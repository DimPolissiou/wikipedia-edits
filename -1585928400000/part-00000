Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. He is a [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]], one of the ''Istari'' order, and the leader of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] and the Army of the West. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', he is initially known as '''Gandalf the Grey''', but returns from death as '''Gandalf the White'''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nTolkien took the name \"Gandalf\" from the \"[[Norse dwarves#Dvergatal: the list of the Dvergar|Catalogue of Dwarves]]\" in the [[Old Norse]] ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''. \n\nTolkien once described Gandalf as an [[angel]] incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Odin]] in his \"Wanderer\" guise. Other scholars have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonist, comparable to the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] who assisted [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[The Aeneid]]'', or to Virgil himself in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Emblema Gandalf.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Cirth|Certh]] [[rune]] no. 19 \"G\", used by Gandalf as a personal [[sign]] or [[seal (emblem)|seal]]]]\n\n===Etymology===\n\nTolkien derived the name ''Gandalf'' from ''[[Gandalf (mythology)|Gand\u00e1lfr]]'', a [[Norse dwarf|dwarf]] in the [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'s ''Dvergatal'', a list of dwarf-names.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D.

This is reflected in his name ''Thark\u00fbn'', which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man' \" in [[Khuzdul]], one of [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's invented languages]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===In-universe names===\n\nGandalf is given several names and nicknames in Tolkien's writings. Gandalf himself says, \"Many are my names in many countries.

For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf ''the Grey'', and Grey[[wikt:hame|hame]]. ''Mithrandir'' is a name in [[Sindarin]] meaning \"the Grey Pilgrim\" or \"the Grey Wanderer\". Midway through ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed [[#Gandalf the White|Gandalf the White]]. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as ''Mithrandir''. At times in ''The Lord of the Rings'', other characters address Gandalf by disparaging nicknames:Stormcrow, ''L\u00e1thspell'' (\"Ill-news\" in [[Old English]]), and \"Grey Fool\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in [[Middle-earth]], one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a [[Magic (Middle-earth)#Magic items|staff]]\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> Yet the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[C\u00edrdan]] who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven [[Three Rings|Ring of Power]] called [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] later in the same essay:<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n{{blockquote|Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of [[Sauron]], opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was called among [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of the North Gandalf 'the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] of the Wand'. For they deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire; and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>}}\n\n==Internal biography==\n\n===Valinor===\n\nIn [[Valinor]], Gandalf was called ''Ol\u00f3rin''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people of the Vala [[Manw\u00eb]]; and was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and [[Nienna]], the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the order of the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizards (Istari)]] across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed [[Sauron]], Ol\u00f3rin was proposed by Manw\u00eb. Ol\u00f3rin initially begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manw\u00eb replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 4, ch. 2, \"The Istari\"</ref>\n\nAs one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Ol\u00f3rin was in service to the Creator ([[Eru Il\u00favatar]]) and the Creator's '[[Secret Fire]]'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their own, and hopefully the kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving them direct commands.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===Middle-earth===\n\nThe Istari arrived in [[Middle-earth]] separately, early in the [[Third Age]]; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but [[C\u00edrdan]] the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire. [[Saruman]], the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other [[ring-bearers]] at the end of the Third Age that he, and not C\u00edrdan, was the holder of the third of the [[Three Rings|Elven-rings]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], but only through counsel; it was forbidden to use force to dominate them\u2014an injunction that Saruman increasingly disregarded.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The White Council====\n\nGandalf suspected early on that the [[Sauron#The Necromancer of Dol Guldur|Necromancer of Dol Guldur]] was not a [[Nazg\u00fbl]] but Sauron himself. He went to [[Dol Guldur]]<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix B.</ref> to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him. The Necromancer returned to Dol Guldur with greater force,<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> and the White Council was formed in response.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> [[Galadriel]] had hoped Gandalf would lead the Council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returned to Dol Guldur \"at great peril\" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron returned. The following year the White Council was summoned, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the [[One Ring]] would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river [[Anduin]] to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But at this time, Saruman himself began actively seeking the Ring near the [[Gladden Fields]] where [[Isildur]] had been killed.<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T/><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The Quest of Erebor====\n\n\"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' elaborates upon the story behind ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and [[Thorin Oakenshield]], a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-king in exile, in the inn of the ''Prancing Pony'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with [[Sauron]], and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If [[Rivendell]] were to be attacked, the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]] could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of [[Erebor]] from Smaug, and so the quest was born.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, 3, \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\"</ref>\n\n===''The Hobbit''===\n\nGandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of ''The Hobbit''. He arranges for a tea party, to which he also invites the thirteen dwarves and thus arranges the traveling group central to the novel's narrative. To the quest, Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 1, \"An Unexpected Party\"</ref> On this quest Gandalf finds his sword, ''[[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Glamdring|Glamdring]]'', in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll's]] treasure hoard.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 2, \"Roast Mutton\"</ref> Elrond informs them this sword was made in [[Gondolin]], a city where Elrond's father lived as a child before its destruction.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 3, \"A Short Rest\"</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from the [[Misty Mountains]] pursued by goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|warg]]s, the party is carried to safety by the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 6, \"Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\"</ref> Gandalf then persuades [[Beorn]] to house and provision the company for the trip through [[Mirkwood]]. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 7, \"Queer Lodgings\"</ref>\n\nHe turns up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of [[Esgaroth]] and the [[Mirkwood Elves]] will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 17, \"The Clouds Burst\"</ref> After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the [[One Ring]] to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 19, \"The Last Stage\"</ref> Then the Council \"put forth its power\" and drives Sauron from [[Dol Guldur]]. Sauron, however, has anticipated this and withdraws as a feint, only to reappear in [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T>''The Fellowship of the Ring'', book 2, ch. 2, \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n\n====Gandalf the Grey====\n\nAs explained in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Gandalf spends the years between ''The Hobbit'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' traveling [[Middle-earth]] in search of information on [[Sauron]]'s resurgence and [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s mysterious [[One Ring|ring]], spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a \"present\" from [[Gollum]]. During this period, he befriends [[Aragorn]] and first becomes suspicious of [[Saruman]]. He spends as much time as he can in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday party, bringing many [[fireworks]] for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the Ring and disappears, Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile and accuses Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for [[Rivendell]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\nOver the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He find some answers in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of [[Minas Tirith]]. He also wants to question Gollum, who had borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, and often has the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeds in finding Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture in [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] to tell what he knows of the ring. This reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring is the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nReturning to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], Gandalf confirms his suspicions by throwing [[One Ring|the Ring]] into [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the Ring, and urges him to take it to [[Rivendell]], for he will be in grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of [[Sauron]] will be searching for him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nOutside the Shire, Gandalf encounters [[Radagast the Brown]], another wizard, who brings the news that the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] have ridden forth out of Mordor\u2014and a request from [[Saruman]] that Gandalf come to [[Isengard]]. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at an inn in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and heads towards Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Eventually Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagle]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGwaihir sets Gandalf down in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], where Gandalf appeals to King [[Th\u00e9oden]] for a horse. Th\u00e9oden, under the evil influence of [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue]], Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, one of the ''mearas'', who will be his mount and companion for much of the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf then rides hard for the Shire, but does not reach it until Frodo has already set out. Knowing that Frodo and his companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with [[Aragorn]]. He faces the Nazg\u00fbl at [[Weathertop]] but escapes after an all-night battle, drawing four of them northward.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/> Frodo, Aragorn and company face the remaining five on Weathertop a few nights later.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 11, \"A Knife in the Dark\"</ref> Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo's arrival.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nIn Rivendell, Gandalf helps [[Elrond]] drive off the Nazg\u00fbl pursuing Frodo<!--eh?--> and plays a great part in the following [[Council of Elrond|council]] as the only person who knows the full history of the Ring. He also reveals that Saruman has betrayed them and is in league with Sauron. When it is decided that the Ring has to be destroyed, Gandalf volunteers to accompany Frodo\u2014now the Ring-bearer\u2014in his quest. He also persuades Elrond to let Frodo's cousins [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] join the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\n{{Quote box|\n |quote  = The Balrog reached the bridge.

After the [[Battle of the Hornburg|ensuing battle]], Gandalf and the king ride to [[Isengard]], which in the interim has itself been attacked and conquered by [[Treebeard]] and the [[Ent]]s, along with Merry and Pippin.

Gandalf then assumes Saruman's place as head of both. Wormtongue makes an indecisive attempt to kill Gandalf or Saruman with the ''[[palant\u00edr]]'' of Orthanc, but misses both. Pippin retrieves the ''palant\u00edr'', but Gandalf quickly appropriates it. After the group leaves Isengard, Pippin takes the palant\u00edr from a sleeping Gandalf, looks into it, and comes face to face with Sauron himself.

The name ''[[Gandalf (Norse mythology)|Gandalf]]'' is found in at least one more place in Norse myth, in the semi-historical [[Heimskringla]], which briefly describes [[Gandalf Alfgeirsson]], a legendary Norse king from eastern Norway and rival of [[Halfdan the Black]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/ |title=Halfdan the Black Saga (Ch. 1.

In English literature, Nelson notes, [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' has the wizard Merlin teaching and directing [[King Arthur|Arthur]] to begin his journeys.

Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. He is a [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]], one of the ''Istari'' order, and the leader of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] and the Army of the West. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', he is initially known as '''Gandalf the Grey''', but returns from death as '''Gandalf the White'''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nTolkien took the name \"Gandalf\" from the \"[[Norse dwarves#Dvergatal: the list of the Dvergar|Catalogue of Dwarves]]\" in the [[Old Norse]] ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''. \n\nTolkien once described Gandalf as an [[angel]] incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Odin]] in his \"Wanderer\" guise. Other scholars have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonist, comparable to the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] who assisted [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[The Aeneid]]'', or to Virgil himself in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Emblema Gandalf.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Cirth|Certh]] [[rune]] no. 19 \"G\", used by Gandalf as a personal [[sign]] or [[seal (emblem)|seal]]]]\n\n===Etymology===\n\nTolkien derived the name ''Gandalf'' from ''[[Gandalf (mythology)|Gand\u00e1lfr]]'', a [[Norse dwarf|dwarf]] in the [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'s ''Dvergatal'', a list of dwarf-names.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D.

This is reflected in his name ''Thark\u00fbn'', which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man' \" in [[Khuzdul]], one of [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's invented languages]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===In-universe names===\n\nGandalf is given several names and nicknames in Tolkien's writings. Gandalf himself says, \"Many are my names in many countries.

For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf ''the Grey'', and Grey[[wikt:hame|hame]]. ''Mithrandir'' is a name in [[Sindarin]] meaning \"the Grey Pilgrim\" or \"the Grey Wanderer\". Midway through ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed [[#Gandalf the White|Gandalf the White]]. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as ''Mithrandir''. At times in ''The Lord of the Rings'', other characters address Gandalf by disparaging nicknames:Stormcrow, ''L\u00e1thspell'' (\"Ill-news\" in [[Old English]]), and \"Grey Fool\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in [[Middle-earth]], one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a [[Magic (Middle-earth)#Magic items|staff]]\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> Yet the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[C\u00edrdan]] who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven [[Three Rings|Ring of Power]] called [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] later in the same essay:<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n{{blockquote|Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of [[Sauron]], opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was called among [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of the North Gandalf 'the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] of the Wand'. For they deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire; and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>}}\n\n==Internal biography==\n\n===Valinor===\n\nIn [[Valinor]], Gandalf was called ''Ol\u00f3rin''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people of the Vala [[Manw\u00eb]]; and was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and [[Nienna]], the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the order of the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizards (Istari)]] across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed [[Sauron]], Ol\u00f3rin was proposed by Manw\u00eb. Ol\u00f3rin initially begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manw\u00eb replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 4, ch. 2, \"The Istari\"</ref>\n\nAs one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Ol\u00f3rin was in service to the Creator ([[Eru Il\u00favatar]]) and the Creator's '[[Secret Fire]]'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their own, and hopefully the kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving them direct commands.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===Middle-earth===\n\nThe Istari arrived in [[Middle-earth]] separately, early in the [[Third Age]]; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but [[C\u00edrdan]] the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire. [[Saruman]], the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other [[ring-bearers]] at the end of the Third Age that he, and not C\u00edrdan, was the holder of the third of the [[Three Rings|Elven-rings]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], but only through counsel; it was forbidden to use force to dominate them\u2014an injunction that Saruman increasingly disregarded.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The White Council====\n\nGandalf suspected early on that the [[Sauron#The Necromancer of Dol Guldur|Necromancer of Dol Guldur]] was not a [[Nazg\u00fbl]] but Sauron himself. He went to [[Dol Guldur]]<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix B.</ref> to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him. The Necromancer returned to Dol Guldur with greater force,<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> and the White Council was formed in response.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> [[Galadriel]] had hoped Gandalf would lead the Council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returned to Dol Guldur \"at great peril\" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron returned. The following year the White Council was summoned, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the [[One Ring]] would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river [[Anduin]] to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But at this time, Saruman himself began actively seeking the Ring near the [[Gladden Fields]] where [[Isildur]] had been killed.<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T/><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The Quest of Erebor====\n\n\"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' elaborates upon the story behind ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and [[Thorin Oakenshield]], a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-king in exile, in the inn of the ''Prancing Pony'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with [[Sauron]], and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If [[Rivendell]] were to be attacked, the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]] could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of [[Erebor]] from Smaug, and so the quest was born.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, 3, \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\"</ref>\n\n===''The Hobbit''===\n\nGandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of ''The Hobbit''. He arranges for a tea party, to which he also invites the thirteen dwarves and thus arranges the traveling group central to the novel's narrative. To the quest, Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 1, \"An Unexpected Party\"</ref> On this quest Gandalf finds his sword, ''[[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Glamdring|Glamdring]]'', in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll's]] treasure hoard.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 2, \"Roast Mutton\"</ref> Elrond informs them this sword was made in [[Gondolin]], a city where Elrond's father lived as a child before its destruction.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 3, \"A Short Rest\"</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from the [[Misty Mountains]] pursued by goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|warg]]s, the party is carried to safety by the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 6, \"Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\"</ref> Gandalf then persuades [[Beorn]] to house and provision the company for the trip through [[Mirkwood]]. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 7, \"Queer Lodgings\"</ref>\n\nHe turns up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of [[Esgaroth]] and the [[Mirkwood Elves]] will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 17, \"The Clouds Burst\"</ref> After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the [[One Ring]] to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 19, \"The Last Stage\"</ref> Then the Council \"put forth its power\" and drives Sauron from [[Dol Guldur]]. Sauron, however, has anticipated this and withdraws as a feint, only to reappear in [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T>''The Fellowship of the Ring'', book 2, ch. 2, \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n\n====Gandalf the Grey====\n\nAs explained in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Gandalf spends the years between ''The Hobbit'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' traveling [[Middle-earth]] in search of information on [[Sauron]]'s resurgence and [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s mysterious [[One Ring|ring]], spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a \"present\" from [[Gollum]]. During this period, he befriends [[Aragorn]] and first becomes suspicious of [[Saruman]]. He spends as much time as he can in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday party, bringing many [[fireworks]] for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the Ring and disappears, Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile and accuses Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for [[Rivendell]].<ref group=T>\"[[The Fellowship of the Ring]] book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\nOver the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He find some answers in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of [[Minas Tirith]]. He also wants to question Gollum, who had borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, and often has the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeds in finding Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture in [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] to tell what he knows of the ring. This reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring is the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nReturning to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], Gandalf confirms his suspicions by throwing [[One Ring|the Ring]] into [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the Ring, and urges him to take it to [[Rivendell]], for he will be in grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of [[Sauron]] will be searching for him.<ref group=T>\"[[The Fellowship of the Ring]] book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nOutside the Shire, Gandalf encounters [[Radagast the Brown]], another wizard, who brings the news that the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] have ridden forth out of Mordor\u2014and a request from [[Saruman]] that Gandalf come to [[Isengard]]. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at an inn in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and heads towards Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Eventually Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagle]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGwaihir sets Gandalf down in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], where Gandalf appeals to King [[Th\u00e9oden]] for a horse. Th\u00e9oden, under the evil influence of [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue]], Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, one of the ''mearas'', who will be his mount and companion for much of the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf then rides hard for the Shire, but does not reach it until Frodo has already set out. Knowing that Frodo and his companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with [[Aragorn]]. He faces the Nazg\u00fbl at [[Weathertop]] but escapes after an all-night battle, drawing four of them northward.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/> Frodo, Aragorn and company face the remaining five on Weathertop a few nights later.<ref group=T>\"[[The Fellowship of the Ring]] book 1, ch. 11, \"A Knife in the Dark\"</ref> Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo's arrival.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nIn Rivendell, Gandalf helps [[Elrond]] drive off the Nazg\u00fbl pursuing Frodo<!--eh?--> and plays a great part in the following [[Council of Elrond|council]] as the only person who knows the full history of the Ring. He also reveals that Saruman has betrayed them and is in league with Sauron. When it is decided that the Ring has to be destroyed, Gandalf volunteers to accompany Frodo\u2014now the Ring-bearer\u2014in his quest.

In a parley before the battle, Gandalf and the other leaders of the West meet the Sauron's chief Lieutenant who shows them Frodo's ''[[mithril]]'' shirt and other items from the Hobbits' equipment. Gandalf rejects Mordor's terms of surrender, and the forces of the West faced the full might of Sauron's armies, until the Ring is destroyed in Mount Doom. Gandalf then leads the Eagles to rescue Frodo and Sam from the erupting mountain.\n\nAfter the war, Gandalf crowns Aragorn as King Elessar, and helps him find a sapling of the [[White Tree of Gondor]]. He accompanies the Hobbits back to the borders of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], before leaving to visit [[Tom Bombadil]].\n\nTwo years later, Gandalf departs [[Middle-earth]] for ever. He boards the Ringbearers' ship in the Grey Havens and sets sail to return across [[Belegaer|the sea]] to the [[Undying Lands]]; with him are his friends Frodo, [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], [[Galadriel]], and [[Elrond]], and his horse Shadowfax.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[Image:Der Berggeist.jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"Der Berggeist\" by [[Josef Madlener]]]]\n\n===Appearance===\n\n[[Humphrey Carpenter]] in his 1977 biography relates that [[J.

He wears a wide-brimmed round hat and a long red cloak, and a white fawn is nuzzling his upturned hands. Carpenter said that Tolkien recalled buying the postcard during his holiday in [[Switzerland]] in 1911. Manfred Zimmerman, however, discovered that the painting was by [[Germans|German]] artist [[Josef Madlener]] and dates to the mid-1920s.

The name ''[[Gandalf (Norse mythology)|Gandalf]]'' is found in at least one more place in Norse myth, in the semi-historical [[Heimskringla]], which briefly describes [[Gandalf Alfgeirsson]], a legendary Norse king from eastern Norway and rival of [[Halfdan the Black]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/ |title=Halfdan the Black Saga (Ch. 1.

In English literature, Nelson notes, [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' has the wizard Merlin teaching and directing [[King Arthur|Arthur]] to begin his journeys.

H. Arnold High School) is an American high school located in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, and is a part of the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]], the 9th largest United States School System. Although located in Germany, the school follows a traditional U.S. curriculum and traditional U.S. school activities.\n\n==History==\n\n==== 1940s ====\nWiesbaden High School was established in 1948 using a former German school building on Lahnstrasse. Prior to its opening, American high school students in Wiesbaden attended high school in [[Frankfurt American High School|Frankfurt]]. The initial school population was 56 students and nine faculty members. In 1949\u201350, the school was named '''General H.H. Arnold High School''' after [[Henry H. Arnold]], [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] and [[General of the Air Force]] during and immediately after [[World War II]]. The [[Berlin Blockade]] (Berlin Airlift) which started in Wiesbaden <ref>http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp</ref> coincided with the opening of the school, with many of the students\u2019 parents involved. \n\n==== 1950s ====\nIn January 1955, the school moved from Lahnstrasse to its present location on Texasstra\u00dfe just outside the Wiesbaden city limits. Students from outlying communities lived in dormitories during the school week. Later, students from [[Rhein Main Air Base]] and the [[Darmstadt]] Military community were bused to the school until the closure of these military facilities. \n\n==== 1960s / 1970s ====\nBy the 1970s the school population was up to 1800 students, recording its peak (1,809) the '72-'73 school year.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dodea.edu/WiesbadenHS/about.cfm|title=About Our School|last=Communications|first=DoDEA|website=www.dodea.edu|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> \n\n==== 1980s / 1990s ====\nAt the end of the 1980s the school's population was over 850 and nearly all students were either Air Force or Army [[Military dependent|dependents]], few others were children of [[United States federal civil service|DoD civilians]] or [[Expatriate|expatriates]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 1989, and subsequent collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Soviet Union]], the [[Cold War]] effectively ended December 25, 1991. The student body began to decline rapidly as U.S. forces drew down their presence in Europe. By 1993, the student population dropped below 500 with the closure of numerous regional installations, including the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital, [[Europaviertel (Wiesbaden)|Lindsey Air Station]], Mainz Army Depot, [[Lee Barracks]], and Camp Pieri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Wikipedia%20Articles/Warriors%20newsletterWinter2018.pdf|title=Warrior Gazzette, December 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden High School / Gen. H. H. Arnold High School  Alumni Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> In 1995, following the closure of the [[Frankfurt American High School]], Frankfurt-area students were bused to Wiesbaden, bringing enrollment to around 430 students.\n\n==== 2000s ====\nImmediately after the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on 9/11]], the school heightened its security, erecting fencing and posting armed US soldiers on its perimeter. The campus has remained behind enhanced [[physical security]] measures ever since. The school's populace increased to 600 students by 2005.<ref name=\":4\" />  In 2006 the school was officially renamed Wiesbaden High School. Despite the change, its historical name of 57 years, Gen. H. H. Arnold High School, is still widely used by tens of thousands of alumni, former faculty and community members. The school's post-[[Cold War]] transformation also resulted in a reversal of key demographics, with Army [[Military dependent|dependents]] becoming the school's majority and Air Force [[Military dependent|dependents]] in the minority. This reality led to a change of the school's [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program, which transitioned from Air Force to Army in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/wiesbadens-jrotc-warrior-battalion-pursues-designation-of-distinction/|title=Wiesbaden\u2019s JROTC Warrior Battalion pursues designation of distinction|date=2017-02-01|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/75663/masters_of_drill_wiesbaden_warrior_drill_team_defends_title_farewells_air_force_competition|title=Masters of drill: Wiesbaden Warrior drill team defends title, farewells Air Force competition|website=www.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Wiesbaden's long-standing Air Force [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program had been one of only four in Germany, and seven in Europe.     \n\n==== 2010s ====\nBy 2010, a multi-phased transformation of the 55-year-old campus had already begun. Demolition began with the iconic space station-like Dependent Youth Activities (DYA) building, who's futuristic profile stood prominently next to the football field.

Arnold High School Crest.png|thumb|The General H. H. Arnold High School crest, an icon of the school's traditions and lore.]]\n'''Protecting the school crest''' is arguably the most unique tradition remembered by school alumni. Although there are variants of the crest's lore, a general take is that no one was allowed to walk on the school crest, and it was the seniors' responsibility to enforce it. This 'rule' was essential because 'the warrior' was buried beneath the crest and if anyone were to walk on it, his spirit would turn over. If that occurred, it was considered bad luck and the probable cause of losing any football game. During some periods of the school's history, it was acceptable for seniors to walk on the crest, a earned privilege.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2005, at the conclusion of First Lady, Laura Bush's, message to 400 assembled 'Warriors,' she remarked, \"And there is one more important bit of advice I forgot to mention, and this is especially important for the lower class men: Whatever you do, don't walk on the Crest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/strong-family-base-at-home-important-for-deployed-troops-first-lady-tells-students-1.29799|title=Strong family base at home important for deployed troops, first lady tells students|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>     \n\nThe crest was embedded into the floor of the main foyer amidst the early phases of school's construction.<ref name=\":2\" /> It comprises a mosaic-tiled blue shield with a black and red outline, featuring the school's symbolic profile of warrior with [[War bonnet|headdress]] and the school's former name (H H Arnold High School). The entire inlay (with border frame) is approximately 4' x 5'. The crest was carefully removed during the 2010-2017 campus transformation. The crest has been prominently displayed in the school's new facilities since 2017.    \n\n'''Graduating in the [[Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Kurhaus]]''' is a special honor for those who earn a diploma from this school.

H. Arnold High School) is an American high school located in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, and is a part of the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]], the 9th largest United States School System. Although located in Germany, the school follows a traditional U.S. curriculum and traditional U.S. school activities.\n\n==History==\n\n==== 1940s ====\nWiesbaden High School was established in 1948 using a former German school building on Lahnstrasse. Prior to its opening, American high school students in Wiesbaden attended high school in [[Frankfurt American High School|Frankfurt]]. The initial school population was 56 students and nine faculty members. In 1949\u201350, the school was named '''General H.H. Arnold High School''' after [[Henry H. Arnold]], [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] and [[General of the Air Force]] during and immediately after [[World War II]]. The [[Berlin Blockade]] (Berlin Airlift) which started in Wiesbaden <ref>http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp</ref> coincided with the opening of the school, with many of the students\u2019 parents involved. \n\n==== 1950s ====\nIn January 1955, the school moved from Lahnstrasse to its present location on Texasstra\u00dfe just outside the Wiesbaden city limits. Students from outlying communities lived in dormitories during the school week. Later, students from [[Rhein Main Air Base]] and the [[Darmstadt]] Military community were bused to the school until the closure of these military facilities. \n\n==== 1960s / 1970s ====\nBy the 1970s the school population was up to 1800 students, recording its peak (1,809) the '72-'73 school year.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dodea.edu/WiesbadenHS/about.cfm|title=About Our School|last=Communications|first=DoDEA|website=www.dodea.edu|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> \n\n==== 1980s / 1990s ====\nAt the end of the 1980s the school's population was over 850 and nearly all students were either Air Force or Army [[Military dependent|dependents]], few others were children of [[United States federal civil service|DoD civilians]] or [[Expatriate|expatriates]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 1989, and subsequent collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Soviet Union]], the [[Cold War]] effectively ended December 25, 1991. The student body began to decline rapidly as U.S. forces drew down their presence in Europe. By 1993, the student population dropped below 500 with the closure of numerous regional installations, including the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital, [[Europaviertel (Wiesbaden)|Lindsey Air Station]], Mainz Army Depot, [[Lee Barracks]], and Camp Pieri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Wikipedia%20Articles/Warriors%20newsletterWinter2018.pdf|title=Warrior Gazzette, December 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden High School / Gen.

The campus has remained behind enhanced [[physical security]] measures ever since. The school's populace increased to 600 students by 2005.<ref name=\":4\" />  In 2006 the school was officially renamed Wiesbaden High School. Despite the change, its historical name of 57 years, Gen. H. H. Arnold High School, is still widely used by tens of thousands of alumni, former faculty and community members. The school's post-[[Cold War]] transformation also resulted in a reversal of key demographics, with Army [[Military dependent|dependents]] becoming the school's majority and Air Force [[Military dependent|dependents]] in the minority. This reality led to a change of the school's [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program, which transitioned from Air Force to Army in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/wiesbadens-jrotc-warrior-battalion-pursues-designation-of-distinction/|title=Wiesbaden\u2019s JROTC Warrior Battalion pursues designation of distinction|date=2017-02-01|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/75663/masters_of_drill_wiesbaden_warrior_drill_team_defends_title_farewells_air_force_competition|title=Masters of drill: Wiesbaden Warrior drill team defends title, farewells Air Force competition|website=www.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Wiesbaden's long-standing Air Force [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program had been one of only four in Germany, and seven in Europe.     \n\n==== 2010s ====\nBy 2010, a multi-phased transformation of the 55-year-old campus had already begun.

Arnold High School Crest.png|thumb|The General H. H. Arnold High School crest, an icon of the school's traditions and lore.]]\n'''Protecting the school crest''' is arguably the most unique tradition remembered by school alumni. Although there are variants of the crest's lore, a general take is that no one was allowed to walk on the school crest, and it was the seniors' responsibility to enforce it. This 'rule' was essential because 'the warrior' was buried beneath the crest and if anyone were to walk on it, his spirit would turn over. If that occurred, it was considered bad luck and the probable cause of losing any football game. During some periods of the school's history, it was acceptable for seniors to walk on the crest, a earned privilege.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2005, at the conclusion of First Lady, Laura Bush's, message to 400 assembled 'Warriors,' she remarked, \"And there is one more important bit of advice I forgot to mention, and this is especially important for the lower class men: Whatever you do, don't walk on the Crest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/strong-family-base-at-home-important-for-deployed-troops-first-lady-tells-students-1.29799|title=Strong family base at home important for deployed troops, first lady tells students|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>     \n\nThe crest was embedded into the floor of the main foyer amidst the early phases of school's construction.<ref name=\":2\" /> It comprises a mosaic-tiled blue shield with a black and red outline, featuring the school's symbolic profile of warrior with [[War bonnet|headdress]] and the school's former name (H H Arnold High School). The entire inlay (with border frame) is approximately 4' x 5'. The crest was carefully removed during the 2010-2017 campus transformation. The crest has been prominently displayed in the school's new facilities since 2017.    \n\n'''Graduating in the [[Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Kurhaus]]''' is a special honor for those who earn a diploma from this school.

Participating in a fierce encounter with a cleverly concealed and well-entrenched enemy force occupying positions on a vital and bitterly contested outpost far in advance of the main line of resistance, HM3 Charette repeatedly and unhesitatingly moved about through a murderous barrage of hostile small-arms and mortar fire to render assistance to his wounded comrades. When an enemy grenade landed within a few feet of a marine he was attending, he immediately threw himself upon the stricken man and absorbed the entire concussion of the deadly missile with his body. Although sustaining painful facial wounds, and undergoing shock from the intensity of the blast which ripped the helmet and medical aid kit from his person, HM3 Charette resourcefully improvised emergency bandages by tearing off part of his clothing, and gallantly continued to administer medical aid to the wounded in his own unit and to those in adjacent platoon areas as well. Observing a seriously wounded comrade whose armored vest had been torn from his body by the blast from an exploding shell, he selflessly removed his own battle vest and placed it upon the helpless man although fully aware of the added jeopardy to himself. Moving to the side of another casualty who was suffering excruciating pain from a serious leg wound, HM3. CHARETTE stood upright in the trench line and exposed himself to a deadly hail of enemy fire in order to lend more effective aid to the victim and to alleviate his anguish while being removed to a position of safety. By his indomitable courage and inspiring efforts in behalf of his wounded comrades, HM3 Charette was directly responsible for saving many lives. His great personal valor reflects the highest credit upon himself and enhances the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.<ref>U.S. Naval Sea Cadets Corps http://charette-battalion.com/about_us {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222160723/http://charette-battalion.com/about_us |date=2015-12-22 }}</ref><ref name=\"citation\"/>\n\n: <center> ''[[Dwight D.

He then attended the Hospital Corps School at [[United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge|Naval Training Center, Bainbridge]], Maryland, becoming a [[United States Navy Hospital Corpsman|Hospital Corpsman]] upon graduation.

He served as an Independent Duty Corpsman (IDC) in the Navy's nuclear submarine program. He served under Captain [[Edward L.

In 1924, the Club changed its name to the Singapore Turf Club.  \n\nThe Club moved to [[Bukit Timah]] in 1933 before relocating to its present location at the Singapore Racecourse at [[Kranji]] in 1999. The racecourse is adjacent to [[Kranji MRT station]].\n\n== Racing ==\n\nRacing is staged all year round on almost every Friday and Sunday. Most of the 100-odd race meetings are restricted to locally trained horses, except for the two International races in May, the [[Singapore Airlines]] International Cup and the [[KrisFlyer]] International Sprint, and certain cross-border races open to Malaysian-based horses.\n\nSince there is no breeding industry in Singapore, all its [[thoroughbred]] bloodstock is imported from overseas, primarily from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], while a minority comes from other countries like [[Japan]], [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[South Africa]], [[United States|America]] and [[Germany]].\n\nHorse owners, made up of both Singaporeans and foreigners, purchase horses and send them to any of the 26 trainers currently licensed at Kranji. Currently, there are 14 expatriates and 12 local trainers.\n\nThe pool of jockeys available consists mainly of locally trained jockeys and apprentices all licensed by the MRA and around 10 expatriate jockeys, whose licences are granted by the Singapore Turf Club over a specific period of time (as short as one-day for short-term licences and from three months to one year for longer-term licences). All licences are subject to renewal depending on performances and conduct.\n\n== Major Races ==\n\n=== Singapore Airlines International Cup and KrisFlyer International Sprint ===\nThe S$3 million Group 1 [[Singapore Airlines International Cup]] (SAIC), was first held in 2000 in conjunction with the opening of the Singapore Racecourse at Kranji. It is held in May, coupled with its sister sprint race, the S$1 million Group 1 [[KrisFlyer International Sprint]] run over 1200 metres.\n\nBoth events are part of the Singapore International Racing Festival (SIRF), which is attended by some of the world's top owners, jockeys and trainers, and are International Group 1 races open to horses from around the world. In 2011, the KrisFlyer became the fourth leg of the [[Global Sprint Challenge]].\n\n=== Singapore Gold Cup ===\n\nThe [[Singapore Gold Cup]] is considered as the most prestigious race on the Singapore racing calendar and is traditionally held at the end of November. Contested on turf, the domestic Group 1 [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap]] race is run over a distance of 2200 metres and is open to horses aged three and older.\n\nThe Singapore Gold Cup is the third leg of the Singapore Triple Crown, after the [[Kranji Mile]] and the Raffles Cup.\n\nFirst run in 1924 at the Serangoon Road Race Course at Farrer Park, the race's first winner was Thelasocrete, winning $1,600 as prize money.\n\nIn history of the handicap race, trainer [[Ivan Allan]] holds the record for the most successes, having saddled up the winner on nine occasions. Jerry Sung, owner of Auric Stables, as an owner, won the Cup five times.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.turfclub.com.sg/EventsandEntertainment/Pages/goldcup2017.aspx#.XQmmoogzaUk | title=Dester Singapore Gold Cup 2017 | accessdate=19 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Abdul Mawi became the first local jockey to win the Gold Cup. In 2008, El Dorado became the first Japanese-bred horse trained in Singapore to win the Gold Cup and he then doubled the feat by landing the race the next year (2009), to become the first horse to do so since Grenadier in 1965 and 1966.\n\nTo mark its move from Bukit Timah to Kranji in 1999, the Singapore Turf Club raised the prize money to $1 million and opened the race to international contenders, but the race returned to domestic status three years later. The prize money for the Group 1 event has since been raised to $1.35 million.\n\nIn 2010-2015, Swiss watchmaker Longines became the official partner and timekeeper of the Singapore Turf Club, and the race was renamed \u201cLongines Singapore Gold Cup\u201d.\n\nIn 2016, the Singapore Gold Cup was renamed to \"Dester Singapore Gold Cup\" with a new sponsor, Lubritrade Distribution. Lubritrade owns the premium beer brand, Dester 100% Malt.\n\n=== Singapore Derby ===\n\nThe Emirates [[Singapore Derby]] is held every mid-July. This race is staged on turf and is contested over 2000 metres. The race is open to four-year-old racehorses only and carries a prize pool of $1 million.\n\nThe race was known as the Singapore Derby until 1995, when Dubai-based [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates Airlines]] embarked with a partnership with Singapore Turf Club.\n\nInaugurated in 1880 at the Serangoon Road Race Course in Farrer Park, it was regularly conducted there until 1910 when it was cancelled. It was not until 1959 that the Singapore Derby was resurrected by the Singapore Turf Club. Since then it has been staged at the Bukit Timah Racecourse until 1999 when the Club relocated the Singapore Racecourse at Kranji.\n\nSince its inception the race has been contested over various distances close to 2400 metres until 1998 when the distance was set at 2000 metres.\n\nTrainer [[Ivan Allan]] has won the Derby nine times, a record which may never be surpassed. The Auric Stable has registered the most wins in the Derby \u2013 five times in 1970, 1975, 1990, 1995 and 1996, while Australian jockey Johnny Wilson holds the record of most wins with three (1963, 1972 and 1975).\n\nNovember Sun, Feu Vert and Courtline Jester are the only horses to have won the Derby twice.\n\nThe Singapore Derby is now the third Leg of the Singapore Four-Year Challenge after the Stewards\u2019 Cup and the Patron's Bowl. Japanese mare Jolie's Shinju is the last horse to have won all three Legs (2009), though the first two Legs were then slated as the Patron's Bowl and the Singapore Derby Trial.\n\n=== Lion City Cup ===\n\nThe Lion City Cup was launched in 1974 and is widely considered Singapore's premier domestic sprint race. It is held in April. The domestic Group 1 race is run over a distance of 1200 metres and is open to horses aged three and older.\n\nWar Plan's Cup win in 1990 was beamed \"live\" to Hong Kong and in turn local racegoers were treated to a telecast of the [[Hong Kong Derby]].\n\nAt its new home at Kranji, Superb Effect scored consecutive wins in 2000 and 2001. It was then the turn of another Charles Leck-trained sprinter Classic Marco who took the honours in 2002. Que Expresion<!-- Que Expresion is a name --> became the first Argentinian-bred horse to win the Cup in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turfclub.com.sg/Racing/RacingCalendarAndFixtures/Pages/FeatureRaceDetails.aspx?RN=Lion+City+Cup+|title=Feature Race Details|website=www.turfclub.com.sg|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nSingapore's sprinter Rocket Man holds the record of most wins. His name was added to the roll of honour four times with wins recorded consecutively from 2009 to 2012.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Raffles Cup ===\nThe [[Raffles Cup]] is the second Leg of the Singapore Triple Crown Challenge and is normally held in October at Kranji. Run on turf over 1800m, the domestic Group 1 race is open to horses aged three years old and older.\n\nNamed after [[Stamford Raffles|Sir Stamford Raffles]], the founder of Singapore, the Raffles Cup was first run in 1991 at the old Bukit Timah Race Course with its distance first pegged at 1600m before it was raised to 1800m in 2001.\n\nThough it has only a relatively short history, many top gallopers have inscribed their names to the Raffles Cup roll of honour. The most notable horses include Ouzo (1999), Smart Bet (2002), Zirna (2003) and most recently Better Than Ever (2010).\n\nTrainer Teh Choon Beng boasts the highest rate of success in the Raffles Cup having won the race four times in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995. Jockeys Kim Clapperton (1993 to 1995) and Saimee Jumaat (1999, 2008 and 2010) are joint leaders with three wins apiece.\n\n== Betting ==\n\nAll wagering on both Singapore and [[simulcast]] races is operated and administered by the Singapore Turf Club on behalf of the Singapore Totalisator Board, using an electronic Pari-Mutuel system. \n\nBets can be placed through the following manners:\n\n* Betting counters at the Singapore Turf Club Racecourse at Kranji on raceways.\n* Betting counters at nine Off Course Betting Centres and four Off Course Betting Outlets\n* Singapore Pools Branches (including LiveWire and SportsBuzz)\n* Self-Betting Kiosks\n* Telebet account holders using TeleTote, MobileTote, Electronic Fund Transfer and AXS, Winners\u2019 Touch System or calling directly via Operator-Assisted Betting.\n\nGoverned by its own set of Rules and Regulations, Singapore Turf Club offers bets such as Win, Place, Roll Win, Forecast, Place Forecast, Tierce, Trio, Quartet and Quadro.\n\nSingapore Turf Club also takes part in [[commingling]]. Commingling of pools is the process where one totalisator organisation combines its wagering pool with another to create one common dividend. In January 2009, the Singapore Totalisator pool combined with [[Tabcorp Holdings|Tabcorp]] Australia's Victorian pool. \n\n== Events and Entertainment ==\n\nThe Open Day \"Fun For All Under The Stars\" invites people under 18 years of age (the age limit for admission to the races) to experience the world of horse racing. Barrier trials are held and no wagering is offered on such nights. \n\nOther regularly held events that fall outside the main business core of horse racing include the [[Singapore Symphony Orchestra]] concerts, Ladies\u2019 Night (including fashion shows) and [[Horseshoes|Horseshoe Pitching]] contest (during the Singapore International Racing Festival in May), among others. The venue also rents for corporate functions and other events.\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nTraining amenities at the  [[Kranji Racecourse]] include a swimming pool, treadmills, horse walkers and a total of seven tracks of both turf, synthetic tracks ([[Polytrack]] and [[Tapeta]]) as well as sand. The latest addition to the tracks was a 1000m long uphill track (Polytrack) completed in February 2010. Taking into account Singapore's wet weather, all tracks utilise an underground drainage network which minimises waterlogging by draining off the rainwater to maintain a safe racing surface at all times.\n\nThe club also operates an equine hospital, the Singapore Turf Club Veterinary Hospital. The hospital was renovated in 2013.\n\n== Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ==\n\nThe Singapore Turf Club is a non-profit organisation and any surplus revenue is donated to charitable organisations..\n\nThe current{{Clarify timeframe|date=June 2019}} adopted charity is Melrose Home and past charities that the Club has adopted include Club Rainbow (Singapore) and Thye Hua Kwan EIPIC Centre @ Woodlands.\n\n== Sponsorships ==\n\nVarious companies act as sponsors to some feature races in Singapore, including Singapore Airlines (Singapore Airlines International Cup and KrisFlyer International Sprint), Longines (Singapore Gold Cup), [[Emirates Airline]] (Singapore Derby), [[Panasonic]] (Kranji Mile) and [[Magic Millions]], Inglis, Aushorse and IRT (Singapore Golden Horseshoe series) and [[Japan Bloodhorse Breeders Association|Japan Bloodhorse Breeders\u2019 Association]] (Moonbeam Vase) among others.\n\n== Riding Centre ==\n\nThe Singapore Turf Club also runs a subsidiary equestrian riding centre, which was opened on 24 June 2010 and was used as the exclusive site for the equestrian event of the [[2010 Youth Olympic Games]]. \n\n==See also==\n*[[Singapore Pools]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.turfclub.com.sg}}\n\n{{Sports governing bodies in Singapore}}\n\n[[Category:Horse racing organizations]]\n[[Category:1842 establishments in the Straits Settlements]]\n[[Category:Horse racing in Singapore|Turf Club]]\n[[Category:Venues of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics]]\n", "text_old": "{{advert|date=January 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2017}}\nThe '''Singapore Turf Club''' was founded in 1842 as the Singapore Sporting Club to operate the [[Serangoon Road Race Course]] at [[Farrer Park Field]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_136_2004-12-30.html|title=It was founded by Scottish merchant|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg}}</ref>.

[[Fremont School District 79]] also serves students from communities from northern part of Wauconda.\n\n==Government==\nWauconda's local government consists of a King, Mayor, Clerk, and six-member Board of Trustees who are elected to four-year overlapping terms of office.  Village Board meetings are held on the first and third Tuesday of the month.  Committee of the Whole meetings are held the second, fourth and sometimes fifth Tuesday of the month.\n\nThe Village Administrator oversees all village departments and serves as a liaison between the village residents and the Board.  The Administrator supervises the daily operations of the village with the assistance of staff, including the Chief of Police and the directors of Public Works, Finance, Human Resources/Risk Management, Information Technology, Environmental Quality, Building and Zoning, and Economic Development.\n\nThere is a library on Main Street, called [[Wauconda Area Library]], which serves the village.\n\n==History==\nAccording to local legend, Wauconda was supposedly named after an indigenous chief whose name translated to \"spirit water\". Many indigenous people had already migrated westwards when the first settlers arrived. Many early settlers of Wauconda came from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] by [[covered wagon]] or through the [[Erie Canal]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\">{{cite web|title=History of Wauconda {{!}} Wauconda, IL|url=https://wauconda-il.gov/217/History-of-Wauconda|website=wauconda-il.gov|accessdate=9 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nElihu Hubbard built the first log cabin on the bank of [[Bangs Lake]] in 1836. Justus Bangs, the first settler in Wauconda, built a house next to the lake in 1848 and the lake was later named after him. In 1840, members of the [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] tribe who did not leave the shores of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]] often went to the area to trade. In 1849, Wauconda was formally organized and the first town meeting was held in April 1850 on the first Tuesday.<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\" />\n\nWauconda's first school was built in 1839 and the area's post office was moved to Wauconda on June 27, 1849, with Hazard Green becoming its first postmaster.<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\" />\n\nElder Joel Wheeler of [[McHenry, Illinois|McHenry]] built the first [[Baptists|Baptist]] church in Wauconda in the autumn of 1838. A [[Methodism|Methodist]] church was organized on September 3, 1852 by Reverend C. French, and built in 1856 on the Commons. Both Methodists and Baptists attended prayer at the church until February 1870, when the Baptists reorganized and built a new church on October 30, 1870. A [[Roman Catholic church]] was built in 1877 and its first trustees were James Murray, Charles Davlin, Felix Givens, Hugh Davlin, and Owen McMahon.

Many early settlers of Wauconda came from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] by [[covered wagon]] or through the [[Erie Canal]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\">{{cite web|title=History of Wauconda {{!}} Wauconda, IL|url=https://wauconda-il.gov/217/History-of-Wauconda|website=wauconda-il.gov|accessdate=9 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nElihu Hubbard built the first log cabin on the bank of [[Bangs Lake]] in 1836. Justus Bangs, the first settler in Wauconda, built a house next to the lake in 1848 and the lake was later named after him. In 1840, members of the [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] tribe who did not leave the shores of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]] often went to the area to trade. In 1849, Wauconda was formally organized and the first town meeting was held in April 1850 on the first Tuesday.<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\" />\n\nWauconda's first school was built in 1839 and the area's post office was moved to Wauconda on June 27, 1849, with Hazard Green becoming its first postmaster.<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\" />\n\nElder Joel Wheeler of [[McHenry, Illinois|McHenry]] built the first [[Baptists|Baptist]] church in Wauconda in the autumn of 1838. A [[Methodism|Methodist]] church was organized on September 3, 1852 by Reverend C. French, and built in 1856 on the Commons. Both Methodists and Baptists attended prayer at the church until February 1870, when the Baptists reorganized and built a new church on October 30, 1870. A [[Roman Catholic church]] was built in 1877 and its first trustees were James Murray, Charles Davlin, Felix Givens, Hugh Davlin, and Owen McMahon.
