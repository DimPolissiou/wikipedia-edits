It has an incubation period of months to years, during which no signs are noticed, though the pathway of converting the normal brain prion protein (PrP) into the toxic, disease-related PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form has started. At present, virtually no way is known to detect PrP<sup>Sc</sup> reliably except by examining ''post mortem'' brain tissue using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form of PrP is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids such as blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, but no methods for use in materials such as blood have been accepted fully.{{by whom|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe traditional method of diagnosis relies on [[histopathological]] examination of the [[medulla oblongata]] of the brain, and other tissues, ''[[post mortem]]''. [[Immunohistochemistry]] can be used to demonstrate prion protein accumulation.<ref name=\"WikiVet\">[http://en.wikivet.net/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy] reviewed and published by [[WikiVet]]. Retrieved 11 October 2011.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10<sup>\u221211</sup>) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called [[Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA)|surround optical fiber immunoassay]] and some specific antibodies against PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an [[antibody]] for specificity and then finally loaded into a microcapillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artifacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals\u2019 brains were analysed once any signs became apparent. The researchers could, therefore, compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited signs of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals\u2019 lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> could be detected in the blood of animals long before the signs appeared.

For instance in the EU, the cattle tested are older (30 months or older), while many cattle are slaughtered younger than that. At the opposite end of the scale, Japan tests all cattle at the time of slaughter. Tests are also difficult, as the altered prion protein has very low levels in blood or urine, and no other signal has been found. Newer tests{{specify|date=July 2016}} are faster, more sensitive, and cheaper, so future figures possibly may be more comprehensive. Even so, currently the only reliable test is examination of tissues during a [[necropsy]].\n\nAs for vCJD in humans, autopsy tests are not always done, so those figures, too, are likely to be too low, but probably by a lesser fraction. In the United Kingdom, anyone with possible vCJD symptoms must be reported to the Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit. In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] has refused to impose a national requirement that physicians and hospitals report cases of the disease. Instead, the agency relies on other methods, including death certificates and urging physicians to send suspicious cases to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, which is funded by the CDC.\n\nTo control potential transmission of vCJD within the United States, the FDA had established strict restrictions on individuals' eligibility to donate blood. Individuals who had spent a cumulative time of 3 months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996, or a cumulative time of 5 years or more from 1980 to 2020 in any combination of countries in Europe, were prohibited from [[Blood donation|donating blood]].<ref>[http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-alphabetical-listing#arc5 Eligibility Criteria for Blood Donation], American Red Cross</ref>\n\nDue to blood shortages associated with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2020 COVID-19 outbreak]], the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] announced that these restrictions were rescinded effective immediately.

Historically, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and meat scraps have almost always commanded a higher price as a feed additive than oilseed meals in the U.S., so not much incentive existed to use animal products to feed ruminants. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, as it was in Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibited the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to [[ruminant]]s such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock, including pigs and [[poultry]].

It has an incubation period of months to years, during which no signs are noticed, though the pathway of converting the normal brain prion protein (PrP) into the toxic, disease-related PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form has started. At present, virtually no way is known to detect PrP<sup>Sc</sup> reliably except by examining ''post mortem'' brain tissue using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form of PrP is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids such as blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, but no methods for use in materials such as blood have been accepted fully.{{by whom|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe traditional method of diagnosis relies on [[histopathological]] examination of the [[medulla oblongata]] of the brain, and other tissues, ''[[post mortem]]''. [[Immunohistochemistry]] can be used to demonstrate prion protein accumulation.<ref name=\"WikiVet\">[http://en.wikivet.net/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy] reviewed and published by [[WikiVet]]. Retrieved 11 October 2011.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10<sup>\u221211</sup>) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called [[Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA)|surround optical fiber immunoassay]] and some specific antibodies against PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an [[antibody]] for specificity and then finally loaded into a microcapillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artifacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals\u2019 brains were analysed once any signs became apparent. The researchers could, therefore, compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited signs of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals\u2019 lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> could be detected in the blood of animals long before the signs appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of great value in surveillance as a blood- or urine-based screening test for BSE.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Detecting Prions in Blood |journal=Microbiology Today. |pages=195 |date=August 2010 |url= https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf | title = SOFIA: An Assay Platform for Ultrasensitive Detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in Brain and Blood | publisher = SUNY Downstate Medical Center | authorlink = Rubenstein, R., et al. | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Classification===\nBSE is a transmissible disease that primarily affects the [[central nervous system]]; it is a form of [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]], like [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]] and [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] in humans and [[scrapie]] in sheep, and [[chronic wasting disease]] in [[cervids|deer]].<ref name=Budka2015rev>{{cite journal|last1=Budka|first1=H|last2=Will|first2=RG|title=The end of the BSE saga: do we still need surveillance for human prion diseases?|journal=Swiss Medical Weekly|date=12 November 2015 |volume=145 |pages=w1421 2|doi=10.4414/smw.2015.14212 |pmid=26715203 |url=https://smw.ch/index.php?id=75&tx_ezmjournal_articledetail[identifier]=smw.2015.14212}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Era\u00f1a|first1=H|last2=Venegas|first2=V|last3=Moreno|first3=J|last4=Castilla|first4=J|title=Prion-like disorders and Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies: An overview of the mechanistic features that are shared by the various disease-related misfolded proteins.|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date=19 February 2017|volume=483|issue=4|pages=1125\u201336|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.08.166|pmid=27590581|url=https://zenodo.org/record/897700}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waddell|first1=L|last2=Greig|first2=J|last3=Mascarenhas|first3=M|last4=Otten|first4=A|last5=Corrin|first5=T|last6=Hierlihy|first6=K|title=Current evidence on the transmissibility of chronic wasting disease prions to humans \u2013 A systematic review|journal=Transboundary and Emerging Diseases|volume=65|issue=1|pages=37\u201349|date=30 January 2017|doi=10.1111/tbed.12612|pmid=28139079}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nA ban on feeding meat and bone meal to cattle has resulted in a strong reduction in cases in countries where the disease has been present.

For instance in the EU, the cattle tested are older (30 months or older), while many cattle are slaughtered younger than that. At the opposite end of the scale, Japan tests all cattle at the time of slaughter. Tests are also difficult, as the altered prion protein has very low levels in blood or urine, and no other signal has been found. Newer tests{{specify|date=July 2016}} are faster, more sensitive, and cheaper, so future figures possibly may be more comprehensive. Even so, currently the only reliable test is examination of tissues during a [[necropsy]].\n\nAs for vCJD in humans, autopsy tests are not always done, so those figures, too, are likely to be too low, but probably by a lesser fraction. In the United Kingdom, anyone with possible vCJD symptoms must be reported to the Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit. In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] has refused to impose a national requirement that physicians and hospitals report cases of the disease. Instead, the agency relies on other methods, including death certificates and urging physicians to send suspicious cases to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, which is funded by the CDC.\n\nTo control potential transmission of vCJD within the United States, the FDA had established strict restrictions on individuals' eligibility to donate blood. Individuals who had spent a cumulative time of 3 months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996, or a cumulative time of 5 years or more from 1980 to 2020 in any combination of countries in Europe, were prohibited from [[Blood donation|donating blood]].<ref>[http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-alphabetical-listing#arc5 Eligibility Criteria for Blood Donation], American Red Cross</ref>\n\nDue to blood shortages associated with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2020 COVID-19 outbreak]], the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] announced that these restrictions were rescinded effective immediately.

As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, as it was in Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibited the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to [[ruminant]]s such as cattle and goats.

Three cases of vCJD occurred in people who had lived in or visited the UK \u2013 one each in the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States of America]]. Also, some concern existed about those who work with (and therefore inhale) cattle [[meat and bone meal]], such as [[horticulture|horticulturists]], who use it as fertilizer. Up-to-date statistics on all types of CJD are published by the National Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit <!-- (NCJDSU) --> in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].\n\nFor many of the vCJD patients, direct evidence exists that they had consumed tainted [[beef]], and this is assumed to be the mechanism by which all affected individuals contracted it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Disease incidence also appears to correlate with slaughtering practices that led to the mixture of [[nervous system]] tissue with [[ground meat]] (mince) and other beef. An estimated 400,000 cattle infected with BSE entered the human food chain in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Although the BSE epizootic was eventually brought under control by [[culling]] all suspect cattle populations, people are still being diagnosed with vCJD each year (though the number of new cases currently has dropped to fewer than five per year). This is attributed to the long incubation period for prion diseases, which is typically measured in years or decades. As a result, the full extent of the human vCJD outbreak is still not known.\n\nThe scientific consensus is that infectious BSE prion material is not destroyed through cooking procedures, meaning that even contaminated beef foodstuffs prepared \"well done\" may remain infectious.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mad cow disease: Still a concern |url=http://premium.edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/ID/00012.html |work=MayoClinic.com |publisher=CNN |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=20 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425012159/http://premium.edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/ID/00012.html |archivedate=25 April 2005 }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy \u2013 \"Mad Cow Disease\" | url = http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy_Mad_Cow_Disease/index.asp | accessdate = 8 April 2008 | date = March 2005 | work = Fact Sheets | publisher = [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413003024/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/fact_sheets/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy_Mad_Cow_Disease/index.asp | archive-date = 13 April 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\nIn fact the infectious agent remains viable over {{cvt|600|C|F}}.\n\nAlan Colchester, a professor of neurology at the [[University of Kent]], and Nancy Colchester, writing in the 3 September 2005 issue of the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', proposed a theory that the most likely initial origin of BSE in the United Kingdom was the importation from the Indian Subcontinent of bone meal which contained CJD-infected human remains.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Colchester AC, Colchester NT | title = The origin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy: the human prion disease hypothesis| journal = Lancet| volume = 366| issue = 9488| pages = 856\u201361| year = 2005| pmid = 16139661| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67218-2}}</ref> The government of India vehemently responded to the research, calling it \"misleading, highly mischievous; a figment of imagination; absurd,\" further adding that India maintained constant surveillance and had not had a single case of either BSE or vCJD.<ref>{{cite news | title = India dismisses Lancet's mad cow | first1 = Chandrika | last1 = Mago | first2 = Kounteya | last2 = Sinha | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1218869.cms |work=The Times of India | date = 2 September 2005 | accessdate = 20 June 2009 }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = New theory traces mad cow disease to animal feed exported from India | first = Geoff | last = Thompson | url = http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2005/s1453543.htm | work = The World Today | publisher = ABC | date = 5 September 2005 | accessdate = 20 June 2009 }}\n</ref> The authors responded in the 22 January 2006 issue of ''The Lancet'' that their theory is unprovable only in the same sense as all other BSE origin theories are and that the theory warrants further investigation.<ref>{{cite journal| last1       = Colchester| first1      = A| last2       = Colchester| first2      = N|date=28 January 2006| title       = Origin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy \u2013 Authors' reply| journal     = The Lancet| volume      = 367| issue       = 9507| pages       = 298\u201399| doi         = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68062-8}}\n</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the investigation into the BSE epizootic, an enquiry was also made into the activities of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] [[Medicines Control Agency]] (MCA).

James Walsh, the owner of Darwen FC and the associated mill decides to secretly pay two Scottish players, [[Fergus Suter|Fergus \"Fergie\" Suter]] and James \"Jimmy\" Love to join his team in a bid to secure the FA Cup (which at the time is exclusively for amateurs). At halftime the Old Etonians lead 5-1, however Darwen recovers with a progressive adjustment (spreading out their formation and focusing on passing) to draw 5 all.

The numbers in the right column are the [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]] numbers {{OEIS|A034968}}, which have the same [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]] as the permutation.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], when ''X'' is a [[finite set]] with at least two elements, the [[permutation]]s of ''X'' (i.e. the [[bijective function]]s from ''X'' to ''X'') fall into two classes of equal size: the '''even permutations''' and the '''odd permutations'''. If any [[total ordering]] of ''X'' is fixed, the '''parity''' ('''oddness''' or '''evenness''') of a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> of ''X'' can be defined as the parity of the number of [[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversions]] for&nbsp;''\u03c3'', i.e., of pairs of elements ''x'',\u2009''y'' of ''X'' such that {{nowrap|''x'' < ''y''}} and {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(''x'') > ''\u03c3''(''y'')}}.\n\nThe '''sign''', '''signature''', or '''signum''' of a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' is denoted sgn(''\u03c3'') and defined as +1 if ''\u03c3'' is even and &minus;1 if ''\u03c3'' is odd. The signature defines the '''alternating [[character (mathematics)|character]]''' of the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub>. Another notation for the sign of a permutation is given by the more general [[Levi-Civita symbol]] (''\u03b5''<sub>''\u03c3''</sub>), which is defined for all maps from ''X'' to ''X'', and has value zero for [[bijection | non-bijective maps]].\n\nThe sign of a permutation can be explicitly expressed as\n:{{math|1=sgn(''\u03c3'') = (\u22121)<sup>''N''(''\u03c3'')</sup>}}<!-- do not use <math> here.  see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594#c4 -->\nwhere ''N''(''\u03c3'') is the number of [[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]]s in&nbsp;''\u03c3''.\n\nAlternatively, the sign of a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' can be defined from its decomposition into the product of [[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]] as\n:{{math|1=sgn(''\u03c3'') = (\u22121)<sup>''m''</sup>}}<!-- do not use <math> here.  see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594#c4 -->\nwhere ''m'' is the number of transpositions in the decomposition. Although such a decomposition is not unique, the parity of the number of transpositions in all decompositions is the same, implying that the sign of a permutation is [[well-defined]].<ref name=\"Jacobson\">Jacobson (2009), p. 50.</ref>\n\n== Example ==\nConsider the permutation ''\u03c3'' of the set {{mset|1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094,\u20095}} which turns the initial arrangement 12345 into 34521.\nIt can be obtained by three transpositions: first exchange the numbers 2 and 4, then exchange 1 and 3, and finally exchange 1 and 5. This shows that the given permutation ''\u03c3'' is odd. Following the method of the [[Permutation#Cycle_notation|cycle notation]] article, this could be written as\n: <math>\\sigma=\\begin{pmatrix}1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n3&4&5&2&1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1&3&5\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}2&4\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1&5\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1&3\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}2&4\\end{pmatrix} .</math>\nThere are many other ways of writing ''\u03c3'' as a [[functional composition|composition]] of transpositions, for instance\n:{{math|1=''\u03c3'' = (2 3)(1 2)(2 4)(3 5)(4 5)}},\nbut it is impossible to write it as a product of an odd number of transpositions.\n\n== Properties ==\nThe identity permutation is an even permutation.<ref name=\"Jacobson\" /> An even permutation can be obtained as the composition of an [[even and odd numbers|even number]] and only an even number of exchanges (called [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]]s) of two elements, while an odd permutation can be obtained by (only) an odd number of transpositions.\n\nThe following rules follow directly from the corresponding rules about addition of integers:<ref name=\"Jacobson\" />\n* the composition of two even permutations is even\n* the composition of two odd permutations is even\n* the composition of an odd and an even permutation is odd\nFrom these it follows that\n* the inverse of every even permutation is even\n* the inverse of every odd permutation is odd\n\nConsidering the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub> of all permutations of the set {1, ..., ''n''}, we can conclude that the map\n:{{math|1=sgn: S<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 {\u22121, 1}\u2009}}<!-- do not use <math> here.  see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594#c4 -->\nthat assigns to every permutation its signature is a [[group homomorphism]].<ref>Rotman (1995), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=lYrsiaHSHKcC|page=9|text=sgn}} p. 9, Theorem 1.6.]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, we see that the even permutations form a [[subgroup]] of S<sub>''n''</sub>.<ref name=\"Jacobson\" /> This is the [[alternating group]] on ''n'' letters, denoted by A<sub>''n''</sub>.<ref name=\"Jacobson_a\">Jacobson (2009), p. 51.</ref> It is the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the homomorphism sgn.<ref>Goodman, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=l1TKk4InOQ4C|page=116|text=kernel of the sign homomorphism}} p. 116, definition 2.4.21]</ref> The odd permutations cannot form a subgroup, since the composite of two odd permutations is even, but they form a [[coset]] of A<sub>''n''</sub> (in S<sub>''n''</sub>).<ref>Meijer & Bauer (2004), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=ZakN8Y7dcC8C|page=72|text=these permutations do not form a subgroup since the product of two odd permutations is even}} p. 72]</ref>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''n'' > 1}}, then there are just as many even permutations in S<sub>''n''</sub> as there are odd ones;<ref name=\"Jacobson_a\" /> consequently, A<sub>''n''</sub> contains [[factorial|''n''!]]/2 permutations. (The reason is that if ''\u03c3'' is even then {{nowrap|(1 \u200a2)''\u03c3''}} is odd, and if ''\u03c3'' is odd then {{nowrap|(1 \u200a2)''\u03c3''}} is even, and these two maps are inverse to each other.)<ref name=\"Jacobson_a\" />\n\nA [[cyclic permutation|cycle]] is even if and only if its length is odd. This follows from formulas like\n:<math>(a\\ b\\ c\\ d\\ e)=(d\\ e)(c\\ e)(b\\ e)(a\\ e)\\text{ or }(a\\ b)(b\\ c)(c\\ d)(d\\ e).</math>\nIn practice, in order to determine whether a given permutation is even or odd, one writes the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles. The permutation is odd if and only if this factorization contains an odd number of even-length cycles.\n\nAnother method for determining whether a given permutation is even or odd is to construct the corresponding [[permutation matrix]] and compute its determinant. The value of the determinant is the same as the parity of the permutation.\n\nEvery permutation of odd [[order (group theory)|order]] must be even.  The permutation {{nowrap|(1 2)(3 4)}} in A<sub>4</sub> shows that the converse is not true in general.\n\n== Equivalence of the two definitions ==\n\n=== Proof 1 ===\n\nEvery permutation can be produced by a sequence of [[Transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]] (2-element exchanges): with the first transposition we put the first element of the permutation in its proper place, the second transposition puts the second element right etc. Since we cannot be left with just a single element in an incorrect position, we must achieve the permutation with our last transposition. Given a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'', we can write it as a product of transpositions in many different ways. We want to show that either all of those decompositions have an even number of transpositions, or all have an odd number.\n\nSuppose we have two such decompositions:  \n:''&sigma;'' = ''T''<sub>1</sub> ''T''<sub>2</sub> ... ''T''<sub>''k''</sub>\n:''&sigma;'' = ''Q''<sub>1</sub> ''Q''<sub>2</sub> ... ''Q''<sub>''m''</sub>.\nWe want to show that ''k'' and ''m'' are either both even, or both odd.\n\nEvery transposition can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions of adjacent elements, e.g.\n:(2\u200a5) = (2\u200a3)\u2009(3\u200a4)\u2009(4\u200a5)\u2009(4\u200a3)\u2009(3\u200a2).\n\nTo see this, note that if we have the transposition (''i''&nbsp;''j'') on an ''n''-element set {1,...,''i'',...,''j'',...,''n''}, one way to decompose it is as [(''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;j)(''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)&nbsp;...&nbsp;(''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2)][(''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;''i'')(''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;...&nbsp;(''j''&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)]. The right block of transpositions first frees up the ''j'' space by moving ''j'' over to the ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 space; then, ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 goes into the ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 space with ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 in the ''j'' space, ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 goes into the ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3 space with ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3 in the ''j'' space, etc., until ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 ends up in the ''i'' space and ''i'' in the ''j'' space. Thus, each element from ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 to ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 is in a space one to the left from where it ought to be. In the left block, each of those elements is restored one at a time to its original space, after resting in the ''i'' space for the duration of one permutation. ''j'' ends up in the ''i'' space, and ''i'' in the ''j'' space, with nothing else altered, as desired. The number of transpositions is (''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''i'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;(j&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), which is odd.\n\nIf we decompose in this way each of the transpositions ''T''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;''T''<sub>''k''</sub> and ''Q''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;''Q''<sub>''m''</sub> above\ninto an odd number of adjacent transpositions, we get the new decompositions:\n:''&sigma;'' = ''T''*<sub>1</sub> ''T''*<sub>2</sub> ... ''T''*<sub>''k''\u2032</sub>\n:''&sigma;'' = ''Q''*<sub>1</sub> ''Q''*<sub>2</sub> ... ''Q''*<sub>''m''\u2032</sub>\nwhere all of the ''T*''<sub>1</sub>...''T*<sub>k\u2032</sub>'' ''Q*''<sub>1</sub>...''Q*<sub>m\u2032</sub>'' are adjacent, {{nowrap|''k'' &minus; ''k''\u2032}} is even, and {{nowrap|''m'' &minus; ''m''\u2032}} is even.\n\nNow compose the inverse of T*<sub>k\u2032</sub> (which happens to be the same permutation) with ''\u03c3''. ''T*''<sub>k\u2032</sub> is the transposition (''i'',\u2009''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) of two adjacent numbers, so, compared to ''\u03c3'', the new permutation {{nowrap|''\u03c3\u2009''(''i'', ''i'' + 1)}} will have exactly one inversion pair less (in case {{nowrap|(''i'', ''i'' + 1)}} was an inversion pair for ''\u03c3'') or more (in case (''i'',\u2009''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) was not an inversion pair). Then apply the inverses of ''T*''<sub>''k''\u2032\u22121</sub>, ''T*''<sub>''k''&prime;\u22122</sub>, ..., ''T''*<sub>1</sub> in the same way, \"unraveling\" the permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3''. At the end we get the identity permutation, whose number of inversions is zero. This means that the original number of inversions ''N''(''\u03c3'') less ''k''' is even and also ''N''(''\u03c3'') less ''k'' is even (addition modulo two is independent of sign).\n\nWe can do the same thing with the other decomposition, ''Q''*<sub>''m''&prime;</sub>...''Q''*<sub>1</sub>, and it will turn out that the original ''N''(''\u03c3'') less ''m'' is even. Therefore, {{nowrap|''m'' &minus; ''k''}} is even, as we wanted to show.\n\nWe can thus define the parity of ''\u03c3'' to be that of its number of constituent transpositions, because we see that this can have only one value. And this must agree with the parity of the number of inversions under any ordering, as seen above, so the definitions are indeed well-defined and equivalent.\n\n=== Proof 2 ===\n\nAn alternative proof uses the [[polynomial]]\n\n:<math>P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\prod_{i<j} (x_i - x_j).</math>\n\nSo for instance in the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}, we have\n\n:<math>P(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_3)(x_1 - x_3).</math>\n\nNow for a given permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' of the numbers {1,\u2009...,\u2009''n''}, we define\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)=\\frac{P(x_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\sigma(n)})}{P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)}.</math>\n\nSince the polynomial <math>P(x_{\\sigma(1)},\\dots,x_{\\sigma(n)})</math> has the same factors as <math>P(x_1,\\dots,x_n)</math> except for their signs, if follows that sgn(''\u03c3'') is either +1 or &minus;1. Furthermore, if ''\u03c3'' and ''\u03c4'' are two permutations, we see that\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\tau) & = \\frac{P(x_{\\sigma(\\tau(1))},\\ldots,x_{\\sigma(\\tau(n))})}{P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\frac{P(x_{\\tau(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\tau(n)})}{P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)} \\cdot \\frac{P(x_{\\sigma(\\tau(1))},\\ldots, x_{\\sigma(\\tau(n))})}{P(x_{\\tau(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\tau(n)})} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\\cdot\\operatorname{sgn}(\\tau).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSince with this definition it is furthermore clear that any transposition of two elements has signature &minus;1, we do indeed recover the signature as defined earlier.\n\n=== Proof 3 ===\n\nA third approach uses the [[presentation of a group|presentation]] of the group S<sub>''n''</sub> in terms of generators ''\u03c4''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''\u03c4''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub> and relations\n* <math>\\tau_i^2 = 1</math>&nbsp; for all ''i''\n* <math>\\tau_i^{}\\tau_{i+1}\\tau_i = \\tau_{i+1}\\tau_i\\tau_{i+1}</math> &nbsp; for all ''i'' < ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1\n* <math>\\tau_i^{}\\tau_j = \\tau_j\\tau_i</math> &nbsp; if |''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''j''| \u2265 2.\n[Here the generator <math>\\tau_i</math> represents the transposition {{nowrap|(''i'', ''i'' + 1)}}.] All relations keep the length of a word the same or change it by two. Starting with an even-length word will thus always result in an even-length word after using the relations, and similarly for odd-length words. It is therefore unambiguous to call the elements of S<sub>''n''</sub> represented by even-length words \"even\", and the elements represented by odd-length words \"odd\".\n\n=== Proof 4 ===\n\nRecall that a pair ''x'', ''y'' such that {{nowrap|''x'' < ''y''}} and {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(''x'') > ''\u03c3''(''y'')}} is called an inversion. We want to show that the count of inversions has the same parity as the count of 2-element swaps. To do that, we can show that every swap changes the parity of the count of inversions, no matter which two elements are being swapped and what permutation has already been applied. \nSuppose we want to swap the ''i''th and the ''j''th element. Clearly, inversions formed by ''i'' or ''j'' with an element outside of {{nowrap|[''i'', ''j'']}} will not be affected. \nFor the {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''j'' &minus; ''i'' &minus; 1}} elements within the interval {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')}}, assume ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> of them form inversions with ''i'' and ''v''<sub>''j''</sub> of them form inversions with ''j''. If ''i'' and ''j'' are swapped, those ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> inversions with ''i'' are gone, but {{nowrap|''n'' &minus; ''v''<sub>''i''</sub>}} inversions are formed. The count of inversions ''i'' gained is thus {{nowrap|''n'' &minus; 2''v''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, which has the same parity as ''n''.\n \nSimilarly, the count of inversions ''j'' gained also has the same parity as ''n''. Therefore, the count of inversions gained by both combined has the same parity as 2''n'' or 0. Now if we count the inversions gained (or lost) by swapping the ''i''th and the ''j''th element, we can see that this swap changes the parity of the count of inversions, since we also add (or subtract) 1 to the number of inversions gained (or lost) for the pair ''(i,j)''.\nNote that initially when no swap is applied, the count of inversions is 0. Now we obtain equivalence of the two definitions of parity of a permutation.\n\n== Other definitions and proofs ==\nThe parity of a permutation of <math>n</math> points is also encoded in its [[cyclic permutation|cycle structure]].\n\nLet ''\u03c3'' = (''i''<sub>1</sub> ''i''<sub>2</sub> ... ''i''<sub>''r''+1</sub>)(''j''<sub>1</sub> ''j''<sub>2</sub> ... ''j''<sub>''s''+1</sub>)...(''\u2113''<sub>1</sub> ''\u2113''<sub>2</sub> ... ''\u2113''<sub>''u''+1</sub>) be the unique [[cycle notation|decomposition of ''\u03c3'' into disjoint cycles]], which can be composed in any order because they commute. A cycle {{nowrap|(''a'' ''b'' ''c'' ... ''x'' ''y'' ''z'')}} involving {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}} points can always be obtained by composing ''k'' transpositions (2-cycles):\n\n:<math>(a\\ b\\ c \\dots x\\ y\\ z)=(a\\ b)(b\\ c) \\dots (x\\ y)(y\\ z),</math>\n\nso call ''k'' the ''size'' of the cycle, and observe that, under this definition, transpositions are cycles of size 1. From a decomposition into ''m'' disjoint cycles we can obtain a decomposition of ''\u03c3'' into {{nowrap|''k''<sub>1</sub> + ''k''<sub>2</sub> + ... + ''k''<sub>''m''</sub>}} transpositions, where ''k''<sub>''i''</sub> is the size of the ''i''th cycle. The number {{nowrap|1=''N''(''\u03c3'') = ''k''<sub>1</sub> + ''k''<sub>2</sub> + ... + ''k''<sub>''m''</sub>}} is called the discriminant of ''\u03c3'', and can also be computed as\n\n:<math>n \\text{ minus the number of disjoint cycles in the decomposition of } \\sigma</math>\n\nif we take care to include the fixed points of ''\u03c3'' as 1-cycles.\n\nSuppose a transposition (''a'' ''b'') is applied after a permutation ''\u03c3''. When ''a'' and ''b'' are in different cycles of ''\u03c3'' then\n:<math>(a\\ b)(a\\ c_1\\ c_2 \\dots c_r)(b\\ d_1\\ d_2 \\dots d_s) = (a\\ c_1\\ c_2 \\dots c_r\\ b\\ d_1\\ d_2 \\dots d_s)</math>,\n\nand if ''a'' and ''b'' are in the same cycle of ''\u03c3'' then\n\n:<math>(a\\ b)(a c_1 c_2 \\dots c_r\\ b\\ d_1\\ d_2 \\dots d_s) = (a\\ c_1\\ c_2 \\dots c_r)(b\\ d_1\\ d_2 \\dots d_s)</math>.\n\nIn either case, it can be seen that {{nowrap|1=''N''((''a'' ''b'')''\u03c3'') = ''N''(''\u03c3'') \u00b1 1}}, so the parity of ''N''((''a'' ''b'')''\u03c3'') will be different from the parity of ''N''(''\u03c3'').\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3'' = ''t''<sub>1</sub>''t''<sub>2</sub> ... ''t''<sub>''r''</sub>}} is an arbitrary decomposition of a permutation ''\u03c3'' into transpositions, by applying the ''r'' transpositions <math>t_1</math> after ''t''<sub>2</sub> after ... after ''t''<sub>''r''</sub> after the identity (whose ''N'' is zero) observe that ''N''(''\u03c3'') and ''r'' have the same parity. By defining the parity of ''\u03c3'' as the parity of ''N''(''\u03c3''), a permutation that has an even length decomposition is an even permutation and a permutation that has one odd length decomposition is an odd permutation.\n\nRemarks:\n* A careful examination of the above argument shows that {{nowrap|''r'' \u2265 ''N''(''\u03c3'')}}, and since any decomposition of ''\u03c3'' into cycles whose sizes sum to ''r'' can be expressed as a composition of ''r'' transpositions, the number ''N''(''\u03c3'') is the minimum possible sum of the sizes of the cycles in a decomposition of ''\u03c3'', including the cases in which all cycles are transpositions.\n* This proof does not introduce a (possibly arbitrary) order into the set of points on which ''\u03c3'' acts.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nParity can be generalized to [[Coxeter group]]s: one defines a [[length function]] \u2113(''v''), which depends on a choice of generators (for the symmetric group, [[adjacent transposition]]s), and then the function {{nowrap|''v'' \u21a6 (&minus;1)<sup>\u2113(''v'')</sup>}} gives a generalized sign map.\n\n== See also ==\n* The [[fifteen puzzle]] is a classic application, though it actually involves a [[groupoid]].\n* [[Zolotarev's lemma]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{MathWorld|urlname=EvenPermutation|title=Even Permutation}}\n* {{Cite book| last=Jacobson| first=Nathan| author-link=Nathan Jacobson| year=2009| title=Basic algebra| edition=2nd| volume = 1 | series= | publisher=Dover| isbn = 978-0-486-47189-1}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Rotman |first1=J.J. |authorlink1= |title=An introduction to the theory of groups |url= |edition= |series=Graduate texts in mathematics |volume= |year=1995 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location= |isbn=978-0-387-94285-8  }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Frederick M. |authorlink1= |title=Algebra: Abstract and Concrete |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-9799142-0-1  }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Meijer |first1=Paul Herman Ernst |authorlink1= |last2=Bauer |first2=Edmond |authorlink2= |title=Group theory: the application to quantum mechanics |url= |edition= |series=Dover classics of science and mathematics |volume= |year=2004 |publisher=Dover Publications |location= |isbn=978-0-486-43798-9  }}\n\n[[Category:Group theory]]\n[[Category:Permutations]]\n[[Category:Parity (mathematics)]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n\n[[ru:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430#\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Symmetric group 4; permutation list.svg|thumb|[[File:Loupe light.svg|15px|link=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg/1000px-Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg.png]] Permutations of 4 elements<br><br>Odd permutations have a green or orange background.

Following the method of the [[Permutation#Cycle_notation|cycle notation]] article, this could be written as\n: <math>\\sigma=\\begin{pmatrix}1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n3&4&5&2&1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1&3&5\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}2&4\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1&5\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1&3\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}2&4\\end{pmatrix} .</math>\nThere are many other ways of writing ''\u03c3'' as a [[functional composition|composition]] of transpositions, for instance\n:{{math|1=''\u03c3'' = (2 3)(1 2)(2 4)(3 5)(4 5)}},\nbut it is impossible to write it as a product of an even number of transpositions.\n\n== Properties ==\nThe identity permutation is an even permutation.<ref name=\"Jacobson\" /> An even permutation can be obtained as the composition of an [[even and odd numbers|even number]] and only an even number of exchanges (called [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]]s) of two elements, while an odd permutation can be obtained by (only) an odd number of transpositions.\n\nThe following rules follow directly from the corresponding rules about addition of integers:<ref name=\"Jacobson\" />\n* the composition of two even permutations is even\n* the composition of two odd permutations is even\n* the composition of an odd and an even permutation is odd\nFrom these it follows that\n* the inverse of every even permutation is even\n* the inverse of every odd permutation is odd\n\nConsidering the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub> of all permutations of the set {1, ..., ''n''}, we can conclude that the map\n:{{math|1=sgn: S<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 {\u22121, 1}\u2009}}<!-- do not use <math> here.  see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594#c4 -->\nthat assigns to every permutation its signature is a [[group homomorphism]].<ref>Rotman (1995), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=lYrsiaHSHKcC|page=9|text=sgn}} p. 9, Theorem 1.6.]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, we see that the even permutations form a [[subgroup]] of S<sub>''n''</sub>.<ref name=\"Jacobson\" /> This is the [[alternating group]] on ''n'' letters, denoted by A<sub>''n''</sub>.<ref name=\"Jacobson_a\">Jacobson (2009), p. 51.</ref> It is the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the homomorphism sgn.<ref>Goodman, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=l1TKk4InOQ4C|page=116|text=kernel of the sign homomorphism}} p. 116, definition 2.4.21]</ref> The odd permutations cannot form a subgroup, since the composite of two odd permutations is even, but they form a [[coset]] of A<sub>''n''</sub> (in S<sub>''n''</sub>).<ref>Meijer & Bauer (2004), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=ZakN8Y7dcC8C|page=72|text=these permutations do not form a subgroup since the product of two odd permutations is even}} p. 72]</ref>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''n'' > 1}}, then there are just as many even permutations in S<sub>''n''</sub> as there are odd ones;<ref name=\"Jacobson_a\" /> consequently, A<sub>''n''</sub> contains [[factorial|''n''!]]/2 permutations. (The reason is that if ''\u03c3'' is even then {{nowrap|(1 \u200a2)''\u03c3''}} is odd, and if ''\u03c3'' is odd then {{nowrap|(1 \u200a2)''\u03c3''}} is even, and these two maps are inverse to each other.)<ref name=\"Jacobson_a\" />\n\nA [[cyclic permutation|cycle]] is even if and only if its length is odd. This follows from formulas like\n:<math>(a\\ b\\ c\\ d\\ e)=(d\\ e)(c\\ e)(b\\ e)(a\\ e)\\text{ or }(a\\ b)(b\\ c)(c\\ d)(d\\ e).</math>\nIn practice, in order to determine whether a given permutation is even or odd, one writes the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles. The permutation is odd if and only if this factorization contains an odd number of even-length cycles.\n\nAnother method for determining whether a given permutation is even or odd is to construct the corresponding [[permutation matrix]] and compute its determinant. The value of the determinant is the same as the parity of the permutation.\n\nEvery permutation of odd [[order (group theory)|order]] must be even.  The permutation {{nowrap|(1 2)(3 4)}} in A<sub>4</sub> shows that the converse is not true in general.\n\n== Equivalence of the two definitions ==\n\n=== Proof 1 ===\n\nEvery permutation can be produced by a sequence of [[Transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]] (2-element exchanges): with the first transposition we put the first element of the permutation in its proper place, the second transposition puts the second element right etc. Since we cannot be left with just a single element in an incorrect position, we must achieve the permutation with our last transposition. Given a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'', we can write it as a product of transpositions in many different ways. We want to show that either all of those decompositions have an even number of transpositions, or all have an odd number.\n\nSuppose we have two such decompositions:  \n:''&sigma;'' = ''T''<sub>1</sub> ''T''<sub>2</sub> ... ''T''<sub>''k''</sub>\n:''&sigma;'' = ''Q''<sub>1</sub> ''Q''<sub>2</sub> ... ''Q''<sub>''m''</sub>.\nWe want to show that ''k'' and ''m'' are either both even, or both odd.\n\nEvery transposition can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions of adjacent elements, e.g.\n:(2\u200a5) = (2\u200a3)\u2009(3\u200a4)\u2009(4\u200a5)\u2009(4\u200a3)\u2009(3\u200a2).\n\nTo see this, note that if we have the transposition (''i''&nbsp;''j'') on an ''n''-element set {1,...,''i'',...,''j'',...,''n''}, one way to decompose it is as [(''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;j)(''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)&nbsp;...&nbsp;(''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2)][(''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;''i'')(''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;...&nbsp;(''j''&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)]. The right block of transpositions first frees up the ''j'' space by moving ''j'' over to the ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 space; then, ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 goes into the ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 space with ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 in the ''j'' space, ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 goes into the ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3 space with ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3 in the ''j'' space, etc., until ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 ends up in the ''i'' space and ''i'' in the ''j'' space. Thus, each element from ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 to ''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 is in a space one to the left from where it ought to be. In the left block, each of those elements is restored one at a time to its original space, after resting in the ''i'' space for the duration of one permutation. ''j'' ends up in the ''i'' space, and ''i'' in the ''j'' space, with nothing else altered, as desired. The number of transpositions is (''j''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''i'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;(j&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), which is odd.\n\nIf we decompose in this way each of the transpositions ''T''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;''T''<sub>''k''</sub> and ''Q''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;''Q''<sub>''m''</sub> above\ninto an odd number of adjacent transpositions, we get the new decompositions:\n:''&sigma;'' = ''T''*<sub>1</sub> ''T''*<sub>2</sub> ... ''T''*<sub>''k''\u2032</sub>\n:''&sigma;'' = ''Q''*<sub>1</sub> ''Q''*<sub>2</sub> ... ''Q''*<sub>''m''\u2032</sub>\nwhere all of the ''T*''<sub>1</sub>...''T*<sub>k\u2032</sub>'' ''Q*''<sub>1</sub>...''Q*<sub>m\u2032</sub>'' are adjacent, {{nowrap|''k'' &minus; ''k''\u2032}} is even, and {{nowrap|''m'' &minus; ''m''\u2032}} is even.\n\nNow compose the inverse of T*<sub>k\u2032</sub> (which happens to be the same permutation) with ''\u03c3''. ''T*''<sub>k\u2032</sub> is the transposition (''i'',\u2009''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) of two adjacent numbers, so, compared to ''\u03c3'', the new permutation {{nowrap|''\u03c3\u2009''(''i'', ''i'' + 1)}} will have exactly one inversion pair less (in case {{nowrap|(''i'', ''i'' + 1)}} was an inversion pair for ''\u03c3'') or more (in case (''i'',\u2009''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) was not an inversion pair). Then apply the inverses of ''T*''<sub>''k''\u2032\u22121</sub>, ''T*''<sub>''k''&prime;\u22122</sub>, ..., ''T''*<sub>1</sub> in the same way, \"unraveling\" the permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3''. At the end we get the identity permutation, whose number of inversions is zero. This means that the original number of inversions ''N''(''\u03c3'') less ''k''' is even and also ''N''(''\u03c3'') less ''k'' is even (addition modulo two is independent of sign).\n\nWe can do the same thing with the other decomposition, ''Q''*<sub>''m''&prime;</sub>...''Q''*<sub>1</sub>, and it will turn out that the original ''N''(''\u03c3'') less ''m'' is even. Therefore, {{nowrap|''m'' &minus; ''k''}} is even, as we wanted to show.\n\nWe can thus define the parity of ''\u03c3'' to be that of its number of constituent transpositions, because we see that this can have only one value. And this must agree with the parity of the number of inversions under any ordering, as seen above, so the definitions are indeed well-defined and equivalent.\n\n=== Proof 2 ===\n\nAn alternative proof uses the [[polynomial]]\n\n:<math>P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\prod_{i<j} (x_i - x_j).</math>\n\nSo for instance in the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}, we have\n\n:<math>P(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_3)(x_1 - x_3).</math>\n\nNow for a given permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' of the numbers {1,\u2009...,\u2009''n''}, we define\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)=\\frac{P(x_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\sigma(n)})}{P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)}.</math>\n\nSince the polynomial <math>P(x_{\\sigma(1)},\\dots,x_{\\sigma(n)})</math> has the same factors as <math>P(x_1,\\dots,x_n)</math> except for their signs, if follows that sgn(''\u03c3'') is either +1 or &minus;1. Furthermore, if ''\u03c3'' and ''\u03c4'' are two permutations, we see that\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\tau) & = \\frac{P(x_{\\sigma(\\tau(1))},\\ldots,x_{\\sigma(\\tau(n))})}{P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\frac{P(x_{\\tau(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\tau(n)})}{P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)} \\cdot \\frac{P(x_{\\sigma(\\tau(1))},\\ldots, x_{\\sigma(\\tau(n))})}{P(x_{\\tau(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\tau(n)})} \\\\[4pt]\n& = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\\cdot\\operatorname{sgn}(\\tau).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSince with this definition it is furthermore clear that any transposition of two elements has signature &minus;1, we do indeed recover the signature as defined earlier.\n\n=== Proof 3 ===\n\nA third approach uses the [[presentation of a group|presentation]] of the group S<sub>''n''</sub> in terms of generators ''\u03c4''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''\u03c4''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub> and relations\n* <math>\\tau_i^2 = 1</math>&nbsp; for all ''i''\n* <math>\\tau_i^{}\\tau_{i+1}\\tau_i = \\tau_{i+1}\\tau_i\\tau_{i+1}</math> &nbsp; for all ''i'' < ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1\n* <math>\\tau_i^{}\\tau_j = \\tau_j\\tau_i</math> &nbsp; if |''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''j''| \u2265 2.\n[Here the generator <math>\\tau_i</math> represents the transposition {{nowrap|(''i'', ''i'' + 1)}}.] All relations keep the length of a word the same or change it by two. Starting with an even-length word will thus always result in an even-length word after using the relations, and similarly for odd-length words. It is therefore unambiguous to call the elements of S<sub>''n''</sub> represented by even-length words \"even\", and the elements represented by odd-length words \"odd\".\n\n=== Proof 4 ===\n\nRecall that a pair ''x'', ''y'' such that {{nowrap|''x'' < ''y''}} and {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(''x'') > ''\u03c3''(''y'')}} is called an inversion. We want to show that the count of inversions has the same parity as the count of 2-element swaps. To do that, we can show that every swap changes the parity of the count of inversions, no matter which two elements are being swapped and what permutation has already been applied. \nSuppose we want to swap the ''i''th and the ''j''th element. Clearly, inversions formed by ''i'' or ''j'' with an element outside of {{nowrap|[''i'', ''j'']}} will not be affected. \nFor the {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''j'' &minus; ''i'' &minus; 1}} elements within the interval {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')}}, assume ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> of them form inversions with ''i'' and ''v''<sub>''j''</sub> of them form inversions with ''j''. If ''i'' and ''j'' are swapped, those ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> inversions with ''i'' are gone, but {{nowrap|''n'' &minus; ''v''<sub>''i''</sub>}} inversions are formed. The count of inversions ''i'' gained is thus {{nowrap|''n'' &minus; 2''v''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, which has the same parity as ''n''.\n \nSimilarly, the count of inversions ''j'' gained also has the same parity as ''n''. Therefore, the count of inversions gained by both combined has the same parity as 2''n'' or 0. Now if we count the inversions gained (or lost) by swapping the ''i''th and the ''j''th element, we can see that this swap changes the parity of the count of inversions, since we also add (or subtract) 1 to the number of inversions gained (or lost) for the pair ''(i,j)''.\nNote that initially when no swap is applied, the count of inversions is 0. Now we obtain equivalence of the two definitions of parity of a permutation.\n\n== Other definitions and proofs ==\nThe parity of a permutation of <math>n</math> points is also encoded in its [[cyclic permutation|cycle structure]].\n\nLet ''\u03c3'' = (''i''<sub>1</sub> ''i''<sub>2</sub> ... ''i''<sub>''r''+1</sub>)(''j''<sub>1</sub> ''j''<sub>2</sub> ... ''j''<sub>''s''+1</sub>)...(''\u2113''<sub>1</sub> ''\u2113''<sub>2</sub> ... ''\u2113''<sub>''u''+1</sub>) be the unique [[cycle notation|decomposition of ''\u03c3'' into disjoint cycles]], which can be composed in any order because they commute. A cycle {{nowrap|(''a'' ''b'' ''c'' ... ''x'' ''y'' ''z'')}} involving {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}} points can always be obtained by composing ''k'' transpositions (2-cycles):\n\n:<math>(a\\ b\\ c \\dots x\\ y\\ z)=(a\\ b)(b\\ c) \\dots (x\\ y)(y\\ z),</math>\n\nso call ''k'' the ''size'' of the cycle, and observe that, under this definition, transpositions are cycles of size 1. From a decomposition into ''m'' disjoint cycles we can obtain a decomposition of ''\u03c3'' into {{nowrap|''k''<sub>1</sub> + ''k''<sub>2</sub> + ... + ''k''<sub>''m''</sub>}} transpositions, where ''k''<sub>''i''</sub> is the size of the ''i''th cycle. The number {{nowrap|1=''N''(''\u03c3'') = ''k''<sub>1</sub> + ''k''<sub>2</sub> + ... + ''k''<sub>''m''</sub>}} is called the discriminant of ''\u03c3'', and can also be computed as\n\n:<math>n \\text{ minus the number of disjoint cycles in the decomposition of } \\sigma</math>\n\nif we take care to include the fixed points of ''\u03c3'' as 1-cycles.\n\nSuppose a transposition (''a'' ''b'') is applied after a permutation ''\u03c3''. When ''a'' and ''b'' are in different cycles of ''\u03c3'' then\n:<math>(a\\ b)(a\\ c_1\\ c_2 \\dots c_r)(b\\ d_1\\ d_2 \\dots d_s) = (a\\ c_1\\ c_2 \\dots c_r\\ b\\ d_1\\ d_2 \\dots d_s)</math>,\n\nand if ''a'' and ''b'' are in the same cycle of ''\u03c3'' then\n\n:<math>(a\\ b)(a c_1 c_2 \\dots c_r\\ b\\ d_1\\ d_2 \\dots d_s) = (a\\ c_1\\ c_2 \\dots c_r)(b\\ d_1\\ d_2 \\dots d_s)</math>.\n\nIn either case, it can be seen that {{nowrap|1=''N''((''a'' ''b'')''\u03c3'') = ''N''(''\u03c3'') \u00b1 1}}, so the parity of ''N''((''a'' ''b'')''\u03c3'') will be different from the parity of ''N''(''\u03c3'').\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3'' = ''t''<sub>1</sub>''t''<sub>2</sub> ... ''t''<sub>''r''</sub>}} is an arbitrary decomposition of a permutation ''\u03c3'' into transpositions, by applying the ''r'' transpositions <math>t_1</math> after ''t''<sub>2</sub> after ... after ''t''<sub>''r''</sub> after the identity (whose ''N'' is zero) observe that ''N''(''\u03c3'') and ''r'' have the same parity. By defining the parity of ''\u03c3'' as the parity of ''N''(''\u03c3''), a permutation that has an even length decomposition is an even permutation and a permutation that has one odd length decomposition is an odd permutation.\n\nRemarks:\n* A careful examination of the above argument shows that {{nowrap|''r'' \u2265 ''N''(''\u03c3'')}}, and since any decomposition of ''\u03c3'' into cycles whose sizes sum to ''r'' can be expressed as a composition of ''r'' transpositions, the number ''N''(''\u03c3'') is the minimum possible sum of the sizes of the cycles in a decomposition of ''\u03c3'', including the cases in which all cycles are transpositions.\n* This proof does not introduce a (possibly arbitrary) order into the set of points on which ''\u03c3'' acts.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nParity can be generalized to [[Coxeter group]]s: one defines a [[length function]] \u2113(''v''), which depends on a choice of generators (for the symmetric group, [[adjacent transposition]]s), and then the function {{nowrap|''v'' \u21a6 (&minus;1)<sup>\u2113(''v'')</sup>}} gives a generalized sign map.\n\n== See also ==\n* The [[fifteen puzzle]] is a classic application, though it actually involves a [[groupoid]].\n* [[Zolotarev's lemma]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{MathWorld|urlname=EvenPermutation|title=Even Permutation}}\n* {{Cite book| last=Jacobson| first=Nathan| author-link=Nathan Jacobson| year=2009| title=Basic algebra| edition=2nd| volume = 1 | series= | publisher=Dover| isbn = 978-0-486-47189-1}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Rotman |first1=J.J. |authorlink1= |title=An introduction to the theory of groups |url= |edition= |series=Graduate texts in mathematics |volume= |year=1995 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location= |isbn=978-0-387-94285-8  }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Frederick M. |authorlink1= |title=Algebra: Abstract and Concrete |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-9799142-0-1  }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Meijer |first1=Paul Herman Ernst |authorlink1= |last2=Bauer |first2=Edmond |authorlink2= |title=Group theory: the application to quantum mechanics |url= |edition= |series=Dover classics of science and mathematics |volume= |year=2004 |publisher=Dover Publications |location= |isbn=978-0-486-43798-9  }}\n\n[[Category:Group theory]]\n[[Category:Permutations]]\n[[Category:Parity (mathematics)]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n\n[[ru:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430#\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f]]\n", "name_user": "2601:150:8200:92a0:69ed:6eec:f05d:d9af", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExample)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_a_permutation"}

However, in the October 1863 raid, Union General Wistar later reported some of his troops behaved very badly, and Sands Smith was executed after he shot a Union soldier attempting to confiscate his cow.<ref>Mathews County Historical Society, History and Progress, Mathews County, Virginia (reprints from 1949 and 1979 special editions of the Gloucester Mathews Gazette-Journal pp. 15-16</ref> His son and grandson would become prominent Mathews County officials by century's end. Also, Miss [[Sally Louisa Tompkins]], of a prominent Mathews family, went to [[Richmond, Virginia]] and established a private hospital for Confederate wounded, which achieved significant success, such that she was granted an officer's commission on September 9, 1861 by Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] and continued to nurse the wounded until 1865.<ref>1979 history pp. 44-47</ref><ref>McCartney pp. 332-333 relates that of 1,333 men receiving care, only 73 died</ref>\n\nIn 1882\u20131886, complaints about out-of-state watermen dredging local oyster beds (and destroying young oysters) produced an \"oyster war\" during the administration of Virginia Governor [[William E. Cameron]]. Several offending boats were captured, but all but one of their watermen were from [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Virginia's Eastern shore]] (across Chesapeake Bay)rather than from outside the Commonwealth.<ref>McCartney pp. 429-430</ref>\n\nDuring World War I, Mathews County greatly exceeded its quota of volunteers. In addition to fatalities, several men were disabled by gas attacks at the battlefront, and later relayed their stories. Many Mathews county seamen also served in the Merchant Marine. The war also changed economic relations within the county, for farm laborers could get better paying jobs in Hampton Roads or nearby cities.\n\nAs the [[Great Depression]] began, voters elected [[Emma Lee Smith White]], wife of local physician Dr. Carl Clifford White, to represent them in the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. As a local insurance agent, among other jobs, she had other priorities after a hurricane and 100-year level flooding devastated Mathews County in August 1933. No woman again sat in the Virginia General Assembly for 21 years.<ref>Cynthia A.

General Lewis' forces bombarded Gwynn's Island from [[Fort Cricket Hill]].\n\nIn 1791, after Virginia gained its independence from [[Great Britain]], the [[Virginia General Assembly]] split Gloucester county and created Mathews County. The county was named for [[Brigadier General]] [[Thomas Mathews (politician)|Thomas Mathews]], then speaker of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]]. Westville was designated at the county seat (later it became known variously as Mathews Court House or simply Mathews).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~vamathew/ |title=VAGenWeb Mathews County, VA Genealogy |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}</ref>\n\nSeaborne commerce, fishing and oyster farming had always been important in the area and [[Old Point Comfort Light]]house was built in 1802 to guide vessels into the [[Hampton Roads]] seaport (along with the older lighthouse at Cape Henry). Two additional lighthouses were built slightly later: [[New Point Comfort Light]] and [[Smith Point Light]]. During the [[War of 1812]], British vessels anchored in Hampton Roads and raided adjacent areas.\n\nFarming using enslaved labor was important to the 19th century economy, and early in the century [[Edmund Ruffin]] introduced the use of limestone marl as fertilizer on fields worn out from tobacco crops.<ref>McCartney pp. 266--268</ref> Two Mathews County men implicated in [[Gabriel's Rebellion]] in 1802 were sentenced to transportation out of the Commonwealth. In a lawsuit begun in 1806, Jackey Wright of Mathews County was granted her freedom from prominent landowner Holder Hudgins due to her grandmother's Native American ancestry in one of the last cases decided by Judge [[George Wythe]], with a Virginia Supreme Court opinion by [[St. George Tucker]].<ref>McCartney pp. 223-226</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], many white men from Mathews County enlisted in the Confederate Army. Some Union sympathizers petitioned President Abraham Lincoln for help, alleging that Confederate sympathizers had harassed them.<ref>McCartney pp. 337-339</ref> Union forces by 1862 controlled the Hampton Roads area and in July 1862 a detachment of Pennsylvania cavalry arrived at Gloucester Court House, then went to Mathews to arrest Carter B. Hudgins, but were unsuccessful. Several other Union raids occurred beginning in September 1863, initially designed to disrupt Confederate salt works. However, in the October 1863 raid, Union General Wistar later reported some of his troops behaved very badly, and Sands Smith was executed after he shot a Union soldier attempting to confiscate his cow.<ref>Mathews County Historical Society, History and Progress, Mathews County, Virginia (reprints from 1949 and 1979 special editions of the Gloucester Mathews Gazette-Journal pp. 15-16</ref> His son and grandson would become prominent Mathews County officials by century's end.

Cameron]]. Several offending boats were captured, but all but one of their watermen were from [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Virginia's Eastern shore]] (across Chesapeake Bay)rather than from outside the Commonwealth.<ref>McCartney pp. 429-430</ref>\n\nDuring World War I, Mathews County greatly exceeded its quota of volunteers. In addition to fatalities, several men were disabled by gas attacks at the battlefront, and later relayed their stories. Many Mathews county seamen also served in the Merchant Marine. The war also changed economic relations within the county, for farm laborers could get better paying jobs in Hampton Roads or nearby cities.\n\nAs the [[Great Depression]] began, voters elected [[Emma Lee Smith White]], wife of local physician Dr. Carl Clifford White, to represent them in the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. As a local insurance agent, among other jobs, she had other priorities after a hurricane and 100-year level flooding devastated Mathews County in August 1933. No woman again sat in the Virginia General Assembly for 21 years.<ref>Cynthia A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>.

After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref><ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref><ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W.
