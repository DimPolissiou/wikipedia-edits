The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers.

It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n*During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers. He who seizes land gifted by himsolf or by others is borm as a worm in ordure for 60,000 years. Whoever destroys this gift will incur the sin of killing tawny cows on the banks of the [[Ganges]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.501532|title=Annual Report Of The Mysore Archaeological Department, For The Year 1930|first=M.H.|last=Krishna|date=1934|language=english}}</ref>\n\n'''Note'''\n\nThis is a record registering the grant of a village called Kavahalli or Kalihalli (same as the present village Kahalli) for services in the Kirtinarayana temple at Talakad on the Kaveri river in T.-Narsipur Taluk, Mysore District. It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n*During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

Tests performed on serum are further categorized by the reason for performing the test:  maternal serum, adult tumor marker, and pediatric tumor marker.\n\n==Serum==\nThe standard is a quantitative test, reporting a measured concentration of AFP in the sample, but there is also a less expensive qualitative test, reporting only that the concentration is normal or high.  The qualitative test is appropriate only in some circumstances.\n\nThe resulting test report should specify the assay method and equipment used, and the report of a quantitative test should also provide a reference range for the test result.  Many laboratories report reference ranges that are based on all other samples tested in that laboratory, necessarily including samples with abnormal AFP concentrations due to disease.  Superior reference ranges are produced by research on healthy subjects.\n\nAFP test results often are reported as either ng/ml or MoM ([[multiple of the median]], where the median is calculated for an appropriate reference population).\n\n===Maternal testing for fetal screening===\nAbnormally elevated AFP in the serum of a pregnant woman can have one or more of these sources:\n\n* a problem with the fetus\n* a problem with the placenta\n* a [[tumor]] or [[liver]] disease in the woman\n* a normally elevated AFP in the fetus or woman (some people naturally have very high AFP)\n\nUsual follow-up steps include (1) a prenatal [[ultrasound]] exam to look for fetal abnormalities and/or (2) measurement of AFP in amniotic fluid obtained via [[amniocentesis]].\n\n[[Maternal]] serum AFP ('''MSAFP''') varies by [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] during the course of a normal pregnancy.  MSAFP increases rapidly until about 32 weeks gestation, then decreases gradually.  After the pregnancy ends it decreases rapidly, with a [[half-life]] of about 5 days.\n\nTypically, MSAFP is measured in the beginning of the second trimester (14\u201316 weeks).  It may be measured alone or as part of a package of [[Prenatal diagnosis|routine prenatal screening]] tests, such as a [[triple test]] or [[quad test]].\n\nBecause MSAFP test results must be interpreted according to the gestational age, they often are reported in terms of [[multiple of the median]] (MoM).  Because the median is calculated from tests of other women's pregnancies at the same gestational age, in effect MoM is independent of gestational age, but depend on accurate gestational dating.  A typical normal range is 0.5 to 2.0 or 2.5 MoM.\n\n* MSAFP ''above'' normal is seen in [[multiple birth|multiple gestation]], when there is [[placental abruption]], as well as in a number of fetal abnormalities, such as [[neural tube defect]]s including [[spina bifida]] and [[anencephaly]], and [[abdominal wall defect]]s. Other possibility is error in the date of the gestation. Mothers with [[Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase]] genetic variant also have more frequent elevated MSAFP.<ref name=\"pmid15352998\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bj\u00f6rklund NK, Evans JA, Greenberg CR, Seargeant LE, Schneider CE, Chodirker BN | title = The C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase variant and third trimester obstetrical complications in women with unexplained elevations of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein.| journal =Reprod Biol Endocrinol. | volume = 2| issue = | pages = 65|date=Sep 2004| pmid = 15352998| doi = 10.1186/1477-7827-2-65| pmc=520832}}</ref> Rarely, high MSAFP is due to [[endodermal sinus tumor]] (EST) or another [[germ cell tumor]] containing EST.  These tumors can occur in the pregnant woman (often as an [[ovarian tumor]]) or in the fetus.\n* MSAFP ''below'' normal is associated with a smaller number of conditions, including [[Down syndrome]] and [[Trisomy 18]]. Diabetic patients also have lower levels.\n\nPatients with abnormal MSAFP need to undergo detailed [[obstetric ultrasonography]]. The information is then used to decide whether to proceed with [[amniocentesis]].  [[Genetic counseling]] usually is offered when the screening test result is positive.\n\nIf a woman is already getting a Quad test for Down Syndrome screening, then the AFP-marker that is part of this test provides the screen result for neural-tube and abdominal wall defects.  However, if a woman received a 1st Trimester Combined screen for Down Syndrome, which does not include AFP, then some physicians will specifically order an AFP-only test in the 2nd trimester to screen for neural tube/abdominal wall defects.

In fact, these physicians might disregard the AFP-related information on neural tube/abdominal wall defects and do the detailed ultrasound to look for these defects even if the patient has a \"normal\" AFP reading{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.\n\n===Tumor marker===\nPrincipal [[tumor]]s that secrete AFP are [[endodermal sinus tumor]] (yolk sac carcinoma), [[hepatoblastoma]], and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].\n\nIn patients with AFP-secreting tumors, serum levels of AFP often correlate with tumor size. Resection is usually associated with a fall in serum levels. Serum levels are useful in assessing response to treatment.\n\nLike any elevated [[tumor marker]], elevated AFP by itself is not diagnostic, only suggestive. Tumor markers are used primarily to monitor the result of a treatment (e.g. [[chemotherapy]]).  If levels of AFP go down after treatment, the tumor is not growing.  In the case of babies, after treatment AFP should go down '''faster''' than it would normally.  A temporary increase in AFP immediately following chemotherapy may indicate not that the tumor is growing but rather that it is shrinking (and releasing AFP as the tumor cells die).\n\n==== Nonseminomatous germ cell tumor====\nIn the context of [[evidence-based medicine]], AFP is validated at the highest level as a tumor marker for use in patients with [[nonseminomatous germ cell tumor]]s.<ref name=\"pmid15333188\">{{cite journal | author = Duffy MJ | title = Evidence for the clinical use of tumour markers | journal = Ann.

Tests performed on serum are further categorized by the reason for performing the test:  maternal serum, adult tumor marker, and pediatric tumor marker.\n\n==Serum==\nThe standard is a quantitative test, reporting a measured concentration of AFP in the sample, but there is also a less expensive qualitative test, reporting only that the concentration is normal or high.  The qualitative test is appropriate only in some circumstances.\n\nThe resulting test report should specify the assay method and equipment used, and the report of a quantitative test should also provide a reference range for the test result.  Many laboratories report reference ranges that are based on all other samples tested in that laboratory, necessarily including samples with abnormal AFP concentrations due to disease.  Superior reference ranges are produced by research on healthy subjects.\n\nAFP test results often are reported as either ng/ml or MoM ([[multiple of the median]], where the median is calculated for an appropriate reference population).\n\n===Maternal testing for fetal screening===\nAbnormally elevated AFP in the serum of a pregnant woman can have one or more of these sources:\n\n* a problem with the fetus\n* a problem with the placenta\n* a [[tumor]] or [[liver]] disease in the woman\n* a normally elevated AFP in the fetus or woman (some people naturally have very high AFP)\n\nUsual follow-up steps include (1) a prenatal [[ultrasound]] exam to look for fetal abnormalities and/or (2) measurement of AFP in amniotic fluid obtained via [[amniocentesis]].\n\n[[Maternal]] serum AFP ('''MSAFP''') varies by [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] during the course of a normal pregnancy.  MSAFP increases rapidly until about 32 weeks gestation, then decreases gradually.  After the pregnancy ends it decreases rapidly, with a [[half-life]] of about 5 days.\n\nTypically, MSAFP is measured in the beginning of the second trimester (14\u201316 weeks).  It may be measured alone or as part of a package of [[Prenatal diagnosis|routine prenatal screening]] tests, such as a [[triple test]] or [[quad test]].\n\nBecause MSAFP test results must be interpreted according to the gestational age, they often are reported in terms of [[multiple of the median]] (MoM).  Because the median is calculated from tests of other women's pregnancies at the same gestational age, in effect MoM is independent of gestational age, but depend on accurate gestational dating.  A typical normal range is 0.5 to 2.0 or 2.5 MoM.\n\n* MSAFP ''above'' normal is seen in [[multiple birth|multiple gestation]], when there is [[placental abruption]], as well as in a number of fetal abnormalities, such as [[neural tube defect]]s including [[spina bifida]] and [[anencephaly]], and [[abdominal wall defect]]s. Other possibility is error in the date of the gestation.

These tumors can occur in the pregnant woman (often as an [[ovarian tumor]]) or in the fetus.\n* MSAFP ''below'' normal is associated with a smaller number of conditions, including [[Down syndrome]] and [[Trisomy 18]]. Diabetic patients also have lower levels.\n\nPatients with abnormal MSAFP need to undergo detailed [[obstetric ultrasonography]]. The information is then used to decide whether to proceed with [[amniocentesis]].  [[Genetic counseling]] usually is offered when the screening test result is positive.\n\nIf a woman is already getting a Quad test for Down Syndrome screening, then the AFP-marker that is part of this test provides the screen result for neural-tube and abdominal wall defects.  However, if a woman received a 1st Trimester Combined screen for Down Syndrome, which does not include AFP, then some physicians will specifically order an AFP-only test in the 2nd trimester to screen for neural tube/abdominal wall defects.

In fact, these physicians might disregard the AFP-related information on neural tube/abdominal wall defects and do the detailed ultrasound to look for these defects even if the patient has a \"normal\" AFP reading{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.\n\n===Tumor marker===\nPrincipal [[tumor]]s that secrete AFP are [[endodermal sinus tumor]] (yolk sac carcinoma), [[hepatoblastoma]], and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].\n\nIn patients with AFP-secreting tumors, serum levels of AFP often correlate with tumor size. Resection is usually associated with a fall in serum levels. Serum levels are useful in assessing response to treatment.\n\nLike any elevated [[tumor marker]], elevated AFP by itself is not diagnostic, only suggestive. Tumor markers are used primarily to monitor the result of a treatment (e.g. [[chemotherapy]]).  If levels of AFP go down after treatment, the tumor is not growing.  In the case of babies, after treatment AFP should go down '''faster''' than it would normally.  A temporary increase in AFP immediately following chemotherapy may indicate not that the tumor is growing but rather that it is shrinking (and releasing AFP as the tumor cells die).\n\n==== Nonseminomatous germ cell tumor====\nIn the context of [[evidence-based medicine]], AFP is validated at the highest level as a tumor marker for use in patients with [[nonseminomatous germ cell tumor]]s.<ref name=\"pmid15333188\">{{cite journal | author = Duffy MJ | title = Evidence for the clinical use of tumour markers | journal = Ann.

Trypsin, a type of [[peptidase]], is a digestive enzyme active in the [[duodenum]] and elsewhere.\n\nThe term ''alpha-1'' refers to the protein's behavior on [[protein electrophoresis]]. On electrophoresis, the protein component of the blood is separated by [[electric current]]. There are several ''clusters'', the first being [[serum albumin|albumin]], the second being the ''alpha'', the third ''beta'' and the fourth ''gamma'' ([[immunoglobulin]]s). The non-albumin proteins are referred to as [[globulin]]s.\n\nThe ''alpha'' region can be further divided into two sub-regions, termed \"1\" and \"2\". Alpha-1 antitrypsin is the main [[protein]] of the [[alpha-globulin]] 1 region.\n\nAnother name used is ''alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor'' (\u03b1<sub>1</sub>-PI).\n\n== Genetics ==\nThe [[gene]] is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 14]] (14q32.1).\n\nOver 100 different variants of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin have been described in various populations. North-Western [[Europe]]ans are most at risk for carrying one of the most common mutant forms of A1AT, the Z mutation (Glu342Lys on M1A, rs28929474).\n\n== Biochemical properties ==\nA1AT is a single-chain glycoprotein consisting of 394 amino acids in the mature form and exhibits many [[glycoform]]s. The three N-linked glycosylations sites are mainly equipped with so-called diantennary N-[[glycans]]. However, one particular site shows a considerable amount of heterogeneity since tri- and even tetraantennary N-[[glycans]] can be attached to the [[Asparagine]] 107 ([[UniProtKB]] amino acid nomenclature). These [[glycans]] carry different amounts of negatively charged sialic acids; this causes the heterogeneity observed on normal A1AT when analysed by [[isoelectric focusing]]. Also, the fucosylated triantennary N-glycans were shown to have the [[fucose]] as part of a so-called [[Sialyl Lewis x]] [[epitope]], which could confer this [[protein]] particular protein-cell recognition properties. The single [[cysteine]] residue of A1AT in position 256 ([[UniProtKB]] nomenclature) is found to be covalently linked to a free single [[cysteine]] by a [[disulfide bridge]].<ref name=Kolarich_2006>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolarich D, Weber A, Turecek PL, Schwarz HP, Altmann F | title = Comprehensive glyco-proteomic analysis of human alpha1-antitrypsin and its charge isoforms | journal = Proteomics | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 3369\u201380 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16622833 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200500751 }}</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe level of A1AT in serum is most often determined by adding an antibody that binds to A1AT, then using [[turbidimetry]] to measure how much A1AT is present. Other detection methods include the use of enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent-assays and radial immunodiffusion.\n\nDifferent analytical methods are used to determine A1AT [[phenotype]]. As [[protein]] [[electrophoresis]] is imprecise, the A1AT phenotype is analysed by [[isoelectric focusing]] (IEF) in the pH range 4.5-5.5, where the protein migrates in a gel according to its isoelectric point or charge in a [[pH]] gradient.\n\nNormal A1AT is termed ''M'', as it migrates toward the center of such an IEF gel. Other variants are less functional and are termed A-L and N-Z, dependent on whether they run proximal or distal to the M band. The presence of deviant bands on IEF can signify the presence of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]].  Since the number of identified mutations has exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, subscripts have been added to most recent discoveries in this area, as in the Pittsburgh mutation described above.\n\nAs every person has two [[allele|copies]] of the A1AT [[gene]], a [[heterozygote]] with two different copies of the gene may have two different bands showing on electrofocusing, although heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression of the gene will only show one band.\n\nIn [[blood test]] results, the IEF results are notated as in ''P<sub>i</sub>''MM, where ''P<sub>i</sub>'' stands for [[protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]] and \"MM\" is the banding pattern of that patient.\n\n''Alpha-1 antitrypsin'' levels in the blood depend on the [[genotype]]. Some mutant forms fail to fold properly and are, thus, targeted for destruction in the [[proteasome]], whereas others have a tendency to [[polymer]]ise, being retained in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. The serum levels of some of the common genotypes are:\n\n* PiMM: 100% (normal)\n* PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiZZ: 10-15% (severe [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]])\n* PiZ is caused by a [[glutamate]] to [[lysine]] mutation at position 342 (366 in pre-processed form)\n* PiS is caused by a [[glutamate]] to [[valine]] mutation at position 264 (288 in pre-processed form)\nOther rarer forms have been described; in all, there are over 80 variants.\n\n== Medical use ==\n{{drugbox\n| verifiedrevid = 477318673\n| IUPAC_name = Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor\n| image = A1AT.png\n<!--Clinical data -->\n| pregnancy_category = \n| legal_status = \n| routes_of_administration = intravenous\n<!--Pharmacokinetic data -->\n| bioavailability = \n| protein_bound = \n| metabolism = \n| elimination_half-life = \n<!--Identifiers -->\n| CAS_number_Ref = {{cascite|correct|??}}\n| CAS_number = 9041-92-3\n| ATC_prefix = B02\n| ATC_suffix = AB02\n| ATC_supplemental = \n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| ChemSpiderID = none\n| PubChem = \n| DrugBank_Ref = {{drugbankcite|correct|drugbank}}\n| DrugBank = DB00058\n<!--Chemical data -->\n| C=2001 | H=3130 | N=514 | O=601 | S=10\n| molecular_weight = 44324.5 g/mol\n}}\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin concentrates are prepared from the [[blood plasma]] of blood donors.

Trypsin, a type of [[peptidase]], is a digestive enzyme active in the [[duodenum]] and elsewhere.\n\nThe term ''alpha-1'' refers to the protein's behavior on [[protein electrophoresis]]. On electrophoresis, the protein component of the blood is separated by [[electric current]]. There are several ''clusters'', the first being [[serum albumin|albumin]], the second being the ''alpha'', the third ''beta'' and the fourth ''gamma'' ([[immunoglobulin]]s). The non-albumin proteins are referred to as [[globulin]]s.\n\nThe ''alpha'' region can be further divided into two sub-regions, termed \"1\" and \"2\". Alpha-1 antitrypsin is the main [[protein]] of the [[alpha-globulin]] 1 region.\n\nAnother name used is ''alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor'' (\u03b1<sub>1</sub>-PI).\n\n== Genetics ==\nThe [[gene]] is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 14]] (14q32.1).\n\nOver 100 different variants of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin have been described in various populations. North-Western [[Europe]]ans are most at risk for carrying one of the most common mutant forms of A1AT, the Z mutation (Glu342Lys on M1A, rs28929474).\n\n== Biochemical properties ==\nA1AT is a single-chain glycoprotein consisting of 394 amino acids in the mature form and exhibits many [[glycoform]]s. The three N-linked glycosylations sites are mainly equipped with so-called diantennary N-[[glycans]]. However, one particular site shows a considerable amount of heterogeneity since tri- and even tetraantennary N-[[glycans]] can be attached to the [[Asparagine]] 107 ([[UniProtKB]] amino acid nomenclature). These [[glycans]] carry different amounts of negatively charged sialic acids; this causes the heterogeneity observed on normal A1AT when analysed by [[isoelectric focusing]]. Also, the fucosylated triantennary N-glycans were shown to have the [[fucose]] as part of a so-called [[Sialyl Lewis x]] [[epitope]], which could confer this [[protein]] particular protein-cell recognition properties. The single [[cysteine]] residue of A1AT in position 256 ([[UniProtKB]] nomenclature) is found to be covalently linked to a free single [[cysteine]] by a [[disulfide bridge]].<ref name=Kolarich_2006>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolarich D, Weber A, Turecek PL, Schwarz HP, Altmann F | title = Comprehensive glyco-proteomic analysis of human alpha1-antitrypsin and its charge isoforms | journal = Proteomics | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 3369\u201380 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16622833 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200500751 }}</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe level of A1AT in serum is most often determined by adding an antibody that binds to A1AT, then using [[turbidimetry]] to measure how much A1AT is present. Other detection methods include the use of enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent-assays and radial immunodiffusion.\n\nDifferent analytical methods are used to determine A1AT [[phenotype]]. As [[protein]] [[electrophoresis]] is imprecise, the A1AT phenotype is analysed by [[isoelectric focusing]] (IEF) in the pH range 4.5-5.5, where the protein migrates in a gel according to its isoelectric point or charge in a [[pH]] gradient.\n\nNormal A1AT is termed ''M'', as it migrates toward the center of such an IEF gel. Other variants are less functional and are termed A-L and N-Z, dependent on whether they run proximal or distal to the M band. The presence of deviant bands on IEF can signify the presence of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]].  Since the number of identified mutations has exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, subscripts have been added to most recent discoveries in this area, as in the Pittsburgh mutation described above.\n\nAs every person has two [[allele|copies]] of the A1AT [[gene]], a [[heterozygote]] with two different copies of the gene may have two different bands showing on electrofocusing, although heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression of the gene will only show one band.\n\nIn [[blood test]] results, the IEF results are notated as in ''P<sub>i</sub>''MM, where ''P<sub>i</sub>'' stands for [[protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]] and \"MM\" is the banding pattern of that patient.\n\n''Alpha-1 antitrypsin'' levels in the blood depend on the [[genotype]]. Some mutant forms fail to fold properly and are, thus, targeted for destruction in the [[proteasome]], whereas others have a tendency to [[polymer]]ise, being retained in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. The serum levels of some of the common genotypes are:\n\n* PiMM: 100% (normal)\n* PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiZZ: 10-15% (severe [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]])\n* PiZ is caused by a [[glutamate]] to [[lysine]] mutation at position 342 (366 in pre-processed form)\n* PiS is caused by a [[glutamate]] to [[valine]] mutation at position 264 (288 in pre-processed form)\nOther rarer forms have been described; in all, there are over 80 variants.\n\n== Medical use ==\n{{drugbox\n| verifiedrevid = 477318673\n| IUPAC_name = Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor\n| image = A1AT.png\n<!--Clinical data -->\n| pregnancy_category = \n| legal_status = \n| routes_of_administration = intravenous\n<!--Pharmacokinetic data -->\n| bioavailability = \n| protein_bound = \n| metabolism = \n| elimination_half-life = \n<!--Identifiers -->\n| CAS_number_Ref = {{cascite|correct|??}}\n| CAS_number = 9041-92-3\n| ATC_prefix = B02\n| ATC_suffix = AB02\n| ATC_supplemental = \n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| ChemSpiderID = none\n| PubChem = \n| DrugBank_Ref = {{drugbankcite|correct|drugbank}}\n| DrugBank = DB00058\n<!--Chemical data -->\n| C=2001 | H=3130 | N=514 | O=601 | S=10\n| molecular_weight = 44324.5 g/mol\n}}\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin concentrates are prepared from the [[blood plasma]] of blood donors.
