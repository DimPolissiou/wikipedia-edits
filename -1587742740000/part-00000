{"title_page": "Voting", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Vote}}\n{{Redirect|Voter}}\n\n{{Voting images}}\n\n'''Voting''' is a method for a group, such as a meeting or legal cheating by the electorate, to get votes or express an opinion usually following stupid and gay cults, Like [[Trump Pence|TrumpPence]]. \n\nIn smaller organisations, voting can occur in different ways. Formally via ballot to elect others for example within a workplace, to elect members of political associations or to choose roles for others. Informally voting could occur as spoken agreement or as a verbal gesture like a raised hand.\n\n== In politics ==\nIn a [[democracy]], a [[government]] is chosen by voting in an [[election]]: a way for an electorate to elect, i.e. choose, among several candidates for rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/voting|title=Voting - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> In a [[representative democracy]] ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate appoints its representatives to government.\nIn a [[direct democracy]], ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate directly make decisions, turn [[bill (law)|bill]]s into laws, etc.\n\nA vote is a formal expression of an individual's choice for or against some [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] (for example, a proposed resolution); for or against some [[ballot question]]; or for a certain candidate, selection of candidates, or [[political party]]. Many countries use a [[secret ballot]], a practice to prevent voters from being intimidated and to protect their [[political privacy]].\n\nVoting often takes place at a [[polling station]]; it is voluntary in some countries, [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] in others, such as Australia.\n\n=== Electoral systems ===\n{{Voting}}\n{{main|Voting system|Election}}\n[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without need to register, every citizen receives at home the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each voting (and can send it by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to [[Bern#Politics|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time.]]\nDifferent [[voting system]]s use different types of votes. [[Plurality voting]] does not require the winner to achieve a vote majority, or more than fifty percent of the total votes cast. In a voting system that uses a single vote per race, when more than two candidates run, the winner may commonly have less than fifty percent of the vote.\n\nA side effect of a single vote per race is [[vote splitting]], which tends to elect candidates that do not support [[centrism]], and tends to produce a [[two-party system]]. An alternative to a single-vote system is [[approval voting]].\n\nTo understand why a single vote per race tends to favor less centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed \"up for election\", and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason is that the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than sixty percent of the voters prefer green. If the same percentage of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say if 33 percent of the voters prefer green, 33 percent prefer blue, and 33 percent prefer red, then each green marble will only get eleven percent of the vote, while the red and blue marbles will each get 33 percent, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-vote system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority. If the experiment is repeated using [[approval voting]], where voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, then the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles, because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles.\n\n<!-- Needs attention \u2193 -->\nA development on the 'single vote' system is to have [[Two-round system|two-round]] elections, or repeat [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]. This system is most common around the world. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority, which is more than half.<ref>[[Majority rule]].</ref>  and if no candidate obtains a majority at the first round, then the two candidates with the largest plurality are selected for the second round. Variants exist on these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50%, and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary.\n\nAn alternative to the Two-round voting system is the single round [[instant-runoff voting]] system (Also referred to as ''Alternative vote'' or ''[[Ranked voting systems|Preferential voting]]'') as used in some elections in Australia, Ireland and the USA. Voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the preferences allocated. If no single candidate has 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference. The process repeating itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an [[exhaustive ballot]] but using only a single round of voting.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''multiple vote'', the voter can vote for any subset of the alternatives. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. [[Approval voting]] uses such multiple votes.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''ranked vote'', the voter has to rank the alternatives in order of preference. For example, they might vote for Bob in first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. [[Ranked voting systems]], such as those famously used in Australia, use a ranked vote.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''scored vote'' (or ''range vote''), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See [[cardinal voting systems]].\n\nSome \"multiple-winner\" systems may have a single vote or one vote per elector per available position. In such a case the elector could vote for Bob and Charlie on a ballot with two votes. These types of systems can use ranked or [[Plurality-at-large voting|unranked]] voting, and are often used for [[at-large]] positions such as on some city councils.\n\n=== Referendums ===\n\nMost of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an [[election]]. However, people can also vote in [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche \u00e9conomique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).</ref> [[Australia]] ranked second with dozens of referendums.\n\n=== Fair voting ===\n{{Confusing|date=July 2011}}\nResults may lead at best to confusion, at worst to violence and even [[civil war]], in the case of political rivals. Many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference\u2014they are neither accepted nor rejected. Avoiding the choice that most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favour.\n\nThere are [[social choice theory]] definitions of seemingly reasonable criteria that are a measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including [[non-dictatorship]], [[unrestricted domain]], non-imposition, [[Pareto efficiency]], and [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] but [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that no voting system can meet all these standards.\n\nTo ensure fair voting and preventing the misuse of the microblogging platform, [[Twitter]] announced for adding a feature for users to report content that misleads voters. This announcement came when general elections are going to be held in India and some other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/twitter-adds-feature-for-users-to-report-content-that-misleads-voters/article26933008.ece|title=Twitter adds feature for users to report content that misleads voters|date=2019-04-24|work=thehindubusinessline|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Negative voting ===\n\n{{Main|Disapproval voting}}\n\nNegative voting allows a vote that expresses disapproval of a candidate.  For explanatory purposes, consider a hypothetical voting system that uses negative voting.  In this system, one vote is allowed, with the choice of either  for a candidate, or against a candidate.  Each positive vote adds one to a candidate's overall total, while a negative vote subtracts one, arriving at a net favorability.  The candidate with the highest net favorability is the winner. Note that not only is a negative total possible, but also, a candidate may even be elected with 0 votes if enough negative votes are cast against their opponents.\n\nUnder this implementation, negative voting is no different from a positive voting system, when only two candidates are on the ballot. However, in the case of three or more candidates, each negative vote for a candidate counts positively towards all of the other candidates.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nThree candidates are running for the same seat.  Two hypothetical election results are given, contrasting positive and negative voting.  Both polling accuracy and voter turnout are assumed to be 100 percent.\n\n<div float=none>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Current standing in the polls\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidate \n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" right | Polling \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| Party 1|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 40%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| Party 2|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| Party 3|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"  \n|+ Election results after positive voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +45\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Election results after negative voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" |-15\n|}\n</div>\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Election results with positive voting:'''\n\nA-voters, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A.

C-voters also decide to vote negatively against Candidate A, reasoning along similar lines.  Candidate B is the winner with 0 votes.  Enough negative votes were cast against Candidate B's opponents, resulting in negative totals.  Candidate A, despite having polled at 40%,  winds up with -5%, offset due to the aggregate 45% of negative votes cast by B and C voters. Candidate C ends up with -15%.\n\n=== Proxy voting ===\n{{Main|Proxy voting}}\nProxy voting is the type of voting where a registered citizen who is able to vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.\n\n=== Anti-voting ===\n{{Main|Abstention}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens. They make the structural argument that no political party truly represents them. For instance, this resulted in the \"[[No Land! No House! No Vote!]]\" Campaign which becomes very prominent each time the country holds elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://libcom.org/library/the-no-land-no-house-no-vote-campaign-still-2009|title=The 'No Land, No House, No Vote' campaign still on for 2009|date=5 May 2005|publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://antieviction.org.za/2005/12/12/indymedia-presents-no-land-no-house-no-vote/| title=IndyMedia Presents: No Land!

These include the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] and various [[anarchist]]-oriented movements.\n\nIt is possible to make a [[blank vote]], carrying out the act of voting, which may be compulsory, without selecting any candidate or option, often as an act of protest. In some jurisdictions, there is an official [[none of the above]] option and it is counted as a valid vote. Usually, blank and null votes are counted (together or separately) but are not considered valid.\n\n=== Voting and information ===\nModern political science has questioned whether [[average]] citizens have sufficient political information to cast meaningful votes. A series of studies coming out of the [[University of Michigan]] in the 1950s and 1960s argued that voters lack a basic understanding of current issues, the [[Liberalism|liberal]]\u2013[[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Ideology|ideological]] dimension, and the relative ideological dilemma.<ref>Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ([http://wikisum.com/w/Lupia_and_McCubbins:_The_Democratic_Dilemma Summary])</ref>\n\nStudies from other institutions have suggested that the physical appearance of candidates is a criterion upon which voters base their decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Predicting%20Elections%20from%20politicians%20faces.pdf | title = Predicting Elections from Politicians' Faces | author = Kesten C.

The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies#Show of hands|show of hands]], [[voice voting]] or [[audience response]] systems, to informally noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.\n\n=== Voting basis ===\n{{See also|Majority|Supermajority|Unanimity}}According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a widely used guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], the bases for determining the voting result consist of two elements: (1) the percentage of votes that are required for a proposal to be adopted or for a candidate to be elected (e.g. more than half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc.); and (2) the set of members to which the proportion applies (e.g. the members present and voting, the members present, the entire membership of the organization, the entire electorate, etc.).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 402|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> An example is a majority vote of the members present and voting.\n\nThe voting result could also be determined using a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the choices.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a decision could be made without a formal vote by using [[unanimous consent]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 54}}</ref>\n\n{{Electoral systems}}\n{{About-distinguish2|the physical means of casting ballots|details of voting theory, for which see [[Electoral system]]}}\nA '''voting method''' is the way in which people cast their votes in an [[election]] or [[referendum]]. There are several different methods in use around the world.\n\n==Voting methods in deliberative assemblies==\n{{main|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\n[[Deliberative assembly|Deliberative assemblies]]\u2014bodies that use [[parliamentary procedure]] to arrive at [[Decision making|decisions]]\u2014use several methods of voting on [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Different legislatures may have their own voting methods.\n\n==Voting methods==\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Voting method|Electoral system}}\n\n===Paper-based methods===\nThe most common voting method uses paper [[ballot]]s on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]], where they write out the name of their preferred candidate if it is not listed.\n\n[[Image:Kalpi israel 18.JPG|Ballot letters in Israel|thumb|150px|right]]\nAn alternative paper-based system known as [[ballot letters]] is used in [[Israel]], where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party contesting the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the [[ballot box]]. The same system is also implemented in [[Latvia]].\n\n===Machine voting===\n{{main|Voting machine|Electronic voting}}\n\nMachine voting uses [[voting machine]]s, which may be manual (e.g. [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machines]]) or [[Electronic voting|electronic]]. In Brazil, voters type in the number of the candidate they wish to vote for and then confirm their vote when the candidate's photo is displayed on screen.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21600162-teaching-those-who-cannot-read-how-vote-makes-cleaner-fairer-elections-making-their Illiterate voters: Making their mark] The Economist, 5 April 2014</ref>\n\n===Online voting===\nIn some countries people are allowed to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting]]: it was first used in the [[Estonian municipal elections, 2005|2005 local elections]].<ref>[http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics Voting methods in Estonia: Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia] VVK</ref>\n\n===Postal voting===\nMany countries allow [[postal voting]], where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.\n\n===Open ballot===\nIn contrast to a [[secret ballot]], an [[Open ballot system|open ballot]] takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the [[Landsgemeinde]] system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Grisons]], and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]].\n\n===Other methods===\nIn [[The Gambia]], voting is carried out using marbles, a method introduced in 1965 to deal with [[illiteracy]].<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5369966.stm Gambians vote with their marbles] BBC News, 22 September 2006</ref> Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates' photos attached to them.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/gambia-vote-roll-marbles/ Gambia vote a roll of the marbles] The Telegrapgh, 29 November 2016</ref><ref name=BBC/> Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote. To avoid confusion, bicycles are banned near polling booths on election day.<ref name=BBC/> If the marble is left on top of the drum rather than placed in it, the vote is deemed invalid.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38164870 Gambia election: Voters use marbles to choose president] BBC News, 30 November 2016</ref>\n\nA similar system used in social clubs sees voters given a white ball to indicate support and a black ball to indicate opposition. This led to the coining of the term [[blackballing]].\n\n===In person===\n{{see also|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\nSome votes are carried in person if all the people eligible to vote are present.

[[Democracy|Democracies]] elect holders of high office by voting.  Residents of a place represented by an elected official are called \"constituents\", and those constituents who cast a [[ballot]] for their chosen candidate are called \"voters\".  There are different systems for collecting votes.\n\nIn smaller organisations, voting can occur in different ways. Formally via ballot to elect others for example within a workplace, to elect members of political associations or to choose roles for others. Informally voting could occur as spoken agreement or as a verbal gesture like a raised hand.\n\n== In politics ==\nIn a [[democracy]], a [[government]] is chosen by voting in an [[election]]: a way for an electorate to elect, i.e. choose, among several candidates for rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/voting|title=Voting - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> In a [[representative democracy]] ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate appoints its representatives to government.\nIn a [[direct democracy]], ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate directly make decisions, turn [[bill (law)|bill]]s into laws, etc.\n\nA vote is a formal expression of an individual's choice for or against some [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] (for example, a proposed resolution); for or against some [[ballot question]]; or for a certain candidate, selection of candidates, or [[political party]]. Many countries use a [[secret ballot]], a practice to prevent voters from being intimidated and to protect their [[political privacy]].\n\nVoting often takes place at a [[polling station]]; it is voluntary in some countries, [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] in others, such as Australia.\n\n=== Electoral systems ===\n{{Voting}}\n{{main|Voting system|Election}}\n[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without need to register, every citizen receives at home the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each voting (and can send it by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to [[Bern#Politics|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time.]]\nDifferent [[voting system]]s use different types of votes. [[Plurality voting]] does not require the winner to achieve a vote majority, or more than fifty percent of the total votes cast. In a voting system that uses a single vote per race, when more than two candidates run, the winner may commonly have less than fifty percent of the vote.\n\nA side effect of a single vote per race is [[vote splitting]], which tends to elect candidates that do not support [[centrism]], and tends to produce a [[two-party system]]. An alternative to a single-vote system is [[approval voting]].\n\nTo understand why a single vote per race tends to favor less centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed \"up for election\", and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason is that the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than sixty percent of the voters prefer green. If the same percentage of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say if 33 percent of the voters prefer green, 33 percent prefer blue, and 33 percent prefer red, then each green marble will only get eleven percent of the vote, while the red and blue marbles will each get 33 percent, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-vote system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority. If the experiment is repeated using [[approval voting]], where voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, then the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles, because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles.\n\n<!-- Needs attention \u2193 -->\nA development on the 'single vote' system is to have [[Two-round system|two-round]] elections, or repeat [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]. This system is most common around the world. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority, which is more than half.<ref>[[Majority rule]].</ref>  and if no candidate obtains a majority at the first round, then the two candidates with the largest plurality are selected for the second round. Variants exist on these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50%, and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary.\n\nAn alternative to the Two-round voting system is the single round [[instant-runoff voting]] system (Also referred to as ''Alternative vote'' or ''[[Ranked voting systems|Preferential voting]]'') as used in some elections in Australia, Ireland and the USA. Voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the preferences allocated. If no single candidate has 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference. The process repeating itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an [[exhaustive ballot]] but using only a single round of voting.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''multiple vote'', the voter can vote for any subset of the alternatives. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. [[Approval voting]] uses such multiple votes.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''ranked vote'', the voter has to rank the alternatives in order of preference. For example, they might vote for Bob in first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. [[Ranked voting systems]], such as those famously used in Australia, use a ranked vote.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''scored vote'' (or ''range vote''), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See [[cardinal voting systems]].\n\nSome \"multiple-winner\" systems may have a single vote or one vote per elector per available position. In such a case the elector could vote for Bob and Charlie on a ballot with two votes. These types of systems can use ranked or [[Plurality-at-large voting|unranked]] voting, and are often used for [[at-large]] positions such as on some city councils.\n\n=== Referendums ===\n\nMost of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an [[election]]. However, people can also vote in [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche \u00e9conomique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).</ref> [[Australia]] ranked second with dozens of referendums.\n\n=== Fair voting ===\n{{Confusing|date=July 2011}}\nResults may lead at best to confusion, at worst to violence and even [[civil war]], in the case of political rivals. Many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference\u2014they are neither accepted nor rejected. Avoiding the choice that most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favour.\n\nThere are [[social choice theory]] definitions of seemingly reasonable criteria that are a measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including [[non-dictatorship]], [[unrestricted domain]], non-imposition, [[Pareto efficiency]], and [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] but [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that no voting system can meet all these standards.\n\nTo ensure fair voting and preventing the misuse of the microblogging platform, [[Twitter]] announced for adding a feature for users to report content that misleads voters. This announcement came when general elections are going to be held in India and some other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/twitter-adds-feature-for-users-to-report-content-that-misleads-voters/article26933008.ece|title=Twitter adds feature for users to report content that misleads voters|date=2019-04-24|work=thehindubusinessline|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Negative voting ===\n\n{{Main|Disapproval voting}}\n\nNegative voting allows a vote that expresses disapproval of a candidate.  For explanatory purposes, consider a hypothetical voting system that uses negative voting.  In this system, one vote is allowed, with the choice of either  for a candidate, or against a candidate.  Each positive vote adds one to a candidate's overall total, while a negative vote subtracts one, arriving at a net favorability.  The candidate with the highest net favorability is the winner. Note that not only is a negative total possible, but also, a candidate may even be elected with 0 votes if enough negative votes are cast against their opponents.\n\nUnder this implementation, negative voting is no different from a positive voting system, when only two candidates are on the ballot. However, in the case of three or more candidates, each negative vote for a candidate counts positively towards all of the other candidates.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nThree candidates are running for the same seat.  Two hypothetical election results are given, contrasting positive and negative voting.  Both polling accuracy and voter turnout are assumed to be 100 percent.\n\n<div float=none>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Current standing in the polls\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidate \n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" right | Polling \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| Party 1|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 40%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| Party 2|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| Party 3|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"  \n|+ Election results after positive voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +45\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Election results after negative voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" |-15\n|}\n</div>\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Election results with positive voting:'''\n\nA-voters, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A.

Enough negative votes were cast against Candidate B's opponents, resulting in negative totals.  Candidate A, despite having polled at 40%,  winds up with -5%, offset due to the aggregate 45% of negative votes cast by B and C voters. Candidate C ends up with -15%.\n\n=== Proxy voting ===\n{{Main|Proxy voting}}\nProxy voting is the type of voting where a registered citizen who is able to vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.\n\n=== Anti-voting ===\n{{Main|Abstention}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens. They make the structural argument that no political party truly represents them. For instance, this resulted in the \"[[No Land! No House! No Vote!]]\" Campaign which becomes very prominent each time the country holds elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://libcom.org/library/the-no-land-no-house-no-vote-campaign-still-2009|title=The 'No Land, No House, No Vote' campaign still on for 2009|date=5 May 2005|publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://antieviction.org.za/2005/12/12/indymedia-presents-no-land-no-house-no-vote/| title=IndyMedia Presents: No Land!

These include the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] and various [[anarchist]]-oriented movements.\n\nIt is possible to make a [[blank vote]], carrying out the act of voting, which may be compulsory, without selecting any candidate or option, often as an act of protest. In some jurisdictions, there is an official [[none of the above]] option and it is counted as a valid vote. Usually, blank and null votes are counted (together or separately) but are not considered valid.\n\n=== Voting and information ===\nModern political science has questioned whether [[average]] citizens have sufficient political information to cast meaningful votes. A series of studies coming out of the [[University of Michigan]] in the 1950s and 1960s argued that voters lack a basic understanding of current issues, the [[Liberalism|liberal]]\u2013[[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Ideology|ideological]] dimension, and the relative ideological dilemma.<ref>Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ([http://wikisum.com/w/Lupia_and_McCubbins:_The_Democratic_Dilemma Summary])</ref>\n\nStudies from other institutions have suggested that the physical appearance of candidates is a criterion upon which voters base their decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Predicting%20Elections%20from%20politicians%20faces.pdf | title = Predicting Elections from Politicians' Faces | author = Kesten C.

May\u2013June 2016.  10 October 2016.</ref>\n\n==Meetings and gatherings==\nWhenever several people who do not all agree need to make some decision, voting is a very common way of reaching a decision peacefully. The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies#Show of hands|show of hands]], [[voice voting]] or [[audience response]] systems, to informally noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.\n\n=== Voting basis ===\n{{See also|Majority|Supermajority|Unanimity}}According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a widely used guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], the bases for determining the voting result consist of two elements: (1) the percentage of votes that are required for a proposal to be adopted or for a candidate to be elected (e.g. more than half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc.); and (2) the set of members to which the proportion applies (e.g. the members present and voting, the members present, the entire membership of the organization, the entire electorate, etc.).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 402|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> An example is a majority vote of the members present and voting.\n\nThe voting result could also be determined using a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the choices.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a decision could be made without a formal vote by using [[unanimous consent]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 54}}</ref>\n\n{{Electoral systems}}\n{{About-distinguish2|the physical means of casting ballots|details of voting theory, for which see [[Electoral system]]}}\nA '''voting method''' is the way in which people cast their votes in an [[election]] or [[referendum]]. There are several different methods in use around the world.\n\n==Voting methods in deliberative assemblies==\n{{main|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\n[[Deliberative assembly|Deliberative assemblies]]\u2014bodies that use [[parliamentary procedure]] to arrive at [[Decision making|decisions]]\u2014use several methods of voting on [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Different legislatures may have their own voting methods.\n\n==Voting methods==\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Voting method|Electoral system}}\n\n===Paper-based methods===\nThe most common voting method uses paper [[ballot]]s on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]], where they write out the name of their preferred candidate if it is not listed.\n\n[[Image:Kalpi israel 18.JPG|Ballot letters in Israel|thumb|150px|right]]\nAn alternative paper-based system known as [[ballot letters]] is used in [[Israel]], where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party contesting the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the [[ballot box]]. The same system is also implemented in [[Latvia]].\n\n===Machine voting===\n{{main|Voting machine|Electronic voting}}\n\nMachine voting uses [[voting machine]]s, which may be manual (e.g. [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machines]]) or [[Electronic voting|electronic]]. In Brazil, voters type in the number of the candidate they wish to vote for and then confirm their vote when the candidate's photo is displayed on screen.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21600162-teaching-those-who-cannot-read-how-vote-makes-cleaner-fairer-elections-making-their Illiterate voters: Making their mark] The Economist, 5 April 2014</ref>\n\n===Online voting===\nIn some countries people are allowed to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting]]: it was first used in the [[Estonian municipal elections, 2005|2005 local elections]].<ref>[http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics Voting methods in Estonia: Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia] VVK</ref>\n\n===Postal voting===\nMany countries allow [[postal voting]], where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.\n\n===Open ballot===\nIn contrast to a [[secret ballot]], an [[Open ballot system|open ballot]] takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the [[Landsgemeinde]] system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Grisons]], and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]].\n\n===Other methods===\nIn [[The Gambia]], voting is carried out using marbles, a method introduced in 1965 to deal with [[illiteracy]].<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5369966.stm Gambians vote with their marbles] BBC News, 22 September 2006</ref> Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates' photos attached to them.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/gambia-vote-roll-marbles/ Gambia vote a roll of the marbles] The Telegrapgh, 29 November 2016</ref><ref name=BBC/> Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote. To avoid confusion, bicycles are banned near polling booths on election day.<ref name=BBC/> If the marble is left on top of the drum rather than placed in it, the vote is deemed invalid.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38164870 Gambia election: Voters use marbles to choose president] BBC News, 30 November 2016</ref>\n\nA similar system used in social clubs sees voters given a white ball to indicate support and a black ball to indicate opposition. This led to the coining of the term [[blackballing]].\n\n===In person===\n{{see also|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\nSome votes are carried in person if all the people eligible to vote are present. This could be by a show of hands or [[keypad polling]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Cosmopolitan democracy]]\n*[[Democratic mundialization]]\n*[[Dollar voting]]\n*[[Electoral fraud]]\n*[[Electoral system]]\n*[[Gerrymandering]]\n*[[Mandate (politics)]]\n*[[Ranked voting systems]]\n*[[Opinion poll]]\n*[[Presidential election]]\n*[[Proportional representation]]\n*[[Psephology]]\n*[[Redistricting]]\n*[[Referendum]]\n*[[Suffrage]]\n*[[Voter turnout]]\n*[[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies]]\n*[[Voting system]]\n*[[Right of expatriates to vote in their country of origin]]\n*[[Vote Splitting]]}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|vote|voting}}\n{{Commons category|Voting}}\n*[http://americanhistory.si.edu/vote/ A history of voting in the United States] from the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n*[http://dca.tufts.edu/features/aas A New Nation Votes: American Elections Returns 1787-1825]\n*[http://www.canivote.org/ Can I Vote?]\u2014a nonpartisan US resource for registering to vote and finding your polling place from the [http://www.nass.org/ National Association of Secretaries of State].\n* [http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/elections/el_000_e.shtml The Canadian Museum of Civilization \u2014 A History of the Vote in Canada ]\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Vote|volume=28|pages=216\u2013217}} This contains a brief history of voting in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]; see also [[Electoral system#History|Electoral system s.v.

The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and is rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States. It premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on March 28, 2012.\n\nIn the episode, the boys must deal with the fact that \"Faith Hilling\", the [[Internet meme|meme]]tic trend in which they enjoy participating, is being supplanted in popularity by newer ones, including one that leads investigators to believe that cats are evolving in intelligence and have become a threat to humanity.<ref>[http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/411066/episode-1603-faith-hilling-press-release \"Episode 1603 Faith Hilling Press Release\"]. South Park Studios. March 26, 2012</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA new [[Internet meme|memetic]] trend emerges called \"[[Faith Hill]]ing\", a derivative of [[Planking (fad)|planking]], which involves having a picture of oneself taken while pulling the front of one's shirt forward in mock resemblance of women's breasts. After the boys perform this prank on stage at a [[Colorado Republican caucuses, 2012|2012 Colorado]] [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|Republican Presidential Debate]], the entire fourth grade class of South Park Elementary is required to take a safety education class in which Professor Lamont teaches them the dangers of memetic trends with a [[Red Asphalt|graphic educational video]] showing people dying gruesome deaths when they are hit by [[train]]s while \"[[Tebowing]]\". Despite this, and a report by the ''[[Denver Post]]'' that Faith Hilling is considered pass\u00e9 and has been replaced with the newer trend of dragging one's nude buttocks across the floor or ground, or \"[[Taylor Swift]]ing\", Stan and his friends continue Faith Hilling, even coming into conflict with Taylor Swifters.\n\nProfessor Lamont is then informed by two unidentified men of a new Internet meme being practiced by another species: photos of cats with their heads poking through slices of bread. Lamont sees this as evidence that cats are evolving to become as intelligent as humans. This is a reference to Chapter eleven of Richard Dawkins book on evolution, [[The Selfish Gene]], in which he suggests ideas, or as he calls them \"memes\", are the new replicators and a new kind of evolution. As this and newer memes continue to emerge among both people and cats, which in some instances results in the deaths of participants, the boys continue Faith Hilling, but after taunts and jeers by spectators, they are eventually forced, one by one, to come to terms with the fact that doing so is no longer in style.\n\nAt the same time, Lamont and other humans attempt to communicate with the cats, which are now apparently [[talking animals#Cats|capable of speech]]; the humans feel this represents a danger to mankind and will eventually lead to war between the two species.\n\nThe boys attempt to remain current by participating in newer memes, including one that combines elements from previous memes and involves dragging one's nude buttocks across the floor while holding a cat with its head poking through a slice of bread. The boys attempt to perform this stunt at another Colorado Republican debate, but after Cartman storms the stage with his cat, he finds himself unable to continue, seeing that it is beneath him to adopt a meme simply because it is new. He aborts the intended prank, and instead takes a stand by doing what he really wants. He pulls his shirt out to simulate breasts, and begins to sing a number that spurs both the crowd and the Republicans ([[Rick Santorum]], [[Mitt Romney]], and [[Newt Gingrich]]) to join him in a massive act of group Faith Hilling.\n\nThe episode concludes with a reporter claiming that the messages behind these latest memes is unclear, but it does not matter as long as audiences are given a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with breasts, a practice known as \"[[Pandering (politics)|pandering]]\". As he goes on about the practice of \"[[Journalism|reporting]]\", a [[train]] appears out of nowhere and immediately kills him.\n\n== Reception ==\nEric Goldman of [[IGN]] gave the episode a 7/10 \"Good\" rating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/29/south-park-faith-hilling-review|title=South Park: \"Faith Hilling\" Review|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=2012-03-28|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref> Ryan McGee of ''[[The A.V.

The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and is rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States. It premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on March 28, 2012. \n\nIn the episode, the boys must deal with the fact that \"Faith Hilling\", the [[Internet meme|meme]]tic trend in which they enjoy participating, is being supplanted in popularity by newer ones, including one that leads investigators to believe that cats are evolving in intelligence and have become a threat to humanity.<ref>[http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/411066/episode-1603-faith-hilling-press-release \"Episode 1603 Faith Hilling Press Release\"]. South Park Studios. March 26, 2012</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA new [[Internet meme|memetic ]]trend emerges called \"[[Faith Hill|Faith Hilling]]\", a derivative of [[Planking_(fad)|planking]], which involves having a picture of oneself taken while pulling the front of one's shirt forward in mock resemblance of women's breasts. After the boys perform this prank on stage at a [[Colorado Republican caucuses, 2012|2012 Colorado]] [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|Republican Presidential Debate]], the entire fourth grade class of South Park Elementary is required to take a safety education class in which Professor Lamont teaches them the dangers of memetic trends with a [[Red Asphalt|graphic educational video]] showing people dying gruesome deaths when they are hit by [[train]]s while \"[[Tebowing]]\". Despite this, and a report by the ''[[Denver Post]]'' that Faith Hilling is considered pass\u00e9 and has been replaced with the newer trend of dragging one's nude buttocks across the floor or ground, or \"[[Taylor Swift|Taylor Swifting]]\", Stan and his friends continue Faith Hilling, even coming into conflict with Taylor Swifters.\n\nProfessor Lamont is then informed by two unidentified men of a new Internet meme being practiced by another species: photos of cats with their heads poking through slices of bread. Lamont sees this as evidence that cats are evolving to become as intelligent as humans. This is a reference to Chapter eleven of Richard Dawkins book on evolution, [[The Selfish Gene]], in which he suggests ideas, or as he calls them \"memes\", are the new replicators and a new kind of evolution. As this and newer memes continue to emerge among both people and cats, which in some instances results in the deaths of participants, the boys continue Faith Hilling, but after taunts and jeers by spectators, they are eventually forced, one by one, to come to terms with the fact that doing so is no longer in style. \n\nAt the same time, Lamont and other humans attempt to communicate with the cats, which are now apparently [[talking animals#Cats|capable of speech]]; the humans feel this represents a danger to mankind and will eventually lead to war between the two species.\n\nThe boys attempt to remain current by participating in newer memes, including one that combines elements from previous memes and involves dragging one's nude buttocks across the floor while holding a cat with its head poking through a slice of bread. The boys attempt to perform this stunt at another Colorado Republican debate, but after Cartman storms the stage with his cat, he finds himself unable to continue, seeing that it is beneath him to adopt a meme simply because it is new. He aborts the intended prank, and instead takes a stand by doing what he really wants. He pulls his shirt out to simulate breasts, and begins to sing a number that spurs both the crowd and the Republicans ([[Rick Santorum]], [[Mitt Romney]], and [[Newt Gingrich]]) to join him in a massive act of group Faith Hilling.\n\nThe episode concludes with a reporter claiming that the messages behind these latest memes is unclear, but it does not matter as long as audiences are given a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with breasts, a practice known as \"[[Pandering (politics)|pandering]]\". As he goes on about the practice of \"[[Journalism|reporting]]\", a [[train]] appears out of nowhere and immediately kills him.\n\n== Reception ==\nEric Goldman of [[IGN]] gave the episode a 7/10 \"Good\" rating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/29/south-park-faith-hilling-review|title=South Park: \"Faith Hilling\" Review|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=2012-03-28|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref> Ryan McGee of ''[[The A.V.

In early cinema the soundtrack to movies was provided by musicians playing live in the theatres. Meyer de Wolfe offered a [[sheet music]] library of original compositions to accompany [[silent films]], often produced in collaboration with other musicians from the orchestras of London. These collaborators included conductor [[Sir Landon Ronald]], violinist and conductor [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Sir Eugene Goossens]], composers [[Giuseppe Becce]] and [[Ivor Novello]], and violinist [[Mantovani]].\n\nBy the late 1920s de Wolfe Music began recording with the '[[sound-on-disc]]' technique and '[[sound-on-film]]', on the 35mm [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]]. This film was explosive if improperly stored, which proved to be the cause of an explosion in the basement of the company's [[Wardour Street]] office. Examples of compositions from this time include ''Keep Your Face To The Sunshine'' (1926), ''Odiele'', performed by Ivor Novello, from the film ''[[The Rat (1925 film)|The Rat]]'' (1925), and ''Policeman's Holiday'' (1931) by Montague Ewing.\n\nIn the 1930s de Wolfe created soundtracks for [[newsreels]], working with [[Path\u00e9 News]], [[British Movietone News]], and [[Gaumont-British|British Gaumont Cinemas]]. This work continued throughout the Second World War and on in to the 1960s. The company was still providing music for film, including ''[[Fame Is the Spur (film)|Fame Is the Spur]]'' (with a soundtrack composed by [[Operation Chastise|Dam Busters]] pilot [[John Wooldridge]]) and ''[[Edward, My Son]]'' (1948).\n\nAfter the Second World War, de Wolfe expanded in to North America through a partnership with Corelli and Jacobs,  two film editors from Paramount Pictures. In 1955 the company provided the music for the first televised commercial in the U.K. for Gibbs Toothpaste.\n\nIn 1962 de Wolfe began distributing 10\" vinyl records, with cover designs by Rolf Webster and [[Nick Bantock]]. These LPs are now widely sought after by record collectors. At this time de Wolfe provided the theme to ''[[The Power Game]]'' (earning de Wolfe and Wayne Hill an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Instrumental Composition of the Year),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivors.com/archive/1960-1969/the-ivors-1967/|title=The Ivors 1967|author=DigitalMovement|date=2018|website=theivors.com|accessdate=17 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307064611/http://theivors.com/archive/1960-1969/the-ivors-1967/|archive-date=7 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and for a number of episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.\n\nIn 1973 a [[Jack Trombey]] composition was used as the theme for the detective series ''[[Van Der Valk]]''. ''[[Eye Level]]'' became a million-selling number one single, topping the U.K charts for six weeks. Around this time de Wolfe music could be heard in Kung Fu movies by the [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], British Comedies ''[[Zeta One]]'' and ''[[Adventures of a Taxi Driver]]'', and the [[Monty Python]] films. The 1970s was a period of further expansion for the company, with the addition of the Rouge catalogue in 1975 and the establishing of Angel Recording Studios in 1979.\n\nDigital technology bought changes to the [[music industry]] in the 1980s, particularly with the evolution of CDs. In 1985 de Wolfe launched its DWCD collection of 6 CDs, becoming the world's first digital production music library. De Wolfe ultimately ended the production of its vinyl series in 1988, and the end of the production of CDs would come in 2014 as de Wolfe shifted focus to online delivery.\n\nDe Wolfe LTD celebrated its centenary year in 2009, with the company at that time boasting offices and agents in 40 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dewolfemusic.com/page/nitrate_to_bitrate|title=Nitrate to Bitrate|author=de Wolfe Music|date=27 April 2015|website=dewolfemusic.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Labels==\nDe Wolfe LTD produces audio for a variety of genres and usage, which are organised in to a number of labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dewolfemusic.com/page/production_music|title=Production Music|author=de Wolfe Music|date=17 May 2017|website=dewolfemusic.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===De Wolfe Music (DWCD)===\n\nDe Wolfe's primary label, and where a majority of the new releases are housed.

Examples of compositions from this time include ''Keep Your Face To The Sunshine'' (1926), ''Odiele'', performed by Ivor Novello, from the film ''[[The Rat (1925 film)|The Rat]]'' (1925), and ''Policeman's Holiday'' (1931) by Montague Ewing.\n\nIn the 1930s de Wolfe created soundtracks for [[newsreels]], working with [[Path\u00e9 News]], [[British Movietone News]], and [[Gaumont-British|British Gaumont Cinemas]]. This work continued throughout the Second World War and on in to the 1960s. The company was still providing music for film, including ''[[Fame Is the Spur (film)|Fame Is the Spur]]'' (with a soundtrack composed by [[Operation Chastise|Dam Busters]] pilot [[John Wooldridge]]) and ''[[Edward, My Son]]'' (1948).\n\nAfter the Second World War, de Wolfe expanded in to North America through a partnership with Corelli and Jacobs,  two film editors from Paramount Pictures. In 1955 the company provided the music for the first televised commercial in the U.K. for Gibbs Toothpaste.\n\nIn 1962 de Wolfe began distributing 10\" vinyl records, with cover designs by Rolf Webster and [[Nick Bantock]]. These LPs are now widely sought after by record collectors. At this time de Wolfe provided the theme to ''[[The Power Game]]'' (earning de Wolfe and Wayne Hill an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Instrumental Composition of the Year),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivors.com/archive/1960-1969/the-ivors-1967/|title=The Ivors 1967|author=DigitalMovement|date=2018|website=theivors.com|accessdate=17 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307064611/http://theivors.com/archive/1960-1969/the-ivors-1967/|archive-date=7 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and for a number of episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.\n\nIn 1973 a [[Jack Trombey]] composition was used as the theme for the detective series ''[[Van Der Valk]]''. ''[[Eye Level]]'' became a million-selling number one single, topping the U.K charts for six weeks. Around this time de Wolfe music could be heard in Kung Fu movies by the [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], British Comedies ''[[Zeta One]]'' and ''[[Adventures of a Taxi Driver]]'', and the [[Monty Python]] films. The 1970s was a period of further expansion for the company, with the addition of the Rouge catalogue in 1975 and the establishing of Angel Recording Studios in 1979.\n\nDigital technology bought changes to the [[music industry]] in the 1980s, particularly with the evolution of CDs. In 1985 de Wolfe launched its DWCD collection of 6 CDs, becoming the world's first digital production music library. De Wolfe ultimately ended the production of its vinyl series in 1988, and the end of the production of CDs would come in 2014 as de Wolfe shifted focus to online delivery.\n\nDe Wolfe LTD celebrated its centenary year in 2009, with the company at that time boasting offices and agents in 40 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dewolfemusic.com/page/nitrate_to_bitrate|title=Nitrate to Bitrate|author=de Wolfe Music|date=27 April 2015|website=dewolfemusic.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Labels==\nDe Wolfe LTD produces audio for a variety of genres and usage, which are organised in to a number of labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dewolfemusic.com/page/production_music|title=Production Music|author=de Wolfe Music|date=17 May 2017|website=dewolfemusic.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===De Wolfe Music (DWCD)===\n\nDe Wolfe's primary label, and where a majority of the new releases are housed.

Meanwhile, a [[DeLorean DMC-12|DeLorean]]-driving playboy attracts Alex's attention and Danny comes up with the goods on a [[New Romantic]] night out. Guest starring [[Rupert Graves]] and [[Steve Strange]].\n\n==Plot==\nAlex is watching television when she sees her mum on the TV talking about a case she has done. All the officers are on high alert as Prince Charles and Lady Di are to be married in a couple of days. Gene and Alex go to talk to David Bonds who is protesting in his pub on the refurbishment of the East End. He agrees to not cause any trouble until after the royal wedding. Gene tries to force Alex to have her bottom stamped as property of the station, an apparent tradition in the Metropolitan Police where the male officers moon her afterward. Alex refuses. A message comes in from an apparent bomber after a stray dog is blown up by dynamite. The message says that 'next time it's moore' and although everyone else assumes it to be a spelling mistake, Alex notices the note's perfect grammar and says if they can get that right then they can spell correctly. Chris says Moore might refer to Bobby Moore but is dismissed. Shaz suggests Daniel Moore, a man who is redeveloping parts of the East End. Hunt assigns Chris to find which magazines the letters in the note came from.\n\nGene and Alex go to visit Moore who declines their offer of protection. Alex is immediately attracted to him. Back at CID, Chris has found the source of all the letters except the O's. Moore appears at the station and takes Alex for a drive in his De Lorean. When they park, Alex says she hears a ticking sound and they both struggle to get out of the locked car. The bomb turns out to be a fake to scare Danny and asks if the offer of protection still stands. Alex is visibly shaken by the fake bomb. Gene sends Alex home saying she is no good to them being in the state she's in. At a restaurant Alex asks if Danny will be able to surprise her and he takes her to the Blitz, a famous London nightclub of the era. They meet Shaz and Chris there and Alex is having a great time. She sees the Clown on the stage and follows him only to find him gone. The next day Alex tells Gene she recognises the weird 'O's in the letter and that they were on the shirt of Bonds' son. Gene is reluctant to bring the boy in until Alex agrees to let him stamp her bottom. He is arrested and questioned but doesn't say anything. Whilst Gene is trying to stamp Alex, the Bonds' representative arrives: Caroline Price, Alex's mother.\n\nChris comes back from Bonds' pub with another stick of dynamite and they question George again with Price in the room. The suspect is charged and Caroline asks Alex for a drink. She asks Alex to spy on her fellow male workers and when she refuses Caroline says she's glad the only thing Alex shares with her daughter is her name because she would be ashamed to have Alex as a daughter. In revenge, Alex goes to sleep with Danny but when reaching his office discovers him having sex with someone else. Gene suspects that George's father, David Bonds, is the actual bomber and brings him in for questioning. George confesses to protect his father. As George is being booked, Hunt pulls out a plastic bag and tosses it to Mrs Bonds and Mr. Bonds ducks under a desk thinking it to contain dynamite. Mr. Bonds was the actual bomber (having previously been an explosive expert serving in North Africa during the Second World War). At Danny's party to celebrate the wedding, however, Alex notices Bonds' son acting suspiciously. Alex and Gene shout to everyone to run and Bonds shouts \"we are all prostitutes\", a reference to his favorite song by The Pop Group, before blowing himself up. Caroline comes to apologise to Alex for misjudging George's character and then announces she is going to spend time with her daughter. Alex looks out to see Gene and the rest of the squad mooning her as part of the deal.\n\n==Cast==\n'''Main'''\n\n* [[Philip Glenister]] ([[Gene Hunt]])\n* [[Keeley Hawes]] ([[Alex Drake (Ashes to Ashes)|Alex Drake]])\n* [[Dean Andrews]] ([[Ray Carling]])\n* [[Marshall Lancaster]] ([[Chris Skelton]])\n* [[Montserrat Lombard]] ([[Sharon Granger]])\n\n'''Guests'''\n* [[Amelia Bullmore]] (Caroline Price)\n* [[Stephen Campbell Moore]] (Evan White)\n* [[Joseph Long (actor)|Joseph Long]] (Luigi)\n* [[Geff Francis]] (Viv James)\n* Andrew Clover (The Clown)\n* Grace Vance (Molly Drake)\n* Rupert Graves (Danny Moore)\n* [[Christopher Fairbank]] (David Bonds)\n* [[Stephen Wight]] (George Bonds)\n* [[Amelda Brown]] (Elaine Bonds)\n* Lucy Cole (Young Alex)\n* Nick Howden (Scared youth)\n* Nicky Lilley ([[Lady Diana Spencer]]) \n* [[Steve Strange]] (As himself)\n* [[Lee Jason Simeone]] (Dancer / club regular)\n* Sandrine Gourrow (As herself)\n* Zippy - [[Ronnie Le Drew]] (voiced by [[Roy Skelton]])\n\n==Music==\nMusic featured in the episode includes:\n\n\"[[Swords of a Thousand Men]]\" - [[Tenpole Tudor]]\n\n\"[[The Prince (song)|The Prince]]\" - [[Madness (band)|Madness]]\n\n\"Body Talk\" - [[Imagination (band)|Imagination]]\n\n\"[[Money (That's What I Want)]]\" - [[The Flying Lizards]]\n\n[[Planet Earth (Duran Duran song)|\"Planet Earth\"]] - [[Duran Duran]]\n\n[[Happy Birthday (Altered Images song)|Happy Birthday]] - [[Altered Images]]\n\n\"[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]\" - [[Visage (band)|Visage]] - [[Steve Strange]] appears in this episode playing himself performing the number on stage at The Blitz\n\n\"[[Souvenir (song)|Souvenir]]\" - [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]]\n\n\"We Are All Prostitutes\" - [[The Pop Group]]\n\n\"[[(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang]]\" - [[Heaven 17]]\n\n\"I Hear You Now\" - [[Jon and Vangelis]]\n\n\"[[Geno (song)|Geno]]\" - [[Dexys Midnight Runners]]\n\n\"[[Gertcha]]\" - [[Chas & Dave]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\nDVD - Ashes To Ashes Series 1, 2008, Kudos\n\n{{Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes}}\n\n[[Category:2008 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Life on Mars (franchise)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=July 2016}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Episode 2 (''Ashes to Ashes'' series 1)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title = Episode 2\n| series = [[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]\n| caption =\n| image =\n| series_no = 1\n| episode = 2\n| guests=\n| airdate = {{Start date|2008|2|14|df=yes}}\n| length = 60 minutes\n| writer = [[Ashley Pharoah]]\n| director = [[Jonny Campbell]]\n| photographer = Julian Court\n| editor = Jamie Pearson\n| music = Edmund Butt\n| producer = [[Beth Willis (producer)|Beth Willis]]\n| episode_list = List of Ashes to Ashes episodes\n| prev = [[Episode 1 (Ashes to Ashes series 1)|Episode 1]]\n| next = Episode 3\n|}}\n\n'''\"Episode 2\"''' is the second episode of series 1 of the [[British people|British]] [[science fiction]]/[[police procedural]] [[drama]] [[television]] series ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]'', which is the sequel to ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]''.

The episode was written by Jake Coburn and directed by [[Lee Shallat-Chemel]]. It aired on Monday, October 25, 2010 on the [[The CW Television Network|CW]].\n\n''Easy J'' focuses on the return of [[Jenny Humphrey]] ([[Taylor Momsen]]) and the consequences she faces from her short visit to Manhattan while [[Blair Waldorf]] ([[Leighton Meester]]) hunts her down in the hope of maintaining her social order and eschewing any possible attempts by [[Chuck Bass]] ([[Ed Westwick]]) to ruin her at the same time. [[Serena van der Woodsen]] ([[Blake Lively]]) runs into unfortunate circumstances when she discovers that her new flame is also her college professor.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode begins with a Blair Waldorf dream sequence of ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'' with her as [[Audrey Hepburn]] being attacked. However, unlike in the film, her attacker is, strangely, a blond female.\n\nBlair awakes to find Serena with an unmade bed, messy hair, and adorning the same clothes from the previous day. Serena admits to having spent the night with \"The Cab Stealer.\", Colin Forrester ([[Samuel Page|Sam Page]]). However, they spent the night talking of pop art in lieu of sleeping together. Serena says she refuses to be one of the women he hands off in a cab every morning.\n\nBlair explains her dream to Serena, who believes it to be about recently becoming Chuck's active target. Blair is unsure, however, and wonders aloud why the attacker would be female.\n\nAfter spending the night with Nate ([[Chace Crawford]]), Juliet Sharp ([[Katie Cassidy]]) departs early so as \"not to be late to class.\" Nate is disappointed, hoping to have spent more time with her. Via phone, Dan ([[Penn Badgley]]) assures him it's probably the truth. As Nate ends his call with Dan, getting in line to visit his Dad in prison, he spots a sheepish Juliet.\n\nJenny returns to New York, only to face an angry Blair \u2013 willing to do anything to make \"Little J\" leave town again.\n\nOn her way to class, Serena spots her fling, Colin from the night before while entering the building. Irked, Serena is further thrown off by the revelation that he is her Psychology of Business professor, a fact that threats their relationship.\n\nBlair visits the Van Der Woodsen residence and runs into Jenny. Outraged that Jenny is breaking the rules about being \"banished,\" and after some verbal sparring, Blair grants her \"amnesty 'till midnight\" if Jenny refuses to be seen while in the city. Blair seeks out Chuck at Columbia, after a brief chat with Serena about the Cab Stealer turned Professor. She asks if he knows about Jenny Humphrey's return, and warns him it will damage his reputation as well as hers if the story about Jenny's virginity is outed; however, unknown to Blair, Chuck is responsible for Jenny's return to Manhattan, and remains nonchalant about the possibility of the truth being revealed. After talking to Chuck, Blair assigns her minions to stake-out the Van Der Woodsen residence, in order to make sure Jenny doesn't violate the terms of her Manhattan amnesty.\n\nDan and Eric ([[Connor Paolo]]) find it strange when Jenny declines going out to one of her favorite venues, so she explains to them the terms of the agreement she made with Blair. However, Jenny ultimately reveals to Gossip Girl to whom she lost her virginity, and after a confrontation with both Chuck and Blair, decides to leave town again. At the episode's end, Chuck visits Blair in her apartment, and, after agreeing that the circumstances surrounding their breakup were beyond both their controls, the two agree to end their war, before they both destroy each other.\n\n==Production==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tim Gunn guest stars on Gossip Girl.jpg|thumb|left|180 px| [[Tim Gunn]] (left) on the set of ''Gossip Girl'' with [[Taylor Momsen]].]] -->\n\n===Casting===\n[[Sam Robards]] reprises his role of Howard \"The Captain\" Archibald, making an appearance on the show since the second season episode, ''The Magnificent Archibalds''.

The episode was written by Jake Coburn and directed by [[Lee Shallat-Chemel]]. It aired on Monday, October 25, 2010 on the [[The CW Television Network|CW]].\n\n''Easy J'' focuses on the return of [[Jenny Humphrey]] ([[Taylor Momsen]]) and the consequences she faces from her short visit to Manhattan while [[Blair Waldorf]] ([[Leighton Meester]]) hunts her down in the hope of maintaining her social order and eschewing any possible attempts by [[Chuck Bass]] ([[Ed Westwick]]) to ruin her at the same time. [[Serena van der Woodsen]] ([[Blake Lively]]) runs into unfortunate circumstances when she discovers that her new flame is also her college professor.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode begins with a Blair Waldorf dream sequence of ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'' with her as [[Audrey Hepburn]] being attacked. However, unlike in the film, her attacker is, strangely, a blond female.\n\nBlair awakes to find Serena with an unmade bed, messy hair, and adorning the same clothes from the previous day. Serena admits to having spent the night with \"The Cab Stealer.\", Colin Forrester ([[Samuel Page|Sam Page]]). However, they spent the night talking of pop art in lieu of sleeping together. Serena says she refuses to be one of the women he hands off in a cab every morning.\n\nBlair explains her dream to Serena, who believes it to be about recently becoming Chuck's active target. Blair is unsure, however, and wonders aloud why the attacker would be female.\n\nAfter spending the night with Nate ([[Chace Crawford]]), Juliet Sharp ([[Katie Cassidy]]) departs early so as \"not to be late to class.\" Nate is disappointed, hoping to have spent more time with her. Via phone, Dan ([[Penn Badgley]]) assures him it's probably the truth. As Nate ends his call with Dan, getting in line to visit his Dad in prison, he spots a sheepish Juliet.\n\nJenny returns to New York, only to face an angry Blair \u2013 willing to do anything to make \"Little J\" leave town again.\n\nOn her way to class, Serena spots her fling, Colin from the night before while entering the building. Irked, Serena is further thrown off by the revelation that he is her Psychology of Business professor, a fact that threats their relationship.\n\nBlair visits the Van Der Woodsen residence and runs into Jenny. Outraged that Jenny is breaking the rules about being \"banished,\" and after some verbal sparring, Blair grants her \"amnesty 'till midnight\" if Jenny refuses to be seen while in the city. Blair seeks out Chuck at Columbia, after a brief chat with Serena about the Cab Stealer turned Professor. She asks if he knows about Jenny Humphrey's return, and warns him it will damage his reputation as well as hers if the story about Jenny's virginity is outed; however, unknown to Blair, Chuck is responsible for Jenny's return to Manhattan, and remains nonchalant about the possibility of the truth being revealed. After talking to Chuck, Blair assigns her minions to stake-out the Van Der Woodsen residence, in order to make sure Jenny doesn't violate the terms of her Manhattan amnesty.\n\nDan and Eric ([[Connor Paolo]]) find it strange when Jenny declines going out to one of her favorite venues, so she explains to them the terms of the agreement she made with Blair. However, Jenny ultimately reveals to Gossip Girl to whom she lost her virginity, and after a confrontation with both Chuck and Blair, decides to leave town again. At the episode's end, Chuck visits Blair in her apartment, and, after agreeing that the circumstances surrounding their breakup were beyond both their controls, the two agree to end their war, before they both destroy each other.\n\n==Production==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tim Gunn guest stars on Gossip Girl.jpg|thumb|left|180 px| [[Tim Gunn]] (left) on the set of ''Gossip Girl'' with [[Taylor Momsen]].]] -->\n\n===Casting===\n[[Sam Robards]] reprises his role of Howard \"The Captain\" Archibald, making an appearance on the show since the second season episode, ''The Magnificent Archibalds''.

The companion episode was slated as the third-season premiere and aired on March 31, 2010 (\"Father Goes West\").\n\n==Summary==\nThanks to the [[State Department]], Mary's new \"best friend\" is a feisty [[South American]] woman, Francesca Leandra (guest star Angelica Castro): a [[revolutionary]] leader whom the U.S. government has agreed to hide in the states while they help agitate her countrymen toward rebelling against their dictator. To stir the pot even more, the CIA is quietly spreading the word that Francesca, who is beloved by the working-class citizens, has been captured by El Presidente's men and is being tortured. Her country of origin is never specified.\n\nMary and Francesca are established in a mansion in [[Albuquerque, NM|Albuquerque]] with top-of-the-line security and every possible amenity. Francesca, fearing that her people will discover that she was living in luxury while they suffered under El Presidente, talks the State Department liaison into allowing her to move into a house in one of Albuquerque's barrios (Latin/Hispanic slum). When Marshall and Mary confront her about this, citing the drug-dealing gang across the street from Francesca's new 'safe' house, Francesca insists they are her 'people' and are just like the boys she grew up with in South America. Mary makes a call into APD dispatch and pretends to be an ordinary citizen calling in a disturbance, hoping that a police cruiser driving past will disperse the gang and head off the trouble she senses is coming. The cruiser doesn't come, however, and Mary's instincts are dead-on.\n\nMario, one of the dealers that had come across and flirted with Mary and Francesca earlier, comes back across the street and tries to get the girls to let him in so they can 'party'. Francesca says to ignore him, but Mary knows that won't work. She has already called Bobby Dershowitz to try to get another cruiser to come by; Dershowitz comes himself to try to defuse the situation.  Mary exits the house and pushes Mario off the porch when Dershowitz is becoming outnumbered by Mario's compadres, and when Mario draws, Mary draws her own weapon and is shot in the abdomen. As soon as the shot rings out the dealers scatter, while Dershowitz calls for help on his phone.\n\nMary is rushed to the hospital; she has lost a large volume of blood, is unconscious and goes into cardiac arrest in the ambulance; though she is revived, she does not regain consciousness due to low blood volume. Marshall is the first to arrive as she is being wheeled into emergency, and he pleads with her not to die; after being barred from coming into the trauma room with her, he crumples to the floor in tears as Stan arrives, sobbing that she still wasn't breathing.\n\nJinx, Brandi and Raphael arrive while Marshall is talking to Stan about how bad the situation was at the house, fearing the worst when they see how upset Marshall is. After assuring them that Mary is alive, Stan arranges for a private waiting room with the nursing staff for the family to wait in; Francesca arrives with State Department escorts, determined to wait until she knows Mary will be all right before they relocate her. The State Department liaison pulls Stan out of the waiting room and proceeds to blame Mary for the need to relocate Francesca; he starts to promise that he will destroy Mary's career when Stan loses his temper and shoves the man into an empty hospital room, exploding that Mary might die because they moved Francesca into that neighborhood against WITSEC recommendation and that a complaint has already been filed by WITSEC about the incident.\n\nMarshall refuses to speak with Francesca, blaming her for the incident, and Stan leaves to work with the police to track down the shooter. The doctor advises the family and Marshall that Mary has lost too much blood to continue surgery, and that her condition must be stabilized before they can continue. Stan calls from the task force headquarters to find out why Francesca hasn't given a statement, even though she was a witness; when Marshall challenges her about it, she admits to Marshall that she will not give a statement because she thinks Mary brought the shooting on herself by calling the cops, calling it an overreaction. She also claims that Mario didn't shoot Mary, an assertion which is later proven by ballistic evidence.\n\nThe leader of the drug-dealing gang is brought in for questioning, and Marshall tries to tempt him into providing information in exchange for WITSEC relocation:  a whole new life, new identity, a chance to do anything he's ever wanted and going anyplace he's dreamed of seeing. The dealer refuses to give information, and the investigation begins to stall. Stan and Marshall return to the hospital to wait while Francesca is finally relocated by the State Department, unable to wait any longer. The last shot of the episode shows Mary in intensive care.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Originally slated to be the first of a two-part season finale, the creators decided to end the season with this episode and leave Mary's fate in suspense.\n* This episode pulled 4.44 million views in the [[Nielsen ratings]].\n\n==Cast==\n{|\n|-\n|[[Mary McCormack]] &nbsp; || Marshal Mary Shannon\n|-\n|[[Fred Weller]] || Marshal Marshall Mann\n|-\n|[[Paul Ben-Victor]] || Chief Stan McQueen\n|}\n\n===Supporting cast===\n{|\n|-\n|[[Nichole Hiltz]] || Brandi Shannon\n|-\n|[[Lesley Ann Warren]] || Jinx Shannon\n|-\n|[[Holly Maples]] || Eleanor Prince\n|-\n|[[Todd Williams (actor)|Todd Williams]] || Detective Robert Dershowitz\n|-\n|[[Cristi\u00e1n de la Fuente]] || Raphael Ramirez\n|-\n|[[Joshua Malina]] || Peter Alpert\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1421185/ IMDb - ''In Plain Sight'' - \"Don't Cry for me, Albuquerque\"]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091228155457/http://www.usanetwork.com/series/inplainsight/theshow/episodeguide/episodes/s2_dontcryforme/ ''In Plain Sight'' - Episode Guide: Don't Cry For Me, Albuquerque]\n\n{{In Plain Sight}}\n\n[[Category:In Plain Sight episodes]]\n[[Category:2009 American television episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Don't Cry for Me, Albuquerque\n| series       = [[In Plain Sight]]\n| season       = 2\n| episode      = 15 (#27 overall)\n| airdate      = Part 1 - August 9th, 2009<br>Part 2 - March 31, 2010 (\"Father Goes West\")\n| production   = 2_215\n| writer       = Jessica Butler\n| director     = [[Michael Morris (director)|Michael Morris]]\n| music        = \n| photographer = \n| guests       = [[J.C.

For their first six years, the league had teams in markets not covered by either the [[Arena Football League]] or its developmental league, [[AF2]], however, that changed briefly with their expansion into AFL markets such as [[Atlanta]], [[Denver]], and Los Angeles, and AF2 markets such as [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]] and [[Houston]]. [[Green Bay Packers]] head coach [[Matt LaFleur]], [[Buffalo Bills]] running back [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]], [[New Orleans Saints]] quarterback [[John Fourcade]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] Super Bowl running back [[Bam Morris]], all played in the NIFL.  The league folded in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n==History==\nThe NIFL, based in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], was founded by Carolyn Shiver. The league started operations in 2001, with many teams coming from [[Indoor Football League (1999\u20132000)|Indoor Football League]] being bought the previous year and folding operations. In 2002, the league added in the teams from the [[Indoor Professional Football League]]. 2003 was the most successful year for the league as 24 teams played a mostly complete schedule, with few cancellations.\n\nBefore the 2005 season,  nine teams left the league to form [[United Indoor Football]].  That same year, the [[Intense Football League]] ceased operations and four teams from there joined the league.  Those teams however, left the league before the 2006 season started.\n\nFor the 2005 season, the NIFL had an agreement with NFL to handle referee assignment and training.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3314250 | title=NFL to NIFL: No Deal |date=22 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe 2006 season, was the most chaotic for the league to that point.  Ten expansion teams were added to the league, but nine of them had problems that reflected badly on the league.  The most notable situation was the owner of the [[Montgomery Maulers]] firing the entire team.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2006-04-28-nifl-maulers-dispute_x.htm NIFL squad in Montgomery fired after salary dispute]</ref> None of the ten expansion teams returned to the league for the next season.\n\nThe 2007 season started with the addition of several league-owned expansion teams, primarily to supplement games with the returning teams.  However, the teams were all poorly funded and had problems fielding competitive squads. On May 11, 2007, the ten independently-owned franchises banded together and left the NIFL. These ten teams played against each other as independents for the remainder of the 2007 season. Of these teams, seven left the league for other leagues. The rest of the teams folded.<ref>[http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3468103 ''State Of The Marshals''], press release, May 11th 2007</ref> No playoffs were held at the end of the season. The [[San Diego Shockwave]] were declared the official league champion, however, an unofficial championship game was played by the [[Wyoming Cavalry]] and [[Fayetteville Guard]], with Fayetteville winning.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fayetteville Guard To Host Wyoming Cavalry In Indoor Football Championship Bowl|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3499540|accessdate=30 April 2014|date=July 2, 2007}}</ref> The league then officially folded prior to the 2008 season.\n\nIn 2016, a new website announced that the league operations were relaunched by Carolyn Shiver with announced goal of bringing 34 teams into the former AFL markets starting in the 2017 season. As of June 2016, the league was looking for local team ownership under the league's business model.<ref>{{cite web

Drillers]]\n\nThe '''National Indoor Football League''' ('''NIFL''') was a [[professional]] indoor [[American football|football]] league in the United States. For their first six years, the league had teams in markets not covered by either the [[Arena Football League]] or its developmental league, [[AF2]], however, that changed briefly with their expansion into AFL markets such as [[Atlanta]], [[Denver]], and Los Angeles, and AF2 markets such as [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]] and [[Houston]]. [[Green Bay Packers]] head coach [[Matt LaFleur]], [[Buffalo Bills]] running back [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]], [[New Orleans Saints]] quarterback [[John Fourcade]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] Super Bowl running back [[Bam Morris]], all played in the NIFL.  The league folded in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n==History==\nThe NIFL, based in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], was founded by Carolyn Shiver. The league started operations in 2001, with many teams coming from [[Indoor Football League (1999\u20132000)|Indoor Football League]] being bought the previous year and folding operations. In 2002, the league added in the teams from the [[Indoor Professional Football League]]. 2003 was the most successful year for the league as 24 teams played a mostly complete schedule, with few cancellations.\n\nBefore the 2005 season,  nine teams left the league to form [[United Indoor Football]].  That same year, the [[Intense Football League]] ceased operations and four teams from there joined the league.  Those teams however, left the league before the 2006 season started.\n\nFor the 2005 season, the NIFL had an agreement with NFL to handle referee assignment and training.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3314250 | title=NFL to NIFL: No Deal |date=22 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe 2006 season, was the most chaotic for the league to that point.  Ten expansion teams were added to the league, but nine of them had problems that reflected badly on the league.  The most notable situation was the owner of the [[Montgomery Maulers]] firing the entire team.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2006-04-28-nifl-maulers-dispute_x.htm NIFL squad in Montgomery fired after salary dispute]</ref> None of the ten expansion teams returned to the league for the next season.\n\nThe 2007 season started with the addition of several league-owned expansion teams, primarily to supplement games with the returning teams.  However, the teams were all poorly funded and had problems fielding competitive squads. On May 11, 2007, the ten independently-owned franchises banded together and left the NIFL. These ten teams played against each other as independents for the remainder of the 2007 season. Of these teams, seven left the league for other leagues. The rest of the teams folded.<ref>[http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3468103 ''State Of The Marshals''], press release, May 11th 2007</ref> No playoffs were held at the end of the season. The [[San Diego Shockwave]] were declared the official league champion, however, an unofficial championship game was played by the [[Wyoming Cavalry]] and [[Fayetteville Guard]], with Fayetteville winning.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fayetteville Guard To Host Wyoming Cavalry In Indoor Football Championship Bowl|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3499540|accessdate=30 April 2014|date=July 2, 2007}}</ref> The league then officially folded prior to the 2008 season.\n\nIn 2016, a new website announced that the league operations were relaunched by Carolyn Shiver with announced goal of bringing 34 teams into the former AFL markets starting in the 2017 season. As of June 2016, the league was looking for local team ownership under the league's business model.<ref>{{cite web
