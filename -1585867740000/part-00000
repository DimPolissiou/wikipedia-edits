Freeform primarily broadcasts programming geared toward teenagers and young adults \u2013 with some programming skewing toward young women \u2013 in the 14\u201334 age range, a target demographic designated by the channel as \"becomers\". Its programming includes contemporary [[Broadcast syndication|off-network syndicated]] reruns and original series, feature films, and [[television film|made-for-TV original movies]].\n\nSince the network was launched on April 29, 1977, it has undergone different changes to its programming format and naming under its four different owners. The network was [[Television networks preceding Freeform|founded]] as a [[Religious broadcasting|religious]] channel, the '''CBN Satellite Service'''\u2014an extension of televangelist [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network]]. It evolved into a family-focused entertainment network in 1981, and was spun off into a for-profit company known as [[International Family Entertainment]] (IFE) in 1990, eventually becoming known as '''The Family Channel'''. As a condition of the spin-off, the channel was contractually required to maintain airings of ''[[The 700 Club]]'' and an annual [[telethon]] on the last Sunday in January; these conditions have applied to all future owners of the channel.\n\nIn 1997, IFE and The Family Channel were acquired by a joint venture between [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] and [[Saban Entertainment]], resulting in its re-branding as the '''Fox Family Channel''' a year later. The new owners wanted to re-position the network towards younger viewers as a companion for their popular [[Fox Kids]] programming block. After the network began to struggle as a result of their changes, the venture was sold to Disney in October 2001, in a sale that also included Saban; the channel altered its name to '''ABC Family''' one month later on November 10, 2001.<ref name=FoxFamilySell>{{cite news|title=News Corp. and Haim Saban Reach Agreement to Sell Fox Family Worldwide to Disney for $5.3 Billion|url=http://www.saban.com/html/press/010723.html|website=Saban Entertainment|date=July 23, 2001|access-date=February 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202154922/http://saban.com/html/press/010723.html|archivedate=February 2, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"SaleToDisney\">{{cite news|title=Fox Family costs Mouse less cheese in final deal|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/fox-family-costs-mouse-less-cheese-in-final-deal-1117854788/|author=Carl DiOrio|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=October 24, 2001|access-date=August 13, 2009}}</ref> On October 6, 2015, Disney\u2013ABC Television Group announced that the network would rebrand as '''Freeform''', officially adopting that name on January 12, 2016.<ref name=\"variety-freeformrebrand\">{{cite news|title=ABC Family to Rebrand Network \u2018Freeform\u2019 in January|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/abc-family-freeform-rebranding-network-1201610697/|author=Elizabeth Wagmeister|periodical=Variety|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=October 6, 2015|accessdate=January 23, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"tvnc-freeform\">{{cite web|title=ABC Family Changing Name To Freeform|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/88982/abc-family-changing-name-to-freeform|author=David Bauder|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=October 6, 2015|access-date=October 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Deadline12102015>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/12/abc-family-name-change-freeform-pretty-little-liars-shadowhunters-1201664640/|title=ABC Family Name-Change To Coincide With 'Pretty Little Liars' & 'Shadowhunters' Premieres|last=Petski|first=Denise|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 10, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs of January 2016, Freeform is available to 92 million households in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}</ref> The network's president reports to the chairman of ABC Television Studios and ABC Entertainment.\n\n==History==\n{{For|a detailed history of the channel under its current and past identities|History of Freeform (TV channel)}}\n\n===Early history (1977\u20131998)===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}\nThe channel traces its origins to the launch of the CBN Satellite Service (CBN Satellite Network), an arm of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN), on April 29, 1977. Focusing mainly on [[Religious broadcasting|religious programming]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/christianbro.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Christian Broadcasting Network|website=www.museum.tv|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref> the channel was notable for being one of the first cable channels to distribute its signal nationally through [[communications satellite|satellite]] transmission (the third overall, as the method had been first pioneered by [[HBO]] in September 1975) as well as the first national basic cable-originated network ([[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] \u2013 which became the second cable channel in the U.S. to begin transmitting via satellite in December 1976 \u2013 originated as a feed of [[television station|broadcast television station]] WTCG (now [[WPCH-TV]]) in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]). The channel changed its name to the '''CBN Cable Network''' on September 1, 1981, and adopted a more secular programming format featuring a mix of family-oriented series and films while retaining some religious programs from various [[televangelism|televangelists]] (mirroring the format used by CBN's [[Independent station (North America)|independent television stations]] of that time). Around this time, the channel began airing a late night block of classic family oriented shows like [[You Bet Your Life]] with [[Groucho Marx]], [[I Married Joan]], and [[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]. This block of programming is said by some to have inspired the 1985 debut of the [[Nick at Nite]] classic TV block on [[Nickelodeon]]. By this point, its carriage grew to 10.9 million homes with a cable television subscription.\n\nOn January 1, 1988, the word \"Family\" was incorporated into the channel's name to better reflect its programming format, [[rebranding]] as '''The CBN Family Channel'''. By 1990, the network had grown too profitable to remain under the Christian Broadcasting Network umbrella without endangering the ministry's [[non-profit]] status.

An extensive campaign to promote the rebrand kicked off on the date of the announcement and encompassed the network's popular [[13 Nights of Halloween]] and [[25 Days of Christmas]] blocks during the fourth quarter of that year.<ref name=\"deadline-freeform\"/><ref name=\"TVI-freeform\"/> The new name \u2013 which was chosen among 3,000 proposals, with some initial consideration of retaining \"ABC\" in the name \u2013 was necessitated after an audience survey that sampled opinions of regular ABC Family viewers as well those who watched the channel on an infrequent basis, revealed that although regular viewers understood the network's youth-skewing concept, non-frequent viewers perceived the channel as still being more of a \"wholesome\" family-oriented network.<ref name=\"variety-freeformrebrand\"/><ref name=\"thewrap-freeform\"/>\n\nAt the [[Television Critics Association]] Winter Press Tour on January 9, 2016, in addressing the reasoning behind the name (which had been derided by some viewers on [[social media]] and news websites reporting on the pending rebrand), ABC Family president Tom Ascheim noted that while it does not mind the \"wholesome\" perception, it does \"not necessarily represent\" the network.<ref name=\"thewrap-freeform\"/> While it was rumored that the sale of the network from International Family Entertainment to Fox contained a stipulation that the channel must contain \"Family\" in its name in perpetuity, regardless of its owner (as supported by the failed proposal to relaunch the channel as \"XYZ\"), in initially announcing the channel's rebranding, Ascheim clarified that this was merely an [[urban legend]] as no such clause has been corroborated to have existed.<ref name=\"deadline-freeform\"/><ref name=\"TVI-freeform\"/>\n\nThe rebranding as Freeform took effect on January 12, 2016, coinciding with the premiere of the second half of ''[[Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|Pretty Little Liars]]''{{'}} [[Pretty Little Liars (season 6)|sixth season]], and the series premiere of ''[[Shadowhunters]]'', a fantasy drama based on [[Cassandra Clare]]'s novel series ''[[The Mortal Instruments]]''.<ref name=Deadline12102015/> As Freeform, the channel plans to double the amount of original programming on its schedule through 2020; however, despite firmly focusing on its specified target audience, Freeform would continue to carry much of the existing programming it aired beforehand under the ABC Family brand, including family-oriented series and films, and its annual ''25 Days of Christmas'' and ''13 Days of Halloween'' events.<ref name=\"deadline-freeform\">{{cite web|title=ABC Family To Be Renamed As Freeform|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/abc-family-freeform-new-name-1201567915/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=October 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"TVI-freeform\">{{cite web|title=Disney's ABC Family to Rename Itself \"Freeform\" This January|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/45148/abc-family-to-rename-itself-freeform-this-january/|author=Michael Schneider|website=TVInsider.com|publisher=TV Insider LLC|date=October 6, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"thewrap-freeform\">{{cite news|title=Inside ABC Family's Dramatic Name-Change Decision|url=https://www.thewrap.com/inside-abc-family-freeform-name-change-decision/#sthash.X0JZhL8o.dpuf|author=Daniel Holloway|website=[[The Wrap]]|date=October 6, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] views expressed during the programs conflict with the [[Cultural liberalism|culturally progressive]]/adult content of some of the channel's secular programming, Freeform also retained ''The 700 Club'' and ''The 700 Club Interactive'' (along with CBN's day-long telethon on the last Sunday in January), as network executives were not able to reach an agreement with Pat Robertson to [[Buyout|buy out]] CBN's time-buy contract with the channel (Disney\u2013ABC offered to pay $42 million \u2013 roughly the same amount that the ministry earned in revenue during 2015 from syndication fees for ''The 700 Club'' and various related productions \u2013 to terminate the agreement with the Christian Broadcasting Network, though Robertson stipulated a higher payout that Ascheim deemed \"astronomical\" in comparison to its actual value).<ref name=\"tnr-longhistory\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=ABC Family Will Keep \u2018The 700 Club\u2019 When it Becomes Freeform|url=http://www.thewrap.com/abc-family-will-keep-the-700-club-when-it-becomes-freeform/|author=Daniel Holloway|website=The Wrap|date=January 9, 2016|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=As ABC Family Becomes Freeform, Here's Why It's Still Stuck with 'The 700 Club'|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/62330/as-abc-family-becomes-freeform-heres-why-its-still-stuck-with-the-700-club/|website=TV Insider|publisher=NTVB Media|date=January 4, 2016|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ABC Family, No Matter What It Calls Itself, Can\u2019t Get Rid of Pat Robertson\u2019s The 700 Club|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/pat-robertsons-700-club-will-be-on-forever.html|author=E.

The channel previously aired ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' 1994\u201397 Saget episodes in 2006\u201310 and Tom Bergeron episodes in 2010\u201314, and ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' in 2002\u201310.\n\nThe channel also produces some original programming, which ({{as of|March 2020|c=y}}) includes shows such as ''[[The Bold Type]]'',  ''[[Grown-ish]]'', ''[[Good Trouble (TV series)|Good Trouble]]'', ''[[Siren (TV series)|Siren]]'', ''[[Party of Five (2020 TV series)|Party of Five]]'', ''[[Everything's Gonna Be Okay]]'' and ''[[Motherland: Fort Salem]]''. Until the debuts of ''[[Melissa & Joey]]'' (which ran from 2010 to 2015), and ''[[Baby Daddy]]'' (which ran from 2012 to 2017), Freeform (as ABC Family) had long faced minimal success with its original sitcoms, with its drama series often outlasting its comedies.\n\nFreeform airs its original drama series on Monday and/or Tuesday nights, and since 2011 (beginning under the former ABC Family brand), has aired its comedy series on Wednesdays. The channel airs first-run episodes of its original series mainly between January and August, with films generally airing in their place during prime time on the aforementioned nights from September to December (the only exception since 2010, have been annual Halloween episodes of ''Pretty Little Liars'' that air as part of the 13 Nights of Halloween in October as well as the debut of the first third of season one of ''[[Ravenswood (TV series)|Ravenswood]]'' in October 2013), the first ten episodes (or as few as eight for new series) of each season of its original programs air consecutively, the season's remaining episodes are broadcast following a hiatus of four to six months. Dating back to its existence as ABC Family, Freeform typically only reruns episodes of its original series in a marathon that airs prior to a season premiere, mid-season or season finale, or other special occasion, though the channel does air encore presentations of its shows that typically preempt programs that normally air at 7:00 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time during the rest of the week on these nights (with the previous week's episode airing in the former time slot prior to the newest episode and a same-night encore of the newest episode on the evening of an episode premiere in the latter time slot).\n\n===Films===\n{{no footnotes|section, except for one footnote,|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{Main|List of Freeform original films}}\nFreeform airs movies in prime time on Thursday and Friday nights (and if no original series are scheduled, Mondays, Tuesdays and/or Wednesdays as well), along with a day-long schedule of films on weekends from as early as 7:00&nbsp;a.m. (sometimes later, such as around 7:30 a.m. or 8:00 a.m.) to as late as 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturdays and Sundays. \n\nAs of 2019, Freeform features a mix of animated and live action films from [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[20th Century Studios]].\n\nFreeform also shows sub-runs (runs of films that have already received broadcast or syndicated television airings) of theatrical films from [[Sony Pictures]], [[Universal Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[DreamWorks Pictures]].\n\nFreeform has also purchased the cable television rights to many film series, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series (which ABC and Disney Channel also hold rights to), 2004's ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'' (and the direct to video sequels, ''[[Another Cinderella Story]]'', ''[[A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song]]'', and ''[[A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits]]'') and most recently the ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' film series (after securing rights to the 2009 made-for-DVD release ''[[Legally Blondes]]'').\n\nThe channel also produces its own original made-for-TV movies (targeting a slightly older audience than those aired by sister network Disney Channel); some of Freeform's most popular original movies include ''[[Night of the Twisters (film)|Night of the Twisters]]'' (the channel's first original movie, which premiered in 1996 during its existence as The Family Channel), ''[[Holiday in Handcuffs]]'', the ''[[Au Pair (film)|Au Pair]]'' trilogy, ''[[Ice Angel]]'', and ''[[Cyberbully (2011 film)|Cyberbully]]'' (which premiered on the channel under either the Fox Family or ABC Family identities). As Freeform, the channel has had original movies such as Angry Angel, The Truth About Christmas, Life-Size 2, No Sleep 'Til Christmas, Turkey Drop, and Ghosting: The Spirit of Christmas. ABC Family, the channel has also recently been generating high levels of viewers with its weekend movie events; the \"Harry Potter Weekend\" block in July 2009 generated some of the highest levels of viewers for its weekend events for the year to date. ABC Family's airing of ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' on October 10, 2014, was one of the channel's most watched telecasts for a single film, being seen by nearly 1.9 million viewers.\n\nFreeform is also becoming known for airing previews of upcoming movies, as it has done for ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]],'' and ''[[Stardust (2007 film)|Stardust]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Triple-Feature Weekend on ABC Family Includes OotP Sneak Peeks|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/6/7/harry-potter-triple-feature-weekend-on-abc-family-includes-ootp-sneak-peeks|website=The Leaky Cauldron|date=July 7, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe channel has also aired select Disney Channel Original Movies in recent years, including the 2008 movie ''[[Camp Rock]]'' and the 2011 films ''[[Lemonade Mouth (film)|Lemonade Mouth]]'' and ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]'', which are also three of only four Disney Channel movies to air domestically on a non-Disney Channel branded network. (''[[Cadet Kelly]]'' is the other, having aired on ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' in 2002.) This has become somewhat more prevalent since the channel's January 2016 rebranding to Freeform, which has also seen the channel air such popular Disney Channel films as ''[[High School Musical]]''.\n\n===Sports===\n{{See also|Fox Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball on ESPN|Major League Baseball on TBS}}\nFrom 2000 to 2001, Fox Family aired a weekly [[Major League Baseball]] game on [[Thursday Night Baseball|Thursday nights]] during the league's regular season (a game that had previously aired nationwide on [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] from 1997 to 1999), as well as select [[Division Series]] games. As part of its purchase of Fox Family, in addition to that game, Disney acquired the MLB cable television rights that were also held by Fox Family's then-sister channel [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]. ESPN assumed the production responsibilities for the two game packages beginning with the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002 MLB season]], although the game telecasts remained on ABC Family for one additional year, before ESPN struck a deal to move those playoff games to its flagship network starting [[2003 Major League Baseball season|the following year]] (although the games aired on Disney-owned networks, Fox kept the exclusive negotiation to renew the contract after the [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]] season; Fox chose not to renew their rights to the Division Series, which went to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] as part of its [[MLB on TBS|new baseball contract]]).

It has since expanded this holiday programming, adding made-for-television and theatrically-released movies, a litany of Rankin-Bass sequels (this was complicated somewhat because the broadcast rights of some of the original specials, including ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', were still owned by CBS), and other original programming to create \"The 25 Days of Christmas\".

Freeform primarily broadcasts programming geared toward teenagers and young adults \u2013 with some programming skewing toward young women \u2013 in the 14\u201334 age range, a target demographic designated by the channel as \"becomers\". Its programming includes contemporary [[Broadcast syndication|off-network syndicated]] reruns and original series, feature films, and [[television film|made-for-TV original movies]].\n\nSince the network was launched on April 29, 1977, it has undergone different changes to its programming format and naming under its four different owners. The network was [[Television networks preceding Freeform|founded]] as a [[Religious broadcasting|religious]] channel, the '''CBN Satellite Service'''\u2014an extension of televangelist [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network]]. It evolved into a family-focused entertainment network in 1981, and was spun off into a for-profit company known as [[International Family Entertainment]] (IFE) in 1990, eventually becoming known as '''The Family Channel'''. As a condition of the spin-off, the channel was contractually required to maintain airings of ''[[The 700 Club]]'' and an annual [[telethon]] on the last Sunday in January; these conditions have applied to all future owners of the channel.\n\nIn 1997, IFE and The Family Channel were acquired by a joint venture between [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] and [[Saban Entertainment]], resulting in its re-branding as the '''Fox Family Channel''' a year later. The new owners wanted to re-position the network towards younger viewers as a companion for their popular [[Fox Kids]] programming block. After the network began to struggle as a result of their changes, the venture was sold to Disney in October 2001, in a sale that also included Saban; the channel altered its name to '''ABC Family''' one month later on November 10, 2001.<ref name=FoxFamilySell>{{cite news|title=News Corp. and Haim Saban Reach Agreement to Sell Fox Family Worldwide to Disney for $5.3 Billion|url=http://www.saban.com/html/press/010723.html|website=Saban Entertainment|date=July 23, 2001|access-date=February 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202154922/http://saban.com/html/press/010723.html|archivedate=February 2, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"SaleToDisney\">{{cite news|title=Fox Family costs Mouse less cheese in final deal|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/fox-family-costs-mouse-less-cheese-in-final-deal-1117854788/|author=Carl DiOrio|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=October 24, 2001|access-date=August 13, 2009}}</ref> On October 6, 2015, Disney\u2013ABC Television Group announced that the network would rebrand as '''Freeform''', officially adopting that name on January 12, 2016.<ref name=\"variety-freeformrebrand\">{{cite news|title=ABC Family to Rebrand Network \u2018Freeform\u2019 in January|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/abc-family-freeform-rebranding-network-1201610697/|author=Elizabeth Wagmeister|periodical=Variety|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=October 6, 2015|accessdate=January 23, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"tvnc-freeform\">{{cite web|title=ABC Family Changing Name To Freeform|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/88982/abc-family-changing-name-to-freeform|author=David Bauder|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=October 6, 2015|access-date=October 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Deadline12102015>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/12/abc-family-name-change-freeform-pretty-little-liars-shadowhunters-1201664640/|title=ABC Family Name-Change To Coincide With 'Pretty Little Liars' & 'Shadowhunters' Premieres|last=Petski|first=Denise|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 10, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs of January 2016, Freeform is available to 92 million households in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}</ref> The network's president reports to the chairman of ABC Television Studios and ABC Entertainment.\n\n==History==\n{{For|a detailed history of the channel under its current and past identities|History of Freeform (TV channel)}}\n\n===Early history (1977\u20131998)===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}\nThe channel traces its origins to the launch of the CBN Satellite Service (CBN Satellite Network), an arm of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN), on April 29, 1977. Focusing mainly on [[Religious broadcasting|religious programming]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/christianbro.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Christian Broadcasting Network|website=www.museum.tv|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref> the channel was notable for being one of the first cable channels to distribute its signal nationally through [[communications satellite|satellite]] transmission (the third overall, as the method had been first pioneered by [[HBO]] in September 1975) as well as the first national basic cable-originated network ([[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] \u2013 which became the second cable channel in the U.S. to begin transmitting via satellite in December 1976 \u2013 originated as a feed of [[television station|broadcast television station]] WTCG (now [[WPCH-TV]]) in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]). The channel changed its name to the '''CBN Cable Network''' on September 1, 1981, and adopted a more secular programming format featuring a mix of family-oriented series and films while retaining some religious programs from various [[televangelism|televangelists]] (mirroring the format used by CBN's [[Independent station (North America)|independent television stations]] of that time). Around this time, the channel began airing a late night block of classic family oriented shows like [[You Bet Your Life]] with [[Groucho Marx]], [[I Married Joan]], and [[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]. This block of programming is said by some to have inspired the 1985 debut of the [[Nick at Nite]] classic TV block on [[Nickelodeon]].

An extensive campaign to promote the rebrand kicked off on the date of the announcement and encompassed the network's popular [[13 Nights of Halloween]] and [[25 Days of Christmas]] blocks during the fourth quarter of that year.<ref name=\"deadline-freeform\"/><ref name=\"TVI-freeform\"/> The new name \u2013 which was chosen among 3,000 proposals, with some initial consideration of retaining \"ABC\" in the name \u2013 was necessitated after an audience survey that sampled opinions of regular ABC Family viewers as well those who watched the channel on an infrequent basis, revealed that although regular viewers understood the network's youth-skewing concept, non-frequent viewers perceived the channel as still being more of a \"wholesome\" family-oriented network.<ref name=\"variety-freeformrebrand\"/><ref name=\"thewrap-freeform\"/>\n\nAt the [[Television Critics Association]] Winter Press Tour on January 9, 2016, in addressing the reasoning behind the name (which had been derided by some viewers on [[social media]] and news websites reporting on the pending rebrand), ABC Family president Tom Ascheim noted that while it does not mind the \"wholesome\" perception, it does \"not necessarily represent\" the network.<ref name=\"thewrap-freeform\"/> While it was rumored that the sale of the network from International Family Entertainment to Fox contained a stipulation that the channel must contain \"Family\" in its name in perpetuity, regardless of its owner (as supported by the failed proposal to relaunch the channel as \"XYZ\"), in initially announcing the channel's rebranding, Ascheim clarified that this was merely an [[urban legend]] as no such clause has been corroborated to have existed.<ref name=\"deadline-freeform\"/><ref name=\"TVI-freeform\"/>\n\nThe rebranding as Freeform took effect on January 12, 2016, coinciding with the premiere of the second half of ''[[Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|Pretty Little Liars]]''{{'}} [[Pretty Little Liars (season 6)|sixth season]], and the series premiere of ''[[Shadowhunters]]'', a fantasy drama based on [[Cassandra Clare]]'s novel series ''[[The Mortal Instruments]]''.<ref name=Deadline12102015/> As Freeform, the channel plans to double the amount of original programming on its schedule through 2020; however, despite firmly focusing on its specified target audience, Freeform would continue to carry much of the existing programming it aired beforehand under the ABC Family brand, including family-oriented series and films, and its annual ''25 Days of Christmas'' and ''13 Days of Halloween'' events.<ref name=\"deadline-freeform\">{{cite web|title=ABC Family To Be Renamed As Freeform|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/abc-family-freeform-new-name-1201567915/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=October 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"TVI-freeform\">{{cite web|title=Disney's ABC Family to Rename Itself \"Freeform\" This January|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/45148/abc-family-to-rename-itself-freeform-this-january/|author=Michael Schneider|website=TVInsider.com|publisher=TV Insider LLC|date=October 6, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"thewrap-freeform\">{{cite news|title=Inside ABC Family's Dramatic Name-Change Decision|url=https://www.thewrap.com/inside-abc-family-freeform-name-change-decision/#sthash.X0JZhL8o.dpuf|author=Daniel Holloway|website=[[The Wrap]]|date=October 6, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] views expressed during the programs conflict with the [[Cultural liberalism|culturally progressive]]/adult content of some of the channel's secular programming, Freeform also retained ''The 700 Club'' and ''The 700 Club Interactive'' (along with CBN's day-long telethon on the last Sunday in January), as network executives were not able to reach an agreement with Pat Robertson to [[Buyout|buy out]] CBN's time-buy contract with the channel (Disney\u2013ABC offered to pay $42 million \u2013 roughly the same amount that the ministry earned in revenue during 2015 from syndication fees for ''The 700 Club'' and various related productions \u2013 to terminate the agreement with the Christian Broadcasting Network, though Robertson stipulated a higher payout that Ascheim deemed \"astronomical\" in comparison to its actual value).<ref name=\"tnr-longhistory\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=ABC Family Will Keep \u2018The 700 Club\u2019 When it Becomes Freeform|url=http://www.thewrap.com/abc-family-will-keep-the-700-club-when-it-becomes-freeform/|author=Daniel Holloway|website=The Wrap|date=January 9, 2016|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=As ABC Family Becomes Freeform, Here's Why It's Still Stuck with 'The 700 Club'|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/62330/as-abc-family-becomes-freeform-heres-why-its-still-stuck-with-the-700-club/|website=TV Insider|publisher=NTVB Media|date=January 4, 2016|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ABC Family, No Matter What It Calls Itself, Can\u2019t Get Rid of Pat Robertson\u2019s The 700 Club|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/pat-robertsons-700-club-will-be-on-forever.html|author=E.

The channel previously aired ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' 1994\u201397 Saget episodes in 2006\u201310 and Tom Bergeron episodes in 2010\u201314, and ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' in 2002\u201310.\n\nThe channel also produces some original programming, which ({{as of|March 2020|c=y}}) includes shows such as ''[[The Bold Type]]'',  ''[[Grown-ish]]'', ''[[Good Trouble (TV series)|Good Trouble]]'', ''[[Siren (TV series)|Siren]]'', ''[[Party of Five (2020 TV series)|Party of Five]]'', ''[[Everything's Gonna Be Okay]]'' and ''[[Motherland: Fort Salem]]''. Until the debuts of ''[[Melissa & Joey]]'' (which ran from 2010 to 2015), and ''[[Baby Daddy]]'' (which ran from 2012 to 2017), Freeform (as ABC Family) had long faced minimal success with its original sitcoms, with its drama series often outlasting its comedies.\n\nFreeform airs its original drama series on Monday and/or Tuesday nights, and since 2011 (beginning under the former ABC Family brand), has aired its comedy series on Wednesdays. The channel airs first-run episodes of its original series mainly between January and August, with films generally airing in their place during prime time on the aforementioned nights from September to December (the only exception since 2010, have been annual Halloween episodes of ''Pretty Little Liars'' that air as part of the 13 Nights of Halloween in October as well as the debut of the first third of season one of ''[[Ravenswood (TV series)|Ravenswood]]'' in October 2013), the first ten episodes (or as few as eight for new series) of each season of its original programs air consecutively, the season's remaining episodes are broadcast following a hiatus of four to six months. Dating back to its existence as ABC Family, Freeform typically only reruns episodes of its original series in a marathon that airs prior to a season premiere, mid-season or season finale, or other special occasion, though the channel does air encore presentations of its shows that typically preempt programs that normally air at 7:00 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time during the rest of the week on these nights (with the previous week's episode airing in the former time slot prior to the newest episode and a same-night encore of the newest episode on the evening of an episode premiere in the latter time slot).\n\n===Films===\n{{no footnotes|section, except for one footnote,|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{Main|List of Freeform original films}}\nFreeform airs movies in prime time on Thursday and Friday nights (and if no original series are scheduled, Mondays, Tuesdays and/or Wednesdays as well), along with a day-long schedule of films on weekends from as early as 7:00&nbsp;a.m. (sometimes later, such as around 7:30 a.m. or 8:00 a.m.) to as late as 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturdays and Sundays. \n\nAs of 2019, Freeform features a mix of animated and live action films from [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[20th Century Studios]].\n\nFreeform also shows sub-runs (runs of films that have already received broadcast or syndicated television airings) of theatrical films from [[Sony Pictures]], [[Universal Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[DreamWorks Pictures]].\n\nFreeform has also purchased the cable television rights to many film series, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series (which ABC and Disney Channel also hold rights to), 2004's ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'' (and the direct to video sequels, ''[[Another Cinderella Story]]'', ''[[A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song]]'', and ''[[A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits]]'') and most recently the ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' film series (after securing rights to the 2009 made-for-DVD release ''[[Legally Blondes]]'').\n\nThe channel also produces its own original made-for-TV movies (targeting a slightly older audience than those aired by sister network Disney Channel); some of Freeform's most popular original movies include ''[[Night of the Twisters (film)|Night of the Twisters]]'' (the channel's first original movie, which premiered in 1996 during its existence as The Family Channel), ''[[Holiday in Handcuffs]]'', the ''[[Au Pair (film)|Au Pair]]'' trilogy, ''[[Ice Angel]]'', and ''[[Cyberbully (2011 film)|Cyberbully]]'' (which premiered on the channel under either the Fox Family or ABC Family identities). As Freeform, the channel has had original movies such as Angry Angel, The Truth About Christmas, Life-Size 2, No Sleep 'Til Christmas, Turkey Drop, and Ghosting: The Spirit of Christmas. ABC Family, the channel has also recently been generating high levels of viewers with its weekend movie events; the \"Harry Potter Weekend\" block in July 2009 generated some of the highest levels of viewers for its weekend events for the year to date. ABC Family's airing of ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' on October 10, 2014, was one of the channel's most watched telecasts for a single film, being seen by nearly 1.9 million viewers.\n\nFreeform is also becoming known for airing previews of upcoming movies, as it has done for ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]],'' and ''[[Stardust (2007 film)|Stardust]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Triple-Feature Weekend on ABC Family Includes OotP Sneak Peeks|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/6/7/harry-potter-triple-feature-weekend-on-abc-family-includes-ootp-sneak-peeks|website=The Leaky Cauldron|date=July 7, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe channel has also aired select Disney Channel Original Movies in recent years, including the 2008 movie ''[[Camp Rock]]'' and the 2011 films ''[[Lemonade Mouth (film)|Lemonade Mouth]]'' and ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]'', which are also three of only four Disney Channel movies to air domestically on a non-Disney Channel branded network. (''[[Cadet Kelly]]'' is the other, having aired on ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' in 2002.) This has become somewhat more prevalent since the channel's January 2016 rebranding to Freeform, which has also seen the channel air such popular Disney Channel films as ''[[High School Musical]]''.\n\n===Sports===\n{{See also|Fox Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball on ESPN|Major League Baseball on TBS}}\nFrom 2000 to 2001, Fox Family aired a weekly [[Major League Baseball]] game on [[Thursday Night Baseball|Thursday nights]] during the league's regular season (a game that had previously aired nationwide on [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] from 1997 to 1999), as well as select [[Division Series]] games. As part of its purchase of Fox Family, in addition to that game, Disney acquired the MLB cable television rights that were also held by Fox Family's then-sister channel [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]. ESPN assumed the production responsibilities for the two game packages beginning with the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002 MLB season]], although the game telecasts remained on ABC Family for one additional year, before ESPN struck a deal to move those playoff games to its flagship network starting [[2003 Major League Baseball season|the following year]] (although the games aired on Disney-owned networks, Fox kept the exclusive negotiation to renew the contract after the [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]] season; Fox chose not to renew their rights to the Division Series, which went to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] as part of its [[MLB on TBS|new baseball contract]]).

It has since expanded this holiday programming, adding made-for-television and theatrically-released movies, a litany of Rankin-Bass sequels (this was complicated somewhat because the broadcast rights of some of the original specials, including ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', were still owned by CBS), and other original programming to create \"The 25 Days of Christmas\".

When the constitutive components are molecules, the process is termed [[molecular self-assembly]].\n\n[[File:Molecular self-assembly.gif|255px|thumb|right|[[Atomic force microscopy|AFM]] imaging of self-assembly of 2-aminoterephthalic acid molecules on (104)-oriented [[calcite]].<ref>{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Kling |first=Felix |date=2016 |title=Diffusion and structure formation of molecules on calcite(104) |publisher=[[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]] |url=https://publications.ub.uni-mainz.de/theses/frontdoor.php?source_opus=100002180&la=de}}</ref>]]\n\nSelf-assembly can be classified as either static or dynamic. In ''static'' self-assembly, the ordered state forms as a system approaches [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], reducing its [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].  However, in ''dynamic'' self-assembly, patterns of pre-existing components organized by specific local interactions are not commonly described as \"self-assembled\" by scientists in the associated disciplines. These structures are better described as \"[[self-organization|self-organized]]\", although these terms are often used interchangeably.\n\n== Self-assembly in chemistry and materials science ==\n[[File:DNA nanostructures.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[DNA]] structure at left ([[schematic]] shown) will self-assemble into the structure visualized by [[Atomic force microscope|atomic force microscopy]] at right.]]\nSelf-assembly in the classic sense can be defined as ''the spontaneous and [[Reversible reaction|reversible]] organization of molecular units into ordered structures by [[non-covalent interactions]]''. The first property of a self-assembled system that this definition suggests is the [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|spontaneity]] of the self-assembly process: the interactions responsible for the formation of the self-assembled system act on a strictly local level\u2014in other words, ''the [[nanostructure]] builds itself''.\n\nAlthough self-assembly typically occurs between weakly-interacting species, this organization may be transferred into strongly-bound [[covalent]] systems. An example for this may be observed in the self-assembly of [[polyoxometalate]]s. Evidence suggests that such molecules assemble via a dense-phase type [[Reaction mechanism|mechanism]] whereby small oxometalate ions first [[Molecular self-assembly|assemble non-covalently]] in solution, followed by a [[condensation reaction]] that covalently binds the assembled units.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schreiber |first1=Roy E. |last2=Avram |first2=Liat |last3=Neumann |first3=Ronny |title=Self-Assembly through Noncovalent Preorganization of Reactants: Explaining the Formation of a Polyfluoroxometalate |journal=Chemistry - A European Journal |date=2018 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=369\u2013379 |doi=10.1002/chem.201704287|pmid=29064591 }}</ref> This process can be aided by the introduction of templating agents to control the formed species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miras |first1=H.

An example of this is the phenomenon of electrostatic trapping. In this case an [[electric field]] is applied between two metallic nano-electrodes. The particles present in the environment are polarized by the applied electric field. Because of dipole interaction with the electric field gradient the particles are attracted to the gap between the electrodes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bezryadin|first1=A.|last2=Westervelt|first2=R.|last3=Tinkham|first3=M|title=Self-assembled chains of graphitized carbon nanoparticles|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=1999|doi=10.1063/1.123941|volume=74|issue=18|pages=2699\u20132701|arxiv=cond-mat/9810235|bibcode=1999ApPhL..74.2699B}}</ref> Generalizations of this type approach involving different types of fields, e.g., using magnetic fields, using capillary interactions for particles trapped at interfaces, elastic interactions for particles suspended in liquid crystals have also been reported.\n\nRegardless of the mechanism driving self-assembly, people take self-assembly approaches to materials synthesis to avoid the problem of having to construct materials one building block at a time. Avoiding one-at-a-time approaches is important because the amount of time required to place building blocks into a target structure is prohibitively difficult for structures that have macroscopic size.\n\nOnce materials of macroscopic size can be self-assembled, those materials can find use in many applications. For example, nano-structures such as nano-vacuum gaps are used for storing energy<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Lyon|first2=D.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation|date=2013|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1467\u20131471}}</ref> and nuclear energy conversion.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shinn|first1=E.|title=Nuclear energy conversion with stacks of graphene nanocapacitors|journal=Complexity|date=2012|doi=10.1002/cplx.21427|volume=18|issue=3|pages=24\u201327|bibcode=2013Cmplx..18c..24S}}</ref> Self-assembled [[tunable metamaterial|tunable materials]] are promising candidates for large surface area electrodes in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and organic photovoltaic cells, as well as for microfluidic sensors and filters.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Demortiere|first1=A.|last2=Snezhko|first2=A.|last3=Sapozhnikov|first3=M.|last4=Becker|first4=N.|last5=Proslier|first5=T.|last6=Aranson|first6=I.|title=Self-assembled tunable networks of sticky colloidal particles|journal=Nature Communications|date=2014|doi=10.1038/ncomms4117|pmid=24445324|volume=5|pages=3117|bibcode=2014NatCo...5.3117D}}</ref>\n\n=== Distinctive features ===\nAt this point, one may argue that any chemical reaction driving atoms and molecules to assemble into larger structures, such as [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], could fall into the category of self-assembly. However, there are at least three distinctive features that make self-assembly a distinct concept.\n\n==== Order ====\nFirst, the self-assembled structure must have a higher [[Order (crystal lattice)|order]] than the isolated components, be it a shape or a particular task that the self-assembled entity may perform. This is generally not true in [[chemical reaction]]s, where an ordered state may proceed towards a disordered state depending on thermodynamic parameters.\n\n==== Interactions ====\nThe second important aspect of self-assembly is the predominant role of weak interactions (e.g. [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]], [[capillary action|capillary]], [[Pi-pi interaction|<math>\\pi-\\pi</math>]], [[hydrogen bond]]s, or [[entropic force#Colloids|entropic forces]]) compared to more \"traditional\" covalent, [[ionic bond|ionic]], or [[metallic bond]]s.

In self-assembling structures, the scientist must predict this minimum, not merely place the atoms in the location desired.\n\nAnother characteristic common to nearly all self-assembled systems is their [[thermodynamic stability]]. For self-assembly to take place without intervention of external forces, the process must lead to a lower [[Gibbs free energy]], thus self-assembled structures are thermodynamically more stable than the single, unassembled components. A direct consequence is the general tendency of self-assembled structures to be relatively free of defects. An example is the formation of two-dimensional [[superlattice]]s composed of an orderly arrangement of micrometre-sized [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) spheres, starting from a solution containing the microspheres, in which the solvent is allowed to evaporate slowly in suitable conditions. In this case, the driving force is capillary interaction, which originates from the deformation of the surface of a liquid caused by the presence of floating or submerged particles.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/la00048a054|title=Mechanism of formation of two-dimensional crystals from latex particles on substrates|year=1992|author=Denkov, N.|journal=Langmuir|volume=8|pages=3183\u20133190|last2=Velev|first2=O.|last3=Kralchevski|first3=P.|last4=Ivanov|first4=I.|last5=Yoshimura|first5=H.|last6=Nagayama|first6=K.|issue=12}}</ref>\n\nThese two properties\u2014weak interactions and thermodynamic stability\u2014can be recalled to rationalise another property often found in self-assembled systems: the ''sensitivity to perturbations'' exerted by the external environment. These are small fluctuations that alter thermodynamic variables that might lead to marked changes in the structure and even compromise it, either during or after self-assembly. The weak nature of interactions is responsible for the flexibility of the architecture and allows for rearrangements of the structure in the direction determined by thermodynamics. If fluctuations bring the thermodynamic variables back to the starting condition, the structure is likely to go back to its initial configuration. This leads us to identify one more property of self-assembly, which is generally not observed in materials synthesized by other techniques: ''reversibility''.\n\nSelf-assembly is a process which is easily influenced by external parameters. This feature can make synthesis rather complex because of the need to control many free parameters. Yet self-assembly has the advantage that a large variety of shapes and functions on many length scales can be obtained.<ref name=for>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1071063|date=2002|author=Lehn, Jm|title=Toward self-organization and complex matter|volume=295|issue=5564|pages=2400\u20133|pmid=11923524|journal=Science|bibcode=2002Sci...295.2400L|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/oaiart?codigo=1051047}}</ref>\n\nThe fundamental condition needed for nanoscale building blocks to self-assemble into an ordered structure is the simultaneous presence of long-range repulsive and short-range attractive forces.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020201)41:3<457::AID-ANIE457>3.0.CO;2-W|title=Open-Framework Nickel Succinate, [Ni<sub>7</sub>(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]\u22c52H<sub>2</sub>O: A New Hybrid Material with Three-Dimensional Ni\u2212O\u2212Ni Connectivity|year=2002|author=Forster, Paul M.|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=41|pages=457\u2013459|last2=Cheetham|first2=Anthony K.|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nBy choosing [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] with suitable physicochemical properties, it is possible to exert a fine control on the formation processes that produce complex structures.

When the constitutive components are molecules, the process is termed [[molecular self-assembly]].\n\n[[File:Molecular self-assembly.gif|255px|thumb|right|[[Atomic force microscopy|AFM]] imaging of self-assembly of 2-aminoterephthalic acid molecules on (104)-oriented [[calcite]].<ref>{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Kling |first=Felix |date=2016 |title=Diffusion and structure formation of molecules on calcite(104) |publisher=[[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]] |url=https://publications.ub.uni-mainz.de/theses/frontdoor.php?source_opus=100002180&la=de}}</ref>]]\n\nSelf-assembly can be classified as either static or dynamic. In ''static'' self-assembly, the ordered state forms as a system approaches [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], reducing its [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].  However, in ''dynamic'' self-assembly, patterns of pre-existing components organized by specific local interactions are not commonly described as \"self-assembled\" by scientists in the associated disciplines. These structures are better described as \"[[self-organization|self-organized]]\", although these terms are often used interchangeably.\n\n== Self-assembly in chemistry and materials science ==\n[[File:DNA nanostructures.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[DNA]] structure at left ([[schematic]] shown) will self-assemble into the structure visualized by [[Atomic force microscope|atomic force microscopy]] at right.]]\nSelf-assembly in the classic sense can be defined as ''the spontaneous and [[Reversible reaction|reversible]] organization of molecular units into ordered structures by [[non-covalent interactions]]''. The first property of a self-assembled system that this definition suggests is the [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|spontaneity]] of the self-assembly process: the interactions responsible for the formation of the self-assembled system act on a strictly local level\u2014in other words, ''the [[nanostructure]] builds itself''.\n\nAlthough self-assembly typically occurs between weakly-interacting species, this organization may be transferred into strongly-bound [[covalent]] systems. An example for this may be observed in the self-assembly of [[polyoxometalate]]s. Evidence suggests that such molecules assemble via a dense-phase type [[Reaction mechanism|mechanism]] whereby small oxometalate ions first [[Molecular self-assembly|assemble non-covalently]] in solution, followed by a [[condensation reaction]] that covalently binds the assembled units.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schreiber |first1=Roy E. |last2=Avram |first2=Liat |last3=Neumann |first3=Ronny |title=Self-Assembly through Noncovalent Preorganization of Reactants: Explaining the Formation of a Polyfluoroxometalate |journal=Chemistry - A European Journal |date=2018 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=369\u2013379 |doi=10.1002/chem.201704287|pmid=29064591 }}</ref> This process can be aided by the introduction of templating agents to control the formed species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miras |first1=H.

An example of this is the phenomenon of electrostatic trapping. In this case an [[electric field]] is applied between two metallic nano-electrodes. The particles present in the environment are polarized by the applied electric field. Because of dipole interaction with the electric field gradient the particles are attracted to the gap between the electrodes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bezryadin|first1=A.|last2=Westervelt|first2=R.|last3=Tinkham|first3=M|title=Self-assembled chains of graphitized carbon nanoparticles|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=1999|doi=10.1063/1.123941|volume=74|issue=18|pages=2699\u20132701|arxiv=cond-mat/9810235|bibcode=1999ApPhL..74.2699B}}</ref> Generalizations of this type approach involving different types of fields, e.g., using magnetic fields, using capillary interactions for particles trapped at interfaces, elastic interactions for particles suspended in liquid crystals have also been reported.\n\nRegardless of the mechanism driving self-assembly, people take self-assembly approaches to materials synthesis to avoid the problem of having to construct materials one building block at a time. Avoiding one-at-a-time approaches is important because the amount of time required to place building blocks into a target structure is prohibitively difficult for structures that have macroscopic size.\n\nOnce materials of macroscopic size can be self-assembled, those materials can find use in many applications.

However, there are at least three distinctive features that make self-assembly a distinct concept.\n\n==== Order ====\nFirst, the self-assembled structure must have a higher [[Order (crystal lattice)|order]] than the isolated components, be it a shape or a particular task that the self-assembled entity may perform. This is generally not true in [[chemical reaction]]s, where an ordered state may proceed towards a disordered state depending on thermodynamic parameters.\n\n==== Interactions ====\nThe second important aspect of self-assembly is the predominant role of weak interactions (e.g. [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]], [[capillary action|capillary]], [[Pi-pi interaction|<math>\\pi-\\pi</math>]], [[hydrogen bond]]s, or [[entropic force#Colloids|entropic forces]]) compared to more \"traditional\" covalent, [[ionic bond|ionic]], or [[metallic bond]]s. These weak interactions are important in materials synthesis for two reasons.\n\nFirst, weak interactions take a prominent place in materials, especially in biological systems. For instance, they determine the physical properties of liquids, the [[solubility]] of solids, and the organization of molecules in biological membranes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Israelachvili|first= Jacob N.|title=Intermolecular and Surface Forces|edition=3rd|publisher=Elsevier|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nSecond, in addition to the strength of the interactions, interactions with varying degrees of specificity can control self-assembly. Self-assembly that is mediated by DNA pairing interactions constitutes the interactions of the highest specificity that have been used to drive self-assembly.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones| first1=Matthew R.| last2=Seeman| first2=Nadrian C.| last3=Mirkin| first3=Chad A.|title=Programmable materials and the nature of the DNA bond|journal=Science| volume=347| issue=6224| pages=1260901| doi=10.1126/science.1260901| pmid=25700524| year=2015}}</ref> At the other extreme, the least specific interactions are possibly those provided by [[entropic force#Colloids|\nemergent forces that arise from entropy maximization]].<ref name=\"vanAndersPNAS2014\">{{cite journal|last=van Anders| first=Greg| last2=Klotsa| first2=Daphne| last3=Ahmed| first3=N.

In self-assembling structures, the scientist must predict this minimum, not merely place the atoms in the location desired.\n\nAnother characteristic common to nearly all self-assembled systems is their [[thermodynamic stability]]. For self-assembly to take place without intervention of external forces, the process must lead to a lower [[Gibbs free energy]], thus self-assembled structures are thermodynamically more stable than the single, unassembled components. A direct consequence is the general tendency of self-assembled structures to be relatively free of defects. An example is the formation of two-dimensional [[superlattice]]s composed of an orderly arrangement of micrometre-sized [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) spheres, starting from a solution containing the microspheres, in which the solvent is allowed to evaporate slowly in suitable conditions. In this case, the driving force is capillary interaction, which originates from the deformation of the surface of a liquid caused by the presence of floating or submerged particles.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/la00048a054|title=Mechanism of formation of two-dimensional crystals from latex particles on substrates|year=1992|author=Denkov, N.|journal=Langmuir|volume=8|pages=3183\u20133190|last2=Velev|first2=O.|last3=Kralchevski|first3=P.|last4=Ivanov|first4=I.|last5=Yoshimura|first5=H.|last6=Nagayama|first6=K.|issue=12}}</ref>\n\nThese two properties\u2014weak interactions and thermodynamic stability\u2014can be recalled to rationalise another property often found in self-assembled systems: the ''sensitivity to perturbations'' exerted by the external environment. These are small fluctuations that alter thermodynamic variables that might lead to marked changes in the structure and even compromise it, either during or after self-assembly. The weak nature of interactions is responsible for the flexibility of the architecture and allows for rearrangements of the structure in the direction determined by thermodynamics. If fluctuations bring the thermodynamic variables back to the starting condition, the structure is likely to go back to its initial configuration. This leads us to identify one more property of self-assembly, which is generally not observed in materials synthesized by other techniques: ''reversibility''.\n\nSelf-assembly is a process which is easily influenced by external parameters. This feature can make synthesis rather complex because of the need to control many free parameters. Yet self-assembly has the advantage that a large variety of shapes and functions on many length scales can be obtained.<ref name=for>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1071063|date=2002|author=Lehn, Jm|title=Toward self-organization and complex matter|volume=295|issue=5564|pages=2400\u20133|pmid=11923524|journal=Science|bibcode=2002Sci...295.2400L|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/oaiart?codigo=1051047}}</ref>\n\nThe fundamental condition needed for nanoscale building blocks to self-assemble into an ordered structure is the simultaneous presence of long-range repulsive and short-range attractive forces.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020201)41:3<457::AID-ANIE457>3.0.CO;2-W|title=Open-Framework Nickel Succinate, [Ni<sub>7</sub>(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]\u22c52H<sub>2</sub>O: A New Hybrid Material with Three-Dimensional Ni\u2212O\u2212Ni Connectivity|year=2002|author=Forster, Paul M.|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=41|pages=457\u2013459|last2=Cheetham|first2=Anthony K.|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nBy choosing [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] with suitable physicochemical properties, it is possible to exert a fine control on the formation processes that produce complex structures.

An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Satelight]] aired between 5 October 2016 and 22 March 2017. The title is a play on words, combining the name of the prison, which is the Japanese transcription of the word \"number\", and the Japanese word \"[[Baka (Japanese word)|baka]]\" for \"fool\" or \"idiot\".\n\n==Plot==\nThe story centers around four young men who are assigned to Nanba, the world's most formidable prison. Jyugo, who attempted to break out of prison and ended up extending his jail time; Uno, a gambling fanatic who likes women; Rock, who likes eating and fighting; and Nico, an ex drug addict who happens to be an otaku.

He is of Japanese descent, has black hair with red streaks at the end, and has [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]; his left eye is green and his right eye is violet. He is confident, cheerful, impulsive and gets bored easily. He is skilled at picking any kind of mechanical or electronic lock. The sole exceptions are the shackles on his neck, wrists and ankles which were placed on him mysteriously when he was asleep by a guard with a scar on the back of his neck. His father was inmate number 610 at the Nanba prison and known as the shame of the Nanba prison. He hates the guard who placed the shackles on him, and longs to find him and have them removed. He states that he has to be in Nanba as he has been to all other prisons. His name just means 'fifteen'.\n;{{nihongo|Uno|\u30a6\u30ce}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Alejandro Saab}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate number 1311. He is of British descent, has a long braid, wears a hat, loves women and gambling, and often has a pair of cards on hand. He has a great intuition and is able to make bets on what outcome will occur using his observational skills, luck and intuition. He is kind and outgoing (to the point of being silly) but can be blunt. He is often the one who keeps the others in line when Hajime isn't around, and Nico jokes that he's starting to act like he's their mother. He's also very loyal to Jyugo, whom he claims saved his life and gave him his freedom back. After Jyugo is beaten within an inch of his life by Hajime, he holds a deep anger against Hajime, stating he could never come to like prison guards. He broke out of his previous prisons because he had dates to attend.\n;{{nihongo|Rock|\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Rokku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Airu Shiozaki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Jarrod Greene}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate number 1369. He is American, has a mohawk, wears long feather earrings, and is the physically largest of his fellow cell mates. He loves fighting and eating and is incredibly strong, with only some of the supervisors being stronger. He can be short tempered and impulsive, but cares for his friends, and mostly remains peaceful and happy. He met Jyugo when the other inmate saved him from starving to death in the first prison he was sent to. He escaped other prisons because the food was terrible, but likes the cooking at Nanba.\n;{{nihongo|Nico|\u30cb\u30b3|Niko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daiki Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Justin Briner]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate 1325. An American effeminate short male with green hair and bandages on the right side of his body, predominantly on the right side of his face. He has a chain ball shackled to his right leg. He grew up in the slums, where he was a drug mule, and has escaped multiple prisons primarily because they tried to ''inject'' his medicine into him. He is calm at Nanba as the medicine is taken orally and is flavored. Drugs have an unusual effect on him and rather than incapacitate him, they have alternate side effects. He rarely takes anything seriously and is rather childish and happy go lucky. He is a huge anime fan. In the second season, it's revealed why he is so ill and dependent on medication. As a child, a drug gang used him to test their products, which made him develop several unknown illnesses. After being arrested, the doctors at the first prison he was sent to performed painful, invasive medical experiments on him under the guise of trying to help him get better, which only made him more ill. After spending years locked in the prison infirmary, he eventually sunk into a deep depression and wished that he could die, until Jyugo freed him and helped him develop an interest in life again. In episode 21, it's revealed that he has a violent split personality that will emerge if his health problems are not kept under control with his medications, but he is unaware of its existence.\n\n===Nanba Prison guards===\n;{{nihongo|Hajime Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4e00|Sugoroku Hajime}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Seki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:The supervisor of Nanba prison Building 13.

In season 2, it's revealed that he has an older brother, Enki, who was the former supervisor of building 5; Enki was very popular among both the other guards and the prisoners, however, he secretly tortured and abused the inmates in his care, eventually murdering one of them and going on a rampage when his colleagues tried to arrest him. Samon still struggles to comprehend how his brother could do the things he did, and is often taunted by the other guards, who accuse him of being a traitor like his brother was.

He has multiple piercings on his left ear and wears a golden choker. He is usually seen with a serious expression. When he was younger, he was usually seen training. He was strong enough to break a boulder in two with a single strike, mediate underwater and even studied diligently. He also was often seen with Samon by his side. According to Liang and Upa, Enki used to be in charge of a prison in China where he cruelly beat up inmates to become stronger. Upa was nearly killed by his abuse and Liang was terrified at the thought that he would be next but Enki was transferred to Nanba Prison. Formerly the supervising officer of Building 5, he was well-respected and admired by the many fellow guards and even inmates throughout Nanba Prison. He was also considered indispensable to Building 5 and Nanba Prison. However, according to Liang and Upa, Enki had continued to cruelly beat up inmates in Nanba Prison which causes inmates to fear Enki. Enki had built an underground prison beneath Building 5, and has a secret archive room which has data on certain dangerous criminals, later discovered by Jyugo, that Enki was aware that Jyugo was part of a human experiment. After betraying his co-workers and killing an inmate, later revealed to be Elf, he was apprehended and arrested by his co-workers. He now resides in the underground prison of Building 5. Some time ago, Enki faced someone with blades similar to Jyugo. The mysterious person managed to injure Enki's left arm and Enki called him a monster. Since then, Enki was searching for him with the intent to kill him, as he believes the man is too dangerous to let live. During the second season, he is released by Inori and Houzuki Sanzou,and the three join forces with Ruka Gojou; another former guard who was arrested, and an incarcerated mob boss named Hachiman, who have all allied themselves with Enki. The five proceed to carry out a plan to capture all of the inmates and supervisors, although it's unknown exactly what Enki's unltimate goal is. While trying to capture the inmates, he sees Jyugo and plans to kill him, as he believes that he is the man with the blades who attacked him.\n;{{nihongo|H\u014dzuki Sanz\u014d|\u4e09\u8535 \u6cd5\u6708|Sanz\u014d H\u014dzuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fuyuka Ooura]] (Japanese); Matt Shipman (English)}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Hitoshi Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4ec1\u5fd7|Sugoroku Hitoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Eishin Fudemura]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Howard Wang (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Hajime's cute blonde crossdressing brother who befriends Jyugo.

He believes that he is a [[ninja|shinobi]] or [[ninja]], but his techniques usually fail to work. Ironically, he was born in a ninja village, but even as a child he was terrible. He was found by a movie director, who wanted a real shinobi to cast in her film. She tricked the child into believing that she was his long lost mother, come to take him back, and raised him to be an actor and shinobi. When he discovered the truth he tried to head back to his home village, but got lost and ended up getting arrested for trespassing. After escaping the prison, he was recaptured and sent to Nanba.\n;{{nihongo|Musashi|\u30e0\u30b5\u30b7}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshimasa Hosoya]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|[[Jason Liebrecht]]<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>}}\n:Inmate number 4634. He was born with a rare disease that keeps his body temperature much higher than normal and allows him to manifest flames.  He would learn to live and adapt with the disease.  However, when he went to college in [[Germany]], his condition went out of control.  Fellow student Elf took advantage of the situation by framing him for numerous arson crimes in order to make it acceptable for him as a convicted criminal to be used as a test subject.  In an act of rebellion, he burned the lab, but his power was suppressed by the scientist with the scar on his neck, which led to him being sent to Nanba where he finally found someone who believed his story in Kenshiro.  He has since been determined to get revenge against that scientist.\n;{{nihongo|Liang|\u30ea\u30e3\u30f3|Ryan}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuuki Fujiwara]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); [[Blake Shepard]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Inmate number 0502(block five, number 2), a master martial-artist who can usually be found training. He willingly joined the mob as a young boy to save the life of his teacher, who he witnessed nearly being murdered by the mob for refusing their demands. He was supposed to be an assassin for the boss, but he believed that killing was a sin, and instead used a drug created by Qi to knock his targets out while making them appear to be dead. Eventually he was found out by the boss, who rounded up all the people Liang had spared and forced him to watch them be killed before being brutally tortured himself. When the organization was shut down by the police, he was arrested and sent to jail in China. After a short period there, he was transferred to Nanba. He was severely depressed and disillusioned with martial arts by this time, as his years in the mob had damaged his ideals and left him thinking that he could never be a good person after what he had done. Eventually, he was able to rediscover his passion after Samon Gokuu took him in and began training him. He considers Samon to be his mentor and wants to become stronger so that he can be useful to the guard, who he credits with giving him the will to continue living.\n;{{nihongo|Upa|\u30a6\u30d1}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); [[Aaron Dismuke]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Upa is a powerful qigong master and has a talismen attached to his head to restrict his chi usage. He was kidnapped by the crime syndicate Liang used to work for when he was a child because as the most prodigious member of a powerful clan, his internal organs were worth a great deal of money on the black market. He stayed and worked for the group willingly, as they had promised to return his organs if he proved useful to them. However, it's revealed in season 2 that the organs he received were not his own, but Qi's, who had had his organs transplanted to Upa after he began dying due to his body shutting down. After he was arrested, he was sent to a prison in China, where he unfortunately became a victim of Enki Gokuu's cruel abuse. However, during this time, he also met Samon Gokuu after the guard was able to put him back in contact with his family, who had been told by the mob boss that he had died. He highly respects Samon because even though the guard claimed that he was just doing his job, he was the first person to show him any sort of kindness or respect in years. His aim is to finish serving out his sentence and attempt to begin a new, better life alongside Liang and Qi.\n;{{nihongo|Qi|\u30c1\u30a3\u30fc|Ch\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Genki Okawa]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Gabe Kunda<ref name=\"simuldub\" />}}\n: A prisoner famous for his skill at making drugs and poisons. He resides in cell block five with Liang and Upa. He is rather lazy, and can usually be seen relaxing or sleeping in the background, to the point that Liang and Upa often call him \"lazy trash\". He was forced into working for the same people who had took Liang and Upa to save his own life. He initially was unconcerned about the mob's immoral actives, as he was focused on self preservation, but came to hate them after witnessing the boss abusing Liang and Upa. Unbeknownst to Upa, he even gave him some of his own internal organs to save the young boy's life. Eventually, he discovered that his products were being modified to maim and kill the people who used them and, following his arrest, swore that he would never manufacture drugs or poisons again, as he had come to believe that his talents could only hurt other people. During this time, he also lost his ability to trust others. When he was transferred to Nanba prison, however, he eventually was able to take up his trade again after being encouraged by Samon Gokuu. He came to respect Samon for his honesty and kindness, and hopes that he will be able to repay the guard before he is released.\n;{{nihongo|Trois|\u30c8\u30ed\u30ef|Trowa}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bto Adachi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Elijah Muller<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>}}\n;{{nihongo|Honey|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc|Han\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takao Mitsutomi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Kyle Igneczi (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Ruka Goj\u014d|\u4e94\u6d44 \u6d41\u6cb3|Goj\u014d Ruka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Naozumi Takahashi]]}} (Japanese); Stephen Fu (English)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n: Ruka is a former guard, but is now inmate at Nanba Prison Building 5.\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{nihongo|Elf|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5|Erufu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Austin Tindle]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:A mysterious character who framed Musashi for a series of arson crimes.\n;Man with the Scar\n:{{voiced by|[[Masanori Ikeda]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Phil Parsons (voice actor)|Phil Parsons]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:An unknown figure, who is responsible for Jyugo's irremovable shackles, and Musashi's pyrokinesis.

An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Satelight]] aired between 5 October 2016 and 22 March 2017.

Jyugo, who attempted to break out of prison and ended up extending his jail time; Uno, a gambling fanatic who likes women; Rock, who likes eating and fighting; and Nico, an ex drug addict who happens to be an otaku. The action follows the daily lives of the prison\u2019s inmates and guards.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Cell 13===\n;{{nihongo|Jyugo|\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30b4|J\u016bgo}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bto Uemura]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Daman Mills}}<ref name=\"simuldub\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/10/18/fall-2016-simuldub-english-cast-announcements-for-the-love-of-dubs/|title=Fall 2016 SimulDub\u2122 English Cast Announcements \u2013 For The Love of Dubs - Funimation \u2013 Blog!|publisher=Funimation|date=18 October 2016|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n:Inmate number 1315. He is of Japanese descent, has black hair with red streaks at the end, and has [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]; his left eye is green and his right eye is violet. He is confident, cheerful, impulsive and gets bored easily. He is skilled at picking any kind of mechanical or electronic lock. The sole exceptions are the shackles on his neck, wrists and ankles which were placed on him mysteriously when he was asleep by a guard with a scar on the back of his neck. His father was inmate number 610 at the Nanba prison and known as the shame of the Nanba prison. He hates the guard who placed the shackles on him, and longs to find him and have them removed. He states that he has to be in Nanba as he has been to all other prisons. His name just means 'fifteen'.\n;{{nihongo|Uno|\u30a6\u30ce}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Alejandro Saab}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate number 1311. He is of British descent, has a long braid, wears a hat, loves women and gambling, and often has a pair of cards on hand. He has a great intuition and is able to make bets on what outcome will occur using his observational skills, luck and intuition. He is kind and outgoing (to the point of being silly) but can be blunt. He is often the one who keeps the others in line when Hajime isn't around, and Nico jokes that he's starting to act like he's their mother. He's also very loyal to Jyugo, whom he claims saved his life and gave him his freedom back. After Jyugo is beaten within an inch of his life by Hajime, he holds a deep anger against Hajime, stating he could never come to like prison guards. He broke out of his previous prisons because he had dates to attend.\n;{{nihongo|Rock|\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Rokku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Airu Shiozaki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Jarrod Greene}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate number 1369. He is American, has a mohawk, wears long feather earrings, and is the physically largest of his fellow cell mates. He loves fighting and eating and is incredibly strong, with only some of the supervisors being stronger. He can be short tempered and impulsive, but cares for his friends, and mostly remains peaceful and happy. He met Jyugo when the other inmate saved him from starving to death in the first prison he was sent to. He escaped other prisons because the food was terrible, but likes the cooking at Nanba.\n;{{nihongo|Nico|\u30cb\u30b3|Niko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daiki Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Justin Briner]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate 1325. An American effeminate short male with green hair and bandages on the right side of his body, predominantly on the right side of his face. He has a chain ball shackled to his right leg. He grew up in the slums, where he was a drug mule, and has escaped multiple prisons primarily because they tried to ''inject'' his medicine into him. He is calm at Nanba as the medicine is taken orally and is flavored. Drugs have an unusual effect on him and rather than incapacitate him, they have alternate side effects. He rarely takes anything seriously and is rather childish and happy go lucky. He is a huge anime fan. In the second season, it's revealed why he is so ill and dependent on medication. As a child, a drug gang used him to test their products, which made him develop several unknown illnesses. After being arrested, the doctors at the first prison he was sent to performed painful, invasive medical experiments on him under the guise of trying to help him get better, which only made him more ill. After spending years locked in the prison infirmary, he eventually sunk into a deep depression and wished that he could die, until Jyugo freed him and helped him develop an interest in life again. In episode 21, it's revealed that he has a violent split personality that will emerge if his health problems are not kept under control with his medications, but he is unaware of its existence.\n\n===Nanba Prison guards===\n;{{nihongo|Hajime Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4e00|Sugoroku Hajime}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Seki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:The supervisor of Nanba prison Building 13.

In season 2, it's revealed that he has an older brother, Enki, who was the former supervisor of building 5; Enki was very popular among both the other guards and the prisoners, however, he secretly tortured and abused the inmates in his care, eventually murdering one of them and going on a rampage when his colleagues tried to arrest him. Samon still struggles to comprehend how his brother could do the things he did, and is often taunted by the other guards, who accuse him of being a traitor like his brother was.

He has multiple piercings on his left ear and wears a golden choker. He is usually seen with a serious expression. When he was younger, he was usually seen training. He was strong enough to break a boulder in two with a single strike, mediate underwater and even studied diligently. He also was often seen with Samon by his side. According to Liang and Upa, Enki used to be in charge of a prison in China where he cruelly beat up inmates to become stronger. Upa was nearly killed by his abuse and Liang was terrified at the thought that he would be next but Enki was transferred to Nanba Prison. Formerly the supervising officer of Building 5, he was well-respected and admired by the many fellow guards and even inmates throughout Nanba Prison. He was also considered indispensable to Building 5 and Nanba Prison. However, according to Liang and Upa, Enki had continued to cruelly beat up inmates in Nanba Prison which causes inmates to fear Enki. Enki had built an underground prison beneath Building 5, and has a secret archive room which has data on certain dangerous criminals, later discovered by Jyugo, that Enki was aware that Jyugo was part of a human experiment. After betraying his co-workers and killing an inmate, later revealed to be Elf, he was apprehended and arrested by his co-workers. He now resides in the underground prison of Building 5. Some time ago, Enki faced someone with blades similar to Jyugo. The mysterious person managed to injure Enki's left arm and Enki called him a monster. Since then, Enki was searching for him with the intent to kill him, as he believes the man is too dangerous to let live. During the second season, he is released by Inori and Houzuki Sanzou,and the three join forces with Ruka Gojou; another former guard who was arrested, and an incarcerated mob boss named Hachiman, who have all allied themselves with Enki. The five proceed to carry out a plan to capture all of the inmates and supervisors, although it's unknown exactly what Enki's unltimate goal is. While trying to capture the inmates, he sees Jyugo and plans to kill him, as he believes that he is the man with the blades who attacked him.\n;{{nihongo|H\u014dzuki Sanz\u014d|\u4e09\u8535 \u6cd5\u6708|Sanz\u014d H\u014dzuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fuyuka Ooura]] (Japanese); Matt Shipman (English)}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Hitoshi Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4ec1\u5fd7|Sugoroku Hitoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Eishin Fudemura]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Howard Wang (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Hajime's cute blonde crossdressing brother who befriends Jyugo.

He was born with a rare disease that keeps his body temperature much higher than normal and allows him to manifest flames.  He would learn to live and adapt with the disease.  However, when he went to college in [[Germany]], his condition went out of control.  Fellow student Elf took advantage of the situation by framing him for numerous arson crimes in order to make it acceptable for him as a convicted criminal to be used as a test subject.  In an act of rebellion, he burned the lab, but his power was suppressed by the scientist with the scar on his neck, which led to him being sent to Nanba where he finally found someone who believed his story in Kenshiro.  He has since been determined to get revenge against that scientist.\n;{{nihongo|Liang|\u30ea\u30e3\u30f3|Ryan}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuuki Fujiwara]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); [[Blake Shepard]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Inmate number 0502(block five, number 2), a master martial-artist who can usually be found training. He willingly joined the mob as a young boy to save the life of his teacher, who he witnessed nearly being murdered by the mob for refusing their demands. He was supposed to be an assassin for the boss, but he believed that killing was a sin, and instead used a drug created by Qi to knock his targets out while making them appear to be dead. Eventually he was found out by the boss, who rounded up all the people Liang had spared and forced him to watch them be killed before being brutally tortured himself. When the organization was shut down by the police, he was arrested and sent to jail in China. After a short period there, he was transferred to Nanba. He was severely depressed and disillusioned with martial arts by this time, as his years in the mob had damaged his ideals and left him thinking that he could never be a good person after what he had done. Eventually, he was able to rediscover his passion after Samon Gokuu took him in and began training him. He considers Samon to be his mentor and wants to become stronger so that he can be useful to the guard, who he credits with giving him the will to continue living.\n;{{nihongo|Upa|\u30a6\u30d1}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); [[Aaron Dismuke]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Upa is a powerful qigong master and has a talismen attached to his head to restrict his chi usage. He was kidnapped by the crime syndicate Liang used to work for when he was a child because as the most prodigious member of a powerful clan, his internal organs were worth a great deal of money on the black market. He stayed and worked for the group willingly, as they had promised to return his organs if he proved useful to them. However, it's revealed in season 2 that the organs he received were not his own, but Qi's, who had had his organs transplanted to Upa after he began dying due to his body shutting down. After he was arrested, he was sent to a prison in China, where he unfortunately became a victim of Enki Gokuu's cruel abuse. However, during this time, he also met Samon Gokuu after the guard was able to put him back in contact with his family, who had been told by the mob boss that he had died. He highly respects Samon because even though the guard claimed that he was just doing his job, he was the first person to show him any sort of kindness or respect in years. His aim is to finish serving out his sentence and attempt to begin a new, better life alongside Liang and Qi.\n;{{nihongo|Qi|\u30c1\u30a3\u30fc|Ch\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Genki Okawa]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Gabe Kunda<ref name=\"simuldub\" />}}\n: A prisoner famous for his skill at making drugs and poisons. He resides in cell block five with Liang and Upa. He is rather lazy, and can usually be seen relaxing or sleeping in the background, to the point that Liang and Upa often call him \"lazy trash\". He was forced into working for the same people who had took Liang and Upa to save his own life. He initially was unconcerned about the mob's immoral actives, as he was focused on self preservation, but came to hate them after witnessing the boss abusing Liang and Upa. Unbeknownst to Upa, he even gave him some of his own internal organs to save the young boy's life. Eventually, he discovered that his products were being modified to maim and kill the people who used them and, following his arrest, swore that he would never manufacture drugs or poisons again, as he had come to believe that his talents could only hurt other people. During this time, he also lost his ability to trust others. When he was transferred to Nanba prison, however, he eventually was able to take up his trade again after being encouraged by Samon Gokuu. He came to respect Samon for his honesty and kindness, and hopes that he will be able to repay the guard before he is released.\n;{{nihongo|Trois|\u30c8\u30ed\u30ef|Trowa}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bto Adachi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Elijah Muller<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>}}\n;{{nihongo|Honey|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc|Han\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takao Mitsutomi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Kyle Igneczi (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Ruka Goj\u014d|\u4e94\u6d44 \u6d41\u6cb3|Goj\u014d Ruka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Naozumi Takahashi]]}} (Japanese); Stephen Fu (English)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n: Ruka is a former guard, but is now inmate at Nanba Prison Building 5.\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{nihongo|Elf|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5|Erufu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Austin Tindle]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:A mysterious character who framed Musashi for a series of arson crimes.\n;Man with the Scar\n:{{voiced by|[[Masanori Ikeda]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Phil Parsons (voice actor)|Phil Parsons]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:An unknown figure, who is responsible for Jyugo's irremovable shackles, and Musashi's pyrokinesis.

It took place between 27 June and 21 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of {{convert|4098|km|0|abbr=on}}. [[Eddy Merckx]] was attempting to win his fifth Tour de France in as many races.\n\nIn 1974 the tour made its first visit to the United Kingdom, with a circuit stage on the Plympton By-pass, near [[Plymouth]], England.\n\nThe race was won by favourite [[Eddy Merckx]], who thus at that point had won all five Tours that he had entered, and had equalled [[Jacques Anquetil]] in Tour victories. While he won the race by a comfortable margin, he was not as overwhelmingly dominant as he had been in his previous victories with eight riders finishing within 20:00, two riders within 10:00 and his two top competitors in [[Luis Oca\u00f1a]] and [[Joop Zoetemelk]] absent from the race. Despite other riders finishing closer in the overall standings, Merckx still won an astonishing eight stages. He also won the [[combination classification in the Tour de France|combination classification]]. Fellow Belgian [[Patrick Sercu]] won the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], while Spanish [[Domingo Perurena]] won the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]].\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1974 Tour de France}}\n\nThe 1974 Tour de France had 13 teams, with 10 cyclists each.<ref name=\"mdc1974\"/>\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{ct|Molteni|1974}}\n* {{ct|Bic|1974}}\n* {{ct|Peugeot|1974}}\n* {{ct|KAS|1974}}\n* {{ct|Gitane\u2013Campagnolo|1974}}\n* {{ct|Miko\u2013de Gribaldy|1974}}\n* {{ct|Mercier|1974}}\n* [[La Casera\u2013Pe\u00f1a Bahamontes]]\n* [[Merlin Plage\u2013Shimano\u2013Flandria]]\n* {{ct|Brooklyn|1974}}\n* {{ct|Jobo|1974}}\n* {{ct|Flandria|1974}}\n* {{ct|Frisol|1974}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Pre-race favourites==\n\n[[Eddy Merckx]], who had been absent in [[1973 Tour de France|1973]] after winning four Tours in a row, was present again.<ref name=\"mdc1974\">{{cite web|url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1974.php|publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme|title=61\u00e8me Tour de France 1974|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629200322/http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1974.php|archive-date=29 June 2012|access-date=26 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Merckx had not been as dominant in the spring as in other years; it was his first year as a professional cyclist in which he did not win a spring classic.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}} He did win the [[1974 Giro d'Italia]] and the Tour de Suisse, but after winning the latter he required surgery on the [[perineum]], five days before the 1974 Tour started.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}}\n\nNotable absents were [[Luis Oca\u00f1a|Oca\u00f1a]] and [[Joop Zoetemelk|Zoetemelk]].

Merckx won the seventh stage, and became the next leader.\n\nThe Alps were the first serious mountains to be seen, in stage nine. Merckx won the stage, but the surprise of the day was Raymond Poulidor, who at 38 years old was still able to escape during the toughest part of the stage.

Surprisingly, Merckx was in second place in that time trial, beaten by [[Michel Pollentier]].{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}} In the last stage, Poulidor increased the margin to Lopez Carril to five seconds due to bonus seconds in an intermediate sprint. At the finish of that last, Sercu finished first in a sprint, but he had blocked the way of [[Gustaaf Van Roosbroeck]], so the jury decided to set him back, and the second rider to finish (Merckx) was declared winner of the stage. Normally, a rider penalized for blocking another rider during a sprint would be set back to the last place of the group that he finished in, but that would have meant that Sercu would have not only lost the stage victory to Merckx, but also the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. The jury then declared that only three riders were really sprinting for the stage victory, so Sercu would be set back to the third place; this enabled him to keep his victory in the points classification by 13 points.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19740722&id=GVA-19740722-01020004|title=Ongelukkige refleks kost Patrick Sercu nog bijna de groene trui|trans-title=Unlucky reflex almost costs Patrick Sercu the green jersey|date=22 July 1974|publisher=Concentra|work=Gazet van Antwerpen|language=Dutch|first=Andr\u00e9|last=Putzeijs|page=20}}</ref>\n\n===Doping===\n[[Cyrille Guimard]], who had won the first part of stage eight, tested positive for [[piperidine]]<ref name=\"sv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dopage.com/cas-dopage/tombes-au-champs-dhonneur-81-105-11-770.html |title=Tomb\u00e9s au champs d'honneur |publisher=Dopage.com |work=Magazine Sport & Vie |date=July 2003 |language=French |accessdate=30 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213011439/http://www.dopage.com/cas-dopage/tombes-au-champs-dhonneur-81-105-11-770.html |archivedate=13 December 2007  }}</ref> after stage thirteen.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LD/1974-07-18/edition/0/page/13|title=Guimard positief|date=18 July 1974|via=Regionaal archief leiden|work=[[Leidsche Courant]]|page=13}}</ref> Three other cyclists tested positive:Claude Tollet, for [[amphetamine]]; Daniel Ducreux, for piperidine; Carlos Melero, for piperidine.<ref name=\"sv\"/>\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\nThere were several classifications in the 1974 Tour de France, three of them awarding [[Cycling jersey|jerseys]] to their leaders.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013455}} The most important was the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}}\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey in 1974.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nAnother classification was the [[combination classification in the Tour de France|combination classification]]. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications, its leader wore the white jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nThe fifth individual classification was the [[intermediate sprints classification in the Tour de France|intermediate sprints classification]]. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1974, this classification had no associated jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow [[Casquette|caps]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]], in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} At the conclusion of the Tour, Eddy Merckx won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=65}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] near the summit of the [[Col du Galibier]]. This prize was won by [[Vicente L\u00f3pez Carril]] during stage 11.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=368}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref name=\"antwerpen-final-table\">{{cite news|url=http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19740722&id=GVA-19740722-01019022|title=Tour panorama|language=Dutch|work=[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]|date=22 July 1974|page=19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214182602/http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19740722&id=GVA-19740722-01019022|archive-date=14 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 1974|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 1974|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1974|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190304062036/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1974|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

This also happened in the tenth stage: Poulidor joined the crucial escape, but could not beat Merckx in the final sprint.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}}\n\nIn the tenth stage, the hardest Alpine stage, [[Vicente Lopez Carril]] from the KAS team stayed away. Merckx was in the next group, together with [[Francisco Gald\u00f3s]] and [[Gonzalo Aja]], also from the KAS team. Aja was in third place in the general classification, so Merckx was unable to chase Lopez Carril without helping his rival Aja.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}}\n\nThe next stages did not change the general classification. In the fifteenth stage, the Pyren\u00e9es were encountered. There was a crash that took down Gald\u00f3s, now in sixth place in the general classification, and he had to leave the race.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}}\nThe Tour was in Spain at that point, and Basque separatist placed bombs on press and team cars. Nobody was hurt, but cyclists were scared: Spanish champion Lopez Carril did not wear his national champion's jersey, afraid to become a target because of the Spanish flag on it.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}}\n\nIn the sixteenth stage, with an uphill finish, Poulidor won, his first Tour stage victory since 1965. Merckx finished in fourth place, losing time to Poulidor, Lopez Carril and Pollentier.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}}<ref name=\"mdc1974_16\">{{cite web|url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1974_16.php|publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme|title=61\u00e8me Tour de France 1974 - 16\u00e8me \u00e9tape|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804032409/http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1974_16.php|archive-date=4 August 2011|access-date=26 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the seventeenth stage, Poulidor again won time, finishing second after [[Jean-Pierre Danguillaume]], and jumped to the third place in the general classification, behind Merckx and Lopez Carril.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}}\nDanguillaume also won the eighteenth stage, the last mountain stage. The favourites stayed together with Merckx, and at that point Merckx was more or less certain of the victory, with two time trials remaining, in which he normally would gain time on the others.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}}\n\nPoulidor battled with Lopez-Carril for the second place. After the time trial in the second part of stage 21, Poulidor captured the second place by just one second. Surprisingly, Merckx was in second place in that time trial, beaten by [[Michel Pollentier]].{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=81\u201388}} In the last stage, Poulidor increased the margin to Lopez Carril to five seconds due to bonus seconds in an intermediate sprint. At the finish of that last, Sercu finished first in a sprint, but he had blocked the way of [[Gustaaf Van Roosbroeck]], so the jury decided to set him back, and the second rider to finish (Merckx) was declared winner of the stage. Normally, a rider penalized for blocking another rider during a sprint would be set back to the last place of the group that he finished in, but that would have meant that Sercu would have not only lost the stage victory to Merckx, but also the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. The jury then declared that only three riders were really sprinting for the stage victory, so Sercu would be set back to the third place; this enabled him to keep his victory in the points classification by 13 points.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19740722&id=GVA-19740722-01020004|title=Ongelukkige refleks kost Patrick Sercu nog bijna de groene trui|trans-title=Unlucky reflex almost costs Patrick Sercu the green jersey|date=22 July 1974|publisher=Concentra|work=Gazet van Antwerpen|language=Dutch|first=Andr\u00e9|last=Putzeijs|page=20}}</ref>\n\n===Doping===\n[[Cyrille Guimard]], who had won the first part of stage eight, tested positive for [[piperidine]]<ref name=\"sv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dopage.com/cas-dopage/tombes-au-champs-dhonneur-81-105-11-770.html |title=Tomb\u00e9s au champs d'honneur |publisher=Dopage.com |work=Magazine Sport & Vie |date=July 2003 |language=French |accessdate=30 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213011439/http://www.dopage.com/cas-dopage/tombes-au-champs-dhonneur-81-105-11-770.html |archivedate=13 December 2007  }}</ref> after stage thirteen.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LD/1974-07-18/edition/0/page/13|title=Guimard positief|date=18 July 1974|via=Regionaal archief leiden|work=[[Leidsche Courant]]|page=13}}</ref> Three other cyclists tested positive:Claude Tollet, for [[amphetamine]]; Daniel Ducreux, for piperidine; Carlos Melero, for piperidine.<ref name=\"sv\"/>\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\nThere were several classifications in the 1974 Tour de France, three of them awarding [[Cycling jersey|jerseys]] to their leaders.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013455}} The most important was the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}}\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey in 1974.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nAnother classification was the [[combination classification in the Tour de France|combination classification]]. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications, its leader wore the white jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nThe fifth individual classification was the [[intermediate sprints classification in the Tour de France|intermediate sprints classification]]. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1974, this classification had no associated jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow [[Casquette|caps]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]], in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} At the conclusion of the Tour, Eddy Merckx won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=65}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] near the summit of the [[Col du Galibier]]. This prize was won by [[Vicente L\u00f3pez Carril]] during stage 11.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=368}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref name=\"antwerpen-final-table\">{{cite news|url=http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19740722&id=GVA-19740722-01019022|title=Tour panorama|language=Dutch|work=[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]|date=22 July 1974|page=19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214182602/http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19740722&id=GVA-19740722-01019022|archive-date=14 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 1974|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 1974|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1974|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190304062036/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1974|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!
