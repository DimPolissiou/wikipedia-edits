Starting as a child actress, she had a long and varied career in film from 1917 to 1953. She won the 1948 [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role in the 1947 film ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (1947 film)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'', and received an Oscar nomination for her role in ''[[Come to the Stable]]'' in 1949. Young moved to the relatively new medium of television, where she had a dramatic [[anthology series]], ''[[Letter to Loretta|The Loretta Young Show]]'', from 1953 to 1961. The series earned three [[Emmy Award]]s, and was re-run successfully on daytime TV and later in syndication. In the 1980s, Young returned to the small screen and won a Golden Globe for her role in ''Christmas Eve'' in 1986.\n\n==Early life==\nShe was born Gretchen Young in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], the daughter of Gladys (n\u00e9e Royal) and John Earle Young.<ref>''Leading Ladies The 50 Most Unforgettable Actresses of the Studio Era''.

When she was two years old, her parents separated, and when she was three, her mother moved the family to [[Hollywood]]. She and her sisters [[Polly Ann Young|Polly Ann]] and Elizabeth Jane (better known as [[Sally Blane]]) all worked as child actresses, but of the three, Gretchen was the most successful.\n\nYoung's first role was at the age of two or three in the silent film ''[[Sweet Kitty Bellairs (1916 film)|Sweet Kitty Bellairs]]''. During her high-school years she was educated at [[Ramona Convent Secondary School]]. She was signed to a contract by [[John McCormick (producer)|John McCormick]], husband and manager of actress [[Colleen Moore]], who saw the young girl's potential.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loretta-young.com/FY-leaving-gretch-behind.html|title=Loretta Young|publisher=loretta-young.com|accessdate=2015-09-30}}</ref> Moore gave her the name Loretta, explaining that it was the name of her favorite doll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/loretta-young/4.html|title=Loretta Young profile|publisher=Bookrags.com|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Film===\n[[File:Loretta Young NM230.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Young in 1930]]\nYoung was billed as Gretchen Young in the silent film ''Sirens of the Sea'' (1917). She was first billed as Loretta Young in 1928, in ''[[The Whip Woman]]''. That same year, she co-starred with [[Lon Chaney]] in the MGM film ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]''. The next year, she was named one of the [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Denise|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Women in Early American Films, 1895\u20131930|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9790874369709_b7n2/page/67 67]|isbn=0-7890-1843-8|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9790874369709_b7n2/page/67}}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, when she was 17, she eloped with 26-year-old actor [[Grant Withers]]; they were married in [[Yuma, Arizona]]. The marriage was annulled the next year, just as their second movie together (ironically entitled ''Too Young to Marry'') was released.\n\nIn 1935, she co-starred with [[Clark Gable]] and [[Jack Oakie]] in the [[The Call of the Wild (1935 film)|film version]] of [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', directed by [[William Wellman]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Young made ''[[Ladies Courageous]]'' (1944; re-issued as ''Fury in the Sky''), the fictionalized story of the [[Women Airforce Service Pilots|Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron]]. It depicted a unit of female pilots who flew bomber planes from the factories to their final destinations. Young made as many as eight movies a year. In [[1947 in film|1947]], she won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for her performance in ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (1947 film)|The Farmer's Daughter]]''. That same year, she co-starred with [[Cary Grant]] and [[David Niven]] in ''[[The Bishop's Wife]]'', a perennial favorite. In 1949, she received another Academy Award nomination for ''[[Come to the Stable]]''. In 1953, she appeared in her last theatrical film, ''[[It Happens Every Thursday]]'', a [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] comedy about a New York couple who move to California to take over a struggling weekly newspaper; her co-star was [[John Forsythe]].\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Cause For Alarm!.JPG|right|200px|thumb|From the trailer for ''[[Cause for Alarm! (film)|Cause for Alarm!]]'' (1951)]]\nYoung hosted and starred in the well-received half-hour [[anthology series|anthology]] [[television series]] ''[[Letter to Loretta]]'' (soon retitled ''The Loretta Young Show''), which was originally broadcast from 1953 to 1961. She earned three Emmy awards for the program. Her trademark was a dramatic entrance through a living room door in various high-fashion evening gowns. She returned at the program's conclusion to offer a brief passage from the Bible or a famous quote that reflected upon the evening's story. (Young's introductions and concluding remarks were not re-run on television because she legally stipulated that they not be, as she did not want the dresses she wore in those segments to make the program seem dated.) The program ran in [[prime time]] on [[NBC]] for eight years, the longest-running primetime network program hosted by a woman up to that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe program was based on the premise that each drama was in answer to a question asked in her [[fan mail]]. The title was changed to ''The Loretta Young Show'' during the first season (as of the episode of February 14, 1954), and the \"letter\" concept was dropped at the end of the second season. Towards the end of the second season, Young was hospitalized as a result of overwork, which required a number of guest hosts and guest stars; her first appearance in the [[1955\u201356 United States network television schedule|1955\u20131956 season]] was for the [[Christmas]] show. From then on, Young appeared in only about half of each season's shows as an actress, and served as the program's host for the remainder.\n\nMinus Young's introductions and conclusions, the series was re-run as the ''Loretta Young Theatre'' in daytime by NBC from 1960 to 1964. It also appeared in [[television syndication|syndication]] into the early 1970s before being withdrawn.\n\nIn the 1962\u20131963 television season, Young appeared as Christine Massey, a freelance magazine writer and the mother of seven children, in ''[[The New Loretta Young Show]]'', on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]. It fared poorly in the ratings on Monday evenings against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Ben Casey]]''. It was dropped after one season of 26 episodes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn the 1990s, selected episodes from Young's personal collection, with the opening and closing segments (and original title) intact, were released on home video and frequently shown on cable television. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Awards===\nIn 1988, Young received the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Crystal Award]] for outstanding women who through their endurance and the excellence of their work helped expand the role of women in the entertainment industry.<ref>[http://wif.org/past-recipients] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630083646/http://wif.org/past-recipients |date=June 30, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nYoung has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one for her work in television, at 6135 [[Hollywood Boulevard]], and the other for her work in motion pictures, at 6100 Hollywood Boulevard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/loretta-young |title=Walk of Fame Stars: Loretta Young |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=October 13, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403071134/http://walkoffame.com/loretta-young |archivedate=April 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2011, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]], in [[Palm Springs, California]], was dedicated to her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |format=PDF |title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars by Date Dedicated |publisher=Palmspringswalkofstars.com |accessdate=2015-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Loretta Young Argentinean Magazine AD.jpg|thumb|Young in 1938]]\nYoung was married three times and had three children.

Starting as a child actress, she had a long and varied career in film from 1917 to 1953. She won the 1948 [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role in the 1947 film ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (1947 film)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'', and received an Oscar nomination for her role in ''[[Come to the Stable]]'' in 1949. Young moved to the relatively new medium of television, where she had a dramatic [[anthology series]], ''[[Letter to Loretta|The Loretta Young Show]]'', from 1953 to 1961. The series earned three [[Emmy Award]]s, and was re-run successfully on daytime TV and later in syndication. In the 1980s, Young returned to the small screen and won a Golden Globe for her role in ''Christmas Eve'' in 1986.\n\n==Early life==\nShe was born Gretchen Young in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], the daughter of Gladys (n\u00e9e Royal) and John Earle Young.<ref>''Leading Ladies The 50 Most Unforgettable Actresses of the Studio Era''.

When she was two years old, her parents separated, and when she was three, her family and she moved to [[Hollywood]]. She and her sisters [[Polly Ann Young|Polly Ann]] and Elizabeth Jane (better known as [[Sally Blane]]) all worked as child actresses, but of the three, Gretchen was the most successful.\n\nYoung's first role was at the age of two or three in the silent film ''[[Sweet Kitty Bellairs (1916 film)|Sweet Kitty Bellairs]]''. During her high-school years she was educated at [[Ramona Convent Secondary School]]. She was signed to a contract by [[John McCormick (producer)|John McCormick]], husband and manager of actress [[Colleen Moore]], who saw the young girl's potential.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loretta-young.com/FY-leaving-gretch-behind.html|title=Loretta Young|publisher=loretta-young.com|accessdate=2015-09-30}}</ref> The name Loretta was given her by Moore, who later explained it was the name of her favorite doll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/loretta-young/4.html|title=Loretta Young profile|publisher=Bookrags.com|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Film===\n[[File:Loretta Young NM230.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Young in 1930]]\nYoung was billed as Gretchen Young in the silent film ''Sirens of the Sea'' (1917). She was first billed as Loretta Young in 1928, in ''[[The Whip Woman]]''. That same year, she co-starred with [[Lon Chaney]] in the MGM film ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]''. The next year, she was named one of the [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Denise|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Women in Early American Films, 1895\u20131930|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9790874369709_b7n2/page/67 67]|isbn=0-7890-1843-8|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9790874369709_b7n2/page/67}}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, when she was 17, she eloped with 26-year-old actor [[Grant Withers]]; they were married in [[Yuma, Arizona]]. The marriage was annulled the next year, just as their second movie together (ironically entitled ''Too Young to Marry'') was released.\n\nIn 1935, she co-starred with [[Clark Gable]] and [[Jack Oakie]] in the [[The Call of the Wild (1935 film)|film version]] of [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', directed by [[William Wellman]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Young made ''[[Ladies Courageous]]'' (1944; re-issued as ''Fury in the Sky''), the fictionalized story of the [[Women Airforce Service Pilots|Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron]]. It depicted a unit of female pilots who flew bomber planes from the factories to their final destinations. Young made as many as eight movies a year. In [[1947 in film|1947]], she won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for her performance in ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (1947 film)|The Farmer's Daughter]]''. That same year, she co-starred with [[Cary Grant]] and [[David Niven]] in ''[[The Bishop's Wife]]'', a perennial favorite. In 1949, she received another Academy Award nomination for ''[[Come to the Stable]]''. In 1953, she appeared in her last theatrical film, ''[[It Happens Every Thursday]]'', a [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] comedy about a New York couple who move to California to take over a struggling weekly newspaper; her co-star was [[John Forsythe]].\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Cause For Alarm!.JPG|right|200px|thumb|From the trailer for ''[[Cause for Alarm! (film)|Cause for Alarm!]]'' (1951)]]\nYoung hosted and starred in the well-received half-hour [[anthology series|anthology]] [[television series]] ''[[Letter to Loretta]]'' (soon retitled ''The Loretta Young Show''), which was originally broadcast from 1953 to 1961. She earned three Emmy awards for the program. Her trademark was a dramatic entrance through a living room door in various high-fashion evening gowns. She returned at the program's conclusion to offer a brief passage from the Bible or a famous quote that reflected upon the evening's story. (Young's introductions and concluding remarks were not re-run on television because she legally stipulated that they not be, as she did not want the dresses she wore in those segments to make the program seem dated.) The program ran in [[prime time]] on [[NBC]] for eight years, the longest-running primetime network program hosted by a woman up to that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe program was based on the premise that each drama was in answer to a question asked in her [[fan mail]]. The title was changed to ''The Loretta Young Show'' during the first season (as of the episode of February 14, 1954), and the \"letter\" concept was dropped at the end of the second season. Towards the end of the second season, Young was hospitalized as a result of overwork, which required a number of guest hosts and guest stars; her first appearance in the [[1955\u201356 United States network television schedule|1955\u20131956 season]] was for the [[Christmas]] show. From then on, Young appeared in only about half of each season's shows as an actress, and served as the program's host for the remainder.\n\nMinus Young's introductions and conclusions, the series was re-run as the ''Loretta Young Theatre'' in daytime by NBC from 1960 to 1964. It also appeared in [[television syndication|syndication]] into the early 1970s before being withdrawn.\n\nIn the 1962\u20131963 television season, Young appeared as Christine Massey, a freelance magazine writer and the mother of seven children, in ''[[The New Loretta Young Show]]'', on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]. It fared poorly in the ratings on Monday evenings against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Ben Casey]]''. It was dropped after one season of 26 episodes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn the 1990s, selected episodes from Young's personal collection, with the opening and closing segments (and original title) intact, were released on home video and frequently shown on cable television. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Awards===\nIn 1988, Young received the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Crystal Award]] for outstanding women who through their endurance and the excellence of their work helped expand the role of women in the entertainment industry.<ref>[http://wif.org/past-recipients] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630083646/http://wif.org/past-recipients |date=June 30, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nYoung has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one for her work in television, at 6135 [[Hollywood Boulevard]], and the other for her work in motion pictures, at 6100 Hollywood Boulevard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/loretta-young |title=Walk of Fame Stars: Loretta Young |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=October 13, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403071134/http://walkoffame.com/loretta-young |archivedate=April 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2011, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]], in [[Palm Springs, California]], was dedicated to her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |format=PDF |title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars by Date Dedicated |publisher=Palmspringswalkofstars.com |accessdate=2015-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Loretta Young Argentinean Magazine AD.jpg|thumb|Young in 1938]]\nYoung was married three times and had three children.

Orimoloye: Biographia Nigeriana: a biographical dictionary of eminent Nigerians G. K. Hall & Co, Boston, 1977; {{ISBN|0-81618-049-0}}, pages 162\u2013163</ref> in publications often '''D. C. D. Happold''', is a British-Australian [[mammalogy|mammalogist]]. His main research interests are the small mammals (bats, shrews, and rodents) of [[Africa]] and [[Australia]].\n\n== Career ==\nDavid Happold is the son of [[Frederick Crossfield Happold|Frederick Crossfield]] (1893-1971) and his wife Dorothy Vectis Happold, n\u00e9e Halbach. From 1947 to 1955, he attended [[Bishop Wordsworth's School]] in Salisbury, where his father was a headmaster from 1928 to 1960. In 1957, he was matriculated at [[Peterhouse College]], [[University of Cambridge]], where he earned his [[Master's degree]] in 1960. That same year he went to [[Canada]], where he attended the [[University of Calgary]] in northern [[Alberta]] until 1963. From 1961 until 1962 he did field research on the ecology and distribution of [[mosquito]]s, in particular near the [[Flatbush, Alberta|Flatbush]] [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] and [[Athabasca, Alberta|Athabasca]]. In April 1963, he submitted his [[PhD]] thesis entitled ''Studies on the ecology of mosquitoes in the boreal forest of Alberta''.\n\nIn July 1963 he accepted a position at the [[University of Khartoum]], where he changed his interests to mammalogy. During the three years he spent in [[Khartoum]], he travelled the [[semi-desert]] regions of [[Sudan]] and studied small mammals. Most of his research included ecological studies of the [[lesser Egyptian jerboa]] (''Jaculus jaculus'') and the [[greater Egyptian gerbil]] (''Gerbillus pyramidum'').\n\nIn April 1966, he moved to the [[University of Ibadan]] in [[Nigeria]] (one year before the outbreak of the [[Nigerian Civil War]]) and began long-term studies on the demography of terrestrial small mammals in the [[rainforest]], on distribution patterns of small mammals in the savannah areas, reproductive strategies of small mammals and on the problems of species conservation in the national parks. David Happold lived in Nigeria for 12 years until he and his wife Meredith, an Australian zoologist, were forced to leave the country in 1977 by various circumstances. They moved to Australia and David Happold took up a post at the Zoology Department of the [[Australian National University]]. From January 1977 until his retirement in August 1998, he worked as a [[Lecturer]], [[Senior lecturer]] and [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]].\n\nIn Australia, Happold and his students worked on many aspects of small mammal ecology in the [[subalpine]] and [[Australian Alps montane grasslands|alpine regions]] of the [[Kosciuszko National Park]], a few kilometres south of [[Canberra]]. The studies dealt with demography, reproductive strategies, habitat selection, food preferences, social behaviour, the effects of altitude (especially snowfall in winter) on many areas of life and the problems of [[nature conservation]] in mountain habitats.\n\nHe also continued his research work in Africa. From 1984 to 1985 and from 1993 to 1994 he lectured as a visiting professor at the [[University of Malawi]] in [[Zomba, Malawi|Zomba]]. In collaboration with his wife, he conducted long-term studies on African bats.\n\nIn 1983, Happold described the [[savanna swamp shrew]] (''Crocidura longipes'') from Nigeria in collaboration with German mammalogist [[Rainer Hutterer]] from the [[Museum Koenig]] in [[Bonn]].\n\n== Work ==\nIn 1971, Happold published the monograph ''Wildlife Conservation in West Africa'' on the behalf of the [[IUCN]]. In 1973, the book ''Large Mammals of West Africa'' was published. In 1979, he wrote the book ''Ecology of African Mammals'' in collaboration with Michael James Delany. In 1984, he wrote the chapter ''Small Mammals'' in the book ''Sahara Desert'' by [[John Cloudsley-Thompson]]. 1987 he published the book ''Mammals of Nigeria''. This comprehensive reference book is the first field guide to list all 250 mammal species recorded in Nigeria. In 2011, Happold published ''The African Naturalist: The Life and Times of Rodney Carrington Wood 1889-1962'' on the [[game warden]] and [[lepidopterology|lepidopterist]] Rodney Carrington Wood, who spent most of his life in [[Nyasaland]] (today Malawi). The six-volume work ''[[Mammals of Africa]]'' was published in 2013, with David Happold as co-editor besides [[Jonathan Kingdon]], [[Meredith Happold]], [[Thomas M. Butynski]], [[Jan Kalina]] and [[Michael Hoffmann (zoologist)|Michael Hoffmann]]. It received the [[Dartmouth Medal]] of the [[American Library Association]] in 2014. In 2018, the book ''Africa from East to West'' was published, in which Happold describes a journey he made between 1965 and 1967 from [[Massawa]] on the coast of the [[Red Sea]] from [[Eritrea]] to [[Cap-Vert]] in [[Senegal]]. He also published over 80 scientific articles, often co-authored by his wife.\n\nDavid Happold is a member of the [[Zoological Society of London]], the [[British Ecological Society]] and [[Fauna & Flora International]].\n\n== Honours ==\nFor his achievements in African mammalian research, David Happold received an honorary [[Doctor of Science]] degree from the University of Cambridge in 1997 and was elected an honorary member of the [[American Society of Mammalogists]]. In 2019, David and Meredith Happold were honoured in the specific name of the bat species ''[[Parahypsugo happoldorum]]'' from [[Guinea]] and [[Liberia]].<ref>Rainer Hutterer, Jan Decher, Ara Monadjem, Jonas Astrin: A New Genus and Species of Vesper Bat from West Africa, with Notes on Hypsugo, Neoromicia, and Pipistrellus (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae).

The utility is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., a division of [[Fortis Inc.|Fortis Inc]].  Cornwall Electric is the only electricity distributor in the province of [[Ontario]] that obtains its electricity from the province of [[Quebec]].

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.

It supplies electricity to approximately 24,300 customers in the city of [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], the townships of [[South Glengarry, Ontario|South Glengarry]] and [[South Stormont|South Stormont,]] and a portion of the [[Mohawk Nation]] territory of [[Akwesasne]] in Eastern Ontario.  The utility is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., a division of [[Fortis Inc.|Fortis Inc]].

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.
