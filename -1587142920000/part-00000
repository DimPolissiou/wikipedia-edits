In his search for a home, he is introduced to the Yuragi Inn, a cheap boarding house and former hot springs inn.

Prior to the start of the story, he was homeless before coming to the Yuragi Inn. As a child, his body was susceptible to being easily possessed by spirits, causing misfortune in his childhood.

Kogarashi is extremely popular with the females around him with almost all of the female characters being a love interest of his and whether or not he notices their affection towards him is entirely unknown. The girls that have shown to be in love with him are Yuuna, Chisaki, Sagiri, Oboro, Hibari, and Karura, with the latter two having already confessed and been rejected by him although it only made them both bolder in their pursuits. He later sacrifices his life to save them after his body is stolen by an Oni that tried to kill them by destroying his own body. In his youth, he was always in several orphanages, and hated being possessed, because his body was weak to possession, acquiring skills of the ghosts, but always ridden in debt. \n;{{Nihongo|Yuuna Yunohana|\u6e6f\u30ce\u82b1 \u5e7d\u5948|Yunohana Y\u016bna}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Miyuri Shimabukuro]]}}<ref name=\"anime-staff\">{{cite web|title=Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs Anime Reveals Cast, Staff, 1st Promo Video, Summer 2018 Premiere|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-12-16/yuuna-and-the-haunted-hot-springs-anime-reveals-cast-staff-1st-promo-video-summer-2018-premiere/.125364|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=December 16, 2017|date=December 16, 2017}}</ref>\n:The titular character of the series.

She is the legendary Genry\u016bsai Tenko, a powerful warrior known for psychic prowess.

It was Sir John Vaughan who acquired from the Earl of Essex much of the former monastic lands of the [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] [[Strata Florida]]. At the same time further land was added to the estate through his marriage to Jane Stedman, daughter of John Stedman of Ystrad Fflur and Cilcennin.\n\nThe estate has been passed down in the [[Landed gentry|landed family]] from father to son in a direct line since it was acquired by marriage in 1200. The Vaughans are one of the few aristocratic families who have retained possession of a house since first taking it on in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nTrawsgoed became an [[Estate (house)|estate]] in the English sense of the word in the 16th century. Strata Florida Abbey, in the centre of Wales, was given to the [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|1st Earl of Essex]] to broker during the [[English Reformation]] and [[dissolution of the monasteries]], and he sold much of it to the Stedman family. Sir John Vaughan married the Stedman heiress<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iD4LAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA168&dq=trawsgoed+crosswood&ei=jd7NSJyUJYHYtgP7-LkI Annals and Antiquities of the Counties and County Families of Wales: Stedmans of Strata Florida]</ref> and his brother, Henry, her sister. So almost all the abbey estate was taken over by the Vaughans. In 1695, John Vaughan of Trawsgoed, the grandson of Sir John Vaughan, was created [[Viscount Lisburne]] in the peerage of Ireland. during the Civil War he married Malet, daughter of the poet and courtier, the [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], and granddaughter of the Cavalier, Sir [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester]], the victor of the [[Battle of Roundway Down]].\n\nThe Vaughan family was granted the title [[Earl of Lisburne]] in 1776 and remained at Trawsgoed mansion over successive generations. The family at one time owned estates in [[Northumberland]] and at Mamhead in [[Devon]]. In 1947 the mansion house became the headquarters of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] in Wales, and the home farm is still occupied by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ([[BBSRC]]) and managed by the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research ([[IGER]]).\n\n==Grounds==\nIn 1873, the Vaughan's estate acreage at Trawsgoed was the largest in Cardiganshire at {{convert|42666|acre|km2}} as listed in the government return of landowners.

He also had the library ceiling painted in the style of those at [[Windsor Castle]]. The house eventually included seventy rooms, a summerhouse, gardens with rare Chilean and Himalayan tree species that thrive in the mild moist climate of coastal Wales, the remains of a small [[Roman fort]] adjoining the grounds, fountain, stable block, lodge house, and unencumbered view of the [[Cambrian Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Property particulars|url=http://www.primelocation.com/for-sale/details/29198586?search_identifier=e3f87ac081f3af2528cfbae195434a58}}</ref>\n\nThe mansion house at Trawsgoed was sold in 2007 to the Edwards family, who spent five years restoring the house.

It was Sir John Vaughan who acquired from the Earl of Essex much of the former monastic lands of the [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] [[Strata Florida]]. At the same time further land was added to the estate through his marriage to Jane Stedman, daughter of John Stedman of Ystrad Fflur and Cilcennin.\n\nThe estate has been passed down in the [[Landed gentry|landed family]] from father to son in a direct line since it was acquired by marriage in 1200. The Vaughans are one of the few aristocratic families who have retained possession of a house since first taking it on in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nTrawsgoed became an [[Estate (house)|estate]] in the English sense of the word in the 16th century. Strata Florida Abbey, in the centre of Wales, was given to the [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|1st Earl of Essex]] to broker during the [[English Reformation]] and [[dissolution of the monasteries]], and he sold much of it to the Stedman family. Sir John Vaughan married the Stedman heiress<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iD4LAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA168&dq=trawsgoed+crosswood&ei=jd7NSJyUJYHYtgP7-LkI Annals and Antiquities of the Counties and County Families of Wales: Stedmans of Strata Florida]</ref> and his brother, Henry, her sister. So almost all the abbey estate was taken over by the Vaughans. In 1695, John Vaughan of Trawsgoed, the grandson of Sir John Vaughan, was created [[Viscount Lisburne]] in the peerage of Ireland. during the Civil War he married Malet, daughter of the poet and courtier, the [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], and granddaughter of the Cavalier, Sir [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester]], the victor of the [[Battle of Roundway Down]].\n\nThe Vaughan family was granted the title [[Earl of Lisburne]] in 1776 and remained at Trawsgoed mansion over successive generations. The family at one time owned estates in [[Northumberland]] and at Mamhead in [[Devon]]. In 1947 the mansion house became the headquarters of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] in Wales, and the home farm is still occupied by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ([[BBSRC]]) and managed by the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research ([[IGER]]).\n\n==Grounds==\nIn 1873, the Vaughan's estate acreage at Trawsgoed was the largest in Cardiganshire at {{convert|42666|acre|km2}} as listed in the government return of landowners. Sir Pryse Pryse of [[Gogerddan]] held 28,684, W.T.R.

It was chosen as a special stage in the British Rally from [[2006 Wales Rally GB|2006]] to [[2008 Wales Rally GB|2008]].\n\n==Trawsgoed Mansion==\n'''Trawsgoed Mansion''' is a 17th-century [[country house]], also known as Crosswood Park, formerly the seat of the [[Earl of Lisburne]]. It is a [[Grade II* listed]] building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-17258-trawsgoed-house-trawsgoed#.Voqvk09_cnM|title= \nTrawsgoed House, Trawsgoed Date Listed: 9 June 1996 Cadw Building ID: 17258|publisher= British Listed Buildings|accessdate = 4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt was Ernest George Henry, the 6th Earl of Lisburne, who added the 50-room Victorian wing to the old Georgian mansion and built the summerhouse, squash and tennis courts and the ornamental fountain. He also had the library ceiling painted in the style of those at [[Windsor Castle]]. The house eventually included seventy rooms, a summerhouse, gardens with rare Chilean and Himalayan tree species that thrive in the mild moist climate of coastal Wales, the remains of a small [[Roman fort]] adjoining the grounds, fountain, stable block, lodge house, and unencumbered view of the [[Cambrian Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Property particulars|url=http://www.primelocation.com/for-sale/details/29198586?search_identifier=e3f87ac081f3af2528cfbae195434a58}}</ref>\n\nThe mansion house at Trawsgoed was sold in 2007 to the Edwards family, who spent five years restoring the house.

The estate lets  shooting rights over and adjoining Forestry Commission woodlands and fishing rights on the River Ystwyth and Teifi. The house is set in listed parkland and gardens and is some eight miles (13&nbsp;km) inland from Aberystwyth.\n\nThe last remaining Vaughan member to be in residence at the house was the Honourable John Edward Malet Vaughan, born 3 Oct 1952.  He is the youngest child of [[Earl of Lisburne#Earls of Lisburne .281776.29|John David Malet Vaughan, 8th Earl of Lisburne]] and Shelagh Macauley.<ref>[http://thepeerage.com/p8194.htm#i81936 ThePeerage]</ref> Formerly a Director of Savills, John Vaughan is the Managing Director of Trawsgoed Estates, Ltd.<ref>[https://www.trawsgoed-estate.co.uk/ Trawsgoed Estates, Ltd.]</ref>\n\n==Lisburne Mines==\nThe Trawsgoed estate was home to the Lisburne (Lead) Mines, one of the most profitable in all of Wales.

A true case of hydrocephalus can be diagnosed by a veterinarian, though the prognosis is grim.\n\nApple head Chihuahuas can have [[molera]]s, or a soft spot in their skulls, and they are the only breed of dog to be born with an incomplete skull. This is not a defect; it is a normal adaptation facilitating the passage through the birth canal and growth and development of the domed type of forehead. The molera is predominant in the apple heads and is present in nearly all Chihuahua puppies. The molera fills in with age, but great care needs to be taken during the first six months until the skull is fully formed. Some moleras do not close completely and require extra care to prevent injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/molera.htm |title=Molera Statement |accessdate=2010-09-05 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403223157/http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/molera.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nChihuahua puppies can be at risk for [[hypoglycemia]] (low [[blood sugar]]). Signs of hypoglycemia include lethargy, sleepiness, uncoordinated walking, unfocused eyes, spasms of the neck muscles or head pulling back or to the side, fainting, and seizures. Hypoglycemia can be avoided with adequate nutrition and frequent feedings, especially for Chihuahuas that are younger, smaller, or leaner. Chihuahua owners should have a simple-sugar supplement on hand to use in emergencies, such as Nutri-Cal or corn syrup. These supplements can be rubbed on the gums and roof of the mouth to rapidly raise the blood sugar level.\n\nHowever, as with any dog, owners should take care not to overfeed their Chihuahua, since obesity can result in increased rates of joint injuries, tracheal collapse, [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], and shortened lifespan.\n\nAs in other breeds with large protruding eyes, Chihuahuas are prone to eye infections and eye injury. The eyes may water in response to dry air, dust, or airborne allergens.\n\n[[Tracheal collapse|Collapsed trachea]] is a health concern characteristic of the Chihuahua breed.<ref name=\"tracheal collapse\">{{cite web|url=http://www.famouschihuahua.com/chihuahua-health-concerns/tracheal-collapse-in-chihuahua-puppies-and-dogs|title=tracheal collapse in chihuahuas: a serious chihuahua respiratory problem|work=famous chihuahua}}</ref>\n\nChihuahuas may tremble or shiver when stressed, excited, or cold. These dogs, especially the short coat variety, are less tolerant of cold than larger breeds, and require a sweater/coat and/or boots in cold weather. They seek warmth in sunshine, under blankets, or on furniture, or human laps.\n\nSome Chihuahuas may present separation anxiety as a result of being so close and loyal to their owners. This is a fairly common cause behind any pacing, excessive salivating, destructive chewing, or barking, howling, or whining in dogs. Many [[Separation anxiety in dogs|treatments and tips]] can help prevent separation anxiety in dogs.\n\nThe lifespan for a Chihuahua is usually between 12 and 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/chihuahua|title=Chihuahua|work=Vetstreet}}</ref>\n\nChihuahuas are also known for [[luxating patella]], a genetic condition that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.\n\nChihuahuas are also prone to some heart-related disorders, such as heart murmurs and pulmonic stenosis, a condition in which the blood outflow from the heart's right ventricle is obstructed at the pulmonic valve.\n\n== Chihuahua crossbreeds ==\n\nApart from different types of Chihuahuas, breeders across the world started [[crossbreed]]ing Chihuahuas with other dog breeds in order to create breeds of mixed traits. The result of crossbreeding Chihuahuas with other dog breeds such as [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian dog]]s, [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]]s, [[Boston Terrier]]s, [[Pug]]s and so on, usually ends up in a dog breed of a Chihuahua's body size and the other parent breed's coat color and fur traits. \nThese are the most common Chihuahua crossbreeds:\n* Chihuahua and Pug - also called the Chug <ref name=\"Barking Royalty\">{{cite web|url=https://barkingroyalty.com/chihuahua-pug-mix/|title=Chug dog|work=Chug Dog \u2013 Ultimate Guide To The Chihuahua Pug Mix|publisher=Barking Royalty|location=barkingroyalty.com}}</ref>\n* Chihuahua and [[Bichon Frise]] - also called the Chi Chon\n* Chihuahua and Boston Terrier - also known as the Boston Huahua\n* Chihuahua and [[Pekingese]] - also known as the Cheek \n* Chihuahua and [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]] - also known as the Chilier <ref name=\"The Dogs Journal\">{{cite web|url=https://thedogsjournal.com/chilier-dog-breed-info/|title=Chilier dog|work=Chilier Dog Breed Info (Chihuahua Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Mix)|publisher=The DOgs Journal|location=thedogsjournal.com}}</ref>\n* Chihuahua and [[Jack Russell Terrier|Jack Russell]] - also called the Jack Huahua\n* Chihuahua and Pomeranian - also called the Pomchi\n* Chihuahua and Pembroke Welsh Corgi - also called the Chigi\n* Chihuahua and [[Poodle]] - also known as Chipoo\n* Chihuahua and Dachshund - also called the Chiweenie \n* Chihuahua and MinPin (Miniature Pinscher) - also called the Chipin\nPoodles and Bichon Frise dog breeds are often used in crossbreeding because of their hypoallergenic fur.

Many breeders try to breed Chihuahuas as small as possible, because those marketed as \"teacup\" or \"tiny teacup\" command higher prices.<ref>{{cite news|last=Segovia|first=Stacey Smith |date=March 21, 2004|title= Runt of the litter|work= The Leaf Chronicle|id={{ProQuest|441596979}}|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/293813349/ }}</ref>\n\nChihuahuas occur in virtually any color combination, from solid to marked or splashed,<ref name=\"AKC\">[http://www.akc.org/breeds/chihuahua/index.cfm American Kennel Club Chihuahua page], retrieved on July 29, 2007.</ref> allowing for colors from solid black to solid white, spotted, sabled, or a variety of other colors and patterns.

No color or pattern is considered more valuable than another.\n\nThe [[Merle (dog coat)|merle coat pattern]], which appears mottled, is not traditionally considered part of the breed standard. In May 2007, [[The Kennel Club]] decided not to register puppies with this coloration due to the health risks associated with the responsible gene, and in December of that year, formally amended its breed standard to disqualify merle dogs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/183 |title=Kennel Club breed standard |publisher=Thekennelclub.org.uk |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=August 14, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103063619/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/183 |archivedate=January 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, which represents the major kennel clubs of 84 countries, also disqualified merle.<ref name=\"FCI\" /> Other countries' kennel clubs, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany, have also disqualified merle. However, in May 2008, the Chihuahua Club of America voted that merles would not be disqualified in the United States, and would be fully registrable and able to compete in AKC events. Opponents of merle recognition suspect the coloration came about by modern crossbreeding with other dogs and not by natural [[genetic drift]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chihuahuasaspets.com/showing-chihuahuas/|title=Chihuahua Breed Standards {{!}} Chihuahuas as Pets|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-19}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n=== Apple head vs. Deer head Chihuahuas ===\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = \n| image1 = Chihuahua-Dog.JPG\n| alt1 = Profile of deer-headed dog\n| caption1 = A shorthair deer head Chihuahua.\n| image2 = Standard razza chihuahua.jpg\n| caption2 = A shorthair apple head Chihuahua; note the pronounced stop.\n| alt2 = Profile of apple head dog\n}}\nDogs of any coat type may be identified as either \"apple head\" or \"deer head\" Chihuahuas. Apple heads have rounded heads, close-set eyes, and relatively short ears and legs. Deer heads have flat-topped heads, more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer, more slender legs. Deer heads were the breed standard conformation in the mid-20th century, but current breed standards defined by registries such as the AKC specify the apple-head conformation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Apple Head Chihuahua is known for having a round/apple \n-shaped head and a definite \u201cstop\u201d whereas a Deer Head Chihuahua \u201cmay\u201d have a flatter head, thinner skull, but is unlikely to have a \u201cstop\u201d and will probably have a much longer nose.

There is no scientific evidence that Apple Heads have a higher risk of getting respiratory issues, due to having a smaller airway. Deer Headed Chihuahuas are not allowed in the AKC due to not meeting the standards that Apple Heads do.

They are often found under the covers or at the bottom of the bed, deep in the dark and safety of what they perceive as their den. Chihuahuas also enjoy time in sunlight.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coile|first1=D.

Chihuahuas have their own type of personality. They tend to be alert. Chihuahuas typically do not show fear; even though they are a smaller breed, they do not view their size as a disadvantage. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/chihuahua|title=Chihuahua Dog Breed Information|website=Vetstreet|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Teacup Chihuahuas ==\nJust like Apple Head and Deer Head Chihuahuas, Teacup Chihuahuas are from the same breed but have a different appearance. A Teacup Chihuahua on average doesn't weigh more than four pounds. In a household they may need a little more looking after due to their small\u00a0size. Teacup Chihuahuas can have either short or long hair. Although a Teacup is much smaller in size, they still have the same confident and energetic personality as a full-sized Chihuahua. It is also very risky for Teacup Chihuahuas to have puppies due to their size. It can cause many complications and put their life at risk. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pets.thenest.com/teacup-chihuahua-3557.html|title=Teacup Chihuahua Facts|last=Quarters|first=Cindy|website=pets.thenest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Compared to the typical lifespan of a Chihuahua, a Teacup's lifespan tends to be much shorter due to the health issues they are more prone to have because of their small size.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Health==\n[[File:Chihuahua puppy (toronjazul).jpg|thumb|Chihuahua puppy]]\nThis breed requires expert veterinary attention in areas such as birthing and dental care. Dental care is a must for these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth. Although daily brushing provides the best preventive measure, feeding a dental diet or using dental chews for dogs is an effective approach pet owners can take to help prevent and control accumulation of plaque and tartar to avoid consequences of severe periodontal disease.<ref>{{citation |last=Logan |first=Ellen I. |title=Dietary Influences on Periodontal Health in Dogs and Cats |journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice |publisher=Elsivier Saunders |volume=36 |issue=6 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.cvsm.2006.09.002 |pmid=17085242 |pages=1385\u20131401}}</ref> The best [[Dental health diets for dogs#cite note-Logan 2-2|physical characteristics of dog food]] to contribute to cleaning a dog's teeth would be food that is large and dense, so more time is spent chewing, which leads to the surface of the teeth being cleaned.\n\nChihuahuas, and other toy breeds, can be affected by [[hydrocephalus]].<ref name=\"UFAW website\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufaw.org.uk/hydrocephaluschihuahua.php|title=Hydrocephalus|work=Genetic Welfare Problems of Companion Animals|publisher=Universities Federation for Animal Welfare|location=ufaw.org.uk|accessdate=February 10, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410080452/http://www.ufaw.org.uk/hydrocephaluschihuahua.php|archivedate=April 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Chihuahua puppies with hydrocephalus have an abnormally large head, are lethargic, and do not grow at the same pace as their siblings. A true case of hydrocephalus can be diagnosed by a veterinarian, though the prognosis is grim.\n\nApple head Chihuahuas can have [[molera]]s, or a soft spot in their skulls, and they are the only breed of dog to be born with an incomplete skull. This is not a defect; it is a normal adaptation facilitating the passage through the birth canal and growth and development of the domed type of forehead. The molera is predominant in the apple heads and is present in nearly all Chihuahua puppies. The molera fills in with age, but great care needs to be taken during the first six months until the skull is fully formed. Some moleras do not close completely and require extra care to prevent injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/molera.htm |title=Molera Statement |accessdate=2010-09-05 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403223157/http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/molera.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nChihuahua puppies can be at risk for [[hypoglycemia]] (low [[blood sugar]]). Signs of hypoglycemia include lethargy, sleepiness, uncoordinated walking, unfocused eyes, spasms of the neck muscles or head pulling back or to the side, fainting, and seizures. Hypoglycemia can be avoided with adequate nutrition and frequent feedings, especially for Chihuahuas that are younger, smaller, or leaner. Chihuahua owners should have a simple-sugar supplement on hand to use in emergencies, such as Nutri-Cal or corn syrup. These supplements can be rubbed on the gums and roof of the mouth to rapidly raise the blood sugar level.\n\nHowever, as with any dog, owners should take care not to overfeed their Chihuahua, since obesity can result in increased rates of joint injuries, tracheal collapse, [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], and shortened lifespan.\n\nAs in other breeds with large protruding eyes, Chihuahuas are prone to eye infections and eye injury. The eyes may water in response to dry air, dust, or airborne allergens.\n\n[[Tracheal collapse|Collapsed trachea]] is a health concern characteristic of the Chihuahua breed.<ref name=\"tracheal collapse\">{{cite web|url=http://www.famouschihuahua.com/chihuahua-health-concerns/tracheal-collapse-in-chihuahua-puppies-and-dogs|title=tracheal collapse in chihuahuas: a serious chihuahua respiratory problem|work=famous chihuahua}}</ref>\n\nChihuahuas may tremble or shiver when stressed, excited, or cold. These dogs, especially the short coat variety, are less tolerant of cold than larger breeds, and require a sweater/coat and/or boots in cold weather. They seek warmth in sunshine, under blankets, or on furniture, or human laps.\n\nSome Chihuahuas may present separation anxiety as a result of being so close and loyal to their owners. This is a fairly common cause behind any pacing, excessive salivating, destructive chewing, or barking, howling, or whining in dogs. Many [[Separation anxiety in dogs|treatments and tips]] can help prevent separation anxiety in dogs.\n\nThe lifespan for a Chihuahua is usually between 12 and 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/chihuahua|title=Chihuahua|work=Vetstreet}}</ref>\n\nChihuahuas are also known for [[luxating patella]], a genetic condition that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.\n\nChihuahuas are also prone to some heart-related disorders, such as heart murmurs and pulmonic stenosis, a condition in which the blood outflow from the heart's right ventricle is obstructed at the pulmonic valve.\n\n== Chihuahua crossbreeds ==\n\nApart from different types of Chihuahuas, breeders across the world started [[crossbreed]]ing Chihuahuas with other dog breeds in order to create breeds of mixed traits. The result of crossbreeding Chihuahuas with other dog breeds such as [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian dog]]s, [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]]s, [[Boston Terrier]]s, [[Pug]]s and so on, usually ends up in a dog breed of a Chihuahua's body size and the other parent breed's coat color and fur traits. \nThese are the most common Chihuahua crossbreeds:\n* Chihuahua and Pug - also called the Chug <ref name=\"Barking Royalty\">{{cite web|url=https://barkingroyalty.com/chihuahua-pug-mix/|title=Chug dog|work=Chug Dog \u2013 Ultimate Guide To The Chihuahua Pug Mix|publisher=Barking Royalty|location=barkingroyalty.com}}</ref>\n* Chihuahua and [[Bichon Frise]] - also called the Chi Chon\n* Chihuahua and Boston Terrier - also known as the Boston Huahua\n* Chihuahua and [[Pekingese]] - also known as the Cheek \n* Chihuahua and [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]] - also known as the Chilier <ref name=\"The Dogs Journal\">{{cite web|url=https://thedogsjournal.com/chilier-dog-breed-info/|title=Chilier dog|work=Chilier Dog Breed Info (Chihuahua Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Mix)|publisher=The DOgs Journal|location=thedogsjournal.com}}</ref>\n* Chihuahua and [[Jack Russell Terrier|Jack Russell]] - also called the Jack Huahua\n* Chihuahua and Pomeranian - also called the Pomchi\n* Chihuahua and Pembroke Welsh Corgi - also called the Chigi\n* Chihuahua and [[Poodle]] - also known as Chipoo\n* Chihuahua and Dachshund - also called the Chiweenie \n* Chihuahua and MinPin (Miniature Pinscher) - also called the Chipin\nPoodles and Bichon Frise dog breeds are often used in crossbreeding because of their hypoallergenic fur.

Northwest of Darbun, two frame homes were completely leveled, one of which was removed off its foundation. A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado rolled a mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. Two fatalities occurred in the county.

It occurs after [[autumn]] and before [[spring (season)|spring]] in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]] being oriented away from the [[Sun]]. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.  When it is winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[summer]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with [[snow]] and [[freezing]] temperatures. The moment of [[winter solstice]] is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole).  The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with [[daytime|day length]] increasing and [[nighttime|night length]] decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see [[Analemma#Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset|earliest and latest sun correct\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''winter'' comes from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] noun ''*wintru-'', whose origin is unclear. Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*wed-'' 'water' or a nasal infix variant ''*wend-''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Winter &#124; Origin and meaning of winter by Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2015-02-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154139/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n{{See also|Effect of Sun angle on climate}}\nThe tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44\u00b0 to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.\n\nDuring winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of [[solar radiation]] strikes the Earth per unit of surface area. Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the distance of the Earth from the Sun (due to the Earth's elliptical orbit) is negligible.\n\nThe manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snow\u2013prone latitudes is highly variable depending on elevation, position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation. For instance, within [[Canada]] (a country of cold winters), [[Winnipeg]] on the [[Great Plains]], a long way from the ocean, has a January high of {{convert|-11.3|C|F}} and a low of {{convert|-21.4|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&amp;StationName=Winnipeg&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 Station Data for Winnipeg|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905075212/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&StationName=Winnipeg&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1|archivedate=5 September 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2013-09-25}}</ref> In comparison, [[Vancouver]] on the west coast with a marine influence from moderating Pacific winds has a January low of {{convert|1.4|C|F}} with days well above freezing at {{convert|6.9|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1|title=Canadian climate normals 1981\u20132010 Station Data for Vancouver|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084829/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all|date=2013-09-25}}</ref> Both places are at 49\u00b0N latitude, and in the same western half of the continent.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40\u00b0S makes the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly [[Patagonia]] region of South Argentina. Snow occurs year-round in [[Antarctica]].\n\n==Astronomical and other calendar-based reckoning==\n[[File:KleinarlWinterwonderland.jpg|thumb|In the [[mid-latitudes]] and [[Polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], winter is associated with snow and ice.]]\n[[File:Neve Caxias do Sul (2).jpg|thumb|In the [[Southern Hemisphere]] winter extends from June to September, pictured in [[Caxias do Sul]] in the southern highlands of [[Brazil]].]]\n[[File:Hamburg Germany Jan 6.jpg|thumb|[[Sea ice]] in the [[Port of Hamburg]], Germany]]\n\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], some authorities define the period of '''winter''' based on astronomical fixed points (i.e. based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun), regardless of weather conditions.

In [[Celtic nations]] such as Ireland (using the [[Irish calendar]]) and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on [[Halloween|All Hallows]], or [[Samhain]]. Winter ends and spring begins on [[Imbolc]], or [[Candlemas]], which is 1 or 2 February. This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. (The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere and May, June and July in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].)\n\nAlso, many mainland European countries tended to recognize [[Martinmas]] or [[St. Martin's Day]] (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYT8MPFl_egC&pg=PA219|title=Folk-Taxonomies in Early English|last=Anderson|first=Earl R.|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8386-3916-0|location=Madison, N.J.|pages=219|quote=\"On St. Martin's day (11 November) winter begins, summer takes its end, harvest is completed. ...This text is one of many that preserves vestiges of the ancient Indo-European system of two seasons, winter and summer.\"}}</ref> The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian equinox and [[solstice]] dates. Also, [[Valentine's Day]] (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring, such as flowers blooming.\n\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]] and other East Asian [[Chinese calendar|calendars]], winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, with the ''[[Jieqi|Ji\u00e9q\u00ec]]'' (known as \u7acb\u51ac ''l\u00ec d\u014dng'' \u2013 literally, \"establishment of winter\").\n\nThe three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere and lasts through late February or early March. This \"thermological winter\" is earlier than the solstice delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic) definition. Depending on [[seasonal lag]], this period will vary between climatic regions.\n\nCultural influences such as [[Christmas creep]] may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years, although high latitude countries like Canada are usually well into their real winters before the December solstice.\n\nSince by almost all definitions valid for the Northern Hemisphere, winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the season is split across years, just like summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. \"Winter 2018\". Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. \"Winter 18/19\", or settling on the year the season starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions.\n\n==Ecological reckoning and activity==\n[[File:Snowshoe hare.jpg|thumb|right|The [[snowshoe hare]], and some other animals, change color in winter.]]\nEcological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates.  It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term ''hibernal'' for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal).<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate = 30 May 2012 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602225322/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | archivedate = 2 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth.  The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.\n\nTo survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for [[overwintering]]:\n*[[Bird migration|Migration]] is a common effect of winter upon animals, notably birds. However, the majority of birds do not migrate{{snd}}the [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]] and [[European robin]], for example. Some [[butterfly|butterflies]] also migrate seasonally.\n*[[Hibernation]] is a state of reduced [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] during the winter. Some animals \"sleep\" during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns; e.g., [[Gopher (animal)|gopher]]s, frogs, snakes, and bats.\n*Some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely. This is the case for [[squirrel]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[badger]]s, and [[raccoon]]s.\n*Resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature. The color of the fur or plumage changes to white (in order to be confused with snow) and thus retains its [[cryptic (zoology)|cryptic]] coloration year-round. Examples are the [[rock ptarmigan]], [[Arctic fox]], [[weasel]], [[hare|white-tailed jackrabbit]], and [[mountain hare]].\n*Some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter; this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur. The coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling. The heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for [[Animal trapping|trapper]]s, who sought more profitable skins.\n*Snow also affects the ways animals behave; many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it. Mice and [[vole]]s typically live under the snow layer.\n\nSome [[annual plant]]s never survive the winter. Other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle; this is known as [[vernalization]]. As for [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly [[deciduous|deciduous trees]], usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the [[prunus mume|flowering plum]], which flowers in time for [[Chinese New Year]]. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]].\n\n==Exceptionally cold winters==\n[[File:Frost Fair of 1683.JPG|right|thumb|River Thames frost fair, 1683]]\n*1683\u20131684, \"The Great Frost\", when the [[Thames]], hosting the [[River Thames frost fairs]], was frozen all the way up to the London Bridge and remained frozen for about two months.

The unusual coolness of the winter of 1815\u20131816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia, in April 1815.  There were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810, and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814.  The cumulative effects were worldwide, but were especially strong in the Eastern United States, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Europe. Frost formed in May in New England, killing many newly planted crops, and the summer never recovered. Snow fell in New York and Maine in June, and ice formed in lakes and rivers in July and August. In the UK, snow drifts remained on hills until late July, and the Thames froze in September.

It occurs after [[autumn]] and before [[spring (season)|spring]] in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]] being oriented away from the [[Sun]]. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.  When it is winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[summer]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with [[snow]] and [[freezing]] temperatures. The moment of [[winter solstice]] is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole).  The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with [[daytime|day length]] increasing and [[nighttime|night length]] decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see [[Analemma#Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset|earliest and latest sunrise and sunset]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''winter'' comes from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] noun ''*wintru-'', whose origin is unclear. Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*wed-'' 'water' or a nasal infix variant ''*wend-''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Winter &#124; Origin and meaning of winter by Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2015-02-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154139/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n{{See also|Effect of Sun angle on climate}}\nThe tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44\u00b0 to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.\n\nDuring winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of [[solar radiation]] strikes the Earth per unit of surface area. Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the distance of the Earth from the Sun (due to the Earth's elliptical orbit) is negligible.\n\nThe manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snow\u2013prone latitudes is highly variable depending on elevation, position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation. For instance, within [[Canada]] (a country of cold winters), [[Winnipeg]] on the [[Great Plains]], a long way from the ocean, has a January high of {{convert|-11.3|C|F}} and a low of {{convert|-21.4|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&amp;StationName=Winnipeg&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 Station Data for Winnipeg|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905075212/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&StationName=Winnipeg&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1|archivedate=5 September 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2013-09-25}}</ref> In comparison, [[Vancouver]] on the west coast with a marine influence from moderating Pacific winds has a January low of {{convert|1.4|C|F}} with days well above freezing at {{convert|6.9|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1|title=Canadian climate normals 1981\u20132010 Station Data for Vancouver|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084829/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all|date=2013-09-25}}</ref> Both places are at 49\u00b0N latitude, and in the same western half of the continent.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40\u00b0S makes the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly [[Patagonia]] region of South Argentina.

In [[Celtic nations]] such as Ireland (using the [[Irish calendar]]) and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on [[Halloween|All Hallows]], or [[Samhain]]. Winter ends and spring begins on [[Imbolc]], or [[Candlemas]], which is 1 or 2 February. This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. (The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere and May, June and July in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].)\n\nAlso, many mainland European countries tended to recognize [[Martinmas]] or [[St. Martin's Day]] (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYT8MPFl_egC&pg=PA219|title=Folk-Taxonomies in Early English|last=Anderson|first=Earl R.|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8386-3916-0|location=Madison, N.J.|pages=219|quote=\"On St. Martin's day (11 November) winter begins, summer takes its end, harvest is completed. ...This text is one of many that preserves vestiges of the ancient Indo-European system of two seasons, winter and summer.\"}}</ref> The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian equinox and [[solstice]] dates. Also, [[Valentine's Day]] (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring, such as flowers blooming.\n\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]] and other East Asian [[Chinese calendar|calendars]], winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, with the ''[[Jieqi|Ji\u00e9q\u00ec]]'' (known as \u7acb\u51ac ''l\u00ec d\u014dng'' \u2013 literally, \"establishment of winter\").\n\nThe three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere and lasts through late February or early March. This \"thermological winter\" is earlier than the solstice delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic) definition. Depending on [[seasonal lag]], this period will vary between climatic regions.\n\nCultural influences such as [[Christmas creep]] may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years, although high latitude countries like Canada are usually well into their real winters before the December solstice.\n\nSince by almost all definitions valid for the Northern Hemisphere, winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the season is split across years, just like summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. \"Winter 2018\". Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. \"Winter 18/19\", or settling on the year the season starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions.\n\n==Ecological reckoning and activity==\n[[File:Snowshoe hare.jpg|thumb|right|The [[snowshoe hare]], and some other animals, change color in winter.]]\nEcological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates.  It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term ''hibernal'' for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal).<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate = 30 May 2012 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602225322/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | archivedate = 2 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth.  The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.\n\nTo survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for [[overwintering]]:\n*[[Bird migration|Migration]] is a common effect of winter upon animals, notably birds. However, the majority of birds do not migrate{{snd}}the [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]] and [[European robin]], for example. Some [[butterfly|butterflies]] also migrate seasonally.\n*[[Hibernation]] is a state of reduced [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] during the winter. Some animals \"sleep\" during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns; e.g., [[Gopher (animal)|gopher]]s, frogs, snakes, and bats.\n*Some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely. This is the case for [[squirrel]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[badger]]s, and [[raccoon]]s.\n*Resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature. The color of the fur or plumage changes to white (in order to be confused with snow) and thus retains its [[cryptic (zoology)|cryptic]] coloration year-round. Examples are the [[rock ptarmigan]], [[Arctic fox]], [[weasel]], [[hare|white-tailed jackrabbit]], and [[mountain hare]].\n*Some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter; this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur. The coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling. The heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for [[Animal trapping|trapper]]s, who sought more profitable skins.\n*Snow also affects the ways animals behave; many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it. Mice and [[vole]]s typically live under the snow layer.\n\nSome [[annual plant]]s never survive the winter. Other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle; this is known as [[vernalization]]. As for [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly [[deciduous|deciduous trees]], usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the [[prunus mume|flowering plum]], which flowers in time for [[Chinese New Year]]. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]].\n\n==Exceptionally cold winters==\n[[File:Frost Fair of 1683.JPG|right|thumb|River Thames frost fair, 1683]]\n*1683\u20131684, \"The Great Frost\", when the [[Thames]], hosting the [[River Thames frost fairs]], was frozen all the way up to the London Bridge and remained frozen for about two months.  Ice was about {{convert|27|cm|abbr=on}} thick in London and about {{convert|120|cm|abbr=on}} thick in Somerset. The sea froze up to {{convert|2|mi}} out around the coast of the southern North Sea, causing severe problems for shipping and preventing use of many harbours.\n*1739\u20131740, one of the most severe winters in the UK on record. The Thames remained frozen over for about 8 weeks. The [[Irish Famine (1740\u20131741)|Irish famine]] of 1740\u20131741 claimed the lives of at least 300,000 people.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cormac O Grada|title=Famine: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LoN2XkjJio4C&pg=PA23|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12237-3|page=23}}</ref>\n*1816 was the [[Year Without a Summer]] in the Northern Hemisphere. The unusual coolness of the winter of 1815\u20131816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia, in April 1815.  There were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810, and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814.  The cumulative effects were worldwide, but were especially strong in the Eastern United States, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Europe. Frost formed in May in New England, killing many newly planted crops, and the summer never recovered. Snow fell in New York and Maine in June, and ice formed in lakes and rivers in July and August. In the UK, snow drifts remained on hills until late July, and the Thames froze in September. Agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in food shortages and the worst famine of the 19th century.\n*1887\u20131888, there were record cold temperatures in the Upper Midwest, heavy snowfalls worldwide, and amazing storms, including the [[Schoolhouse Blizzard]] of 1888 (in the Midwest in January), and the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]] (in the Eastern US and Canada in March).\n*In Europe, the winters of early 1947,<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.winter1947.co.uk |title=Winter 1947 in the British Isles |journal=Weather |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=61\u201368 |accessdate=22 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112022825/http://www.winter1947.co.uk/ |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=2007Wthr...62...61B |last1=Booth |first1=George |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/wea.66 }}</ref> February 1956, 1962\u20131963, 1981\u20131982 and [[Winter of 2009\u20132010 in Europe|2009\u20132010]] were abnormally cold.  The UK winter of 1946\u20131947 started out relatively normal, but became one of the snowiest UK winters to date, with nearly continuous snowfall from late January until March.\n*In South America the winter of 1975 was one of the strongest, with record snow occurring at 25\u00b0S in cities of low altitude, with registration of \u221217&nbsp;\u00b0C (1.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) in some parts of southern Brazil.\n*\n*In the eastern United States and Canada, the winter of [[2013\u201314 North American winter|2013\u20132014]] and the second half of February 2015 were abnormally cold.

The cold began on Christmas Eve and lasted until late March, with a few temporary warm-ups. The Severn and Thames froze, and frost fairs started up again. The French army tried to invade the Netherlands over its frozen rivers, while the Dutch fleet was stuck in its harbor. The winter had easterlies (from Siberia) as its dominant feature.\n*1813\u20131814, severe cold, last freeze-over of Thames, and last frost fair. (Removal of old London Bridge and changes to river's banks made freeze-overs less likely.)\n*1883\u20131888, colder temperatures worldwide, including an unbroken string of abnormally cold and brutal winters in the Upper Midwest, related to the explosion of [[Krakatoa]] in August 1883.  There was snow recorded in the UK as early as October and as late as July during this time period.\n*1976\u20131977, one of the coldest winters in the US in decades.\n*1985, Arctic outbreak in US resulting from shift in polar vortex, with many cold temperature records broken.\n*2002\u20132003 was an unusually cold winter in the Northern and Eastern US.\n*2010\u20132011, persistent bitter cold in the entire eastern half of the US from December onward, with few or no mid-winter warm-ups, and with cool conditions continuing into spring. [[La Ni\u00f1a]] and negative [[Arctic oscillation]] were strong factors. Heavy and persistent precipitation contributed to almost constant snow cover in the Northeastern US which finally receded in early May.\n*2011 was one of the coldest on record in [[New Zealand]] with sea level snow falling in [[Wellington]] in July for the first time in 35 years and a much heavier snowstorm for 3 days in a row in August.\n\n==Humans and winter==\nHumans are sensitive to cold, see [[hypothermia]].

The legend claims that Nizam gave the gold to Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] in 1965, when the latter visited Hyderabad during an India-wide tour to raise funds for the post-war economy. According to the story, Nizam asked only the boxes containing the gold to be returned.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn reality, the Nizam did not donate 5,000&nbsp;kg of gold, he invested 425&nbsp;kg of gold in the National Defence Gold Scheme. The Scheme was floated by the government in October 1965 to deal with an economic crisis, and the investors were offered a 6.5% interest rate. The scheme included an amnesty clause: the gold acquired using income not disclosed to the income tax authorities was exempted from tax, if invested in the scheme. The Nizam indeed met Shastri in Hyderabad, and agreed to invest 425&nbsp;kg of old gold [[mohur]]s (coins), which were valued at {{INR}} 5 million at the time. Shastri later thanked the Nizam at a public meeting, stating that the government planned to send these gold coins to foreign countries, expecting to obtain {{INR}} 10 million in return.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear who received the return on this investment. In 2018, the Nizam's grandson [[Mir Najaf Ali Khan]] stated that according to his knowledge, none of the 52 trusts created by the Nizam had received any money from this investment. English-language newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]'' submitted a [[Right to Information Act, 2005|Right to Information]] query to the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) in 2018 asking for information on the investment and the final beneficiary. However, the RBI refused to provide this information, citing \"unwarranted invasion of the privacy\" clause of the RTI law.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\"/>\n\n== Operation Polo and forced abdication ==\n\n[[File:OsmanNehruJN.jpg|thumb|175px|(From left to right): Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the Nizam and Major [[Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri]] after Hyderabad's accession to India]]\n\n{{Main|Indian annexation of Hyderabad}}\n\nAfter Indian independence in 1947, the country was partitioned into [[India]] and Pakistan. The princely states were left free to make whatever arrangement they wished with either India or Pakistan. The Nizam ruled over more than 16 million people and {{convert|82698|sqmi|km2}} of territory when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. The Nizam refused to join either India or Pakistan, preferring to form a separate independent kingdom within the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nThis proposal for independence was rejected by the British government, but the Nizam continued to explore it. Towards this end, he kept up open negotiations with the Government of India regarding the modalities of a future relationship while opening covert negotiations with Pakistan in a similar vein. The Nizam cited the [[Razakars (Hyderabad)|Razakars]] as evidence that the people of the state were opposed to any agreement with India.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nUltimately the new Indian government decided to invade and capture Hyderabad in 1948, in an operation code named [[Operation Polo]]. Under the supervision of Major General [[Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri]], one division of the [[Indian Army]] and a tank brigade invaded Hyderabad.\n\n==Title conferred==\n\nThe Nizam was the honorary Colonel of the 20 Deccan Horse.

The legend claims that Nizam gave the gold to Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] in 1965, when the latter visited Hyderabad during an India-wide tour to raise funds for the post-war economy. According to the story, Nizam asked only the boxes containing the gold to be returned.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn reality, the Nizam did not donate 5,000&nbsp;kg of gold, he invested 425&nbsp;kg of gold in the National Defence Gold Scheme. The Scheme was floated by the government in October 1965 to deal with an economic crisis, and the investors were offered a 6.5% interest rate. The scheme included an amnesty clause: the gold acquired using income not disclosed to the income tax authorities was exempted from tax, if invested in the scheme. The Nizam indeed met Shastri in Hyderabad, and agreed to invest 425&nbsp;kg of old gold [[mohur]]s (coins), which were valued at {{INR}} 5 million at the time. Shastri later thanked the Nizam at a public meeting, stating that the government planned to send these gold coins to foreign countries, expecting to obtain {{INR}} 10 million in return.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear who received the return on this investment. In 2018, the Nizam's grandson [[Mir Najaf Ali Khan]] stated that according to his knowledge, none of the 52 trusts created by the Nizam had received any money from this investment. English-language newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]'' submitted a [[Right to Information Act, 2005|Right to Information]] query to the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) in 2018 asking for information on the investment and the final beneficiary.

The Nizam refused to join either India or Pakistan, preferring to form a separate independent kingdom within the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nThis proposal for independence was rejected by the British government, but the Nizam continued to explore it. Towards this end, he kept up open negotiations with the Government of India regarding the modalities of a future relationship while opening covert negotiations with Pakistan in a similar vein.
