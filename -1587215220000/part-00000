The keep walls are about five feet thick and the vaults on the basement are well preserved, however most of the superstructure is entirely demolished. The keep represents the original castle, much altered. The central portion of the castle may be 15th century and was intended to form a defence to the access into the keep. The additional buildings are of a later date and contain two kitchens on the ground level, one for the castle and the other for the retainers. To the north-east stands a detached wall which may have led to a gateway. A drawbridge may have stood nearby and the chapel may have been located against the thick wall of the central part of the castle.<ref name=\"MacGibbon, T p. 344\"/> A moat or fosse protected the approach and a wall may have also existed.<ref name=\"Macintosh, John 1894 p. 179\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s excavations showed that a [[hall house]] was built across the 13th century court in the 14th century.<ref>Salter, Mike (2009). ''The Castles of South-West Scotland.'' Malvern : Folly. {{ISBN|1-871731-70-4}}. p. 41</ref>\n\nBeneath the castle is a cavern, called the Browney's Cave which may have been a sally-port; a secret tunnel leading to the castle.<ref>Grose, Francis (1797). ''The Antiquities of Scotland''. High Holborn : Hooper and Wigstead. p. 196.</ref>\n\nIn 1429 a meeting took place at Dunure between James Campbell, representing King James I of Scotland and John Mor MacDonald, representing the Lord of the Isles. Violence broke out and MacDonald was killed. James I's efforts to contain the outrage of the Lords of the Isles by executing Campbell did not prevent a subsequent uprising by them. For three days from 4 August 1563, Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed at Dunure Castle on her Royal tour down the west coast to Glenluce Abbey then on to Whithorn Priory. She was the guest of Gilbert Kennedy, the 4th Earl of Cassilis.<ref name=\"Carruth\"/>\n\n===Doocot===\nThe late medieval \"beehive\"-shaped dovecot of Dunure Castle dates probably from the 15th century. It would have held some 200&nbsp;nesting boxes and would have supplied the castle with fresh eggs and meat.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/aogg/871430784/ Dunure Doocot on flikr.]</ref>\n\n===Demise===\n[[File:Dunure Castle, Ayrshire, 1840.jpg|thumb|250px|Dunure and the castle in 1840]]\n[[File:Dunure Castle and headland.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Dunure Castle and headland from the south.]]\nThis began in the mid-17th century and by 1694 the castle is described as \"wholly ruined\". It is not clear whether this can be linked to the Civil War period, although local tradition suggests that Dunure had been burnt and / or blown up. A major collapse of the SE part of the keep could perhaps be linked to such activity. Recovery of building materials for the construction of the Cromwellian citadel in Ayr may also account for its ruination, as at [[Ardrossan Castle]]. Much evidence exists for the systematic dismantling of the structure for recoverable building materials including the orderly removal of slates, stone and glass. The windows were dismantled and comprehensively stripped of their lead. Remains of a localised fire and associated deposits of coal suggested that smelting of the lead took place within the room. Those dismantling the castle seem to have occupied part of the structure during their work.\n\nThe ruin subsequently saw periodic robbing of its sandstone dressings. A range of castle buildings to the S of Area 4 remained in occupation until c.&nbsp;1860. Census records and reuse of some rooms demonstrate that some of the occupants were fishermen. A large midden of mussel shell gave evidence for the baiting of cod lines. Domestic refuse of the later 18th and early to mid-19th century was also recovered. The only relatively late recorded military action at Dunure consists of a short siege in 1570. A Civil War action or slighting is a further possibility, although the castle may have been abandoned by that time. The route of a stone-lined water course was located at the S end of the trench as it ran into the entrance of the Area 4 kitchen range. Groundworks to the S of the ruins located a further, well preserved section of the same water course.<ref>[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/40938/details/dunure+castle/ RCAHMS Scotland.]</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe castle has been excavated and consolidated, making safe the public access to the area. The castle dominates the Kennedy Park, which has a number of facilities for visitors. There are also said to be secret [[Ley tunnel]]s which connect Dunure Castle to Greenan Castle further north.\n\nCanadian billionaire [[Brendan Clouston]] of Dunure is the Baron of Dunure (2009) as registered with the Lord Lyon King of Arms.<ref>[http://www.burkespeerage.com/familyhomepage.aspx?FID=0&FN=DUNURE Burke's Peerage.

Sir Thomas has an illegitimate daughter and he hopes that the two will marry.

The keep walls are about five feet thick and the vaults on the basement are well preserved, however most of the superstructure is entirely demolished. The keep represents the original castle, much altered. The central portion of the castle may be 15th century and was intended to form a defence to the access into the keep. The additional buildings are of a later date and contain two kitchens on the ground level, one for the castle and the other for the retainers. To the north-east stands a detached wall which may have led to a gateway. A drawbridge may have stood nearby and the chapel may have been located against the thick wall of the central part of the castle.<ref name=\"MacGibbon, T p. 344\"/> A moat or fosse protected the approach and a wall may have also existed.<ref name=\"Macintosh, John 1894 p. 179\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s excavations showed that a [[hall house]] was built across the 13th century court in the 14th century.<ref>Salter, Mike (2009).

''The Antiquities of Scotland''. High Holborn : Hooper and Wigstead. p. 196.</ref>\n\nIn 1429 a meeting took place at Dunure between James Campbell, representing King James I of Scotland and John Mor MacDonald, representing the Lord of the Isles. Violence broke out and MacDonald was killed. James I's efforts to contain the outrage of the Lords of the Isles by executing Campbell did not prevent a subsequent uprising by them. For three days from 4 August 1563, Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed at Dunure Castle on her Royal tour down the west coast to Glenluce Abbey then on to Whithorn Priory. She was the guest of Gilbert Kennedy, the 4th Earl of Cassilis.<ref name=\"Carruth\"/>\n\n===Doocot===\nThe late medieval \"beehive\"-shaped dovecot of Dunure Castle dates probably from the 15th century. It would have held some 200&nbsp;nesting boxes and would have supplied the castle with fresh eggs and meat.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/aogg/871430784/ Dunure Doocot on flikr.]</ref>\n\n===Demise===\n[[File:Dunure Castle, Ayrshire, 1840.jpg|thumb|250px|Dunure and the castle in 1840]]\n[[File:Dunure Castle and headland.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Dunure Castle and headland from the south.]]\nThis began in the mid-17th century and by 1694 the castle is described as \"wholly ruined\". It is not clear whether this can be linked to the Civil War period, although local tradition suggests that Dunure had been burnt and / or blown up. A major collapse of the SE part of the keep could perhaps be linked to such activity. Recovery of building materials for the construction of the Cromwellian citadel in Ayr may also account for its ruination, as at [[Ardrossan Castle]]. Much evidence exists for the systematic dismantling of the structure for recoverable building materials including the orderly removal of slates, stone and glass. The windows were dismantled and comprehensively stripped of their lead. Remains of a localised fire and associated deposits of coal suggested that smelting of the lead took place within the room. Those dismantling the castle seem to have occupied part of the structure during their work.\n\nThe ruin subsequently saw periodic robbing of its sandstone dressings. A range of castle buildings to the S of Area 4 remained in occupation until c.&nbsp;1860. Census records and reuse of some rooms demonstrate that some of the occupants were fishermen. A large midden of mussel shell gave evidence for the baiting of cod lines. Domestic refuse of the later 18th and early to mid-19th century was also recovered. The only relatively late recorded military action at Dunure consists of a short siege in 1570. A Civil War action or slighting is a further possibility, although the castle may have been abandoned by that time. The route of a stone-lined water course was located at the S end of the trench as it ran into the entrance of the Area 4 kitchen range. Groundworks to the S of the ruins located a further, well preserved section of the same water course.<ref>[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/40938/details/dunure+castle/ RCAHMS Scotland.]</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe castle has been excavated and consolidated, making safe the public access to the area. The castle dominates the Kennedy Park, which has a number of facilities for visitors. There are also said to be secret [[Ley tunnel]]s which connect Dunure Castle to Greenan Castle further north.\n\nCanadian billionaire [[Brendan Clouston]] of Dunure is the Baron of Dunure (2009) as registered with the Lord Lyon King of Arms.<ref>[http://www.burkespeerage.com/familyhomepage.aspx?FID=0&FN=DUNURE Burke's Peerage.

Sir Thomas has an illegitimate daughter and he hopes that the two will marry. The O'Neils of Ireland are competitors for her hand and to ensure a love match the legend of the Brownie of Dunure is employed with mixed results.<ref>Crawford, Archibald (1844).

From a materialistic starting point he argued  that natural conditions are themselves conditions of eternal change. He attacked authors claim that there is  stability and equilibrium in nature. Contrariwise he claimed that evolution is quality of living creatures rather than a tendency toward a \"higher order\" of stability, and equilibrium of organisms. He criticised [[Herbert Spencer]]'s views arguing that such views when applied to the evolution of natural history focus attention on the least changeable. However, he argued that such views systematically failed to take into account the fact that equilibrium is attained only at the moment of death: for a living creature, changing forms are constantly developing. Thus Fyodorov criticised the notion that the constant and the stable are the supreme mission of life. Rather he claimed that life never finally achieves anything but always strives to achieve.

From a materialistic starting point he argued  that natural conditions are themselves conditions of eternal change. He attacked authors claim that there is  stability and equilibrium in nature. Contrariwise he claimed that evolution is quality of living creatures rather than a tendency toward a \"higher order\" of stability, and equilibrium of organisms. He criticised [[Herbert Spencer]]'s views arguing that such views when applied to the evolution of natural history focus attention on the least changeable. However, he argued that such views systematically failed to take into account the fact that equilibrium is attained only at the moment of death: for a living creature, changing forms are constantly developing. Thus Fyodorov criticised the notion that the constant and the stable are the supreme mission of life. Rather he claimed that life never finally achieves anything but always strives to achieve.

The center plate was an irregular polygon. Prominently down the center of the plate was a vertical NXT logo in gold; to the left center side of the logo read \"Tag\" while the right center side read \"Team\". The two side plates contained the WWE logo. The plates were on a black leather strap. A unique feature of this original design was that the two belts were slightly different. On one belt, the left side of the center plate was black with \"Tag\" written in gold while the right side of the center plate was gold with \"Team\" written in black; the other belt was the opposite. The side plates also reflected this coloring; the side plate on the black side was dominated by a black background behind the WWE logo while the side plate on the gold side had a dominant gold background behind the WWE logo. When first introduced, the side plates had the WWE scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]].\n\nOn April 1, 2017, at [[WrestleMania Axxess]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] General Manager [[William Regal]] announced that all of the NXT title belts would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. Both the center plate and side plates of the new NXT Tag Team Championship belts are the same shape as the previous design and are again on black leather straps. The differences are the design on the plates themselves. The center plate maintains the vertical NXT logo prominently in the center, but now in silver with the WWE logo affixed at the very center of the \"X\". At the top of the plate right above the vertical NXT logo is a banner that reads \"Tag Team\", while at the bottom of the plate below the logo is a banner that reads \"Champions\". Black, silver, and gold ornamentation fills in the rest of the plate. Unlike the previous design, both belts are exactly the same. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the updated design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default side plates feature the WWE logo. As a result, the championship was the first WWE tag team championship to feature customizable side plates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns == \n{{main|List of NXT Tag Team Champions}}\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}  {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been 20 reigns between 17 teams composed of 35 individual champions, and one vacancy.

{"title_page": "The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n'''''The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen''''' is a story within the Appendices of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It narrates the love of the [[Man (Middle-earth)|mortal Man]] [[Aragorn]] and the [[Immortality|immortal]] [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf-maiden]] [[Arwen]], telling the story of their first meeting, their eventual [[betrothal]] and marriage, and the circumstances of their deaths. Tolkien called the tale \"really essential to the story\".<ref name=\"Hammond Scull 2006 p488\"/> In contrast to the non-narrative appendices it extends the main story of the book to cover events both before and after it, one reason it would not fit in the main text. Tolkien gave another reason for its exclusion, namely that the main text is told from the [[hobbit]]s' point of view.\n\nThe tale to some extent mirrors the \"older\" ''[[Tale of Beren and L\u00fathien]]'', creating a feeling of historical depth, in what scholars note is an approach similar to that of [[Dante]] in his ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.\n\nAspects of the tale discussed by scholars include the nature of love and death; the question of why the tale, if so important, was relegated to an appendix; Tolkien's blurring of the line between story and history; the balance Tolkien strikes between open [[Christianity]] and his treatment of his characters as [[pagan]]; and the resulting paradox that although Tolkien was a [[Roman Catholic]] and considered the book fundamentally Catholic, Middle-earth societies lack [[religion]]s of their own. It has been noted also that the tale's relegation deprives the main story of much of its [[love-interest]], shifting the book's emphasis towards action.\n\n==Context==\n\nThe tale is set in the [[Third Age|Third]] and [[Fourth Age]]s of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[fictional universe]], [[Middle-earth]], and was published in 1955 in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' as the fifth part of the first section of Appendix A of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"RoTK\" group=T>{{cite book |last=Tolkien |first=J.

Galadriel dresses Aragorn in \"silver and white, with a cloak of elven-grey and a bright gem on his brow\", so that he seems to be an elf-lord. Arwen sees him and makes her choice. They climb the hill of Cerin Amroth, from where they can see the Shadow ([[Mordor]]) in the East, and the Twilight (the fading of the Elves) in the West, and they \"[[Engagement|plighted their troth]]\".

At the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], he unfurls the standard made by Arwen and is hailed as King by the people of Gondor. The [[One Ring]] is destroyed, taking the power of the [[Three Rings|three Elven-rings]], including Elrond's, with it. Aragorn becomes King of Gondor and Arnor, and at midsummer he and Arwen are married in Minas Tirith.

In the scenes that follow, Aragorn and a grief-stricken Arwen converse on the nature of death and the consequences of the choice she had made. Aragorn lies down in \"the House of the Kings in the Silent Street\" and, giving the crown of Gondor and the [[sceptre]] of Arnor to his son Eldarion, he says his final farewell to Arwen and dies, his body remaining \"in glory undimmed\". Arwen was \"not yet weary of her days and thus tasted the bitterness of the mortality that she had taken upon her\". The elf-light in her eyes goes out, and she leaves Gondor for Lorien, itself now dimmed as the elf-rulers [[Galadriel and Celeborn]] and their people had left Middle-earth.

Kocher]] on this: \"At the end of his epic Tolkien inserts ... some forebodings of [Middle-earth's] future which will make Earth what it is today ... he shows the initial steps in a long process of retreat or disappearance [of] all other intelligent species, which will leave man effectually alone on earth...

Men cannot climb the hierarchy, as [[Eru Iluvatar|Eru]], [[Valar]], and Elves are permanently above them. But the Elves voluntarily leave at the end of the Third Age, so men can take their place.

Yet it is not yours to give me, even if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it\", and in response is presented by Galadriel with a green elfstone (earning him the name \"Elessar\") set in a silver brooch from Arwen.<ref name=\"West 2006\"/>\n\nWest draws a further connection between the tale in the Appendices and the main text in his analysis of the scene at the camp on Weathertop where Aragorn (Strider) recounts to the hobbits in poetry and prose the tale of Beren and L\u00fathien, with West highlighting Aragorn's words and \"pensive mood\" as he tells them that L\u00fathien \"chose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow [Beren]\" and that \"together they passed, long ago, beyond the confines of this world\" and that she \"alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved\".<ref name=\"West 2006\"/> West speculates that Aragorn may be thinking here of the consequences of what will happen should Arwen marry him, and later states that he finds \"the lonely death of Arwen the most moving tragedy within [''The Lord of the Rings'']\".<ref name=\"West 2006\"/> A similar conclusion regarding Aragorn's feelings at Weathertop is drawn by scholar of medieval English literature John M. Bowers in his work on the influence of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] on Tolkien. Bowers, looking at both the Weathertop scene and 'The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen', states that like certain pilgrims in Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Aragorn's stories of his ancestors \"open a window into his private desires and fears\".<ref name=\"Bowers 2019\">{{cite book | last=Bowers | first=John M. | title=Tolkien's Lost Chaucer | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2019 | isbn=9780198842675 | pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n\nThe scholar of English literature Anna Vaninskaya studies \"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\" to see how Tolkien uses fantasy to examine the issues of love and death, time and immortality.

Workman quotes Brooks's statement that \"all narration is obituary\" and states that it is in that conception that Tolkien valued Arwen's fate: it is Arwen's \"mourning gaze that allows for the transmission of Aragorn's memory\",<ref name=\"Workman 2014\"/> or in Tolkien's words which she quotes, \"And long there he lay, an image of the splendour of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed\".<ref name=\"Workman 2014\"/>\n\nThe Polish scholar of religion in literature and film, Christopher Garbowski, notes that while Tolkien contrasts Elves and Men throughout ''The Lord of the Rings'', he introduces the [[Central conceit|conceit]] that an Elf may marry a Man on condition of surrendering her immortality. This happens exactly twice in the legendarium, with L\u00fathien and then with Arwen. In Garbowski's view the conceit's most dramatic use is an event in \"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\", the moment when Aragorn voluntarily accepts the time of his death, offered to him by Il\u00favatar (God), which Garbowski finds \"optimistic\". Arwen calls this \"gift\" \"bitter to receive\"; Garbowski comments that Tolkien's later and much less optimistic posthumously published discourse \"[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]\" effectively undermines the status of the \"gift\", coming close to the Christian position that body and soul cannot be separated.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Garbowski |first=Christopher  |editor-last=Drout |editor-first=Michael D.

He writes that [[Plato]] stated that [[Homer]] took [[Achilles]] as the model for death, the \"only sound response\" being despair, whereas Tolkien's model is Aragorn, who chooses death freely according to the \"ancient prerogative of the [[N\u00famenor|N\u00famen\u00f3rean]] rulers\"; when Arwen pleads with him to hold off, he \"concedes that death is a cause for 'sorrow' but not for 'despair'.\"<ref name=\"Walsh 2015\"/> Walsh comments that it is significant that at this moment, Arwen calls him Estel, his childhood name, which meant \"Hope\" or \"Trust\"; she has to trust his wisdom, and her own choice of love and death.<ref name=\"Walsh 2015\"/> That Aragorn was wise to choose his death as he did is confirmed, Walsh writes, by the \"transformation\" of his body after death, as it becomes permanently beautiful, reflecting the \"essential goodness of his soul\", in contrast to the death of the wizard [[Saruman]], who had turned to evil.<ref name=\"Walsh 2015\"/>\n\nThe scholar of English literature Catherine Madsen notes the reflection of mortality in the \"fading\" of Middle-earth from the enormous powers like [[Morgoth]] and [[Elbereth]] that battled in the First Age.

As he does so, \"L\u00fathien walked before his eyes\": he sees [[Arwen]] in the woods, and calls out to her \"Tin\u00faviel!

Arwen's father, [[Elrond]] the Half-elven, sees without being told what has happened, and tells Aragorn that a \"great doom awaits\" him, either to be the greatest of his line since [[Elendil]], or to fall into darkness; and that he \"shall neither have wife, nor bind any woman to you in troth\" until he is found worthy. In reply, with \"the foresight of his kindred\", Aragorn prophesies that Elrond's time in Middle-earth is coming to an end, and that Arwen will have to choose between her father and staying in Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Tale\" group=T>{{cite book |last=Tolkien |first=J.

Galadriel dresses Aragorn in \"silver and white, with a cloak of elven-grey and a bright gem on his brow\", so that he seems to be an elf-lord. Arwen sees him and makes her choice. They climb the hill of Cerin Amroth, from where they can see the Shadow ([[Mordor]]) in the East, and the Twilight (the fading of the Elves) in the West, and they \"[[Engagement|plighted their troth]]\". Elrond tells Aragorn that they may marry only when he is King of both [[Gondor]] and Arnor, the ancient southern and northern Kingdoms of Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Tale\" group=T/>\n\nSome years later, Aragorn helps the Fellowship and the forces of the West to victory in the [[War of the Ring]] against the forces of Mordor. At the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], he unfurls the standard made by Arwen and is hailed as King by the people of Gondor. The [[One Ring]] is destroyed, taking the power of the [[Three Rings|three Elven-rings]], including Elrond's, with it. Aragorn becomes King of Gondor and Arnor, and at midsummer he and Arwen are married in Minas Tirith. The [[Third Age]] ends as Elrond departs Middle-earth never to return, and he and Arwen are \"sundered by the Sea and by a doom beyond the end of the world\".<ref name=\"Tale\" group=T/>\n\nAragorn and Arwen live together as King and Queen of Gondor and Arnor for \"six-[[score (number)|score]] [120] years in great glory and bliss\". Then, aged 210 and feeling the onset of old age, Aragorn chooses to lay down his life before he falls from his \"high seat unmanned and witless\". In the scenes that follow, Aragorn and a grief-stricken Arwen converse on the nature of death and the consequences of the choice she had made. Aragorn lies down in \"the House of the Kings in the Silent Street\" and, giving the crown of Gondor and the [[sceptre]] of Arnor to his son Eldarion, he says his final farewell to Arwen and dies, his body remaining \"in glory undimmed\". Arwen was \"not yet weary of her days and thus tasted the bitterness of the mortality that she had taken upon her\". The elf-light in her eyes goes out, and she leaves Gondor for Lorien, itself now dimmed as the elf-rulers [[Galadriel and Celeborn]] and their people had left Middle-earth.

Yet it is not yours to give me, even if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it\", and in response is presented by Galadriel with a green elfstone (earning him the name \"Elessar\") set in a silver brooch from Arwen.<ref name=\"West 2006\"/>\n\nWest draws a further connection between the tale in the Appendices and the main text in his analysis of the scene at the camp on Weathertop where Aragorn (Strider) recounts to the hobbits in poetry and prose the tale of Beren and L\u00fathien, with West highlighting Aragorn's words and \"pensive mood\" as he tells them that L\u00fathien \"chose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow [Beren]\" and that \"together they passed, long ago, beyond the confines of this world\" and that she \"alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved\".<ref name=\"West 2006\"/> West speculates that Aragorn may be thinking here of the consequences of what will happen should Arwen marry him, and later states that he finds \"the lonely death of Arwen the most moving tragedy within [''The Lord of the Rings'']\".<ref name=\"West 2006\"/> A similar conclusion regarding Aragorn's feelings at Weathertop is drawn by scholar of medieval English literature John M. Bowers in his work on the influence of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] on Tolkien. Bowers, looking at both the Weathertop scene and 'The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen', states that like certain pilgrims in Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Aragorn's stories of his ancestors \"open a window into his private desires and fears\".<ref name=\"Bowers 2019\">{{cite book | last=Bowers | first=John M. | title=Tolkien's Lost Chaucer | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2019 | isbn=9780198842675 | pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n\nThe scholar of English literature Anna Vaninskaya studies \"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\" to see how Tolkien uses fantasy to examine the issues of love and death, time and immortality. Given that Tolkien's Elves are immortal, they face the question of death from a unique vantage-point.<ref name=\"Vaninskaya 2020\">{{cite book | last=Vaninskaya | first=Anna | title=J. R. R.

Workman quotes Brooks's statement that \"all narration is obituary\" and states that it is in that conception that Tolkien valued Arwen's fate: it is Arwen's \"mourning gaze that allows for the transmission of Aragorn's memory\",<ref name=\"Workman 2014\"/> or in Tolkien's words which she quotes, \"And long there he lay, an image of the splendour of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed\".<ref name=\"Workman 2014\"/>\n\nThe Polish scholar of religion in literature and film, Christopher Garbowski, notes that while Tolkien contrasts Elves and Men throughout ''The Lord of the Rings'', he introduces the [[Central conceit|conceit]] that an Elf may marry a Man on condition of surrendering her immortality. This happens exactly twice in the legendarium, with L\u00fathien and then with Arwen. In Garbowski's view the conceit's most dramatic use is an event in \"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\", the moment when Aragorn voluntarily accepts the time of his death, offered to him by Il\u00favatar (God), which Garbowski finds \"optimistic\". Arwen calls this \"gift\" \"bitter to receive\"; Garbowski comments that Tolkien's later and much less optimistic posthumously published discourse \"[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]\" effectively undermines the status of the \"gift\", coming close to the Christian position that body and soul cannot be separated.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Garbowski |first=Christopher  |editor-last=Drout |editor-first=Michael D.

He writes that [[Plato]] stated that [[Homer]] took [[Achilles]] as the model for death, the \"only sound response\" being despair, whereas Tolkien's model is Aragorn, who chooses death freely according to the \"ancient prerogative of the [[N\u00famenor|N\u00famen\u00f3rean]] rulers\"; when Arwen pleads with him to hold off, he \"concedes that death is a cause for 'sorrow' but not for 'despair'.\"<ref name=\"Walsh 2015\"/> Walsh comments that it is significant that at this moment, Arwen calls him Estel, his childhood name, which meant \"Hope\" or \"Trust\"; she has to trust his wisdom, and her own choice of love and death.<ref name=\"Walsh 2015\"/> That Aragorn was wise to choose his death as he did is confirmed, Walsh writes, by the \"transformation\" of his body after death, as it becomes permanently beautiful, reflecting the \"essential goodness of his soul\", in contrast to the death of the wizard [[Saruman]], who had turned to evil.<ref name=\"Walsh 2015\"/>\n\nThe scholar of English literature Catherine Madsen notes the reflection of mortality in the \"fading\" of Middle-earth from the enormous powers like [[Morgoth]] and [[Elbereth]] that battled in the First Age. She writes that \"Aragorn is a hero and a descendant of heroes, but he is brought up in hiding and given the name of Hope [Estel]; Arwen possesses the beauty of L\u00fathien, but she is born in the twilight of her people and her title is Evenstar; these two restore the original glories only for a little while, before the world is altered and 'fades into the light of common day'\".<ref name=\"Madsen 2004\">{{cite book |last=Madsen |first=Catherine |title='Light from an Invisible Lamp' {{!}} Natural Religion in ''The Lord of the Rings'' | editor-last=Chance | editor-first=Jane | work=Tolkien and the invention of myth : a reader | publisher=University Press of Kentucky | publication-place=Lexington | year=2004 | isbn=0-8131-2301-1 | oclc=54938267 | page=42}}</ref>{{efn|Madsen is here quoting from [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[Ode on Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood|Ode on Intimations of Immortality]]'', line 76.}} Rateliff, writing on the theme of the evocation of loss in Tolkien's works, describes the 'Gift of Men' as being \"to accept loss and decay as essential parts of the world\" and draws parallels with other writings by Tolkien: \"The Elves cling to the past and so are swept away with it; in a fallen world, acceptance of the inevitability of death is the only way to pass beyond the world's limitations, for [[Brendan]] or [[Niggle]] or Arwen.\"<ref name=\"Rateliff 2006\"/>\n\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| width  = 300px\n| video1 = [https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/release--jrr-tolkien/znd36v4 'Tolkien in Oxford'] In a 1968 BBC2 television documentary, Tolkien quoted the French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s thoughts on death, describing the theme of the inevitability of death as key to his work.

Humiliated for his illiteracy, his dominating and arrogant non-biological father, Shukla, decides to have Radhe marry an educated girl and chooses \"district-topper\" Krishna from the neighboring town of [[Malihabad]].\n\nIntelligent and ambitious, Krishna assists her father, Dubey, at his medical clinic. Her mother had died of cervical cancer and Krishna dreams of studying medicine in [[London]] and becoming a doctor. Though devastated by the idea of marrying into an illiterate conservative family, Krishna goes ahead with the wedding to save her father's reputation.\n\nImmediately after the wedding, Krishna is humiliated by her mother-in-law, Shuklain, and others in the Shukla family who resent her for her independent thinking and modern views. However, Radhe supports her. Gradually, Krishna returns his affections and is able to bring some positive changes into the Shukla household starting with getting rid of domestic violence in the house. In a twist, it is revealed that Radhe is Lambodar and his late wife Vrinda's son. Lambodar, Shukla's elder brother, had murdered Vrinda when she tried to save Shuklain from Lambodar's unwanted sexual advances. Lambodar is sent to prison and Radhe and Krishna leave for [[London]]. \n\nIn medical school, Krishna is punished by stern, arrogant NRI professor Dr. Veer Sahay, a famous clinical cardiologist, whose native city is [[Unnao]]. Dr. Veer is expelled from his job for racist behaviour. His car hits Radhe who dies in the accident. The Shuklas promptly blame Krishna for his death and mistreat her. An emotionally broken Krishna is forced to stay with the Shuklas who had recently opened a special hospital named the Radhe Krishna Hospital where Krishna must now work.\n\nMeanwhile, Lambodar tries to escape from prison and gets admitted to a hospital. Dr. Veer returns to India where his past is revealed to be connected to the Shuklas. Dr. Veer's father worked for Shukla who refused to lend him money for an important surgery which eventually led to Veer's father's death. Veer harbours a deep grudge against the Shuklas. He and Krishna are forced to run the Radhe Krishna Hospital and slowly fall in love with one another and are married. \n\nVeer buys the Radhe Krishna Hospital at an auction and gifts it to Krishna. Shukla manipulates everyone including Krishna to think that Veer killed Radhe and was faking his love for Krishna. Veer gets ten years imprisonment for Radhe's murder. A heartbroken Krishna returns the hospital to Shukla ji and leaves for London to complete medical school.\n\n===5 years later===\nDr. Krishna Dubey, an honest and sincere professional doctor now works at the Life Care Hospital. Shukla tries to convince her to work in his hospital for his business growth, but she rejects the offer. Veer escapes from prison to meet Krishna and pleads his innocence but is soon captured and sent back to prison. A mysterious man convinces an emotional Shuklain and Gajanan that he is their Radhe. Veer's mother, Sunaina, wants Shukla to bail Veer out as \"Radhe\" has now returned. Veer gets bail and begins investigating the actual identity of the new Radhe.

Humiliated for his illiteracy, his dominating and arrogant non-biological father, Shukla, decides to have Radhe marry an educated girl and chooses \"district-topper\" Krishna from the neighboring town of [[Malihabad]].\n\nIntelligent and ambitious, Krishna assists her father, Dubey, at his medical clinic. Her mother had died of cervical cancer and Krishna dreams of studying medicine in [[London]] and becoming a doctor. Though devastated by the idea of marrying into an illiterate conservative family, Krishna goes ahead with the wedding to save her father's reputation.\n\nImmediately after the wedding, Krishna is humiliated by her mother-in-law, Shuklain, and others in the Shukla family who resent her for her independent thinking and modern views. However, Radhe supports her. Gradually, Krishna returns his affections and is able to bring some positive changes into the Shukla household starting with getting rid of domestic violence in the house. In a twist, it is revealed that Radhe is Lambodar and his late wife Vrinda's son. Lambodar, Shukla's elder brother, had murdered Vrinda when she tried to save Shuklain from Lambodar's unwanted sexual advances. Lambodar is sent to prison and Radhe and Krishna leave for [[London]]. \n\nIn medical school, Krishna is punished by stern, arrogant NRI professor Dr. Veer Sahay, a famous clinical cardiologist, whose native city is [[Unnao]]. Dr. Veer is expelled from his job for racist behaviour. His car hits Radhe who dies in the accident. The Shuklas promptly blame Krishna for his death and mistreat her. An emotionally broken Krishna is forced to stay with the Shuklas who had recently opened a special hospital named the Radhe Krishna Hospital where Krishna must now work.\n\nMeanwhile, Lambodar tries to escape from prison and gets admitted to a hospital. Dr. Veer returns to India where his past is revealed to be connected to the Shuklas. Dr. Veer's father worked for Shukla who refused to lend him money for an important surgery which eventually led to Veer's father's death. Veer harbours a deep grudge against the Shuklas. He and Krishna are forced to run the Radhe Krishna Hospital and slowly fall in love with one another and are married. \n\nVeer buys the Radhe Krishna Hospital at an auction and gifts it to Krishna. Shukla manipulates everyone including Krishna to think that Veer killed Radhe and was faking his love for Krishna. Veer gets ten years imprisonment for Radhe's murder. A heartbroken Krishna returns the hospital to Shukla ji and leaves for London to complete medical school.\n\n===5 years later===\nDr. Krishna Dubey, an honest and sincere professional doctor now works at the Life Care Hospital. Shukla tries to convince her to work in his hospital for his business growth, but she rejects the offer. Veer escapes from prison to meet Krishna and pleads his innocence but is soon captured and sent back to prison. A mysterious man convinces an emotional Shuklain and Gajanan that he is their Radhe. Veer's mother, Sunaina, wants Shukla to bail Veer out as \"Radhe\" has now returned. Veer gets bail and begins investigating the actual identity of the new Radhe. Veer and Krishna discover that the new Radhe is actually Mohan who is defrauding the family.\n\nSoon, the Shuklas realise that they were being duped by Mohan. They are grateful to Veer and Krishna for exposing him. Veer and Krishna reject an appointment letter from the London Royal Hospital to stay back in Kanpur with the Shukla family who give them their blessings.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Megha Chakraborty]] as Dr. Krishna Sahay\u2013 [[Medicine|Clinical]] [[cancer]] [[specialist]]; Kaksh Nath's daughter; Radhe's former wife; Veer's wife\n* Gaurav Sareen as Radhe Shukla\u2013 Lambodar and Vrinda's son; Krishna's former husband\n* Karan Vohra as Dr. Veer Sahay\u2013 Clinical [[cardiology]] specialist; Sunaina's son; Nayani's brother; Krishna's husband\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n* Neeraj Sood as Dr. Kaksh Nath Dubey\u2013 Gulkand's brother; Krishna's father\n* [[Sushmita Mukherjee]] as Gulkand Saneria\u2013 Kaksh Nath's sister; Krishna's aunt; Nirmal's wife\n* Pawan Mahendru as Nirmal Saneria\u2013 Gulkand's husband; Krishna's uncle\n* [[Yamini Singh]] as Sunaina Sahay\u2013 Veer and Nayani's mother\n* Bhagwan Tiwari as Gajodhar Shukla\u2013 Lambodar's brother; Raima's husband; Radhe's uncle; Gajanan, Triloki and Jhabbo's father\n* Madhuri Sanjeev as Raima Shukla\u2013 Gajodhar's wife; Radhe's aunt; Gajanan, Triloki and Jhabbo's mother\n* Sunny Sachdeva as Gajanan Shukla\u2013 Gajodhar and Raima's son; Radhe's cousin; Triloki and Jhabbo's brother; Laali's husband\n* Divya Malik as Laali Shukla\u2013 Gajanan's wife\n* Manoj Verma as Triloki Shukla\u2013 Gajodhar and Raima's son; Radhe's cousin; Gajanan and Jhabbo's brother; Bela's husband\n* Bhoomika Mirchandani as Bela Shukla\u2013 Sahira's daughter; Titi's sister; Triloki's wife\n* Piew Jana as Jhabbo Mishra\u2013 Gajodhar and Raima's daughter; Radhe's cousin; Gajanan and Triloki's sister; Matuk's wife\n* Amitabh Singh Ramkshatra as Matuk Nath Mishra\u2013 Jhabbo's husband\n* Abhinandan Jindal as Saajan Srivastav\u2013 Radhe's best friend and confidante; Guddan's husband\n* Kaushiki Rathore as Guddan Srivastav\u2013 Saajan's wife\n* [[Anupam Shyam]] as Lambodar Shukla\u2013 Gajodhar's brother; Vrinda's husband; Radhe's father\n* Meena Mir as Sahira Awasthi\u2013 Bela and Titi's mother\n* Shivanya Ahlawat as Titi Awasthi\u2013 Sahira's daughter; Bela's sister\n* [[Ishaan Singh Manhas]] as Prashant Ahuja\u2013 Krishna\u2019s former boyfriend and mentor\n* [[Ankit Bathla]] as Dr. Aayan Kapoor\u2013 Clinical [[oncology]] specialist\n* Vividha Kirti as Shivani Singh\u2013 Veer's former girlfriend\n* Mayank Arora as Mohan\n* Aaira Rajput as Nayani Sahay\u2013 Sunaina's daughter; Veer's sister\n* Babla Kochhar as Dr. Shrikant Rao\u2013 [[Psychiatrist]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Guests===\n* [[Mouni Roy]] as Sundari (2018)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hotstar.com/tv/krishna-chali-london/17689 Krishna Chali London] streaming on [[Hotstar]]\n\n{{Star Plus Shows}}\n\n[[Category:2018 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Star Plus television series]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Uttar Pradesh]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toSpecialist(link changed toSpecialty (medicine)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Chali_London"}
