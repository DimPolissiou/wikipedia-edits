An attempted raid on Hull on 8/9 August 1915 bombed [[Goole]] by mistake owing to a navigation error. On 5 March 1916 two Zeppelins L11 and L14 were diverted to Hull from an attack on the fleet at [[Rosyth]]. Bombs were dropped on Earles shipyard (Docks) and on [[Hull Paragon Interchange|Paragon station]] (city centre) resulting in deaths. The raids showed that Hull was completely unprotected from aerial attack and public anger led to service personnel being mobbed.

An attempted raid on Hull on 8/9 August 1915 bombed [[Goole]] by mistake owing to a navigation error. On 5 March 1916 two Zeppelins L11 and L14 were diverted to Hull from an attack on the fleet at [[Rosyth]]. Bombs were dropped on Earles shipyard (Docks) and on [[Hull Paragon Interchange|Paragon station]] (city centre) resulting in deaths. The raids showed that Hull was completely unprotected from aerial attack and public anger led to service personnel being mobbed.

Around 140 people were killed by the bombing, many from the areas around the works.{{sfn|Graystone|1991|pp=23\u201326}}<ref name=\"h41\"/>\n\nThe practice of 'trekking', or travelling to the countryside to sleep in the fields when bombing was expected, had begun in the First World War and by 1941 an estimated third of the population were leaving the city at night.{{sfn|Gillett|MacMahon|1980|p=403}} In August 1941 [[King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] visited Hull to see the damage.{{sfn|Simmons|1941}}\n\nMinor attacks continued approximately monthly until the end of the year, with serious bombing in the early morning of 18 August and the night of 31 August/1 September.{{sfn|Graystone|1991|p=26}}<ref name=\"h41\"/>\n\n====1942\u20131945====\nAttacks were reduced in 1942 compared to 1941,<ref name=\"h41\"/><ref name=\"b42\">[[#hh|Heroes of Hull]], [http://www.heroesofhull.co.uk/pages/blitz/1942_Raids.php 1942 Raids]</ref> a major bombing raid on 19/20 May targeted Alexandra and Victoria docks and the surrounding area. Also in the Marlborough Avenue and Blenheim Street and Warneford Gardens where 4 people were killed. It is thought the attacks on the docks served the objective of diminishing supplies shipped to Russia.{{sfn|Graystone|1991|p=27}} By this stage bomb weight had increased, with 500&nbsp;kg bombs in common use.  On 1 August another raid centred on the eastern docks killed 24 people at Grindell Street when a 1,800&nbsp;kg bomb was dropped on it. There were attacks in October and December, with comparatively limited damage, each killing two people.{{sfn|Graystone|1991|pp=26\u201329}}\n\nMinor attacks took place on 3 and 15 January 1943, with [[phosphorus bomb]]s being identified as used as incendiaries in the second attack.{{sfn|Graystone|1991|p=30}}\n\nOn 24 June a larger-scale attack took place, with the city centre targeted again.  During this attack the well-known [[Hull Municipal Museum]] was destroyed by fire. The government allowed Hull to be named specifically as the target of the attack and the ''[[Hull Daily Mail]]'' ran a front-page headline the next day.{{sfn|Graystone|1991|p=30}}<ref name=\"munic\"/> Another attack took place on 13/14 July, which appears have been intended to damage the railway system and caused more than 20 deaths.

The ''Luftwaffe'' targeted coastal towns such as [[Bridlington]], [[Hornsea]] and [[Withernsea]], killing a total of 44 people, as well as RAF airfields such as [[RAF Driffield]], [[RAF Catfoss]] and [[RAF Leconfield]].  An attack on RAF Driffield on 15 August 1940 killed 15 people.{{sfn|Bright|2005}}\n\nOther attacks on East Yorkshire were on the outskirts of Hull and included the first daylight raid on British soil at the Saltend oil terminal and the attack on the Blackburn Aircraft factory at [[Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire|Brough]]. Bombs were also dropped in error owing to poor navigation or the Hull Docks decoy. These attacks killed 22 people in [[Hedon]], [[Bilton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Bilton]] and [[Preston, East Riding of Yorkshire|Preston]]. Other bombing activity was caused by the ''Luftwaffe'' dumping bombs after abandoning raids not just on Hull but also on Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and other northern targets. Death and destruction inflicted by the enemy also included sea mines exploding as they hit the coast and enemy aircraft shooting down allied aircraft over East Yorkshire.{{sfn|Bright|2005}}\n\nOn 24 December 1944 a massed aerial [[V-1 flying bomb]] attack was launched on [[Manchester]], one of the bombs impacting prematurely at [[Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire|Willerby]], just outside Hull, damaging housing and the [[Springhead Pumping Station]].<ref>{{cite book| url = | title = Dark Peak Aircraft Wrecks 2| first  = Ron| last = Collier| first2= Roni| last2= Wilkinson| year =1992|pages =145\u2013151}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| url = |title = Air War Over East Yorkshire in World War II| first = Paul|last = Bright| year =  2005 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n===Evacuees===\nAround 38,000 children were evacuated from Hull. In addition to rural East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire children were evacuated to Lancashire, Norfolk, Northumberland, Leicester and elsewhere. Entire secondary schools were relocated: for example [[Hymers College]] had pupils in [[Pocklington]] and [[Market Weighton]] whilst [[Newland School for Girls|Newland High School]] moved to Bridlington and later [[Malton, North Yorkshire|Malton]].  However many pupils remained in the city and most evacuees returned from the end of 1942 onwards.{{sfn|Graystone|1991|p=44}}\n\n===Reporting===\n\nAs with many towns and cities, contemporary radio and newspaper reports did not usually identify Hull by name but referred to it as a \"north-east coast town,\" \"north-east town,\" or \"northern town\" to avoid providing the enemy with tactical information of damage.{{sfn|Geraghty|1951|p=7}}{{sfn|Graystone|1991|pp=11\u201312, 30, 45}} After the major raids of 18/19 March 1941, 18 July 1941, 18 August 1941 and 24 June 1943 the city was named but in the reporting of the attacks of 7\u20139 May 1941, the target was referred to by the [[Air Ministry]] as being in the Humber area.{{sfn|Graystone|1991|p=45}} The ''Hull Daily Mail'' referred to victims by name but locations and industrial damage were not.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330. The crew asked to remain at FL 330 and the air traffic controller approved this request, moving the other flight to FL 350.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330. The crew asked to remain at FL 330 and the air traffic controller approved this request, moving the other flight to FL 350.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

Directed by [[Lambert Hillyer]] from a screenplay by [[Garrett Fort]], the film stars [[Otto Kruger]], [[Gloria Holden]] in the title role, [[Marguerite Churchill]] and features, as the only cast member to return from the original, [[Edward Van Sloan]] &ndash; although his character's name was altered from Van Helsing to ''Von'' Helsing.\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of [[Count Dracula]] and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]). He, in turn, has a fiance, Janet ([[Marguerite Churchill]]). The Countess kidnaps Janet and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess in an attempt by him to save Janet.\n\nOstensibly based on a [[short story]] titled \"[[Dracula's Guest]]\" by [[Bram Stoker]], the film bears no resemblance to the original source material. [[David O. Selznick]] initially purchased the rights to the story for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Selznick, likely knowing{{weasel inline|date=April 2020}} he could not legally make the film because of Universal's copyright on the original film, sold the rights to Universal. After first assigning the picture to [[James Whale]], Universal production head [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] finally put Hillyer in the director's chair.\n\nWhile not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's strong lesbian overtones, which Universal acknowledged from the start of production and exploited in some early advertising.\n\n==Plot==\n''Dracula's Daughter'' begins a few moments after ''Dracula'' ends. [[Count Dracula]] has just been destroyed by [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Von Helsing]] <!--in this film the character's name is spelled VON Helsing so please do not change it -->([[Edward Van Sloan]]). Van Helsing is arrested by two Whitby policemen, Sergeant Wilkes ([[E. E. Clive]]) and constable Albert ([[Billy Bevan]]).  Von Helsing is sent by the Whitby police to [[Scotland Yard]], where he explains to Sir Basil Humphrey ([[Gilbert Emery]]) that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because he had already been dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]), who was once one of his star students.\n\nSergeant Wilkes leaves the Whitby gaol to meet an officer from Scotland Yard at the train station. Meanwhile, Dracula's daughter, Countess Marya Zaleska ([[Gloria Holden]]), enters the gaol and mesmerizes Albert with her jeweled ring and with the aid of her manservant, Sandor ([[Irving Pichel]]), steals Dracula's body from the Whitby gaol and after tossing salt on the pyre ritualistically burns Dracula's body, hoping to break her curse of vampirism. However, Sandor soon begins to discourage her telling her that all that is in her eyes is \"death.\" She soon gives in to her thirst for blood. The Countess resumes her hunting, mesmerizing her victims with her exotic jeweled ring. After a chance meeting with Dr. Garth at a society party, the Countess asks him to help her overcome the influence she feels from beyond the grave. The doctor advises her to defeat her cravings by confronting them and the Countess becomes hopeful that her will, plus Dr. Garth's science, will be strong enough to overcome Dracula's malevolence.\n\nThe Countess sends Sandor to fetch her a model to paint.  He sees a pretty young woman, Lili ([[Nan Grey]]), and follows her onto a bridge.  The woman pauses at the railing looking despondent. Sandor promises her food, warmth and money.  She hesitates, but Sandor explains that he seeks her for his mistress. Lili returns with Sandor. Countess Zaleska initially resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth know that it was Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth to [[Transylvania]] by kidnapping Janet Blake ([[Marguerite Churchill]]), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gloria Holden]] as Countess Marya Zaleska - Dracula's Daughter\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Dr. Jeffrey Garth\n* [[Marguerite Churchill]] as Janet Blake\n* [[Irving Pichel]] as Sandor\n* [[Gilbert Emery]] as Sir Basil Humphrey, Scotland Yard\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]]\t as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Von Helsing]] <!--in this film the character's name is spelled VON Helsing so please do not change it -->\n* [[Halliwell Hobbes]] as Hawkins\n* [[Billy Bevan]] as Albert\n* [[Nan Grey]] as Lili\n* [[Hedda Hopper]] as Lady Esme Hammond\n* [[Claud Allister]] as Sir Aubrey\n* [[Edgar Norton]] as Hobbs\n* [[E.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] executive [[David O. Selznick]] negotiated a contract in 1933 with Stoker's widow, [[Florence Stoker|Florence]], to buy the rights to the chapter for an advance of $500 against a purchase price of $5,000. MGM's lawyers and executives were worried about the use of the word \"Dracula\" in the film's title, fearing that Universal would take legal action, although Selznick's contract with Stoker explicitly listed \"Dracula's Daughter\" as a possible alternative title. The project was code-named \"Tarantula\" in correspondence.<ref name=\"skal1968\" />\n\nSelznick hired [[John L. Balderston]], who had previously worked on the 1931 ''Dracula'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', to write the screenplay. Balderston's screenplay involved tying up loose ends from the original film. In it, Von Helsing returns to Transylvania to destroy the [[Brides of Dracula|three vampire brides]] seen in ''Dracula'' but overlooks a fourth tomb concealing Dracula's daughter. She follows him back to London and operates under the name \"Countess Szekelsky\". She attacks a young aristocrat and Von Helsing and the aristocrat's fianc\u00e9e track her back to Transylvania and destroy her. The script included scenes that implied that Dracula's daughter enjoyed torturing her male victims and that while under her control the men liked it too. Also included were shots of the Countess's chambers being stocked with whips and straps, which she would never use on-screen but whose uses the audience could imagine. Regardless of any objections that the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA) would have raised to many aspects of the scenario, Balderston's script could never have been filmed because Selznick's contract with Stoker expressly barred him from using any Bram Stoker characters that did not appear in \"[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]\". Selznick re-sold the rights to \"Dracula's Guest\" to Universal in September 1935<ref name=\"skal1968\">Skal, pp. 196\u201398</ref> for $12,500, which included the rights to Balderston's scenario.<ref name=\"curtis260\">Curtis, p. 260</ref> Horror film scholar [[David J. Skal]] theorizes that this was Selznick's actual motivation in buying the rights in the first place, to profit from Universal's desire for a sequel by tying up the only obvious source material.<ref>Skal, p. 196</ref>\n\n===Director===\nUniversal studio head Carl Laemmle, Jr. (nicknamed \"Junior\") wanted [[James Whale]], fresh from his great success with ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', to direct ''Dracula's Daughter''. Whale was idle, waiting for [[Irene Dunne]] to finish work on ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1935 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' so she could begin work on Whale's ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]''. Wary of directing two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called ''The Hangover Murders''. Laemmle agreed only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct ''Dracula's Daughter'' next.<ref>Curtis, pp. 254\u201355</ref> Whale completed work on the film, titled ''[[Remember Last Night?]]'' for release, on September 14, 1935.<ref>Curtis, p. 258</ref> ''Magnificent Obsession'' completed filming on October 29. With Dunne freed up, Whale went to work on ''Show Boat''. Laemmle replaced him with [[A. Edward Sutherland]], who was best known for his work on comedies. Sutherland had as little interest in ''Dracula's Daughter'' as Whale and soon left the studio,<ref>Curtis, pp. 260\u201361</ref> and Hillyer came on to direct.\n\n===Universal script===\nThe earliest scenario for the Universal film was written by [[R. C. Sherriff]]. It began with three scenes set in the 14th Century and centered on the Dracula legend. It then switched to the present day, focusing on two engaged couples who visit Transylvania. The men explore the ruins of Dracula's castle. One is later found, insane, and the other goes missing. Professor Von Helsing is summoned and he tracks the missing man to London, where he is in thrall to Dracula's daughter, the Countess Szelinski (sic). When she attempts to flee with her thrall to the Orient by ship, Von Helsing and three others book passage on the same ship. During a violent storm, Von Helsing destroys Dracula's daughter and, with her hold over the men broken, the scenario closes with a double wedding. This version was submitted on August 28, 1935 to the [[British Board of Film Censors]], which rejected it, saying in part \"...{{nbsp}}''Dracula's Daughter'' would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.\" On September 10 Sherriff met with BBFC representatives and submitted a revised scenario two days later. This scenario was passed but because its details were not recorded by the BBFC it is unknown how much it differed from the original or how much if any of that scenario was retained in the final script.<ref>Robertson pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nUniversal also submitted Sheriff's first draft to the PCA on September 5, 1935 and encountered stronger resistance from PCA enforcer [[Joseph Breen]] than it had from the British. Breen reported back that the script \"contains countless offensive stuff which makes the picture utterly impossible for approval under the Production Code\".<ref>Breen, quoted in Skal, p. 198</ref> A second draft was submitted on October 21, but it too was rejected, with many of Breen's objections centering on the 14th Century scenes in which Dracula himself appeared. It is unclear whether this submission was the same submission that the BBFC had previously passed. A third Sheriff draft was submitted three days later and Sherriff's fourth and final draft on November 10. All remained unacceptable, and Whale biographer James Curtis suggests that Whale, who had no interest in the project and feared that his commitment to it might cost him control over the filming of ''Show Boat'', encouraged Sherriff to submit ever more wildly unacceptable versions in hopes of getting himself off the film.<ref name=\"curtis260\" /> On January 14, 1936, producer [[E. M. Asher]] advised Breen that the Sherriff script was not going to be used and that a new script would be put together from scratch. Screenwriting duties were assigned to Garrett Fort.<ref>Skal, pp. 198\u201399</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:GloriaHolden2DraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right|Gloria Holden]]\n[[File:OttoKrugerDraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' was Gloria Holden's first starring role and reportedly she was extremely displeased at having been assigned it. Like many actors, Holden looked down on horror films. She had also seen [[Bela Lugosi]] struggle over the years since ''Dracula'' was made to free himself from [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] and feared that the role would lead to the same fate for her. Critic Mark Clark believes that ironically it may have been Holden's disgust for the role that led to the quality of her performance. \"Her disdain for the part translates into a kind of self-loathing that perfectly suits her troubled character.\"<ref>Clark, p. 184</ref>\n\nInitially Lugosi and [[Jane Wyatt]] were set to star in the film. Universal also announced that [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Colin Clive]], who had starred together in ''Frankenstein'' and ''Bride of Frankenstein'', would appear,<ref name=\"rhodes219\">Rhodes, p. 219</ref> and that [[Cesar Romero]] would play Dr. Garth.<ref name=\"mank365\">Mank, p. 365</ref> According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Universal had sought [[Herbert Marshall]] for the role of Sandor, before casting Pichel.<ref name=\"mank365\" /> None of them appeared except, after a fashion, Lugosi, in the form of a wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.<ref name=\"rhodes219\" />\n\n===Shooting===\n[[File:Dracula's Daughter - Poster 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Theatrical poster]]\nShooting on ''Dracula's Daughter'' began on February 4, 1936, rushed into production before Fort had completed the script,<ref>Mank, p. 356</ref> because of a deadline clause in Universal's option of the property from Selznick.<ref>Skal, p. 199</ref> The script was not finalized until shooting had been underway for three weeks.<ref name=\"mank357\" /> The film was completed on March 10.<ref>Mank, p. 358</ref> Despite studio orders that the film be shot on a seven-day-per-week schedule,<ref name=\"mank357\" /> filming ran seven days over its schedule and $50,000 over budget, with the final cost of the film tallied at $278,380.<ref>Senn, p. 361</ref>\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' was the last in the first cycle of [[Universal Horror]] films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal said it was because a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate.<ref>Johnson, p. 7</ref> In truth, the cycle was suspended because, just before filming on ''Dracula's Daughter'' had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from [[J. Cheever Cowdin]], head of the [[Standard Capital Corporation]], and from [[Charles R. Rogers]]. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of ''Dracula's Daughter'' to focus on fare like [[Deanna Durbin]] musicals.<ref>Johnson, p. 129</ref> Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' in 1939.\n\n===Other production aspects===\nMakeup artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] and special effects supervisor [[John P. Fulton]] worked together closely, especially on Holden's make-up design. They combined special lighting with a greyish-green make-up for Holden's final scenes, creating a pallor that contrasted with the more normally flesh-toned make-ups of the others in the scene.<ref>''The New York Times'', \"Vampires, Monsters, Horrors!\" March 1, 1936. Quoted in White, pp. 147\u201348</ref> [[Heinz Roemheld]] composed the score<ref name=\"mank357\">Mank, p. 357</ref> and [[Albert S. D'Agostino]] redressed [[Charles D. Hall]]'s set of Dracula's castle and created new sets including a London bridge, the moor where Dracula's body is burned and Countess Zaleska's apartment.<ref>Bansak, et al., p. 113</ref>\n\n==Reception and influence==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''Dracula's Daughter'' a solid, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, review upon its release, citing the film's \"blood-curdling events\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden is a remarkably convincing bat-woman\" in concluding that the film is both \"quite terrifying\" and \"a cute little horror picture.\"<ref name = nyt>{{cite news \n | last = Nugent\n | first = Frank S.\n | title = THE SCREEN; ' Dracula's Daughter' Makes Her Debut at the Rialto and Proves She's a Chip Off the Old Block.\n | work = [[The New York Times]]\n | date = 1936-05-18\n | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9E00EFDF1230E13BBC4052DFB366838D629EDE&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes&oref=slogin\n | accessdate = 2008-11-03}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also praised the production and Holden's performance in particular.<ref>Clark, p. 188</ref> Despite critical approval, ''Dracula's Daughter'' did not have the same box office success as the original.\n\nLater reviews of ''Dracula's Daughter'' are sharply split. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', reviewing the film following its video release, called it \"one of the most satisfying vampire pictures ever made\". Describing director Hillyer's visuals as \"lush, evocative, and suffused with just the right gothic chiaroscuro\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden, as the reluctant vampire protagonist, absolutely drips patrician eroticism\", ''EW'' concludes that this film is better than Lugosi's original ''Dracula''.<ref name = ew>{{cite news \n | last = Simels\n | first = Steve\n | title = Dracula's Daughter\n | work = Entertainment Weekly\n | date = 1992-12-11\n | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20197299,00.html\n | accessdate = 2008-11-03}}</ref>\n\nRyan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while echoing the praise for Holden's performance, nonetheless found that the film \"doesn't hold up so well today\".

''Dracula's Daughter'' marked the first time that the trend was incorporated into a film.<ref>Tudor, p. 31</ref> The [[lesbian]] implications of ''Dracula's Daughter'' were obvious from the start and were of great concern to the Production Code Administration. PCA head Breen took special notice of the scene between the Countess and her model, Lili, writing, \"This will need very careful handling to avoid any questionable flavor.\"<ref name=\"worland126\">Breen, quoted in Worland, p. 126</ref> The day before the scene was to be shot, Universal's [[Harry Zehner]] asked Breen to read a draft of the scene. In response, Breen wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The present suggestion that ... Lili poses in the nude will be changed. She will be posing her neck and shoulders, and there will be no suggestion that she undresses, and there will be no exposure of her person. It was also stated that the present incomplete sequence will be followed by a scene in which Lili is taken to a hospital and there it will be definitely established that she has been attacked by a vampire. The whole sequence will be treated in such a way as to avoid any suggestion of perverse sexual desire on the part of Marya or of an attempted sexual attack by her upon Lili.<ref name=\"worland126\" /></blockquote>\n\nGay film historian [[Vito Russo]] noted in his book ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' that Universal highlighted Countess Zaleska's attraction to women in some of its original advertising for the film, using the tag line \"Save the women of London from Dracula's Daughter!\" He further cited Countess Zaleska as an example of the presentation of the \"essence of homosexuality as a predatory weakness\".<ref>Russo, p. 48</ref> Some reviewers of the day picked up on and condemned the lesbian content, including the ''New York World-Telegram'' which noted the Countess's tendency to wander around \"giving the eye to sweet young girls\".<ref>quoted in Russo, p. 48</ref> Other reviews missed it entirely, including the aforementioned ''[[The New York Times]]'' which advised \"Be sure to bring the kiddies.\"<ref name=\"nyt\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' describes the encounter between the Countess and Lili as \"so hot it's impossible to imagine how it ever got past '30s censors\"<ref name=\"ew\" /> whereas ''Time Out London'' finds only a \"subtle suggestion\" of lesbianism.<ref>{{cite news\n |title=Dracula's Daughter \n |work=Time Out London \n |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65746/Draculas_Daughter.html \n |accessdate=2008-11-03 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206164857/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65746/Draculas_Daughter.html \n |archivedate=2009-02-06 \n}}</ref> Horror scholar Skal notes that the scene has come to be seen as a \"classic 'lesbian' sequence, although of a decidedly negative stripe\".<ref>Skal, p. 200</ref> The scene between Countess Zaleska and Lili was included in the 1995 [[documentary film]] adaptation of Russo's book.\n\nAnother lesbian-tinged scene which has received less critical attention comes when the Countess is holding Janet captive. Described as \"the longest kiss never filmed\", Countess Zaleska \"hovers lovingly over Janet ... hovers ... and hovers ... slowly descending to kiss the recumbent Janet{{nbsp}}...\"<ref>Hanson, pp. 198\u201399</ref> until interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Garth.\n\n''[[Bright Lights Film Journal]]'', after noting that \"Gloria Holden in the title role almost singlehandedly redefined the '20s movie vamp as an impressive Euro-butch dyke bloodsucker\", draws an implicit comparison between Countess Zaleska's seeking to cure her vampirism through psychiatry and the former position of mainstream psychiatry of homosexuality as a mental illness (a view still held by a minority in the profession). Zaleska's cruising the streets of London is seen as parallel to [[cruising for sex]] (although that tends to be a gay male activity) and as suggesting \"society's image of the lesbian as soulless predator\" but the conclusion is that \"Holden's striking, masklike face and haunting, luminous eyes [are] the intoxicating essence of transgressive lesbian power.\"<ref>{{cite news \n | last = Morris\n | first = Gary\n | title = Queer Horror: Decoding Universal's Monsters\n | work = Bright Lights Film Journal\n | date = December 1998\n | url = http://brightlightsfilm.com/23/universalhorror.php\n |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vampire films]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Cite book |last=Abbott |first=Stacey |authorlink= |title=Celluloid Vampires: Life After Death in the Modern World |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2007 |location= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cBhLk-0PKAC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-292-71695-7}}\n* Bansak, Edmund G. and Robert Wise (2003).

Directed by [[Lambert Hillyer]] from a screenplay by [[Garrett Fort]], the film stars [[Otto Kruger]], [[Gloria Holden]] in the title role, [[Marguerite Churchill]] and features, as the only cast member to return from the original, [[Edward Van Sloan]] &ndash; although his character's name was altered from Van Helsing to ''Von'' Helsing.\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of [[Count Dracula]] and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]). He, in turn, has a fiance, Janet ([[Marguerite Churchill]]). The Countess kidnaps Janet and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess in an attempt by him to save Janet.\n\nOstensibly based on a [[short story]] titled \"[[Dracula's Guest]]\" by [[Bram Stoker]], the film bears little or no resemblance to the original source material. [[David O. Selznick]] initially purchased the rights to the story for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Selznick, likely knowing he could not legally make the film because of Universal's copyright on the original film, sold the rights to Universal. After first assigning the picture to [[James Whale]], Universal production head [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] finally put Hillyer in the director's chair.\n\nWhile not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's strong lesbian overtones, which Universal acknowledged from the start of production and exploited in some early advertising.\n\n==Plot==\n''Dracula's Daughter'' begins a few moments after ''Dracula'' ends. [[Count Dracula]] has just been destroyed by [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Von Helsing]] <!--in this film the character's name is spelled VON Helsing so please do not change it -->([[Edward Van Sloan]]). Van Helsing is arrested by two Whitby policemen, Sergeant Wilkes ([[E. E. Clive]]) and constable Albert ([[Billy Bevan]]).  Von Helsing is sent by the Whitby police to [[Scotland Yard]], where he explains to Sir Basil Humphrey ([[Gilbert Emery]]) that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because he had already been dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]), who was once one of his star students.\n\nSergeant Wilkes leaves the Whitby gaol to meet an officer from Scotland Yard at the train station. Meanwhile, Dracula's daughter, Countess Marya Zaleska ([[Gloria Holden]]), enters the gaol and mesmerizes Albert with her jeweled ring and with the aid of her manservant, Sandor ([[Irving Pichel]]), steals Dracula's body from the Whitby gaol and after tossing salt on the pyre ritualistically burns Dracula's body, hoping to break her curse of vampirism. However, Sandor soon begins to discourage her telling her that all that is in her eyes is \"death.\" She soon gives in to her thirst for blood. The Countess resumes her hunting, mesmerizing her victims with her exotic jeweled ring. After a chance meeting with Dr. Garth at a society party, the Countess asks him to help her overcome the influence she feels from beyond the grave. The doctor advises her to defeat her cravings by confronting them and the Countess becomes hopeful that her will, plus Dr. Garth's science, will be strong enough to overcome Dracula's malevolence.\n\nThe Countess sends Sandor to fetch her a model to paint.  He sees a pretty young woman, Lili ([[Nan Grey]]), and follows her onto a bridge.  The woman pauses at the railing looking despondent. Sandor promises her food, warmth and money.  She hesitates, but Sandor explains that he seeks her for his mistress. Lili returns with Sandor. Countess Zaleska initially resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth know that it was Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth to [[Transylvania]] by kidnapping Janet Blake ([[Marguerite Churchill]]), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gloria Holden]] as Countess Marya Zaleska - Dracula's Daughter\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Dr. Jeffrey Garth\n* [[Marguerite Churchill]] as Janet Blake\n* [[Irving Pichel]] as Sandor\n* [[Gilbert Emery]] as Sir Basil Humphrey, Scotland Yard\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]]\t as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Von Helsing]] <!--in this film the character's name is spelled VON Helsing so please do not change it -->\n* [[Halliwell Hobbes]] as Hawkins\n* [[Billy Bevan]] as Albert\n* [[Nan Grey]] as Lili\n* [[Hedda Hopper]] as Lady Esme Hammond\n* [[Claud Allister]] as Sir Aubrey\n* [[Edgar Norton]] as Hobbs\n* [[E.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] executive [[David O. Selznick]] negotiated a contract in 1933 with Stoker's widow, [[Florence Stoker|Florence]], to buy the rights to the chapter for an advance of $500 against a purchase price of $5,000. MGM's lawyers and executives were worried about the use of the word \"Dracula\" in the film's title, fearing that Universal would take legal action, although Selznick's contract with Stoker explicitly listed \"Dracula's Daughter\" as a possible alternative title. The project was code-named \"Tarantula\" in correspondence.<ref name=\"skal1968\" />\n\nSelznick hired [[John L. Balderston]], who had previously worked on the 1931 ''Dracula'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', to write the screenplay. Balderston's screenplay involved tying up loose ends from the original film. In it, Von Helsing returns to Transylvania to destroy the [[Brides of Dracula|three vampire brides]] seen in ''Dracula'' but overlooks a fourth tomb concealing Dracula's daughter. She follows him back to London and operates under the name \"Countess Szekelsky\". She attacks a young aristocrat and Von Helsing and the aristocrat's fianc\u00e9e track her back to Transylvania and destroy her. The script included scenes that implied that Dracula's daughter enjoyed torturing her male victims and that while under her control the men liked it too. Also included were shots of the Countess's chambers being stocked with whips and straps, which she would never use on-screen but whose uses the audience could imagine. Regardless of any objections that the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA) would have raised to many aspects of the scenario, Balderston's script could never have been filmed because Selznick's contract with Stoker expressly barred him from using any Bram Stoker characters that did not appear in \"[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]\". Selznick re-sold the rights to \"Dracula's Guest\" to Universal in September 1935<ref name=\"skal1968\">Skal, pp. 196\u201398</ref> for $12,500, which included the rights to Balderston's scenario.<ref name=\"curtis260\">Curtis, p. 260</ref> Horror film scholar [[David J. Skal]] theorizes that this was Selznick's actual motivation in buying the rights in the first place, to profit from Universal's desire for a sequel by tying up the only obvious source material.<ref>Skal, p. 196</ref>\n\n===Director===\nUniversal studio head Carl Laemmle, Jr. (nicknamed \"Junior\") wanted [[James Whale]], fresh from his great success with ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', to direct ''Dracula's Daughter''. Whale was idle, waiting for [[Irene Dunne]] to finish work on ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1935 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' so she could begin work on Whale's ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]''. Wary of directing two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called ''The Hangover Murders''. Laemmle agreed only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct ''Dracula's Daughter'' next.<ref>Curtis, pp. 254\u201355</ref> Whale completed work on the film, titled ''[[Remember Last Night?]]'' for release, on September 14, 1935.<ref>Curtis, p. 258</ref> ''Magnificent Obsession'' completed filming on October 29. With Dunne freed up, Whale went to work on ''Show Boat''. Laemmle replaced him with [[A. Edward Sutherland]], who was best known for his work on comedies. Sutherland had as little interest in ''Dracula's Daughter'' as Whale and soon left the studio,<ref>Curtis, pp. 260\u201361</ref> and Hillyer came on to direct.\n\n===Universal script===\nThe earliest scenario for the Universal film was written by [[R. C. Sherriff]]. It began with three scenes set in the 14th Century and centered on the Dracula legend. It then switched to the present day, focusing on two engaged couples who visit Transylvania. The men explore the ruins of Dracula's castle. One is later found, insane, and the other goes missing. Professor Von Helsing is summoned and he tracks the missing man to London, where he is in thrall to Dracula's daughter, the Countess Szelinski (sic). When she attempts to flee with her thrall to the Orient by ship, Von Helsing and three others book passage on the same ship. During a violent storm, Von Helsing destroys Dracula's daughter and, with her hold over the men broken, the scenario closes with a double wedding. This version was submitted on August 28, 1935 to the [[British Board of Film Censors]], which rejected it, saying in part \"...{{nbsp}}''Dracula's Daughter'' would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.\" On September 10 Sherriff met with BBFC representatives and submitted a revised scenario two days later. This scenario was passed but because its details were not recorded by the BBFC it is unknown how much it differed from the original or how much if any of that scenario was retained in the final script.<ref>Robertson pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nUniversal also submitted Sheriff's first draft to the PCA on September 5, 1935 and encountered stronger resistance from PCA enforcer [[Joseph Breen]] than it had from the British. Breen reported back that the script \"contains countless offensive stuff which makes the picture utterly impossible for approval under the Production Code\".<ref>Breen, quoted in Skal, p. 198</ref> A second draft was submitted on October 21, but it too was rejected, with many of Breen's objections centering on the 14th Century scenes in which Dracula himself appeared. It is unclear whether this submission was the same submission that the BBFC had previously passed. A third Sheriff draft was submitted three days later and Sherriff's fourth and final draft on November 10. All remained unacceptable, and Whale biographer James Curtis suggests that Whale, who had no interest in the project and feared that his commitment to it might cost him control over the filming of ''Show Boat'', encouraged Sherriff to submit ever more wildly unacceptable versions in hopes of getting himself off the film.<ref name=\"curtis260\" /> On January 14, 1936, producer [[E. M. Asher]] advised Breen that the Sherriff script was not going to be used and that a new script would be put together from scratch. Screenwriting duties were assigned to Garrett Fort.<ref>Skal, pp. 198\u201399</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:GloriaHolden2DraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right|Gloria Holden]]\n[[File:OttoKrugerDraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' was Gloria Holden's first starring role and reportedly she was extremely displeased at having been assigned it. Like many actors, Holden looked down on horror films. She had also seen [[Bela Lugosi]] struggle over the years since ''Dracula'' was made to free himself from [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] and feared that the role would lead to the same fate for her. Critic Mark Clark believes that ironically it may have been Holden's disgust for the role that led to the quality of her performance. \"Her disdain for the part translates into a kind of self-loathing that perfectly suits her troubled character.\"<ref>Clark, p. 184</ref>\n\nInitially Lugosi and [[Jane Wyatt]] were set to star in the film. Universal also announced that [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Colin Clive]], who had starred together in ''Frankenstein'' and ''Bride of Frankenstein'', would appear,<ref name=\"rhodes219\">Rhodes, p. 219</ref> and that [[Cesar Romero]] would play Dr. Garth.<ref name=\"mank365\">Mank, p. 365</ref> According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Universal had sought [[Herbert Marshall]] for the role of Sandor, before casting Pichel.<ref name=\"mank365\" /> None of them appeared except, after a fashion, Lugosi, in the form of a wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.<ref name=\"rhodes219\" />\n\n===Shooting===\n[[File:Dracula's Daughter - Poster 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Theatrical poster]]\nShooting on ''Dracula's Daughter'' began on February 4, 1936, rushed into production before Fort had completed the script,<ref>Mank, p. 356</ref> because of a deadline clause in Universal's option of the property from Selznick.<ref>Skal, p. 199</ref> The script was not finalized until shooting had been underway for three weeks.<ref name=\"mank357\" /> The film was completed on March 10.<ref>Mank, p. 358</ref> Despite studio orders that the film be shot on a seven-day-per-week schedule,<ref name=\"mank357\" /> filming ran seven days over its schedule and $50,000 over budget, with the final cost of the film tallied at $278,380.<ref>Senn, p. 361</ref>\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' was the last in the first cycle of [[Universal Horror]] films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal said it was because a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate.<ref>Johnson, p. 7</ref> In truth, the cycle was suspended because, just before filming on ''Dracula's Daughter'' had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from [[J. Cheever Cowdin]], head of the [[Standard Capital Corporation]], and from [[Charles R. Rogers]]. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of ''Dracula's Daughter'' to focus on fare like [[Deanna Durbin]] musicals.<ref>Johnson, p. 129</ref> Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' in 1939.\n\n===Other production aspects===\nMakeup artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] and special effects supervisor [[John P. Fulton]] worked together closely, especially on Holden's make-up design. They combined special lighting with a greyish-green make-up for Holden's final scenes, creating a pallor that contrasted with the more normally flesh-toned make-ups of the others in the scene.<ref>''The New York Times'', \"Vampires, Monsters, Horrors!\" March 1, 1936. Quoted in White, pp. 147\u201348</ref> [[Heinz Roemheld]] composed the score<ref name=\"mank357\">Mank, p. 357</ref> and [[Albert S. D'Agostino]] redressed [[Charles D. Hall]]'s set of Dracula's castle and created new sets including a London bridge, the moor where Dracula's body is burned and Countess Zaleska's apartment.<ref>Bansak, et al., p. 113</ref>\n\n==Reception and influence==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''Dracula's Daughter'' a solid, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, review upon its release, citing the film's \"blood-curdling events\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden is a remarkably convincing bat-woman\" in concluding that the film is both \"quite terrifying\" and \"a cute little horror picture.\"<ref name = nyt>{{cite news \n | last = Nugent\n | first = Frank S.\n | title = THE SCREEN; ' Dracula's Daughter' Makes Her Debut at the Rialto and Proves She's a Chip Off the Old Block.\n | work = [[The New York Times]]\n | date = 1936-05-18\n | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9E00EFDF1230E13BBC4052DFB366838D629EDE&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes&oref=slogin\n | accessdate = 2008-11-03}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also praised the production and Holden's performance in particular.<ref>Clark, p. 188</ref> Despite critical approval, ''Dracula's Daughter'' did not have the same box office success as the original.\n\nLater reviews of ''Dracula's Daughter'' are sharply split. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', reviewing the film following its video release, called it \"one of the most satisfying vampire pictures ever made\". Describing director Hillyer's visuals as \"lush, evocative, and suffused with just the right gothic chiaroscuro\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden, as the reluctant vampire protagonist, absolutely drips patrician eroticism\", ''EW'' concludes that this film is better than Lugosi's original ''Dracula''.<ref name = ew>{{cite news \n | last = Simels\n | first = Steve\n | title = Dracula's Daughter\n | work = Entertainment Weekly\n | date = 1992-12-11\n | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20197299,00.html\n | accessdate = 2008-11-03}}</ref>\n\nRyan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while echoing the praise for Holden's performance, nonetheless found that the film \"doesn't hold up so well today\". Citing what he sees as slow pacing and \"long bouts of over-the-top dialogue\", Cracknell compares the film to \"reading a textbook \u2013 not the most exciting thing in the world, but it does provide insights into and perspectives on the foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Cracknell \n |first=Ryan \n |title=Dracula's Daughter \n |publisher=Apollo Movie Guide \n |url=http://apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3389&Specific=4076 \n |accessdate=2008-11-07 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206230627/http://apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3389&Specific=4076 \n |archivedate=2009-02-06 \n}}</ref> Michael W.

''Dracula's Daughter'' marked the first time that the trend was incorporated into a film.<ref>Tudor, p. 31</ref> The [[lesbian]] implications of ''Dracula's Daughter'' were obvious from the start and were of great concern to the Production Code Administration. PCA head Breen took special notice of the scene between the Countess and her model, Lili, writing, \"This will need very careful handling to avoid any questionable flavor.\"<ref name=\"worland126\">Breen, quoted in Worland, p. 126</ref> The day before the scene was to be shot, Universal's [[Harry Zehner]] asked Breen to read a draft of the scene. In response, Breen wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The present suggestion that ... Lili poses in the nude will be changed. She will be posing her neck and shoulders, and there will be no suggestion that she undresses, and there will be no exposure of her person. It was also stated that the present incomplete sequence will be followed by a scene in which Lili is taken to a hospital and there it will be definitely established that she has been attacked by a vampire.

Zaleska's cruising the streets of London is seen as parallel to [[cruising for sex]] (although that tends to be a gay male activity) and as suggesting \"society's image of the lesbian as soulless predator\" but the conclusion is that \"Holden's striking, masklike face and haunting, luminous eyes [are] the intoxicating essence of transgressive lesbian power.\"<ref>{{cite news \n | last = Morris\n | first = Gary\n | title = Queer Horror: Decoding Universal's Monsters\n | work = Bright Lights Film Journal\n | date = December 1998\n | url = http://brightlightsfilm.com/23/universalhorror.php\n |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vampire films]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Cite book |last=Abbott |first=Stacey |authorlink= |title=Celluloid Vampires: Life After Death in the Modern World |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2007 |location= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cBhLk-0PKAC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-292-71695-7}}\n* Bansak, Edmund G. and Robert Wise (2003).

He did show an ability to put the ball in play with a low [[strikeout]] rate (one for 13 [[At bat|at-bats]]). Some of his great contributions came when going to the opposite field in [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]] situations and with infield hits. An avid [[Bunt (baseball)|bunter]], he led the league in [[sacrifice hits|sacrificial hit]]s in 1991 (19).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Though not a threat as a [[Stolen base|base stealer]], he was a competent base runner. In the field, Sojo had a good range and a good arm, showing quick hands and slick moves.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Toronto Blue Jays (1990)===\nHe signed with the Blue Jays on January 3, 1986. Called up late in the 1990 season, Sojo played 33 games for the Blue Jays.  He promptly went 18-for-80 (.225) and was then traded to the [[California Angels]] with a player to be named later (Ken Rivers).\n\n===California Angels (1991\u20131992)===\nSojo played 219 games for the Angels over two years.  In 1991, he had 19 sacrifice hits, a career-high.  He was traded back to the Blue Jays after the 1992 season.\n\n===Return to Toronto (1993)===\nSojo played only 19 games in 1993, and was only 8 for 47 (.170), although he managed to collect six [[runs batted in]].  He earned his first of five World Series rings with the Blue Jays.  On October 15, he was granted free agency.\n\n===Seattle Mariners (1994\u20131996)===\nSojo hit .277 over 63 games in the strike-shortened 1994 season, while also hitting 6 home runs, then a career-best.  He was once again awarded a starting role in 1995, where he played in 102 games, his second-highest career total.  He finished the season with 98 hits, and seven home runs, tying a career best.  In the [[1995 American League Division Series]] against the Yankees, he played in all five games, going 5-for-20 with 3 runs batted in.  He continued his hot streak into the [[1995 American League Championship Series]], again going 5-for-20 as the Mariners lost to the [[Cleveland Indians]].  In 1996,\n\nSojo began the 1996 season with the Mariners, hitting just .211 (52 for 247) over 77 games before being claimed off of waivers by the [[New York Yankees]] on August 22, 1996.\n\n===First stint with the Yankees (1996\u20131999)===\nSojo began his Yankee career 11-for-40 (.275) while only striking out four times with one walk.  After playing only 18 games with the Yankees, he was added to the postseason roster.  He did not receive a plate appearance during the [[1996 American League Division Series]], but played as a defensive replacement and pinch runner.  He did, however, play in the [[1996 American League Championship Series]], going 1 for 5 over 3 games.  Despite his limited playing time in that postseason, he played in five of the six games of the [[1996 World Series]], going 3 for 5 (.600) with a double and a [[run batted in]].  Sojo earned his second [[World Series ring]] when the Yankees defeated the [[Atlanta Braves]].\n\nOn January 9, 1997, Sojo re-signed with the Yankees. In 1997, Sojo began to see his playing time decrease. He played in only 77 games, hitting .377. Sojo's 25 [[runs batted in]] was his most as a Yankee.  He did not play at all in the 1997 postseason as the Yankees were defeated by the [[Cleveland Indians]].  He was granted free agency on October 31, and again re-signed with the Yankees on November 12, 1997.\n\nDuring the 1998 season, Sojo's playing time again decreased as he saw action in only 54 games, hitting .231. He had 34 hits and 14 runs batted in during the season, but did not play in the [[1998 American League Division Series]].  He rejoined the team for the [[1998 American League Championship Series|Championship Series]], where he played in one game. He did not play in the [[1998 World Series|World Series]], but received a ring regardless.\n\nIn 1999, he played in just 49 games, less than the previous year, but hit .252 and again missed the Division Series.  He re-joined the team for the [[1999 American League Championship Series]], where he had only one at-bat.  He was not much of a force in the [[1999 World Series|World Series]] that year either, with just one at-bat, but nevertheless received a [[World Series ring]].  He was released on November 10.\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates (2000)===\nOn January 9, 2000, Sojo signed with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. He played in 61 games and hit .284 with 5 home runs before being traded to the Yankees on August 7 in exchange for [[Chris Spurling]].\n\n===Second stint with the Yankees (2000\u20132001)===\nSojo played in 34 games after being traded and hit .288, earning him a spot on the postseason roster. Playing in all five games of the [[American League Division Series]], he was 3 for 16 with 5 RBIs and 3 hits.  Playing in all six games of the [[2000 American League Championship Series]], he went 6 for 23.  In Game 5 of the [[2000 World Series]], Sojo turned from a role player to a hero.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/10262000.shtml 2000 World Series Game 5 Box Score<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> With the score tied at two with two outs in the ninth inning, Sojo singled to center, driving in [[Jorge Posada]] to break the tie with [[Scott Brosius]] also scoring on the errant throw to home plate.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN200010260.shtml October 26, 2000 World Series Game 5, Yankees at Mets] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref> The Yankees won their 26th World Series, their third consecutive, and fourth in the [[Joe Torre]] era. Sojo obtained his fifth [[World Series ring]], (4 with New York and one with the Blue Jays).  On November 7, Sojo was released again and re-signed exactly one month later on December 7. In 2001, he played in 39 games, collecting only 13 hits, but proved productive, as he drove in nine runs.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  After missing the [[2001 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]], he received one at-bat in the [[American League Championship Series]].  He played in two of the seven games in [[2001 World Series|that year's World Series]], going 1 for 3 with a run batted in.\n\n==Retirement and first coaching stint (2002)==\nIn 2002, Sojo failed to earn a spot on the Yankees roster, and retired from playing Major League Baseball. He then made his managerial debut with the Yankees Double A affiliate [[Norwich Navigators]],<ref>[http://forums.nyyfans.com/showthread.php/27794-Luis-Sojo-to-manage-the-Norwich-Navigators Luis Sojo to manage the Norwich Navigators<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and led the team to its first Eastern League Championship.\n\n==Return to the Major Leagues (2003)==\n2003 was a unique year for Sojo. Having left the Navigators, Sojo was invited to the Yankees [[Old Timers Day]]. During the annual Old Timers' Game, he hit the game-winning home run off [[Ron Guidry]]. Later that season, the Yankees re-signed him as an active player, and he appeared in three games to conclude the season.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/2004-07-11/features/0407110151_1_diana-munson-munson-moment-michael-munson A Munson Moment \u2013 Hartford Courant<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He may be the only Yankee (or overall player) in history to play in an Old Timers Game and later a regular season game in the same year.\n\nIn 13 seasons, Sojo [[Batting average (baseball)|batted]] .261 (671-for-2571) with 36 [[home run]]s, 261 RBI, 300 [[Run (baseball)|runs]], 103 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]], 12 [[Triple (baseball)|triples]], and 28 [[stolen base]]s in 848 games.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Post playing days==\nAfter his playing career, he served as the New York Yankees third base coach for the 2004 and 2005 seasons, after which he would serve as [[manager (baseball)|manager]] for the Class A Advanced [[Tampa Yankees]] from 2006 to 2009, before being relieved on Feb. 2, 2010.<ref name=\"Colbrunn Named RiverDogs Manager, Tyson Promoted to Manage Tampa Yankees\">[http://riverdogs.com/news/headlines/index.html?article_id=2064 The Official Site of Minor League Baseball | Charleston RiverDogs Homepage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sojo also managed the [[Venezuelan national baseball team]] in the 2006, 2009, and the 2013 [[World Baseball Classic]].

He did show an ability to put the ball in play with a low [[strikeout]] rate (one for 13 [[At bat|at-bats]]). Some of his great contributions came when going to the opposite field in [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]] situations and with infield hits. An avid [[Bunt (baseball)|bunter]], he led the league in [[sacrifice hits|sacrificial hit]]s in 1991 (19).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Though not a threat as a [[Stolen base|base stealer]], he was a competent base runner. In the field, Sojo had a good range and a good arm, showing quick hands and slick moves.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Toronto Blue Jays (1990)===\nHe signed with the Blue Jays on January 3, 1986. Called up late in the 1990 season, Sojo played 33 games for the Blue Jays.  He promptly went 18-for-80 (.225) and was then traded to the [[California Angels]] with a player to be named later (Ken Rivers).\n\n===California Angels (1991\u20131992)===\nSojo played 219 games for the Angels over two years.  In 1991, he had 19 sacrifice hits, a career-high.  He was traded back to the Blue Jays after the 1992 season.\n\n===Return to Toronto (1993)===\nSojo played only 19 games in 1993, and was only 8 for 47 (.170), although he managed to collect six [[runs batted in]].  He earned his first of five World Series rings with the Blue Jays.  On October 15, he was granted free agency.\n\n===Seattle Mariners (1994\u20131996)===\nSojo hit .277 over 63 games in the strike-shortened 1994 season, while also hitting 6 home runs, then a career-best.  He was once again awarded a starting role in 1995, where he played in 102 games, his second-highest career total.  He finished the season with 98 hits, and seven home runs, tying a career best.  In the [[1995 American League Division Series]] against the Yankees, he played in all five games, going 5-for-20 with 3 runs batted in.  He continued his hot streak into the [[1995 American League Championship Series]], again going 5-for-20 as the Mariners lost to the [[Cleveland Indians]].  In 1996,\n\nSojo began the 1996 season with the Mariners, hitting just .211 (52 for 247) over 77 games before being claimed off of waivers by the [[New York Yankees]] on August 22, 1996.\n\n===First stint with the Yankees (1996\u20131999)===\nSojo began his Yankee career 11-for-40 (.275) while only striking out four times with one walk.  After playing only 18 games with the Yankees, he was added to the postseason roster.  He did not receive a plate appearance during the [[1996 American League Division Series]], but played as a defensive replacement and pinch runner.  He did, however, play in the [[1996 American League Championship Series]], going 1 for 5 over 3 games.  Despite his limited playing time in that postseason, he played in five of the six games of the [[1996 World Series]], going 3 for 5 (.600) with a double and a [[run batted in]].  Sojo earned his second [[World Series ring]] when the Yankees defeated the [[Atlanta Braves]].\n\nOn January 9, 1997, Sojo re-signed with the Yankees. In 1997, Sojo began to see his playing time decrease. He played in only 77 games, hitting .377. Sojo's 25 [[runs batted in]] was his most as a Yankee.  He did not play at all in the 1997 postseason as the Yankees were defeated by the [[Cleveland Indians]].  He was granted free agency on October 31, and again re-signed with the Yankees on November 12, 1997.\n\nDuring the 1998 season, Sojo's playing time again decreased as he saw action in only 54 games, hitting .231. He had 34 hits and 14 runs batted in during the season, but did not play in the [[1998 American League Division Series]].  He rejoined the team for the [[1998 American League Championship Series|Championship Series]], where he played in one game. He did not play in the [[1998 World Series|World Series]], but received a ring regardless.\n\nIn 1999, he played in just 49 games, less than the previous year, but hit .252 and again missed the Division Series.  He re-joined the team for the [[1999 American League Championship Series]], where he had only one at-bat.  He was not much of a force in the [[1999 World Series|World Series]] that year either, with just one at-bat, but nevertheless received a [[World Series ring]].  He was released on November 10.\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates (2000)===\nOn January 9, 2000, Sojo signed with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. He played in 61 games and hit .284 with 5 home runs before being traded to the Yankees on August 7 in exchange for [[Chris Spurling]].\n\n===Second stint with the Yankees (2000\u20132001)===\nSojo played in 34 games after being traded and hit .288, earning him a spot on the postseason roster. Playing in all five games of the [[American League Division Series]], he was 3 for 16 with 5 RBIs and 3 hits.  Playing in all six games of the [[2000 American League Championship Series]], he went 6 for 23.  In Game 5 of the [[2000 World Series]], Sojo turned from a role player to a hero.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/10262000.shtml 2000 World Series Game 5 Box Score<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> With the score tied at two with two outs in the ninth inning, Sojo singled to center, driving in [[Jorge Posada]] to break the tie with [[Scott Brosius]] also scoring on the errant throw to home plate.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN200010260.shtml October 26, 2000 World Series Game 5, Yankees at Mets] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref> The Yankees won their 26th World Series, their third consecutive, and fourth in the [[Joe Torre]] era. Sojo obtained his fifth [[World Series ring]], (4 with New York and one with the Blue Jays).  On November 7, Sojo was released again and re-signed exactly one month later on December 7. In 2001, he played in 39 games, collecting only 13 hits, but proved productive, as he drove in nine runs.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  After missing the [[2001 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]], he received one at-bat in the [[American League Championship Series]].  He played in two of the seven games in [[2001 World Series|that year's World Series]], going 1 for 3 with a run batted in.\n\n==Retirement and first coaching stint (2002)==\nIn 2002, Sojo failed to earn a spot on the Yankees roster, and retired from playing Major League Baseball. He then made his managerial debut with the Yankees Double A affiliate [[Norwich Navigators]],<ref>[http://forums.nyyfans.com/showthread.php/27794-Luis-Sojo-to-manage-the-Norwich-Navigators Luis Sojo to manage the Norwich Navigators<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and led the team to its first Eastern League Championship.\n\n==Return to the Major Leagues (2003)==\n2003 was a unique year for Sojo. Having left the Navigators, Sojo was invited to the Yankees [[Old Timers Day]]. During the annual Old Timers' Game, he hit the game-winning home run off [[Ron Guidry]]. Later that season, the Yankees re-signed him as an active player, and he appeared in three games to conclude the season.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/2004-07-11/features/0407110151_1_diana-munson-munson-moment-michael-munson A Munson Moment \u2013 Hartford Courant<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He may be the only Yankee (or overall player) in history to play in an Old Timers Game and later a regular season game in the same year.\n\nIn 13 seasons, Sojo [[Batting average (baseball)|batted]] .261 (671-for-2571) with 36 [[home run]]s, 261 RBI, 300 [[Run (baseball)|runs]], 103 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]], 12 [[Triple (baseball)|triples]], and 28 [[stolen base]]s in 848 games.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Post playing days==\nAfter his playing career, he served as the New York Yankees third base coach for the 2004 and 2005 seasons, after which he would serve as [[manager (baseball)|manager]] for the Class A Advanced [[Tampa Yankees]] from 2006 to 2009, before being relieved on Feb. 2, 2010.<ref name=\"Colbrunn Named RiverDogs Manager, Tyson Promoted to Manage Tampa Yankees\">[http://riverdogs.com/news/headlines/index.html?article_id=2064 The Official Site of Minor League Baseball | Charleston RiverDogs Homepage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sojo also managed the [[Venezuelan national baseball team]] in the 2006, 2009, and the 2013 [[World Baseball Classic]].
