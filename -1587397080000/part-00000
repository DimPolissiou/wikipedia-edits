The RTP employs between 210,700 and 230,000 officers, roughly 17 percent of all civil servants (excluding the military and the employees of state-owned enterprises).<ref name=\"BP-20160224\" /><ref name=Interpol>{{cite web|title=Thailand Royal Thai Police|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Asia-South-Pacific/Thailand|website=Interpol|accessdate=3 Apr 2015}}</ref> The RTP is frequently recognized as the fourth armed force of Thailand since their tradition, concept, culture, skill, and training are relatively similar to the army and most of their officer cadets need to graduate from the [[Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School]] before entering the Police Academy. Officers also undergo paramilitary training similar to the army but with an additional focus on law enforcement.\n\n==About==\n[[File:Rpcacommander-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|RPCA officers of Royal Police Cadet Academy]]\n[[File:Royal Thai police headquarter.jpg|thumb|Royal Thai Police headquarters in [[Pathum Wan]] District, [[Bangkok]]]]\nUntil the 19th century [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]] personnel, aside from their duties of national defence, also performed law enforcement duties alongside dedicated civil servants. Responsibility for law and order was divided into the six ministries led by chancellors of state (during the Ayutthaya and Thonburi eras); in time of war, police units were under royal command as part of the army. Only during the reigns of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) and King [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V) did the nation see a huge reform and the Westernization of Thai law enforcement forces to adapt to the changing situation and needs of the country. By 1902, the [[Royal Police Cadet Academy]] (RCPA)<ref>{{cite web |title=RCPA: Royal Police Cadet Academy |url=http://www.rpca.ac.th/ |website=RCPA |accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref> was founded to train future police officers. In 1915 the provincial and urban police forces were united as one national organization under the Ministry of Interior (established 1894).<ref name=Haanstad-2013>{{cite book|last1=Haanstad|first1=Eric|editor1-last=Chambers|editor1-first=Paul|title=Knights of the Realm: Thailand's Military and Police, Then and Now|date=2013|publisher=White Lotus Press|isbn=9744801980|page=461|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303374463_A_Brief_History_of_the_Thai_Police|accessdate=15 February 2017|format=PDF|chapter=Chapter 3: A Brief History of the Thai Police}}</ref>\n\nPrimary responsibility for the maintenance of public order through enforcement of the kingdom's laws was exercised by the Thailand National Police Department (TNPD), a subdivision of the Interior Ministry. Charged with performing police functions throughout the entire country, the TNPD was a unitary agency whose power and influence in Thai national life had at times rivalled that of the armed forces itself.\n\nThe formal functions of the TNPD included more than the enforcement of laws and apprehension of offenders. The department also played an important role in the government's efforts to suppress the remnants of the [[communist insurgency in Thailand|communist insurgency]]. In the event of an invasion by external forces, much of the police force would come under the control of the Ministry of Defense to serve with, but not be incorporated into, the military forces.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOriginally modelled on the pre\u2013World War II national police force of [[Japan]], the TNPD was reorganized several times to meet changing public order and internal security needs. American advice, training, and equipment, which were provided from 1951 through the early 1970s, did much to introduce new law enforcement concepts and practices and to aid in the modernization of the TNPD. During this era the strength and effectiveness of the police grew steadily.\n\nAll components of the police system were administered by the TNPD headquarters in Bangkok, which also provided technical support for law enforcement activities throughout the kingdom. The major operational units of the force were the Provincial Police, the Border Patrol Police (BPP), the Metropolitan Police, and smaller specialized units supervised by the Central Investigation Bureau.\n\nIn mid-1987 the total strength of the TNPD, including administrative and support personnel, was estimated at roughly 110,000. Of this number, over one-half were assigned to the Provincial Police and some 40,000 to the BPP. More than 10,000 served in the Metropolitan Police. Quasi-military in character, the TNPD was headed by a director general, who held the rank of police general. He was assisted by three deputy directors general and five assistant directors general, all of whom held the rank of police lieutenant general. Throughout the TNPD system, all ranks except the lowest (constable) corresponded to those of the army. The proliferation of high ranks in the TNPD organizational structure, as in the military, indicated the political impact of the police on national life.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1998, TNPD was transferred from the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]] of Thailand to be directly under the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Thailand)|Office of the Prime Minister]]. It acquired a new name, in English, the \"Royal Thai Police\" (RTP).

It is headed by a commander who reported to the police commissioner-general, and administered through four police regions\u2014geographic areas of responsibility similar to those of the army regional commands. This force provides police services to every town and village throughout the kingdom except metropolitan Bangkok and border areas. The Provincial Police thus handled law enforcement activities and in many cases was the principal representative of the central government's authority in much of the country.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early-1970s, as the police assumed an increasing role in counterinsurgency operations, a lack of coordination among security forces operating in the rural areas became apparent. Observers noted that the overall police effort suffered because of conflicting organizational patterns and the highly centralized control system that required decisions on most matters to emanate from the various police bureaus of the (then) TNPD headquarters in Bangkok.\n\nA reorganization of the TNPD in 1978 and 1979 gave more command authority to the four police [[lieutenant general]]s who served as regional commissioners of the Provincial Police. Thereafter, the senior officers of each region not only controlled all provincial police assigned to their respective geographic areas but also directed the railroad, highway, marine, and forestry police units operating there, without going through the chain of command to the Central Investigation Bureau in Bangkok. Although this change increased the workload of the regional headquarters, it resulted in greater efficiency and improved law enforcement.\n\nThe Provincial Police Division is divided into 10 regions covering the 76 [[Provinces of Thailand]] except metropolitan Bangkok and the border areas:\n* Region 1 - Ayuthaya\n* Region 2 - Chonburi\n* Region 3 - Nakhon Ratchasima\n* Region 4 - Khon Kaen\n* Region 5 - Chiang Mai\n* Region 6 - Phitsanulok\n* Region 7 - Nakhon Pathom\n* Region 8 - Surat Thani\n* Region 9 - Songkhla\n\n;* Chaiya Training\n;* Special Operations Units\n\n===Police education bureau===\n[[File:Rpcacommander-04.jpg|thumb|right|RTP officers, Royal Police Cadet Academy]]\n\nThe RTP Police Education Bureau is responsible for training police personnel in the latest methods of law enforcement and the use of modern weapons.

At the level of constable, this petty thievery is driven by low wages: entry level salaries for police with no university education was 6,800 baht (2012).

Officers also undergo paramilitary training similar to the army but with an additional focus on law enforcement.\n\n==About==\n[[File:Rpcacommander-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|RPCA officers of Royal Police Cadet Academy]]\n[[File:Royal Thai police headquarter.jpg|thumb|Royal Thai Police headquarters in [[Pathum Wan]] District, [[Bangkok]]]]\nUntil the 19th century [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]] personnel, aside from their duties of national defence, also performed law enforcement duties alongside dedicated civil servants. Responsibility for law and order was divided into the six ministries led by chancellors of state (during the Ayutthaya and Thonburi eras); in time of war, police units were under royal command as part of the army. Only during the reigns of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) and King [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V) did the nation see a huge reform and the Westernization of Thai law enforcement forces to adapt to the changing situation and needs of the country. By 1902, the [[Royal Police Cadet Academy]] (RCPA)<ref>{{cite web |title=RCPA: Royal Police Cadet Academy |url=http://www.rpca.ac.th/ |website=RCPA |accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref> was founded to train future police officers. In 1915 the provincial and urban police forces were united as one national organization under the Ministry of Interior (established 1894).<ref name=Haanstad-2013>{{cite book|last1=Haanstad|first1=Eric|editor1-last=Chambers|editor1-first=Paul|title=Knights of the Realm: Thailand's Military and Police, Then and Now|date=2013|publisher=White Lotus Press|isbn=9744801980|page=461|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303374463_A_Brief_History_of_the_Thai_Police|accessdate=15 February 2017|format=PDF|chapter=Chapter 3: A Brief History of the Thai Police}}</ref>\n\nPrimary responsibility for the maintenance of public order through enforcement of the kingdom's laws was exercised by the Thailand National Police Department (TNPD), a subdivision of the Interior Ministry. Charged with performing police functions throughout the entire country, the TNPD was a unitary agency whose power and influence in Thai national life had at times rivalled that of the armed forces itself.\n\nThe formal functions of the TNPD included more than the enforcement of laws and apprehension of offenders. The department also played an important role in the government's efforts to suppress the remnants of the [[communist insurgency in Thailand|communist insurgency]]. In the event of an invasion by external forces, much of the police force would come under the control of the Ministry of Defense to serve with, but not be incorporated into, the military forces.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOriginally modelled on the pre\u2013World War II national police force of [[Japan]], the TNPD was reorganized several times to meet changing public order and internal security needs. American advice, training, and equipment, which were provided from 1951 through the early 1970s, did much to introduce new law enforcement concepts and practices and to aid in the modernization of the TNPD. During this era the strength and effectiveness of the police grew steadily.\n\nAll components of the police system were administered by the TNPD headquarters in Bangkok, which also provided technical support for law enforcement activities throughout the kingdom. The major operational units of the force were the Provincial Police, the Border Patrol Police (BPP), the Metropolitan Police, and smaller specialized units supervised by the Central Investigation Bureau.\n\nIn mid-1987 the total strength of the TNPD, including administrative and support personnel, was estimated at roughly 110,000. Of this number, over one-half were assigned to the Provincial Police and some 40,000 to the BPP. More than 10,000 served in the Metropolitan Police. Quasi-military in character, the TNPD was headed by a director general, who held the rank of police general. He was assisted by three deputy directors general and five assistant directors general, all of whom held the rank of police lieutenant general. Throughout the TNPD system, all ranks except the lowest (constable) corresponded to those of the army. The proliferation of high ranks in the TNPD organizational structure, as in the military, indicated the political impact of the police on national life.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1998, TNPD was transferred from the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]] of Thailand to be directly under the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Thailand)|Office of the Prime Minister]]. It acquired a new name, in English, the \"Royal Thai Police\" (RTP).

It is headed by a commander who reported to the police commissioner-general, and administered through four police regions\u2014geographic areas of responsibility similar to those of the army regional commands. This force provides police services to every town and village throughout the kingdom except metropolitan Bangkok and border areas. The Provincial Police thus handled law enforcement activities and in many cases was the principal representative of the central government's authority in much of the country.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early-1970s, as the police assumed an increasing role in counterinsurgency operations, a lack of coordination among security forces operating in the rural areas became apparent. Observers noted that the overall police effort suffered because of conflicting organizational patterns and the highly centralized control system that required decisions on most matters to emanate from the various police bureaus of the (then) TNPD headquarters in Bangkok.\n\nA reorganization of the TNPD in 1978 and 1979 gave more command authority to the four police [[lieutenant general]]s who served as regional commissioners of the Provincial Police. Thereafter, the senior officers of each region not only controlled all provincial police assigned to their respective geographic areas but also directed the railroad, highway, marine, and forestry police units operating there, without going through the chain of command to the Central Investigation Bureau in Bangkok. Although this change increased the workload of the regional headquarters, it resulted in greater efficiency and improved law enforcement.\n\nThe Provincial Police Division is divided into 10 regions covering the 76 [[Provinces of Thailand]] except metropolitan Bangkok and the border areas:\n* Region 1 - Ayuthaya\n* Region 2 - Chonburi\n* Region 3 - Nakhon Ratchasima\n* Region 4 - Khon Kaen\n* Region 5 - Chiang Mai\n* Region 6 - Phitsanulok\n* Region 7 - Nakhon Pathom\n* Region 8 - Surat Thani\n* Region 9 - Songkhla\n\n;* Chaiya Training\n;* Special Operations Units\n\n===Police education bureau===\n[[File:Rpcacommander-04.jpg|thumb|right|RTP officers, Royal Police Cadet Academy]]\n\nThe RTP Police Education Bureau is responsible for training police personnel in the latest methods of law enforcement and the use of modern weapons.

At the level of constable, this petty thievery is driven by low wages: entry level salaries for police with no university education was 6,800 baht (2012).

The legend claims that Nizam gave the gold to Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] in 1965, when the latter visited Hyderabad during an India-wide tour to raise funds for the post-war economy. According to the story, Nizam asked only the boxes containing the gold to be returned.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn reality, the Nizam did not donate 5,000&nbsp;kg of gold, he invested 425&nbsp;kg of gold in the National Defence Gold Scheme. The Scheme was floated by the government in October 1965 to deal with an economic crisis, and the investors were offered a 6.5% interest rate. The scheme included an amnesty clause: the gold acquired using income not disclosed to the income tax authorities was exempted from tax, if invested in the scheme. The Nizam indeed met Shastri in Hyderabad, and agreed to invest 425&nbsp;kg of old gold [[mohur]]s (coins), which were valued at {{INR}} 5 million at the time. Shastri later thanked the Nizam at a public meeting, stating that the government planned to send these gold coins to foreign countries, expecting to obtain {{INR}} 10 million in return.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear who received the return on this investment. In 2018, the Nizam's grandson [[Mir Najaf Ali Khan]] stated that according to his knowledge, none of the 52 trusts created by the Nizam had received any money from this investment. English-language newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]'' submitted a [[Right to Information Act, 2005|Right to Information]] query to the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) in 2018 asking for information on the investment and the final beneficiary. However, the RBI refused to provide this information, citing \"unwarranted invasion of the privacy\" clause of the RTI law.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\"/>\n\n== Operation Polo and forced abdication ==\n\n[[File:OsmanNehruJN.jpg|thumb|175px|(From left to right): Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the Nizam and Major [[Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri]] after Hyderabad's accession to India]]\n\n{{Main|Indian annexation of Hyderabad}}\n\nAfter Indian independence in 1947, the country was partitioned into [[India]] and Pakistan. The princely states were left free to make whatever arrangement they wished with either India or Pakistan. The Nizam ruled over more than 16 million people and {{convert|82698|sqmi|km2}} of territory when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. The Nizam refused to join either India or Pakistan, preferring to form a separate independent kingdom within the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nThis proposal for independence was rejected by the British government, but the Nizam continued to explore it. Towards this end, he kept up open negotiations with the Government of India regarding the modalities of a future relationship while opening covert negotiations with Pakistan in a similar vein. The Nizam cited the [[Razakars (Hyderabad)|Razakars]] as evidence that the people of the state were opposed to any agreement with India.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nUltimately the new Indian government decided to invade and capture Hyderabad in 1948, in an operation code named [[Operation Polo]]. Under the supervision of Major General [[Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri]], one division of the [[Indian Army]] and a tank brigade invaded Hyderabad.\n\n==Title conferred==\n\nThe Nizam was the honorary Colonel of the 20 Deccan Horse.

The legend claims that Nizam gave the gold to Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] in 1965, when the latter visited Hyderabad during an India-wide tour to raise funds for the post-war economy. According to the story, Nizam asked only the boxes containing the gold to be returned.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn reality, the Nizam did not donate 5,000&nbsp;kg of gold, he invested 425&nbsp;kg of gold in the National Defence Gold Scheme. The Scheme was floated by the government in October 1965 to deal with an economic crisis, and the investors were offered a 6.5% interest rate. The scheme included an amnesty clause: the gold acquired using income not disclosed to the income tax authorities was exempted from tax, if invested in the scheme. The Nizam indeed met Shastri in Hyderabad, and agreed to invest 425&nbsp;kg of old gold [[mohur]]s (coins), which were valued at {{INR}} 5 million at the time. Shastri later thanked the Nizam at a public meeting, stating that the government planned to send these gold coins to foreign countries, expecting to obtain {{INR}} 10 million in return.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear who received the return on this investment. In 2018, the Nizam's grandson [[Mir Najaf Ali Khan]] stated that according to his knowledge, none of the 52 trusts created by the Nizam had received any money from this investment.

The Nizam refused to join either India or Pakistan, preferring to form a separate independent kingdom within the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nThis proposal for independence was rejected by the British government, but the Nizam continued to explore it. Towards this end, he kept up open negotiations with the Government of India regarding the modalities of a future relationship while opening covert negotiations with Pakistan in a similar vein.
