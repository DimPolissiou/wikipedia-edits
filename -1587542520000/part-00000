to him being the only one on the island who smiles.<ref>https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/watch-harry-styles-adore-you-music-video.html</ref> In the video, Styles finds a fish who is washed up on shore, and cares for it as it grows, much to the judgement of fellow Eroda citizens. At the end of the video, the fish bursts out of its tank, and residents help Styles return the fish back to the water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/harry-styles-adore-you-video-921040/|title=Harry Styles Finds Common Ground With a Fish out of Water in 'Adore You' Video|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|last2=Shaffer|first2=Claire|date=2019-12-06|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> The main scenes of the video featuring Harry Styles were filmed in the Scottish fishing village of [[St Abbs]].

[[Theia (planet)|Theia]], an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of these ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single spherical body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.\n\nThe hypothesis requires a collision between a proto-Earth about 90% of the size{{clarify|reason=diameter or mass?|date=June 2019}} of present Earth, and another body the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial diameter and a tenth of its mass). The latter has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the name of the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient [[angular momentum]] to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.\n\n[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tonnes of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the temperature would have risen to {{cvt|10000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n\nThe Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core (compared to other [[rocky planet]]s and moons in the Solar System) is explained by Theia's core mostly merging into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccretion of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]].\n\nThe newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small preexisting satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth\u2013Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.<ref>{{cite web |author = J.

In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.<ref name=wiechert/> Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar System bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected.

Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.) This led to the Moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites, and thus also Earth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n\n\n{{multiple image|align=center\n|title=<center>Moon \u2013 [[Oceanus Procellarum]] (\"Ocean of Storms\")</center> |total_width=600 |width1=614 |height1=228 |image1=14-236-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg|caption1=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 rectangular structure (visible \u2013 topography \u2013 [[Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory|GRAIL gravity gradients]]) (October 1, 2014).|width2=1500  |height2=1500 |image2=PIA18822-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg|caption2=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 context.|width3=1546 |height3=905 |image3=PIA18821-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Closeup-20141001.jpg|caption3=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 closeup (artist's concept).}}\n\n==Other hypotheses==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:88%; float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n|- bgcolor= style=\"font-size: smaller;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Density'''<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/moonhab.html#c2 The Formation of the Moon]</ref>\n|-\n!

[[Theia (planet)|Theia]], an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of these ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single spherical body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.\n\nThe hypothesis requires a collision between a proto-Earth about 90% of the size{{clarify|reason=diameter or mass?|date=June 2019}} of present Earth, and another body the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial diameter and a tenth of its mass). The latter has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the name of the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient [[angular momentum]] to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.\n\n[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tonnes of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the temperature would have risen to {{cvt|10000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n\nThe Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core (compared to other [[rocky planet]]s and moons in the Solar System) is explained by Theia's core mostly merging into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccretion of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]].\n\nThe newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small preexisting satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth\u2013Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.<ref>{{cite web |author = J.

In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.<ref name=wiechert/> Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar System bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected.

Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.)
