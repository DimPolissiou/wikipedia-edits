Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the [[sentimental novel|novels of sensibility]] of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.<ref>Grundy (2014), 195\u2013197</ref>{{efn|Oliver MacDonagh says that ''Sense and Sensibility'' \"may well be the first English realistic novel\" based on its detailed and accurate portrayal of what he calls \"getting and spending\" in an English gentry family.<ref name=\"MacDonagh 1991, 65, 136\u2013137\">MacDonagh (1991), 65, 136\u2013137.</ref>}} Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=2|isbn=978-1-4214-2282-4}}</ref>\n\nWith the publications of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811),  ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled ''[[Sanditon]]'', but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, a short [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Lady Susan]]'', and another unfinished novel, ''[[The Watsons]]''. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\n\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4214-2282-4}}</ref> They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.\n\nAusten has inspired many critical essays and literary anthologies. Her novels have inspired many films, from 1940's ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' to more recent productions like ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995), ''[[Emma (1996 theatrical film)|Emma]]'' (1996), ''[[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|Mansfield Park]]'' (1999), ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' (2005), ''[[Love & Friendship]]'' (2016), and [[Emma (2020 film)|''Emma''.]]{{refn|name=Period|group=lower-alpha|The title of the film has a [[full stop|period]] attached to signify it being a [[period piece]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/film/2020-02-14/emma-title-full-stop-period/|title=Emma. director Autumn de Wilde explains the film\u2019s unusual punctuation|website=Radio Times}}</ref>}} (2020).\n\n==Biographical sources==\n[[File:Letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra, 1799 June 11.

Ostensibly, Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 270; Nokes (1998), 1; Le Faye (2005), 33</ref>{{efn| Important details about the Austen family were almost certainly elided by intention, such as mention of Austen's brother George, whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to send him away from home; the two brothers sent away to the navy at an early age; or mention of the sisters' wealthy Aunt Leigh-Perrot, arrested and tried on charges of larceny.<ref name=\"Nokes 1998 1 2 Fergus 2005 3 4\">Nokes (1998), 1\u20132; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134</ref>}} Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed. The paucity of record of Austen's life leaves modern biographers little with which to work.<ref name=\"Nokes 1998 1 2 Fergus 2005 3 4\"/>\n\nThe situation was compounded as successive generations of the family expunged and sanitised the already opaque details of Austen's biography. The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral [[Francis Austen]], destroyed more letters; details were excised from the \"Biographical Notice\" her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be omitted or embellished in her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography ''Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters'', published in 1913.<ref>Nokes (1998), 2\u20134; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134; Le Faye (2004), 279</ref> The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying a woman whose domestic situation was happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life.<ref name=Fergus(2005)3ff/> Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that the challenge is to avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family\".<ref>Fergus (2005), 4</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Life==\n{{further|Timeline of Jane Austen}}\n\n===Family===\n[[File:Chawton Church, Steventon, Hampshire.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|[[Steventon, Hampshire|Steventon]] Church, as depicted in ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]''<ref name=\"Le Faye 2004 20\">Le Faye (2004), 20</ref>]]\n\nJane Austen was born in [[Steventon, Hampshire]], on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago\". He added that her arrival was particularly welcome as \"a future companion to her sister\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 27; Nokes (1998), 51</ref> The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 27</ref>\n\nFor much of Jane's life, her father, [[George Austen (clergyman)|George Austen]] (1731\u20131805), served as the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the [[Church of England|Anglican]] parishes at Steventon and at nearby [[Deane, Hampshire|Deane]].<ref>Todd (2015), 2</ref>{{efn|Irene Collins estimates that when George Austen took up his duties as rector in 1764, Steventon comprised no more than about thirty families.<ref>Collins (1994), 86</ref>}} He came from an old, respected, and wealthy family of wool merchants. Over the centuries as each generation of [[primogeniture|eldest sons]] received inheritances, their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find a husband and George entered [[St John's College, Oxford]] on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739\u20131827).<ref>Le Faye (2004), 3\u20135, 11</ref> She came from the prominent [[Baron Leigh|Leigh]] family; her father was rector at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he [[Name change#Historical usage|change his name]] to Leigh-Perrot.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 8; Nokes (1998), 51</ref>\n\nGeorge and Cassandra exchanged miniatures in 1763 and probably were engaged around that time.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11</ref> George received the [[Benefice|living]] for the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight, who owned Steventon and its associated farms, one of which the Austen family rented to live in.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 6</ref> Two months after Cassandra's father died, they married on 26 April 1764 at [[Church of St Swithin, Bath|St Swithin's Church]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], by licence, in a simple ceremony. They left for Hampshire the same day.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11; Nokes (1998), 24, 26</ref>\n\nTheir income was modest, with George's small ''per annum'' living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 12; Nokes (1998), 24</ref> The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th-century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and [[Edward Austen Knight|Edward]] in 1767.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11, 18, 19; Nokes (1998), 36</ref> Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then place it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to [[Wet nurse|nurse]] and raise for twelve to eighteen months.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 19</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Steventon===\n[[File:SteventonRectory.jpg|thumb|[[Steventon, Hampshire|Steventon]] rectory, as depicted in ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', was in a valley and surrounded by meadows.<ref name=\"Le Faye 2004 20\"/>]]\n\nIn 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. [[Henry Thomas Austen|Henry]] was the first child to be born there, in 1771.<ref>Nokes (1998), 37; Le Faye (2004), 25</ref> At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore the signs that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and mute, and she chose to send him out to be fostered.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 22</ref> In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by [[Francis Austen|Francis]] in 1774, and Jane in 1775.<!-- don't forget Charles?? source? --><ref>Nokes (1998), 37; Le Faye (2004), 24\u201327</ref>\n\nAccording to Honan, the atmosphere of the Austen home was an \"open, amused, easy intellectual\" one, where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed.<ref>Honan (1987), 211\u2013212</ref> The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members.<ref name = \"Todd4\">Todd (2015), 4</ref> Cassandra Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter [[Eliza de Feuillide|Eliza]], accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly.<ref>Nokes (1998), 39; Le Faye (2004), 22\u201323</ref>{{efn|Philadelphia had returned from India in 1765 and taken up residence in London; when her husband returned to India to replenish their income, she stayed in England.  He died in India in 1775, with Philadelphia unaware until the news reached her a year later, fortuitously as George and Cassandra were visiting. See Le Faye, 29\u201336}} Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 29</ref>\n\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and 1780s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents on her return,  \"...&nbsp;and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 46</ref> Le Faye writes that \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family, there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 26</ref>\n\nFrom 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.<ref>Honan (1987), 14, 17\u201318; Collins (1994), 54.</ref> The Reverend Austen had an annual income of \u00a3200 from his two livings.<ref name=\"Irvine 2005 p.2\">Irvine (2005) p.2</ref> This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about \u00a3100 annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between \u00a31,000 and \u00a35,000.<ref name=\"Irvine 2005 p.2\"/>\n\nDuring this period of her life, Austen attended church regularly, socialised with friends and neighbours,{{efn|For social conventions among the gentry generally, see Collins (1994), 105}} and read novels\u2014often of her own composition\u2014aloud with her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the [[assembly rooms]] in the town hall.<ref>Tomalin (1997), 101\u2013103, 120\u2013123, 144; Honan (1987), 119.</ref> Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".<ref>Quoted in Tomalin (1997), 102; see also Honan (1987), 84</ref>\n\n===Education===\n[[File:CassandraAustenSilhouette.png|thumb|Silhouette of [[Cassandra Austen]], Jane's sister and closest friend]]\n\nIn 1783, Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to [[Oxford]] to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to [[Southampton]] when she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught [[typhus]] and Austen nearly died.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 47\u201349; Collins (1994), 35, 133.</ref> Austen was from then home educated, until she attended boarding school in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] with her sister from early in 1785 at the [[Reading Abbey Girls' School]], ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre.<ref>Todd (2015), 3</ref> The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family.<ref>Tomalin (1997), 9\u201310, 26, 33\u201338, 42\u201343; Le Faye (2004), 52; Collins (1994), 133\u2013134</ref> After 1786, Austen \"never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 52</ref>\n\nThe remainder of her education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry.<ref>Grundy (2014), 192\u2013193; Tomalin (1997), 28\u201329, 33\u201343, 66\u201367; Honan (1987), 31\u201334; Lascelles (1966), 7\u20138</ref> Irene Collins believes that Austen \"used some of the same school books as the boys\" her father tutored.<ref>Collins (1994), 42</ref> Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father's library and that of a family friend, [[Warren Hastings]]. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library.

He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a [[barrister]]. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"<ref>Quoted in Le Faye (2004), 92.</ref>\n\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was a \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\".<ref name = \"halperin721\">Halperin (1985), 721</ref> Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote that she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others.<ref name = \"halperin721\"/> The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over.

However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him.<ref name = \"halperin721\"/> The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xviii; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 112\u2013120, 159; Honan (1987), 105\u2013111.</ref> In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.<ref name = \"halperin722\">Halperin (1985), 722</ref>\n\n===Early manuscripts (1796\u20131798)===\nAfter finishing ''Lady Susan'', Austen began her first full-length novel ''Elinor and Marianne''. Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters.

As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive\u2014he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xxi; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 178\u2013181; Honan (1987), 189\u2013198.</ref> No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal.<ref>Le Faye (2005), 51.</ref> Irvine described Bigg-Wither as a somebody who \"...seems to have been a man very hard to like, let alone love\".<ref>Irvine (2005), 3</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him.

They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and [[Godmersham Park|Godmersham]]. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of [[Worthing]], on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage.{{efn|Austen's observations of early Worthing probably helped inspire her final, but unfinished novel, ''[[Sanditon]]'', the story of an up-and-coming seaside resort in Sussex.}} It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of ''Lady Susan'' and added its \"Conclusion\".

Through her brother Henry, the publisher [[Thomas Egerton (publisher)|Thomas Egerton]] agreed to publish ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', which, like all of Jane Austen's novels except ''Pride and Prejudice'', was published \"on commission\", that is, at the author's financial risk. When publishing on commission, publishers would advance the costs of publication, repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10% commission for each book sold, paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales, the author was responsible for them.<ref>Fergus (2014), 6; Raven (2005), 198; Honan (1987), 285\u2013286.</ref> The alternative to selling via commission was the selling the copyright, where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript, which occurred with ''Pride and Prejudice''.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\">Irvine, 2005 13.</ref> Austen's experience with ''Susan'' (the manuscript that became ''Northanger Abbey'') where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby & Sons for \u00a310, who did not publish the book, forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published, left Austen leery of this method of publishing.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> The final alternative, of selling by subscription, where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance, was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends, could sell by subscription.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\"/>  ''Sense and Sensibility'' appeared in October 1811, and was described as being written \"By a Lady\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> As it was sold on commission, Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/>\n\n[[File:SenseAndSensibilityTitlePage.jpg|left|upright=.85|thumb|First edition title page from ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', Austen's first published novel (1811)]]\nReviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers;<ref name=\"Honan 1987, 289\u2013290\">Honan (1987), 289\u2013290.</ref> the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production (particularly the cost of handmade paper) meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or less to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist. Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued. Austen's novels were published in larger editions, ranging from about 750 copies of ''Sense and Sensibility'' to about 2,000 copies of ''Emma''. It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Austen's novels was driven by the publishers or the author. Since all but one of Austen's books were originally published \"on commission\", the risks of overproduction were largely hers (or Cassandra's after her death) and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk. Editions of popular works of non-fiction were often much larger.<ref>For more information and a discussion of the economics of book publishing during this period, see Fergus (2014), 6\u20137, and Raven (2005), 196\u2013203.</ref>\n\nAusten made \u00a3140 from ''Sense and Sensibility'',<ref>Irvine (2005) p.15</ref> which provided her with some financial and psychological independence.<ref>Honan (1987), 290, Tomalin (1997), 218.</ref> After the success of ''Sense and Sensibility'', all of Austen's subsequent books were billed as written \"By the author of ''Sense and Sensibility''\" and Austen's name never appeared on her books during her lifetime.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> Egerton then published ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', a revision of ''First Impressions'', in January 1813.

Yet in ''Northanger Abbey'' she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale.

The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University.<ref>Devoney Looser, The Making of Jane Austen (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), 185\u2013196.</ref> The first examination came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar [[A. C. Bradley]].<ref>Trott (2005), 92.</ref> In his essay, Bradley groups Austen's novels into \"early\" and \"late\" works, a distinction still used by scholars today.<ref>Southam (1987), 79.</ref> The first academic books devoted to Austen in France was ''Jane Austen'' by Paul and Kate Rague published in 1914, where the Ragues set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The same year, L\u00e9onie Villard published ''Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres'', which was originally her PhD thesis, marking the first time that Austen was the subject of serious academic study in France.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The second examination in English was R.W. Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works. Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.<ref>Southam (1987), 99\u2013100; see also Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Gilson (2005), 149\u201350; Johnson (2014), 239.</ref>\n\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles' ''Jane Austen and Her Art'', the academic study of Austen took hold.<ref>Southam (1987), 107\u2013109, 124.</ref> Lascelles's work included an analysis of the books Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work as well as an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric, a debate that has continued since.<ref>Southam (1986), 108; Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Stovel (2014), 248; Southam (1987), 127</ref>\n\nThe period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including [[feminist theory]], and perhaps most controversially, [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]]. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern [[Janeite]]s, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably.<ref>Rajan (2005), 101\u2013110</ref> After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too \"frivolous\" for this purpose.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 210.</ref> As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in China between 1966\u201369, when Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\" author.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 212.</ref> In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 213.</ref> A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\" [the Tories were the conservative party while the Whigs were the liberal party], a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative.<ref name=\"Koppel\">{{cite web\n| last =  Koppel\n| first = Gene\n| title = Pride and Prejudice: Conservative or Liberal Novel\u2014Or Both?

From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations.<ref>Lynch (2005), 160\u2013162.</ref> The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's ''Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance'', and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, ''The Bennets'' (1901).<ref>Devoney Looser, The Making of Jane Austen (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), 85.</ref> The first film adaptation was the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 MGM production of ''Pride and Prejudice'']] starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Greer Garson]].<ref>Brownstein (2001), 13.</ref> BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings.<ref>Troost (2007), 79.</ref> The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of ''Pride and Prejudice'' and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nFrom 1995 many Austen adaptations appeared, with [[Ang Lee]]'s [[Sense and Sensibility (film)|film of ''Sense and Sensibility'']], for which screenwriter and star [[Emma Thompson]] won an [[Academy Award]], and the BBC's immensely popular TV mini-series ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'', starring [[Jennifer Ehle]] and [[Colin Firth]].<ref>Troost (2007), 82\u201384.</ref> A 2005 British production of [[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|''Pride and Prejudice'']], directed by [[Joe Wright]] and starring [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Matthew Macfadyen]],<ref>Carol Kopp, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/15/oscar/main1321171.shtml \"The Nominees: Keira Knightley\"], CBS News, 20 October 2008.</ref> was followed in 2007 by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park (2007 film)|Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Northanger Abbey (2007 film)|Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (2007 film)|Persuasion]]'',<ref>Julia Day, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.ITV \"ITV falls in love with Jane Austen\"], ''The Guardian'', 10 November 2005.</ref> and in 2016 by ''[[Love & Friendship]]'', a film version of ''Lady Susan'' that borrowed the title of Austen's ''[[Love and {{Not a typo|Freindship}}]]'' [sic].<ref>Alonso Duralde, Alonso, [http://www.thewrap.com/love-friendship-review-whit-stillman-kate-beckinsale-chloe-sevigny-jane-austen/ \"'Love & Friendship' Sundance Review: Whit Stillman Does Jane Austen\u2014But Hasn't He Always?\"], ''The Wrap'', 25 January 2016.</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\nAusten is on the [[Bank of England \u00a310 note|\u00a310 note]] which was introduced in 2017, replacing [[Charles Darwin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-14/jane-austen-is-now-on-the-10-pound-note/8947154|title=Jane Austen is now on Britain's 10 pound note|date=14 September 2017|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/18/jane-austen-banknote-unveiled-with-strange-choice-of-quotation|title=Jane Austen banknote unveiled \u2013 with strange choice of quotation|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=18 July 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/new-10-note-spot-worth-thousands/|title=New \u00a310 note: how to spot if yours is worth thousands|last=Suter|first=Laura|date=13 September 2017|work=The Telegraph|access-date=4 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n==List of works==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n'''Novels'''\n* ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811)\n* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813)\n* ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814)\n* ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815)\n* ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1818, posthumous)\n* ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1818, posthumous)\n* ''[[Lady Susan]]'' (1871, posthumous)\n\n'''Unfinished fiction'''\n* ''[[The Watsons]]'' (1804)\n* ''[[Sanditon]]'' (1817)\n\n'''Other works'''\n* ''Sir Charles Grandison'' ([[The History of Sir Charles Grandison|adapted]] play) (1793, 1800){{efn|The full title of this short play is ''Sir Charles Grandison or The happy Man, a Comedy in 6 acts''.

Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the [[sentimental novel|novels of sensibility]] of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.<ref>Grundy (2014), 195\u2013197</ref>{{efn|Oliver MacDonagh says that ''Sense and Sensibility'' \"may well be the first English realistic novel\" based on its detailed and accurate portrayal of what he calls \"getting and spending\" in an English gentry family.<ref name=\"MacDonagh 1991, 65, 136\u2013137\">MacDonagh (1991), 65, 136\u2013137.</ref>}} Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=2|isbn=978-1-4214-2282-4}}</ref>\n\nWith the publications of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811),  ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled ''[[Sanditon]]'', but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, a short [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Lady Susan]]'', and another unfinished novel, ''[[The Watsons]]''. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\n\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4214-2282-4}}</ref> They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership.

Her novels have inspired many films, from 1940's ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' to more recent productions like ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995), ''[[Emma (1996 theatrical film)|Emma]]'' (1996), ''[[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|Mansfield Park]]'' (1999), ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' (2005), ''[[Love & Friendship]]'' (2016), and [[Emma (2020 film)|''Emma''.]]{{refn|name=Period|group=lower-alpha|The title of the film has a [[full stop|period]] attached to signify it being a [[period piece]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/film/2020-02-14/emma-title-full-stop-period/|title=Emma. director Autumn de Wilde explains the film\u2019s unusual punctuation|website=Radio Times}}</ref>}} (2020).\n\n==Biographical sources==\n[[File:Letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra, 1799 June 11.

Ostensibly, Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 270; Nokes (1998), 1; Le Faye (2005), 33</ref>{{efn| Important details about the Austen family were almost certainly elided by intention, such as mention of Austen's brother George, whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to send him away from home; the two brothers sent away to the navy at an early age; or mention of the sisters' wealthy Aunt Leigh-Perrot, arrested and tried on charges of larceny.<ref name=\"Nokes 1998 1 2 Fergus 2005 3 4\">Nokes (1998), 1\u20132; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134</ref>}} Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed. The paucity of record of Austen's life leaves modern biographers little with which to work.<ref name=\"Nokes 1998 1 2 Fergus 2005 3 4\"/>\n\nThe situation was compounded as successive generations of the family expunged and sanitised the already opaque details of Austen's biography. The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral [[Francis Austen]], destroyed more letters; details were excised from the \"Biographical Notice\" her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be omitted or embellished in her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography ''Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters'', published in 1913.<ref>Nokes (1998), 2\u20134; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134; Le Faye (2004), 279</ref> The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying a woman whose domestic situation was happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life.<ref name=Fergus(2005)3ff/> Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that the challenge is to avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family\".<ref>Fergus (2005), 4</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Life==\n{{further|Timeline of Jane Austen}}\n\n===Family===\n[[File:Chawton Church, Steventon, Hampshire.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|[[Steventon, Hampshire|Steventon]] Church, as depicted in ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]''<ref name=\"Le Faye 2004 20\">Le Faye (2004), 20</ref>]]\n\nJane Austen was born in [[Steventon, Hampshire]], on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago\". He added that her arrival was particularly welcome as \"a future companion to her sister\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 27; Nokes (1998), 51</ref> The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 27</ref>\n\nFor much of Jane's life, her father, [[George Austen (clergyman)|George Austen]] (1731\u20131805), served as the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the [[Church of England|Anglican]] parishes at Steventon and at nearby [[Deane, Hampshire|Deane]].<ref>Todd (2015), 2</ref>{{efn|Irene Collins estimates that when George Austen took up his duties as rector in 1764, Steventon comprised no more than about thirty families.<ref>Collins (1994), 86</ref>}} He came from an old, respected, and wealthy family of wool merchants. Over the centuries as each generation of [[primogeniture|eldest sons]] received inheritances, their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find a husband and George entered [[St John's College, Oxford]] on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739\u20131827).<ref>Le Faye (2004), 3\u20135, 11</ref> She came from the prominent [[Baron Leigh|Leigh]] family; her father was rector at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he [[Name change#Historical usage|change his name]] to Leigh-Perrot.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 8; Nokes (1998), 51</ref>\n\nGeorge and Cassandra exchanged miniatures in 1763 and probably were engaged around that time.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11</ref> George received the [[Benefice|living]] for the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight, who owned Steventon and its associated farms, one of which the Austen family rented to live in.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 6</ref> Two months after Cassandra's father died, they married on 26 April 1764 at [[Church of St Swithin, Bath|St Swithin's Church]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], by licence, in a simple ceremony. They left for Hampshire the same day.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11; Nokes (1998), 24, 26</ref>\n\nTheir income was modest, with George's small ''per annum'' living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 12; Nokes (1998), 24</ref> The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th-century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and [[Edward Austen Knight|Edward]] in 1767.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11, 18, 19; Nokes (1998), 36</ref> Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then place it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to [[Wet nurse|nurse]] and raise for twelve to eighteen months.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 19</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Steventon===\n[[File:SteventonRectory.jpg|thumb|[[Steventon, Hampshire|Steventon]] rectory, as depicted in ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', was in a valley and surrounded by meadows.<ref name=\"Le Faye 2004 20\"/>]]\n\nIn 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. [[Henry Thomas Austen|Henry]] was the first child to be born there, in 1771.<ref>Nokes (1998), 37; Le Faye (2004), 25</ref> At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore the signs that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and mute, and she chose to send him out to be fostered.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 22</ref> In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by [[Francis Austen|Francis]] in 1774, and Jane in 1775.<!-- don't forget Charles?? source? --><ref>Nokes (1998), 37; Le Faye (2004), 24\u201327</ref>\n\nAccording to Honan, the atmosphere of the Austen home was an \"open, amused, easy intellectual\" one, where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed.<ref>Honan (1987), 211\u2013212</ref> The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members.<ref name = \"Todd4\">Todd (2015), 4</ref> Cassandra Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter [[Eliza de Feuillide|Eliza]], accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly.<ref>Nokes (1998), 39; Le Faye (2004), 22\u201323</ref>{{efn|Philadelphia had returned from India in 1765 and taken up residence in London; when her husband returned to India to replenish their income, she stayed in England.  He died in India in 1775, with Philadelphia unaware until the news reached her a year later, fortuitously as George and Cassandra were visiting. See Le Faye, 29\u201336}} Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 29</ref>\n\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and 1780s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents on her return,  \"...&nbsp;and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 46</ref> Le Faye writes that \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family, there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 26</ref>\n\nFrom 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.<ref>Honan (1987), 14, 17\u201318; Collins (1994), 54.</ref> The Reverend Austen had an annual income of \u00a3200 from his two livings.<ref name=\"Irvine 2005 p.2\">Irvine (2005) p.2</ref> This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about \u00a3100 annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between \u00a31,000 and \u00a35,000.<ref name=\"Irvine 2005 p.2\"/>\n\nDuring this period of her life, Austen attended church regularly, socialised with friends and neighbours,{{efn|For social conventions among the gentry generally, see Collins (1994), 105}} and read novels\u2014often of her own composition\u2014aloud with her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the [[assembly rooms]] in the town hall.<ref>Tomalin (1997), 101\u2013103, 120\u2013123, 144; Honan (1987), 119.</ref> Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".<ref>Quoted in Tomalin (1997), 102; see also Honan (1987), 84</ref>\n\n===Education===\n[[File:CassandraAustenSilhouette.png|thumb|Silhouette of [[Cassandra Austen]], Jane's sister and closest friend]]\n\nIn 1783, Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to [[Oxford]] to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to [[Southampton]] when she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught [[typhus]] and Austen nearly died.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 47\u201349; Collins (1994), 35, 133.</ref> Austen was from then home educated, until she attended boarding school in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] with her sister from early in 1785 at the [[Reading Abbey Girls' School]], ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre.<ref>Todd (2015), 3</ref> The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family.<ref>Tomalin (1997), 9\u201310, 26, 33\u201338, 42\u201343; Le Faye (2004), 52; Collins (1994), 133\u2013134</ref> After 1786, Austen \"never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 52</ref>\n\nThe remainder of her education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry.<ref>Grundy (2014), 192\u2013193; Tomalin (1997), 28\u201329, 33\u201343, 66\u201367; Honan (1987), 31\u201334; Lascelles (1966), 7\u20138</ref> Irene Collins believes that Austen \"used some of the same school books as the boys\" her father tutored.<ref>Collins (1994), 42</ref> Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father's library and that of a family friend, [[Warren Hastings]]. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library.  Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqu\u00e9 experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.<ref>Honan (1987), 66\u201368; Collins (1994), 43</ref>\n\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1775) and [[David Garrick]]'s ''[[Bon Ton (play)|Bon Ton]]''.

He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a [[barrister]]. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"<ref>Quoted in Le Faye (2004), 92.</ref>\n\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was a \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\".<ref name = \"halperin721\">Halperin (1985), 721</ref> Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote that she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others.<ref name = \"halperin721\"/> The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over.

However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him.<ref name = \"halperin721\"/> The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xviii; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 112\u2013120, 159; Honan (1987), 105\u2013111.</ref> In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.<ref name = \"halperin722\">Halperin (1985), 722</ref>\n\n===Early manuscripts (1796\u20131798)===\nAfter finishing ''Lady Susan'', Austen began her first full-length novel ''Elinor and Marianne''. Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters.

As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive\u2014he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xxi; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 178\u2013181; Honan (1987), 189\u2013198.</ref> No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal.<ref>Le Faye (2005), 51.</ref> Irvine described Bigg-Wither as a somebody who \"...seems to have been a man very hard to like, let alone love\".<ref>Irvine (2005), 3</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him.

They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and [[Godmersham Park|Godmersham]]. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of [[Worthing]], on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage.{{efn|Austen's observations of early Worthing probably helped inspire her final, but unfinished novel, ''[[Sanditon]]'', the story of an up-and-coming seaside resort in Sussex.}} It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of ''Lady Susan'' and added its \"Conclusion\".

Through her brother Henry, the publisher [[Thomas Egerton (publisher)|Thomas Egerton]] agreed to publish ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', which, like all of Jane Austen's novels except ''Pride and Prejudice'', was published \"on commission\", that is, at the author's financial risk. When publishing on commission, publishers would advance the costs of publication, repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10% commission for each book sold, paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales, the author was responsible for them.<ref>Fergus (2014), 6; Raven (2005), 198; Honan (1987), 285\u2013286.</ref> The alternative to selling via commission was the selling the copyright, where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript, which occurred with ''Pride and Prejudice''.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\">Irvine, 2005 13.</ref> Austen's experience with ''Susan'' (the manuscript that became ''Northanger Abbey'') where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby & Sons for \u00a310, who did not publish the book, forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published, left Austen leery of this method of publishing.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> The final alternative, of selling by subscription, where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance, was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends, could sell by subscription.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\"/>  ''Sense and Sensibility'' appeared in October 1811, and was described as being written \"By a Lady\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> As it was sold on commission, Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/>\n\n[[File:SenseAndSensibilityTitlePage.jpg|left|upright=.85|thumb|First edition title page from ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', Austen's first published novel (1811)]]\nReviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers;<ref name=\"Honan 1987, 289\u2013290\">Honan (1987), 289\u2013290.</ref> the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production (particularly the cost of handmade paper) meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or less to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist. Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued. Austen's novels were published in larger editions, ranging from about 750 copies of ''Sense and Sensibility'' to about 2,000 copies of ''Emma''. It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Austen's novels was driven by the publishers or the author. Since all but one of Austen's books were originally published \"on commission\", the risks of overproduction were largely hers (or Cassandra's after her death) and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk.

Yet in ''Northanger Abbey'' she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale.

The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University.<ref>Devoney Looser, The Making of Jane Austen (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), 185\u2013196.</ref> The first examination came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar [[A. C. Bradley]].<ref>Trott (2005), 92.</ref> In his essay, Bradley groups Austen's novels into \"early\" and \"late\" works, a distinction still used by scholars today.<ref>Southam (1987), 79.</ref> The first academic books devoted to Austen in France was ''Jane Austen'' by Paul and Kate Rague published in 1914, where the Ragues set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The same year, L\u00e9onie Villard published ''Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres'', which was originally her PhD thesis, marking the first time that Austen was the subject of serious academic study in France.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The second examination in English was R.W. Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works. Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.<ref>Southam (1987), 99\u2013100; see also Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Gilson (2005), 149\u201350; Johnson (2014), 239.</ref>\n\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles' ''Jane Austen and Her Art'', the academic study of Austen took hold.<ref>Southam (1987), 107\u2013109, 124.</ref> Lascelles's work included an analysis of the books Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work as well as an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric, a debate that has continued since.<ref>Southam (1986), 108; Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Stovel (2014), 248; Southam (1987), 127</ref>\n\nThe period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including [[feminist theory]], and perhaps most controversially, [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]]. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern [[Janeite]]s, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably.<ref>Rajan (2005), 101\u2013110</ref> After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too \"frivolous\" for this purpose.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 210.</ref> As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in China between 1966\u201369, when Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\" author.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 212.</ref> In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 213.</ref> A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\" [the Tories were the conservative party while the Whigs were the liberal party], a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative.<ref name=\"Koppel\">{{cite web\n| last =  Koppel\n| first = Gene\n| title = Pride and Prejudice: Conservative or Liberal Novel\u2014Or Both?

From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations.<ref>Lynch (2005), 160\u2013162.</ref> The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's ''Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance'', and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, ''The Bennets'' (1901).<ref>Devoney Looser, The Making of Jane Austen (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), 85.</ref> The first film adaptation was the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 MGM production of ''Pride and Prejudice'']] starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Greer Garson]].<ref>Brownstein (2001), 13.</ref> BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings.<ref>Troost (2007), 79.</ref> The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of ''Pride and Prejudice'' and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nFrom 1995 many Austen adaptations appeared, with [[Ang Lee]]'s [[Sense and Sensibility (film)|film of ''Sense and Sensibility'']], for which screenwriter and star [[Emma Thompson]] won an [[Academy Award]], and the BBC's immensely popular TV mini-series ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'', starring [[Jennifer Ehle]] and [[Colin Firth]].<ref>Troost (2007), 82\u201384.</ref> A 2005 British production of [[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|''Pride and Prejudice'']], directed by [[Joe Wright]] and starring [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Matthew Macfadyen]],<ref>Carol Kopp, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/15/oscar/main1321171.shtml \"The Nominees: Keira Knightley\"], CBS News, 20 October 2008.</ref> was followed in 2007 by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park (2007 film)|Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Northanger Abbey (2007 film)|Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (2007 film)|Persuasion]]'',<ref>Julia Day, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.ITV \"ITV falls in love with Jane Austen\"], ''The Guardian'', 10 November 2005.</ref> and in 2016 by ''[[Love & Friendship]]'', a film version of ''Lady Susan'' that borrowed the title of Austen's ''[[Love and {{Not a typo|Freindship}}]]'' [sic].<ref>Alonso Duralde, Alonso, [http://www.thewrap.com/love-friendship-review-whit-stillman-kate-beckinsale-chloe-sevigny-jane-austen/ \"'Love & Friendship' Sundance Review: Whit Stillman Does Jane Austen\u2014But Hasn't He Always?\"], ''The Wrap'', 25 January 2016.</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\nAusten is on the [[Bank of England \u00a310 note|\u00a310 note]] which was introduced in 2017, replacing [[Charles Darwin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-14/jane-austen-is-now-on-the-10-pound-note/8947154|title=Jane Austen is now on Britain's 10 pound note|date=14 September 2017|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/18/jane-austen-banknote-unveiled-with-strange-choice-of-quotation|title=Jane Austen banknote unveiled \u2013 with strange choice of quotation|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=18 July 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/new-10-note-spot-worth-thousands/|title=New \u00a310 note: how to spot if yours is worth thousands|last=Suter|first=Laura|date=13 September 2017|work=The Telegraph|access-date=4 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n==List of works==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n'''Novels'''\n* ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811)\n* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813)\n* ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814)\n* ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815)\n* ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1818, posthumous)\n* ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1818, posthumous)\n* ''[[Lady Susan]]'' (1871, posthumous)\n\n'''Unfinished fiction'''\n* ''[[The Watsons]]'' (1804)\n* ''[[Sanditon]]'' (1817)\n\n'''Other works'''\n* ''Sir Charles Grandison'' ([[The History of Sir Charles Grandison|adapted]] play) (1793, 1800){{efn|The full title of this short play is ''Sir Charles Grandison or The happy Man, a Comedy in 6 acts''.

In the average high school class system (eight classes per day), students spend a whole year enrolled in their core classes with semester-long electives.  Waukee's block-scheduling keeps students in their core classes for a semester with quarter-long electives.  Research has shown that this system creates better attendance rates and more Honor Roll students than traditional class scheduling.<ref>http://coe.winthrop.edu/vawterd/block/research/research.html</ref>\n\nThe school has traditionally boasted good grades and test scores.  In 2012, the school tested at a 92% proficiency rate for math (state average 83%) and a 94% proficiency rate for reading (state average 84%).<ref>http://www.greatschools.org/iowa/waukee/1444-Waukee-Senior-High-School/#!/test-scores</ref> The school received the highest possible rating on greatschool.org.

The school spent several years at the 3A level and has since subsequently risen to 4A and now 5A (the largest class in the state of Iowa).  Waukee initially joined the CIML in the Iowa conference; however, since Ankeny has split into two high schools, the league is now moving to a four-conference format for the 2013-2014 seasons.<ref>ciml waukee history</ref>\n\nThe school's Athletic Director is Jim Duea.\n\nSince the school has risen to the highest level of competition so quickly, it has led to varying levels of success among all the sports.  This inconsistent trend has since solidified into a tradition of talented and hard-working athletes throughout all the sports.\n\n'''The 33 Athletic Achievement Award'''\nThis award is to honor athletes who have lettered in a varsity sport for at least three years in at least three sports.

Waukee's school district, however, is immense in comparison, encompassing the suburbs as far east as West Des Moines and as far west as the edge of Adel. Because the district extends into West Des Moines, the district has been able to take advantage of enormous residential growth surrounding the Jordan Creek Town Center.  This growth has led the district to open a new school each year for six years straight.\n\nWaukee High School has had to expand four times to accommodate the ever-growing student population.\n\nDue to projected growth, a new high school will open in the fall of 2021. This will be called Northwest High School.<ref name= 2ndhs.waukeeschools.org>https://2ndhs.waukeeschools.org/</ref>\n\nTo see the school's enrollment data, including projected growth, visit [https://www.waukee.k12.ia.us/students-and-parents/enrolling-your-student/enrollment-trends/ here].\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Jake Knott]] (born 1990), former Iowa State football player; Played with the Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins..\n*[[Anthony Nelson (American football)|Anthony Nelson]] former Iowa football player; Currently plays for the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added above External links/Sources by script-assisted edit-->\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.waukeeschools.org/school/waukee-high-school/ Waukee High School]\n{{Central Iowa Metro League |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Education in Dallas County, Iowa]]\n[[Category:Iowa High School Athletic Association]]\n[[Category:Public high schools in Iowa]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{third-party|date=July 2013}}\n{{primary sources|date=July 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox school\n| image = Waukee Highschool 2014-01-02 09-48.jpg\n| name = Waukee High School\n| type = [[Public high school]]\n| location = 555 SE University Avenue<br/>[[Waukee, Iowa|Waukee]], [[Iowa|IA]] 50263| information = 515-987-5163\n| enrollment = 1,941 (2017-18)<ref name=NCES>{{cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&DistrictID=1930510&ID=193051001744|title=Waukee Senior High School|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref>\n| faculty = 112<ref>https://www.waukee.k12.ia.us/school/waukee-high-school/staff/</ref>\n| ratio = 17.06<ref name=NCES/>\n| staff = 113.80 (FTE)<ref name=NCES/>\n| coordinates = {{Coord|41.600822|-93.8432808|type:landmark_region:US|display=title}}\n| pushpin_map = Iowa#USA\n| principal = Cary Justmann \n| superintendent = Brad Buck\n| nickname = [[Warrior]]s\n| colors = Purple and Gold {{Color box|purple|border=darkgray}} {{Color box|gold|border=darkgray}}\n| rival = [[Valley High School (West Des Moines, Iowa)|Valley High School]] [[Dowling Catholic]] [[Johnston High School]]\n| athletics_conference = [[Central Iowa Metro League]]\n| district = [[Waukee Community Schools]]\n| website = {{url|waukeeschools.org}}\n}}\n'''Waukee High School''' (also known as Waukee Senior High School) is a three-year [[public high school]] in [[Waukee, Iowa|Waukee]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]].

This number has grown exponentially over the years, as Waukee is the fastest growing school district in Iowa.<ref>https://www.waukee.k12.ia.us/school/waukee-high-school/</ref>\n\nDuring the 2010-2011 school year, 90% of enrolled students were white (state average was 81%).<ref>http://www.greatschools.org/iowa/waukee/1444-Waukee-Senior-High-School/?tab=demographics#header</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nWaukee High School uses a block-scheduling system which has students spending their day in just four classes per day for 90 minutes each.  In the average high school class system (eight classes per day), students spend a whole year enrolled in their core classes with semester-long electives.  Waukee's block-scheduling keeps students in their core classes for a semester with quarter-long electives.  Research has shown that this system creates better attendance rates and more Honor Roll students than traditional class scheduling.<ref>http://coe.winthrop.edu/vawterd/block/research/research.html</ref>\n\nThe school has traditionally boasted good grades and test scores.  In 2012, the school tested at a 92% proficiency rate for math (state average 83%) and a 94% proficiency rate for reading (state average 84%).<ref>http://www.greatschools.org/iowa/waukee/1444-Waukee-Senior-High-School/#!/test-scores</ref> The school received the highest possible rating on greatschool.org.  The class of 2011 held an ACT composite score average of 23.5 (state average was 22.3).<ref>https://www.waukee.k12.ia.us/school/waukee-high-school/academic-achievements/</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Athletics===\nSince the 2006-2007 school year, Waukee High School <ref>http://www.cimlcentral.org/g5-bin/client.cgi?G5genie=79&school_id=8</ref>) has been competing in the CIML (Central Iowa Metro League).<ref>http://www.cimlcentral.org/g5-bin/client.cgi?G5genie=79</ref> In 1997, Waukee was one of the smallest schools in the state, competing at 1A and 2A levels (1A to 5A in order of increasing school size). The school spent several years at the 3A level and has since subsequently risen to 4A and now 5A (the largest class in the state of Iowa).  Waukee initially joined the CIML in the Iowa conference; however, since Ankeny has split into two high schools, the league is now moving to a four-conference format for the 2013-2014 seasons.<ref>ciml waukee history</ref>\n\nThe school's Athletic Director is Jim Duea.\n\nSince the school has risen to the highest level of competition so quickly, it has led to varying levels of success among all the sports.  This inconsistent trend has since solidified into a tradition of talented and hard-working athletes throughout all the sports.\n\n'''The 33 Athletic Achievement Award'''\nThis award is to honor athletes who have lettered in a varsity sport for at least three years in at least three sports.  Waukee High School aims to not only recognize athletes with significant talent and skill, but those athletes who have committed themselves to multiple sports.\n\nAmy Nestingen (2012) Basketball, Volleyball, Track and Field\n\nJake Knott (2009) Football, Basketball, Baseball, Track and Field\n\n'''Waukee's Athletic Programs and Achievements:'''\n\nFall Sports\n\n'''Football:'''\n2005 3A State QF<ref>http://www.iahsaa.org/05_3A_2RDPLOFF.html</ref>\n2015 4A State Semifinalist\n'''Volleyball:'''\n\n'''Boys' Cross-Country:'''\n4A State Team Qualifier (2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2008, 2007, 2006)\n\n'''Girls' Cross-Country:'''\n4A State Team Qualifier (2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005)\n\n'''Boys' Golf:'''\nBoys' Golf first state championship was in Fall of 2010 at The Harvester Golf Club.

Under the direction of Matt Huth until 2015, Millennium experienced remarkable success. From 2012 to 2015, they received the award for Best Vocals at every competition in which they performed - a total of 16. Additionally, they were crowned Grand Champion at 13 of the 16 competitions (they were awarded First Runner-Up at the other three), going entirely undefeated in both 2013 and 2014.

Spirit, a highly competitive mixed JV ensemble, is choreographed by Nick Quamme and directed by Kathryn Mosiman.\n\n==Expansion/Growth==\nBy itself, the town of Waukee is not very large.  Waukee's school district, however, is immense in comparison, encompassing the suburbs as far east as West Des Moines and as far west as the edge of Adel. Because the district extends into West Des Moines, the district has been able to take advantage of enormous residential growth surrounding the Jordan Creek Town Center.  This growth has led the district to open a new school each year for six years straight.\n\nWaukee High School has had to expand four times to accommodate the ever-growing student population.\n\nDue to projected growth, a new high school will open in the fall of 2021. This will be called Northwest High School.<ref name= 2ndhs.waukeeschools.org>https://2ndhs.waukeeschools.org/</ref>\n\nTo see the school's enrollment data, including projected growth, visit [https://www.waukee.k12.ia.us/students-and-parents/enrolling-your-student/enrollment-trends/ here].\n\n==Notable Graduates==\n*[[Jake Knott]] (born 1990), former Iowa State football player; Played with the Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins.\n*[[Gabe Knudtson]], former Lehigh basketball player [http://sports illustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/gameflash/2012/03/16/77997_recap.html], beat 2nd seeded Duke in 2012 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament, now plays professionally in Belgium.\n*[[Anthony Nelson (American football)|Anthony Nelson]] former Iowa football player; Currently plays for the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added above External links/Sources by script-assisted edit-->\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.waukeeschools.org/school/waukee-high-school/ Waukee High School]\n{{Central Iowa Metro League |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Education in Dallas County, Iowa]]\n[[Category:Iowa High School Athletic Association]]\n[[Category:Public high schools in Iowa]]\n", "name_user": "Willsome429", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotable Graduates:cleanup", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waukee_High_School"}

Artificial hearts are typically used to bridge the time to [[heart transplantation]], or to permanently replace the heart in case heart transplantation is impossible. Although other similar inventions preceded it from the late 1940s, the first artificial heart to be successfully implanted in a human was the Jarvik-7 in 1982, designed by a team including [[Willem Johan Kolff]] and [[Robert Jarvik]].\n\nAn artificial heart is distinct from a [[ventricular assist device]] (VAD) designed to support a failing heart. It is also distinct from a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine, which is an external device used to provide the functions of both the heart and lungs, used only for a few hours at a time, most commonly during [[cardiac surgery]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:The SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart with pink heart background.jpg|thumb|The SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart]]\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--Origins, half of \"First clinical applications of a permanent pneumatic total artificial heart\", \"First clinical application of an intrathoracic pump\", and \"First clinical application of an paracorporeal pump\" sections have no citations-->\n\n===Origins===\nA synthetic replacement for the heart remains a long-sought \"holy grail\" of modern medicine. The obvious benefit of a functional artificial heart would be to lower the need for [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]]s, because the demand for organs always greatly exceeds supply.\n\nAlthough the heart is conceptually a pump, it embodies subtleties that defy straightforward emulation with synthetic materials and power supplies. Consequences of these issues include severe [[transplant rejection|foreign-body rejection]] and external batteries that limit mobility. These complications limited the lifespan of early human recipients to hours or days.\n\n===Early development===\nThe first artificial heart was made by the Soviet scientist [[Vladimir Demikhov]] in 1937. It was implanted in a dog.\n\nOn 2 July 1952, 41-year-old [[Henry Opitek]], suffering from shortness of breath, made medical history at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820123708/http://www.harperhospital.org/harper/ Harper University Hospital] at [[Wayne State University]] in Michigan.

The University of Utah developed a similar apparatus around the same time, but when they tried to patent it, Winchell's heart was cited as prior art. The university requested that Winchell donate the heart to the University of Utah, which he did.\nThere is some debate as to how much of Winchell's design Robert Jarvik used in creating Jarvik's artificial heart. Heimlich states, \"I saw the heart, I saw the patent and I saw the letters.

He presented his work at the meeting of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs held in Atlantic City in March 1961. At that meeting, Liotta described the implantation of three types of orthotopic (inside the pericardial sac) TAHs in dogs, each of which used a different source of external energy: an implantable electric motor, an implantable rotating pump with an external electric motor, and a pneumatic pump.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1961 | title = Artificial Heart in the chest: Preliminary report | url = | journal = Trans.

Graduate student Robert Jarvik was the project manager for the artificial heart, which was subsequently renamed the Jarvik 7.\n\nIn 1981, [[William DeVries]] submitted a request to the FDA for permission to implant the Jarvik 7 into a human being. On 2 December 1982, Kolff implanted the Jarvik 7 artificial heart into Barney Clark, a dentist from Seattle who was suffering from severe [[congestive heart failure]]. Clark lived for 112 days tethered to an external pneumatic compressor, a device weighing some {{convert|400|lb|kg}}, but during that time he suffered prolonged periods of confusion and a number of instances of bleeding, and asked several times to be allowed to die.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://celebrities.healthdiaries.com/the-25th-anniversary-of-barney-clarks-artificial-heart.html|title=The 25th Anniversary of Barney Clark's Artificial Heart|author=Barron H.

After 64 hours, the pneumatic-powered artificial heart was removed and replaced by a donor heart. However thirty-two hours after transplantation, the man died of what was later proved to be an acute pulmonary infection, extended to both lungs, caused by fungi, most likely caused by an [[immunosuppressive drug]] complication.<ref>Orthotopic cardiac prosthesis for two-staged cardiac replacement.

[[William J. Schroeder|Bill Schroeder]] became the second recipient and lived for a record 620 days.\n\nContrary to popular belief and erroneous articles in several periodicals, the Jarvik heart was not banned for permanent use. Today, the modern version of the Jarvik 7 is known as the [[SynCardia Systems|SynCardia]] temporary Total Artificial Heart. It has been implanted in more than 1,350 people as a bridge to transplantation.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, artificial hearts were powered by dishwasher-sized pneumatic power sources whose lineage went back to [[Alfa Laval]] [[Dairy#Milking machines|milking machines]]. Moreover, two sizable catheters had to cross the body wall to carry the pneumatic pulses to the implanted heart, greatly increasing the risk of infection. To speed development of a new generation of technologies, the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] opened a competition for implantable electrically powered artificial hearts. Three groups received funding: [[Cleveland Clinic]] in Cleveland, Ohio; the College of Medicine of [[Pennsylvania State University]] ([[Penn State Hershey Medical Center]]) in Hershey, Pennsylvania; and AbioMed, Inc. of Danvers, Massachusetts. Despite considerable progress, the Cleveland program was discontinued after the first five years.\n\n===First clinical application of an intrathoracic pump===\nOn 19 July 1963, E.

Artificial hearts are typically used to bridge the time to [[heart transplantation]], or to permanently replace the heart in case heart transplantation is impossible. Although other similar inventions preceded it from the late 1940s, the first artificial heart to be successfully implanted in a human was the Jarvik-7 in 1982, designed by a team including [[Willem Johan Kolff]] and [[Robert Jarvik]].\n\nAn artificial heart is distinct from a [[ventricular assist device]] (VAD) designed to support a failing heart. It is also distinct from a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine, which is an external device used to provide the functions of both the heart and lungs, used only for a few hours at a time, most commonly during [[cardiac surgery]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:The SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart with pink heart background.jpg|thumb|The SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart]]\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--Origins, half of \"First clinical applications of a permanent pneumatic total artificial heart\", \"First clinical application of an intrathoracic pump\", and \"First clinical application of an paracorporeal pump\" sections have no citations-->\n\n===Origins===\nA synthetic replacement for the heart remains a long-sought \"holy grail\" of modern medicine. The obvious benefit of a functional artificial heart would be to lower the need for [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]]s, because the demand for organs always greatly exceeds supply.\n\nAlthough the heart is conceptually a pump, it embodies subtleties that defy straightforward emulation with synthetic materials and power supplies. Consequences of these issues include severe [[transplant rejection|foreign-body rejection]] and external batteries that limit mobility. These complications limited the lifespan of early human recipients to hours or days.\n\n===Early development===\nThe first artificial heart was made by the Soviet scientist [[Vladimir Demikhov]] in 1937. It was implanted in a dog.\n\nOn 2 July 1952, 41-year-old [[Henry Opitek]], suffering from shortness of breath, made medical history at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820123708/http://www.harperhospital.org/harper/ Harper University Hospital] at [[Wayne State University]] in Michigan.

The University of Utah developed a similar apparatus around the same time, but when they tried to patent it, Winchell's heart was cited as prior art. The university requested that Winchell donate the heart to the University of Utah, which he did.\nThere is some debate as to how much of Winchell's design Robert Jarvik used in creating Jarvik's artificial heart. Heimlich states, \"I saw the heart, I saw the patent and I saw the letters.

He presented his work at the meeting of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs held in Atlantic City in March 1961. At that meeting, Liotta described the implantation of three types of orthotopic (inside the pericardial sac) TAHs in dogs, each of which used a different source of external energy: an implantable electric motor, an implantable rotating pump with an external electric motor, and a pneumatic pump.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1961 | title = Artificial Heart in the chest: Preliminary report | url = | journal = Trans.

Graduate student Robert Jarvik was the project manager for the artificial heart, which was subsequently renamed the Jarvik 7.\n\nIn 1981, [[William DeVries]] submitted a request to the FDA for permission to implant the Jarvik 7 into a human being. On 2 December 1982, Kolff implanted the Jarvik 7 artificial heart into Barney Clark, a dentist from Seattle who was suffering from severe [[congestive heart failure]].

A motorized pump moves hydraulic fluid in and out of the chambers, and that fluid causes the membrane to move; blood flows through the other side of each membrane. The blood-facing side of the membrane is made of tissue obtained from a sac that surrounds a cow's heart, to make the device more biocompatible. The Carmat device also uses valves made from cow heart tissue and has sensors to detect increased pressure within the device.

These pumps (which may be [[centrifugal pump|centrifugal]] or [[axial flow]]) are smaller and potentially more durable and last longer than the current generation of total heart replacement pumps. Another major advantage of a VAD is that the patient keeps the natural heart, which may still function for temporary back-up support if the mechanical pump were to stop. This may provide enough support to keep the patient alive until a solution to the problem is implemented.\n\nIn August 2006, an artificial heart was implanted into a 15-year-old girl at the [[Stollery Children's Hospital]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. It was intended to act as a temporary fixture until a donor heart could be found. Instead, the artificial heart (called a [[Berlin Heart]]) allowed for natural processes to occur and her heart healed on its own. After 146 days, the Berlin Heart was removed, and the girl's heart functioned properly on its own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://capitalhealth.ca/NewsAndEvents/NewsReleases/2007/Berlin_Heart.htm |title=Berlin Heart |accessdate=2007-08-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016205936/http://capitalhealth.ca/NewsAndEvents/NewsReleases/2007/Berlin_Heart.htm |archivedate=2007-10-16 }} (28 August 2007), Capital Health, Edmonton (archived from {{cite web|url=http://www.capitalhealth.ca/NewsAndEvents/NewsReleases/2007/Berlin_Heart.htm |title=Berlin Heart|accessdate=2007-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023043/http://www.capitalhealth.ca/NewsAndEvents/NewsReleases/2007/Berlin_Heart.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 }} the original) on 2007-10-01.</ref> On 16 December 2011 the Berlin Heart gained U.S. [[FDA]] approval.
