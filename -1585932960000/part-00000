Its rock score contributes to this cult status, including performances by [[Delaney and Bonnie]] and others.\n\n==Plot==\nCar delivery driver Kowalski ([[Barry Newman]]) arrives in [[Denver, Colorado]], on a late Friday night with a black [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. The delivery service clerk Sandy ([[Karl Swenson]]) urges him to get some rest, but Kowalski insists on getting started with his next assignment to deliver a white 1970 [[Dodge Challenger]] R/T 440 Magnum (supposedly supercharged) to [[San Francisco]] by Monday. Before leaving Denver, Kowalski pulls into a biker bar parking lot around midnight to buy [[Benzedrine]] pills to stay awake for the long drive ahead. He bets his dealer Jake ([[Lee Weaver]]) that he will get to San Francisco by 3:00 pm the next day, even though the delivery is not due until Monday.\n\nThrough flashbacks and the police reading of his record, we learn that Kowalski is a [[Medal of Honor]] [[Vietnam War]] [[War veteran|veteran]], former racecar driver, and motorcycle racer. He is also a former police officer.\n\nDriving west across Colorado, Kowalski is pursued by two motorcycle police officers who try to stop him for speeding. He forces one officer off the road and eludes the other officer by jumping across a dry creek bed. Later, the driver of a [[Jaguar E-Type]] roadster<ref name=speedtv>\n{{citation\n |date        = November 1, 2010\n |title       = Hollywood\u2019s Hottest Car Chases \u2013 Vanishing Point (1971)\n |publisher   = [[Speed TV]]\n |url         = http://automotive.speedtv.com/article/autos-hollywoods-hottest-car-chases-vanishing-point/\n |accessdate  = 2012-03-23\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120725173918/http://automotive.speedtv.com/article/autos-hollywoods-hottest-car-chases-vanishing-point/\n |archivedate = July 25, 2012\n}}\n</ref>\npulls up alongside Kowalski and challenges him to a race. After the Jaguar driver nearly runs him off the road, Kowalski overtakes him and beats the Jaguar to a one-lane bridge, causing the Jaguar to crash into the river. Kowalski checks to see if the driver is okay, then takes off, with police cars in pursuit.\n\nKowalski drives across [[Utah]] and into [[Nevada]], with the police unable to catch him. During the pursuit, Kowalski listens to radio station KOW, which is broadcasting from [[Goldfield, Nevada]]. A blind black disc jockey at KOW, who goes by the name of Super Soul ([[Cleavon Little]]), listens to the police radio frequency and encourages Kowalski to evade the police. Super Soul seems to understand Kowalski and seems to see and hear Kowalski's reactions. With the help of Super Soul, who calls Kowalski \"the last American hero\", Kowalski gains the interest of the news media, and people begin to gather at the KOW radio station to offer their support.\n\nDuring the police chase across Nevada, Kowalski finds himself surrounded and heads into the desert. After he blows a left front tire and becomes lost, Kowalski is helped by an old prospector ([[Dean Jagger]]) who catches rattlesnakes for a [[Pentecostal]] Christian commune. After Kowalski is given fuel, the old man directs him back to the highway. There, he picks up two homosexual hitchhikers stranded en route to San Francisco with a \"Just Married\" sign in their rear window. When they attempt to hold him up at gunpoint, Kowalski throws them out of the car and continues on his journey.\n\nSaturday afternoon, a vengeful off-duty highway patrolman and a group of thugs break into the KOW studio and assault Super Soul and his engineer. Near the [[California]] state line, Kowalski is helped by hippie biker Angel (Timothy Scott), who gives him pills to help him stay awake. Angel's girlfriend ([[Gilda Texter]]), who rides a motorcycle nude, recognizes Kowalski and shows him a collage she made of newspaper articles about his police career. Kowalski suspects that Super Soul's broadcast is now being directed by the police to entrap him. Confirming that the police are indeed waiting at the border, Angel helps Kowalski get through the roadblock with the help of an old air raid siren and a small motorbike with a red headlight strapped to the top of the Challenger, simulating a police car. Kowalski finally reaches California by Saturday at 7:12 pm. He calls Jake from a payphone to reassure him that he still intends to deliver the car on Monday.\n\nOn Sunday morning, California police, who have been tracking Kowalski's movements on an electronic wall-map, set up a roadblock with two bulldozers in the small town of [[Cisco, California|Cisco]], where Kowalski will be passing. A small crowd gathers at the roadblock, and as Kowalski approaches at high speed, he smiles as he crashes into the bulldozers in a fiery explosion. As firemen work to put out the flames, the crowd slowly disperses.<ref name=\"transcript\">\n{{cite web\n |title       = ''Vanishing Point'' Credits and Transcript\n |publisher   = Corky\n |url         = http://corky.net/scripts/vanishingPoint.html\n |accessdate  = December 2, 2011\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20111126153255/http://corky.net/scripts/vanishingPoint.html\n |archivedate = November 26, 2011\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Barry Newman]] as Kowalski\n* [[Cleavon Little]] as Super Soul\n* [[Dean Jagger]] as Prospector\n* Victoria Medlin as Vera Thornton\n* [[Karl Swenson]] as Sandy McKees\n* [[Lee Weaver]] as Jake\n* [[John Amos]] as Super Soul's engineer\n* Tom Reese as Sheriff\n* [[Paul Koslo]] as Charlie\n* [[Robert Donner]] as Collins\n* [[Owen Bush]] as Communications officer\n* [[Bill Drake]] as KLZ-FM reporter\n* [[Severn Darden]] as Rev.

Cabrera Infante]], under the [[pseudonym]] Guillermo Cain. The story was based on two actual events: the disgraced career of a San Diego police officer and a high-speed pursuit of a man who refused to stop and was killed when he crashed into a police roadblock.<ref name=\"siegel1\">{{cite news |last=Siegel |first=Mike |date=Autumn 2008 |title=The Freedom of Speed |work=Cinema Retro |pages=26 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> Infante modeled the character of Super Soul after legendary rock and roll singer [[The Big Bopper]].<ref name=\"siegel1\"/> His script reflected the popular [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] lifestyle of the time, containing elements of rebellion, drugs, sexual freedom, and rock and roll.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\">{{cite video |people=[[Richard C. Sarafian]] (Director) |title=Vanishing Point Commentary |medium=DVD |publisher= |location= |date=February 3, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, director [[Richard C. Sarafian]] turned down an offer to make [[Robert Redford]]'s ''[[Downhill Racer]]'' in order to direct ''Vanishing Point''. He was drawn to the counterculture themes in Cain's script.<ref name=\"siegel1\"/> Originally, the director wanted [[Gene Hackman]] to play Kowalski, but [[20th Century Fox]] studio executive [[Richard Zanuck]] insisted on casting relative unknown actor Barry Newman in the lead role.<ref name=\"siegel2\">Siegel 2008, pp. 26\u201327.</ref> The film marked the first major screen appearances of [[Cleavon Little]] and [[John Amos]].<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\"/>\n\n===The car===\nAccording to Sarafian, it was Zanuck who came up with the idea of using the new 1970 [[Dodge Challenger|Dodge Challenger R/T]]. He wanted to do Chrysler a favor for their longtime practice of providing 20th Century Fox with cars on a rental basis for only a dollar a day. Many of the other cars featured in the film are also Chrysler products.<ref name=\"siegel3\">Siegel 2008, p. 27.</ref> Stunt Coordinator [[Carey Loftin]] said he requested the Dodge Challenger because of the \"quality of the torsion bar suspension and for its horsepower\" and felt that it was \"a real sturdy, good running car.\"<ref name=\"zazarine\">{{cite news |last=Zazarine |first=Paul |date=March 1986 |title=Kowalski's Last Ride |publisher=Muscle Car Review}}</ref>\n\nFive Alpine White Dodge Challenger R/Ts were lent to the production by Chrysler for promotional consideration and were returned upon completion of filming. Four cars had 440 engines equipped with four-speeds; the fifth car was a 383 with automatic. No special equipment was added or modifications made to the cars, except for heavier-duty shock absorbers for the car that jumped over No Name Creek.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/> The Challengers were prepared and maintained for the movie by Max Balchowsky, who also prepared the Mustangs and Chargers for ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968). The cars performed to Loftin's satisfaction, although dust came to be a problem. None of the engines were blown.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/> Loftin remembers that parts were taken out of one car to repair another because they \"really ruined a couple of those cars\" while jumping ramps between highways and over creeks.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/> Newman remembers that the 440 engines in the cars were so powerful that \"it was almost as if there was too much power for the body. You'd put it in first and it would almost rear back!\"<ref name=\"zazarine\"/> The Challengers appear in the film with Colorado plates OA-5599.\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began in the summer of 1970 with a planned shooting schedule of 60 days.<ref name=\"siegel4\">Siegel 2008, p. 28.</ref> Financial troubles plaguing the studio at the time forced Zanuck to shorten Sarafian's shooting schedule by 22 days. In response, the director decided not to film certain scenes rather than rush through the rest of the shoot.<ref name=\"siegel8\"/> An average day of filming involved the actors and the crew of 19 men spending many hours traveling to the remote locations, shooting for an extended period of time and then looking for a motel to spend the night.<ref name=\"siegel7\">Siegel 2008, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> The shoot had a few mishaps, including Newman driving a Challenger equipped with three cameras into the bushes in order to avoid a head-on collision when a \"civilian\" driver ignored the traffic blocks installed to ensure the safety of the crew.<ref name=\"siegel5\">Siegel 2008, pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe film's cinematographer John Alonzo used light-weight Arriflex II cameras that offered a great deal of flexibility in terms of free movement.<ref name=\"siegel6\">Siegel 2008, p. 29.</ref> Close-up and medium shots were achieved by mounting cameras directly on the vehicles instead of the common practice of filming the drivers from a tow that drove ahead of the targeted vehicle.<ref name=\"siegel6\"/> To convey the appearance of speed, the filmmakers slowed the film rate of the cameras. For example, in the scenes with the Challenger and the Jaguar, the camera's film rate was slowed to half speed. The cars were traveling at approximately {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h}} so that when projected at normal frame rate, they appeared to be moving much faster.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/>\n\n''Vanishing Point'' was filmed on location in the American Southwest in the states of Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California.\n* [[Austin, Nevada]]\n* [[Cisco, Utah]] (the ending)\n* [[Denver, Colorado]]\n* [[Esmeralda County, Nevada]]\n* [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]] (first motorcycle police chase)\n* [[Goldfield, Nevada]] (Super Soul scenes)\n* [[Interstate 70 in Utah]]\n* [[Lander County, Nevada]]\n* [[Nye County, Nevada]]\n* [[Rifle, Colorado]]\n* [[Thompson Springs, Utah]]\n* [[Tonopah, Nevada]]\n* [[Wendover, Utah]]\n\nDean Jagger's scenes were shot on the Salt Lakes of Nevada.<ref name=\"siegel8\">Siegel 2008, p. 30.</ref> Super Soul's radio station was filmed in [[Goldfield, Nevada]]. All of Cleavon Little's scenes were completed in under three days.\n\n[[Carey Loftin]] was the film's stunt coordinator and responsible for setting up and performing the major driving stunts.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Loftin's resume at the time included work on ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966), ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971). Barry Newman learned from Loftin and was encouraged by the stunt coordinator to do some of his own stunts. In the scene before Kowalski crashes into the bulldozer, Newman drove and performed a 180-degree turn on the road himself without the director's knowledge.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/>\n\nThe 383 car was also used as the tow vehicle in the crash scene at the end of the movie. A quarter-mile cable was attached between the Challenger and an explosives-laden 1967 [[Chevrolet Camaro]] with the motor and transmission removed. The tow vehicle was driven by Loftin, who pulled the Camaro into the blades of the bulldozers at high speed. Loftin expected the car to go end over end, but instead it stuck into the bulldozers, which he thought looked better.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/>\n\n===Ending===\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=July 2017}}\nThe ending (and implicitly the theme of the film) has been the source of much debate, including one interpretation that the entire film is a post-death flashback after the car crashes into the bulldozers. The viewer is left guessing why Kowalski insists on driving to San Francisco immediately and then drives heedlessly across four states to his death. Kowalski says only, \"I gotta be in Frisco 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.\" When Jake scoffs that Kowalski is putting him on, Kowalski says, \"I wish to God I was.\"\n\nBarry Newman offered his interpretation of the film's ending in an interview printed in the March 1986 issue of ''Musclecar Review'', \"Kowalski smiles as he rushes to his death at the end of ''Vanishing Point'' because he believes he will make it through the roadblock.\" The August 2006 issue of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine has a sidebar with Newman, in which he explains that Kowalski sees the light glinting from between the two bulldozers. \"To Kowalski, it was still a hole to escape through. It symbolized that no matter how far they push or chase you, no one can truly take away your freedom and there is always an escape.\" Newman also thought that the entire film was an essay on [[existentialism]]. Kowalski drives to drive, with no real purpose for doing what he's doing. He decides to give his life its definition and meaning, with complete freedom over his actions.\n\nSarafian explained that he wanted to make Kowalski appear otherworldly and that the world within the film was a temporary existence that he was just making a stop in. At the end of the film, he was ascending from this existence into another. The lyrics of the end song underscore this interpretation: \"Nobody knows, nobody sees, 'til the light of life stops burning, 'til another soul goes free.\"\n\n===UK theatrical release===\nThe UK theatrical release of the film differs slightly from the US release in plot and running time. In the UK release, Kowalski picks up a mysterious hitchhiker ([[Charlotte Rampling]]) toward the end of the film. Kowalski accepts marijuana from her, despite refusing marijuana in several previous scenes. He stops the car when he starts feeling stoned. She says she has been \"waiting for him, everywhere and since forever.\" When he awakens the next morning, she is gone without a trace. According to interviews with Barry Newman and commentary from the director, the hitchhiker was meant to be an allegorical figure representing death.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\"/> This scene was removed from the final US version, reducing the film from 105 minutes to 98 minutes. Newman felt that the scene gave the film \"an allegorical lift\" but the studio was afraid that the audience would not understand.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/><ref>[http://filmint.nu/?p=10904 Wheeler Winston Dixon: Missing in Action: The Lost Version of Vanishing Point.] Film International 3.3.2014</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name        = Vanishing Point\n| type        = Soundtrack\n| artist      = Various Artists\n| cover       = \n| caption     = \n| released    = March 13, 1971\n| recorded    = 1970\n| genre       = {{flatlist|\n* [[Country music|Country]]\n* [[Pop music|pop]]\n* [[Rock music|rock]]\n}}\n| length      = 40:51\n| label       = Amos\n| producer    = {{flatlist|\n* [[Pete Carpenter]]\n* [[Mike Post]]\n* [[Jimmy Bowen]]\n* [[Tom Thacker (musician)|Tom Thacker]]\n}}\n|misc=\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}} [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r131988|pure_url=yes}} link]\n| noprose = yes\n}}\n}}\nSarafian wanted to score the majority of the film from an album called ''[[Motel Shot]]'' by [[Delaney, Bonnie & Friends]].<ref name=\"siegel8\"/> Lionel Newman, head of Fox's music department at the time, denied Sarafian's request because the studio did not want to spend a substantial amount of money obtaining rights to the tracks. The director then suggested that musician [[Randy Newman]] score the film, but Fox refused this request as well.<ref name=\"siegel8\"/> After watching the film, musical supervisor [[Jimmy Bowen]] wrote three original songs. Delaney, Bonnie & Friends ended up performing a musical number in the film.<ref name=\"siegel8\"/>\n\nA soundtrack of the film was released in the United States by Amos Records. The original vinyl album is long out of print. There have been reissues of the soundtrack [[compact disc]] in the United States by various record companies including [[A&M Records]] and in Europe by Amos Records.\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n| total_length    = 40:51\n| title1          = Super Soul Theme\n| note1           = The J.B.

Carnes also wrote the song performed by Big Mama Thornton. The pop music group Delaney, Bonnie & Friends had a small role as a [[Christian music]] band, which included singer [[Rita Coolidge]] and singer/songwriter [[David Gates]] at the piano.\nThe baby held by one of the singers is [[Bekka Bramlett]], who later replaced [[Stevie Nicks]] in [[Fleetwood Mac]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Vanishing Point'' premiered in January 1971 and did not receive positive notices.<ref name=\"siegel9\">Siegel 2008, p. 31.</ref> In his review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Charles Champlin]] wrote, \"''Vanishing Point'' might have had a point, but it ... ah ... got lost.

Kowalski is rewritten as a suspected [[militia]] sympathizer from [[Idaho]], and [[Jason Priestley]] as \"The Voice\", a white [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[talk radio]] [[shock jock]] who replaces Super Soul. The sequence of events in the two films is vaguely similar, but the remake removed all of the original's mystical, existential elements,<ref name=\"siegel9\"/> replacing them with a religious motivation for Kowalski's actions. Among many other changes, it also added a sequence in which two cops attempt to chase down the Challenger in a black 1969 [[Dodge Charger]] (coining the phrase \"it takes a Mopar to catch a Mopar\", which makes little sense in context, given that both cars have the same engine but the Charger is heavier).

Its rock score contributes to this cult status, including performances by [[Delaney and Bonnie]] and others.\n\n==Plot==\nCar delivery driver Kowalski ([[Barry Newman]]) arrives in [[Denver, Colorado]], on a late Friday night with a black [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. The delivery service clerk Sandy ([[Karl Swenson]]) urges him to get some rest, but Kowalski insists on getting started with his next assignment to deliver a white 1970 [[Dodge Challenger]] R/T 440 Magnum (supposedly supercharged) to [[San Francisco]] by Monday. Before leaving Denver, Kowalski pulls into a biker bar parking lot around midnight to buy [[Benzedrine]] pills to stay awake for the long drive ahead. He bets his dealer Jake ([[Lee Weaver]]) that he will get to San Francisco by 3:00 pm the next day, even though the delivery is not due until Monday.\n\nThrough flashbacks and the police reading of his record, we learn that Kowalski is a [[Medal of Honor]] [[Vietnam War]] [[War veteran|veteran]], former racecar driver, and motorcycle racer. He is also a former police officer.\n\nDriving west across Colorado, Kowalski is pursued by two motorcycle police officers who try to stop him for speeding. He forces one officer off the road and eludes the other officer by jumping across a dry creek bed. Later, the driver of a [[Jaguar E-Type]] roadster<ref name=speedtv>\n{{citation\n |date        = November 1, 2010\n |title       = Hollywood\u2019s Hottest Car Chases \u2013 Vanishing Point (1971)\n |publisher   = [[Speed TV]]\n |url         = http://automotive.speedtv.com/article/autos-hollywoods-hottest-car-chases-vanishing-point/\n |accessdate  = 2012-03-23\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120725173918/http://automotive.speedtv.com/article/autos-hollywoods-hottest-car-chases-vanishing-point/\n |archivedate = July 25, 2012\n}}\n</ref>\npulls up alongside Kowalski and challenges him to a race. After the Jaguar driver nearly runs him off the road, Kowalski overtakes him and beats the Jaguar to a one-lane bridge, causing the Jaguar to crash into the river. Kowalski checks to see if the driver is okay, then takes off, with police cars in pursuit.\n\nKowalski drives across [[Utah]] and into [[Nevada]], with the police unable to catch him. During the pursuit, Kowalski listens to radio station KOW, which is broadcasting from [[Goldfield, Nevada]]. A blind black disc jockey at KOW, who goes by the name of Super Soul ([[Cleavon Little]]), listens to the police radio frequency and encourages Kowalski to evade the police. Super Soul seems to understand Kowalski and seems to see and hear Kowalski's reactions. With the help of Super Soul, who calls Kowalski \"the last American hero\", Kowalski gains the interest of the news media, and people begin to gather at the KOW radio station to offer their support.\n\nDuring the police chase across Nevada, Kowalski finds himself surrounded and heads into the desert. After he blows a left front tire and becomes lost, Kowalski is helped by an old prospector ([[Dean Jagger]]) who catches rattlesnakes for a [[Pentecostal]] Christian commune. After Kowalski is given fuel, the old man directs him back to the highway. There, he picks up two homosexual hitchhikers stranded en route to San Francisco with a \"Just Married\" sign in their rear window. When they attempt to hold him up at gunpoint, Kowalski throws them out of the car and continues on his journey.\n\nSaturday afternoon, a vengeful off-duty highway patrolman and a group of thugs break into the KOW studio and assault Super Soul and his engineer. Near the [[California]] state line, Kowalski is helped by hippie biker Angel (Timothy Scott), who gives him pills to help him stay awake. Angel's girlfriend ([[Gilda Texter]]), who rides a motorcycle nude, recognizes Kowalski and shows him a collage she made of newspaper articles about his police career. Kowalski suspects that Super Soul's broadcast is now being directed by the police to entrap him. Confirming that the police are indeed waiting at the border, Angel helps Kowalski get through the roadblock with the help of an old air raid siren and a small motorbike with a red headlight strapped to the top of the Challenger, simulating a police car. Kowalski finally reaches California by Saturday at 7:12 pm. He calls Jake from a payphone to reassure him that he still intends to deliver the car on Monday.\n\nOn Sunday morning, California police, who have been tracking Kowalski's movements on an electronic wall-map, set up a roadblock with two bulldozers in the small town of [[Cisco, California|Cisco]], where Kowalski will be passing. A small crowd gathers at the roadblock, and as Kowalski approaches at high speed, he smiles as he crashes into the bulldozers in a fiery explosion. As firemen work to put out the flames, the crowd slowly disperses.<ref name=\"transcript\">\n{{cite web\n |title       = ''Vanishing Point'' Credits and Transcript\n |publisher   = Corky\n |url         = http://corky.net/scripts/vanishingPoint.html\n |accessdate  = December 2, 2011\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20111126153255/http://corky.net/scripts/vanishingPoint.html\n |archivedate = November 26, 2011\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Barry Newman]] as Kowalski\n* [[Cleavon Little]] as Super Soul\n* [[Dean Jagger]] as Prospector\n* Victoria Medlin as Vera Thornton\n* [[Karl Swenson]] as Sandy McKees\n* [[Lee Weaver]] as Jake\n* [[John Amos]] as Super Soul's engineer\n* Tom Reese as Sheriff\n* [[Paul Koslo]] as Charlie\n* [[Robert Donner]] as Collins\n* [[Owen Bush]] as Communications officer\n* [[Bill Drake]] as KLZ-FM reporter\n* [[Severn Darden]] as Rev.

Cabrera Infante]], under the [[pseudonym]] Guillermo Cain. The story was based on two actual events: the disgraced career of a San Diego police officer and a high-speed pursuit of a man who refused to stop and was killed when he crashed into a police roadblock.<ref name=\"siegel1\">{{cite news |last=Siegel |first=Mike |date=Autumn 2008 |title=The Freedom of Speed |work=Cinema Retro |pages=26 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> Infante modeled the character of Super Soul after legendary rock and roll singer [[The Big Bopper]].<ref name=\"siegel1\"/> His script reflected the popular [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] lifestyle of the time, containing elements of rebellion, drugs, sexual freedom, and rock and roll.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\">{{cite video |people=[[Richard C. Sarafian]] (Director) |title=Vanishing Point Commentary |medium=DVD |publisher= |location= |date=February 3, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, director [[Richard C. Sarafian]] turned down an offer to make [[Robert Redford]]'s ''[[Downhill Racer]]'' in order to direct ''Vanishing Point''. He was drawn to the counterculture themes in Cain's script.<ref name=\"siegel1\"/> Originally, the director wanted [[Gene Hackman]] to play Kowalski, but [[20th Century Fox]] studio executive [[Richard Zanuck]] insisted on casting relative unknown actor Barry Newman in the lead role.<ref name=\"siegel2\">Siegel 2008, pp. 26\u201327.</ref> The film marked the first major screen appearances of [[Cleavon Little]] and [[John Amos]].<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\"/>\n\n===The car===\nAccording to Sarafian, it was Zanuck who came up with the idea of using the new 1970 [[Dodge Challenger|Dodge Challenger R/T]]. He wanted to do Chrysler a favor for their longtime practice of providing 20th Century Fox with cars on a rental basis for only a dollar a day. Many of the other cars featured in the film are also Chrysler products.<ref name=\"siegel3\">Siegel 2008, p. 27.</ref> Stunt Coordinator [[Carey Loftin]] said he requested the Dodge Challenger because of the \"quality of the torsion bar suspension and for its horsepower\" and felt that it was \"a real sturdy, good running car.\"<ref name=\"zazarine\">{{cite news |last=Zazarine |first=Paul |date=March 1986 |title=Kowalski's Last Ride |publisher=Muscle Car Review}}</ref>\n\nFive Alpine White Dodge Challenger R/Ts were lent to the production by Chrysler for promotional consideration and were returned upon completion of filming. Four cars had 440 engines equipped with four-speeds; the fifth car was a 383 with automatic. No special equipment was added or modifications made to the cars, except for heavier-duty shock absorbers for the car that jumped over No Name Creek.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/> The Challengers were prepared and maintained for the movie by Max Balchowsky, who also prepared the Mustangs and Chargers for ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968). The cars performed to Loftin's satisfaction, although dust came to be a problem. None of the engines were blown.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/> Loftin remembers that parts were taken out of one car to repair another because they \"really ruined a couple of those cars\" while jumping ramps between highways and over creeks.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/> Newman remembers that the 440 engines in the cars were so powerful that \"it was almost as if there was too much power for the body. You'd put it in first and it would almost rear back!\"<ref name=\"zazarine\"/> The Challengers appear in the film with Colorado plates OA-5599.\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began in the summer of 1970 with a planned shooting schedule of 60 days.<ref name=\"siegel4\">Siegel 2008, p. 28.</ref> Financial troubles plaguing the studio at the time forced Zanuck to shorten Sarafian's shooting schedule by 22 days. In response, the director decided not to film certain scenes rather than rush through the rest of the shoot.<ref name=\"siegel8\"/> An average day of filming involved the actors and the crew of 19 men spending many hours traveling to the remote locations, shooting for an extended period of time and then looking for a motel to spend the night.<ref name=\"siegel7\">Siegel 2008, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> The shoot had a few mishaps, including Newman driving a Challenger equipped with three cameras into the bushes in order to avoid a head-on collision when a \"civilian\" driver ignored the traffic blocks installed to ensure the safety of the crew.<ref name=\"siegel5\">Siegel 2008, pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe film's cinematographer John Alonzo used light-weight Arriflex II cameras that offered a great deal of flexibility in terms of free movement.<ref name=\"siegel6\">Siegel 2008, p. 29.</ref> Close-up and medium shots were achieved by mounting cameras directly on the vehicles instead of the common practice of filming the drivers from a tow that drove ahead of the targeted vehicle.<ref name=\"siegel6\"/> To convey the appearance of speed, the filmmakers slowed the film rate of the cameras. For example, in the scenes with the Challenger and the Jaguar, the camera's film rate was slowed to half speed. The cars were traveling at approximately {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h}} so that when projected at normal frame rate, they appeared to be moving much faster.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/>\n\n''Vanishing Point'' was filmed on location in the American Southwest in the states of Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California.\n* [[Austin, Nevada]]\n* [[Cisco, Utah]] (the ending)\n* [[Denver, Colorado]]\n* [[Esmeralda County, Nevada]]\n* [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]] (first motorcycle police chase)\n* [[Goldfield, Nevada]] (Super Soul scenes)\n* [[Interstate 70 in Utah]]\n* [[Lander County, Nevada]]\n* [[Nye County, Nevada]]\n* [[Rifle, Colorado]]\n* [[Thompson Springs, Utah]]\n* [[Tonopah, Nevada]]\n* [[Wendover, Utah]]\n\nDean Jagger's scenes were shot on the Salt Lakes of Nevada.<ref name=\"siegel8\">Siegel 2008, p. 30.</ref> Super Soul's radio station was filmed in [[Goldfield, Nevada]]. All of Cleavon Little's scenes were completed in under three days.\n\n[[Carey Loftin]] was the film's stunt coordinator and responsible for setting up and performing the major driving stunts.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Loftin's resume at the time included work on ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966), ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971). Barry Newman learned from Loftin and was encouraged by the stunt coordinator to do some of his own stunts. In the scene before Kowalski crashes into the bulldozer, Newman drove and performed a 180-degree turn on the road himself without the director's knowledge.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/>\n\nThe 383 car was also used as the tow vehicle in the crash scene at the end of the movie. A quarter-mile cable was attached between the Challenger and an explosives-laden 1967 [[Chevrolet Camaro]] with the motor and transmission removed. The tow vehicle was driven by Loftin, who pulled the Camaro into the blades of the bulldozers at high speed. Loftin expected the car to go end over end, but instead it stuck into the bulldozers, which he thought looked better.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/>\n\n===Ending===\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=July 2017}}\nThe ending (and implicitly the theme of the film) has been the source of much debate, including one interpretation that the entire film is a post-death flashback after the car crashes into the bulldozers. The viewer is left guessing why Kowalski insists on driving to San Francisco immediately and then drives heedlessly across four states to his death. Kowalski says only, \"I gotta be in Frisco 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.\" When Jake scoffs that Kowalski is putting him on, Kowalski says, \"I wish to God I was.\"\n\nBarry Newman offered his interpretation of the film's ending in an interview printed in the March 1986 issue of ''Musclecar Review'', \"Kowalski smiles as he rushes to his death at the end of ''Vanishing Point'' because he believes he will make it through the roadblock.\" The August 2006 issue of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine has a sidebar with Newman, in which he explains that Kowalski sees the light glinting from between the two bulldozers. \"To Kowalski, it was still a hole to escape through. It symbolized that no matter how far they push or chase you, no one can truly take away your freedom and there is always an escape.\" Newman also thought that the entire film was an essay on [[existentialism]]. Kowalski drives to drive, with no real purpose for doing what he's doing. He decides to give his life its definition and meaning, with complete freedom over his actions.\n\nSarafian explained that he wanted to make Kowalski appear otherworldly and that the world within the film was a temporary existence that he was just making a stop in. At the end of the film, he was ascending from this existence into another. The lyrics of the end song underscore this interpretation: \"Nobody knows, nobody sees, 'til the light of life stops burning, 'til another soul goes free.\"\n\n===UK theatrical release===\nThe UK theatrical release of the film differs slightly from the US release in plot and running time. In the UK release, Kowalski picks up a mysterious hitchhiker ([[Charlotte Rampling]]) toward the end of the film. Kowalski accepts marijuana from her, despite refusing marijuana in several previous scenes. He stops the car when he starts feeling stoned.

After completing its run at the cinema box office, the film gained extended life as it became a second feature favorite in drive-in theaters across the US. A cult following began to develop, due in large part to a broadcast on network television in 1976.<ref name=\"zazarine\"/>\n\nThe film earned rentals of $4,250,000 in North America.<ref>Solomon, Aubrey.

Kowalski is rewritten as a suspected [[militia]] sympathizer from [[Idaho]], and [[Jason Priestley]] as \"The Voice\", a white [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[talk radio]] [[shock jock]] who replaces Super Soul. The sequence of events in the two films is vaguely similar, but the remake removed all of the original's mystical, existential elements,<ref name=\"siegel9\"/> replacing them with a religious motivation for Kowalski's actions. Among many other changes, it also added a sequence in which two cops attempt to chase down the Challenger in a black 1969 [[Dodge Charger]] (coining the phrase \"it takes a Mopar to catch a Mopar\", which makes little sense in context, given that both cars have the same engine but the Charger is heavier).

Payne wrote in 1999 that the term \"rape myth\" does not imply that a given scenario ''never'' occurs, and \"it is clear that any individual instance might conform to the characteristics described in cultural male mythology,\" since there is \"undeniably some percentage of women\" who have made false reports of rape, and there are \"certain situational or personal characteristics that differentiate women who have been raped from those who have not.\" They argue, however, that rape myths are \"generally false\" in nature, and function to deny and justify the victimization of women.<ref name=\"irma1999\">{{cite journal |title=Rape Myth Acceptance: Exploration of Its Structure and Its Measurement Using the ''Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale'' |first1=Diana L. |last1=Payne |first2=Kimberly A. |last2=Lonsway |first3=Louise F. |last3=Fitzgerald |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume= 33 |issue=1 |date=March 1999 |pages=27\u201368 |doi=10.1006/jrpe.1998.2238|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0815388f3263ea1b4eaf7facb5e23defdb80bbcc }}</ref> \n\n=== Heteronormative discourses ===\n[[Heteronormativity]] and associated discourses undergird and perpetuate many rape myths.

Transgender people are the most likely to face violence and backlash as people perceive them as inherently deceptive as they are said to be concealing their \u201ctrue sex\u201d. This is a very transphobic assumption that rationalizes the violence against trans people (mainly trans women) and the criminalization of trans people (mainly trans men). \n\n\u201cPenis Panic\u201d (Westbrook and Schilt) emerges in the discourse surrounding gender-neutral washrooms, due to the belief that men (and their penis) have a \u201cpropensity to rape\u201d (48). Therefore transgender women are portrayed, due to their penis, as a threat to women if they share the same washroom. Susan Brownmiller explores the biological determinism that defines rape due to the structural differences in men versus women (Cahill 21). This myth is furthered by the idea that allowing transgender people to use the restroom that aligns with their perceived gender will end up allowing male sexual predators into women\u2019s bathrooms. \n\nAnother common myth is the belief that no one wants to sexually assault a transgender person due to their identity. But that is not true, as transgender folks tend to be more vulnerable they could be more at risk to face sexual violence, especially as a form of hate crime. A common misconception is that sexual assault is primarily about sexual attraction, but rather it is about the dynamics of power and control over another person (https://www.gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Guide-for-trans-people-affected-by-sexual-violence-1.pdf).\n\n==Problems arising out of rape myths==\n\nThe prevalence of rape myths is a major reason for rape [[victim blaming]] and [[Social stigma|stigmatization]].<ref name=\"wvu\" /><ref name=\"HSKS\" /> Rape myths can cause victims of rape to blame themselves for their rape, or to not report their assault, and they can also shape the responses of judges and juries, causing a negative impact on rape victims.<ref name=Rich/> Some studies have shown that police officers are often distrustful of rape victims' account of their victimization, and that many of them believe some common rape myths.<ref name=\"JohnsonFisher2014\"/><ref name=Jordan>{{cite journal|author-last=Jordan|author-first=Jan|date=February 2004|title=Beyond Belief?

Reynolds and Shelley Keith suggested that \"a judiciary made up solely of men differs from one made up of more equal proportions of women and men\".<ref name=\"ymrk2002\" /><ref>{{cite book |first=Martha |last=Reeves |title=Women in Business: Theory and Cases |edition=2nd |date=2016 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NqnZDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT70 |page=70 |via=Google Books |access-date=7 November 2017|isbn=9781317363316 }}</ref> This commentary is furthered by the writings of Mallios and Meisner, who state that rape myth acceptance is problematic in judicial settings. They assert that ''[[voir dire]]'' can be used to curb jury bias related to preconceived notions regarding rape.<ref>Mallios C, Meisner T.

Strategies: The Prosecutors\u2019 Newsletter on Violence Against Women, 2010; 2. http://www.aequitasresource.org/EducatingJuriesInSexualAssaultCasesPart1.pdf</ref> This problem is further heightened by the fact that investigative agencies, various participants in the Legal System, and points of contacts for rape victims, for example the nearest doctor, are likelier to be male, than female. The 2015 book ''Asking for It''&nbsp;by [[Kate Harding]] talks about common rape myths and about the differences between male and female rapes. One in five women and one in seventy-one men in the United States will find out what it's like to be raped, according to Harding. She writes, \"Women are no more important than any other potential victims, but we are the primary targets of the messages and myths that sustain rape culture. Anyone can be raped, but men aren't conditioned to live in terror of it, nor are they constantly warned that their clothing, travel choices, alcohol consumption, and expressions of sexuality are likely to bring violations upon them.\"<ref name=\"Harding\">{{Cite book |title=Asking for It |last=Harding |first=Kate |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-7382-1702-4 |location=Philadelphia |pages=}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\nSuch stereotypes reduce the inclination of victims to report instances of rape, harassment, and assault. This reduced reporting of crimes might present a rosy picture and would further the problem, by leading to beliefs that these crimes that are reported are fake, false, or unlikely to be true.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn ''Asking for It'', Harding writes of rape that \"we tend not to treat it as a serious crime unless there's simultaneously evidence of another one\".<ref name=\"Harding\"/>{{rp|11}}  The author also quotes psychologist [[David Lisak]].

Canadian law does allow for the inclusion of previous sexual history, but defence counsel must present a s.276 application and a hearing is held to ensure the evidence will not be used in the context of the twin myths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://certificate.queenslaw.ca/blog/the-supreme-court-sexual-assault-and-twin-myths|title=The Supreme Court, Sexual Assault and \"Twin Myths\"|last=Rawson|first=Kate|date=2019|website=Queen's Certificate in Law Blog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n==Rape myth acceptance==\n===Measures===\nIn 1980, Martha R. Burt introduced the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (RMA, or RMAS).<ref name=\"Martha Burt\"/><ref name=hb>{{cite book |first=Carole A. |last=Beere |title=Sex and Gender Issues: A Handbook of Tests and Measures |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |url= https://archive.org/details/sexand_bee_1990_00_5030 |url-access=registration |via=Internet Archive |page=[https://archive.org/details/sexand_bee_1990_00_5030/page/400 400]|isbn=9780313274626 |year=1990 }}</ref> The scale was the first method for measuring an individual's level of belief in rape myths, and became the most widely used.<ref name=\"irma1999\"/> Using Burt's method, rape myth acceptance is measured by asking subjects 19 questions. The first 10 questions each consist of a statement which suggests that rape victims are responsible for their own rape, and ask the subject to assess its truthfulness, rating each statement on a seven-point scale from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" The 11th statement tests for the inverse of this idea, asking whether or not it is true that any woman can be raped. The remaining questions ask test subjects to guess the proportion of reported rapes that are false, and assess whether they are more or less likely to believe a rape victim based on the victim's personal characteristics (for example, their gender, their race or ethnicity, their age, or their relationship to the test subject).<ref name=\"hb\"/>\n\nBurt's original study concluded that many Americans believed in rape myths. More than half of the individuals sampled in her original survey had agreed that \"a woman who goes to the home or apartment of a man\" on the first date \"implies she is willing to have sex,\" and that in the majority of rapes \"the victim was promiscuous or had a bad reputation.\" More than half of Burt's respondents had suggested 50% or more of reported rapes were reported \"only because the woman was trying to get back at a man\" or \"trying to cover up an illegitimate pregnancy.\"<ref name=\"Martha Burt\"/>\n\nAnother measure is the 45-item Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (IRMA), developed by Diana L. Payne, Kimberly A. Lonsway, and Louise F. Fitzgerald in 1999.<ref name=\"irma1999\">{{cite journal |title=Rape Myth Acceptance: Exploration of Its Structure and Its Measurement Using the ''Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale'' |first1=Diana L. |last1=Payne |first2=Kimberly A. |last2=Lonsway |first3=Louise F. |last3=Fitzgerald |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume= 33 |issue=1 |date=March 1999 |pages=27\u201368 |doi=10.1006/jrpe.1998.2238|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0815388f3263ea1b4eaf7facb5e23defdb80bbcc }}</ref> They concluded that \"rape myth acceptance is most adequately conceptualized as consisting of both a general component and seven distinct myth components: ''She asked for it; It wasn\u2019t really rape; He didn\u2019t mean to; She really wanted it; She lied; Rape is a trivial event;'' and ''Rape is a deviant event''\"<ref name=\"irma1999\"/>\n\nThe developers of IRMA analyzed responses to a pool of 95 statements about rape to create their scale.<ref name=\"irma1999\" />\n\nBased on the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale, the Chinese Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (CRMA) is a culturally-specific myth scale that measures acceptance of rape myths in Chinese society. The scale operates under a culturally-adapted definition of rape, specifically, in China the legal definition of rape makes no provision for marital rape and does not apply to male victims. Additionally, the definition excludes \u201ctypes of coercive sexual behavior, such as other forms of penetrative sex, including oral sex, anal sex, and penetrations of the vagina or anus by other body parts like fingers or other objects.\u201d The CRMA retains 25 of 45 items from the IRMA scale and produces a five-factor structure. These myth component factors are: rape victims want to be raped; rape allegations are often false; rape must involve violence; victims are responsible for being raped; and, the motivation to rape is understandable.<ref>Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R.

They assert that ''[[voir dire]]'' can be used to curb jury bias related to preconceived notions regarding rape.<ref>Mallios C, Meisner T.

The 2015 book ''Asking for It''&nbsp;by [[Kate Harding]] talks about common rape myths and about the differences between male and female rapes. One in five women and one in seventy-one men in the United States will find out what it's like to be raped, according to Harding. She writes, \"Women are no more important than any other potential victims, but we are the primary targets of the messages and myths that sustain rape culture. Anyone can be raped, but men aren't conditioned to live in terror of it, nor are they constantly warned that their clothing, travel choices, alcohol consumption, and expressions of sexuality are likely to bring violations upon them.\"<ref name=\"Harding\">{{Cite book |title=Asking for It |last=Harding |first=Kate |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-7382-1702-4 |location=Philadelphia |pages=}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\nSuch stereotypes reduce the inclination of victims to report instances of rape, harassment, and assault. This reduced reporting of crimes might present a rosy picture and would further the problem, by leading to beliefs that these crimes that are reported are fake, false, or unlikely to be true.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn ''Asking for It'', Harding writes of rape that \"we tend not to treat it as a serious crime unless there's simultaneously evidence of another one\".<ref name=\"Harding\"/>{{rp|11}}  The author also quotes psychologist [[David Lisak]]. He says that \"Ultimately, only a tiny handful of rapists ever serve time for rape, a shocking outcome given that we view rape as close kin to murder in the taxonomy of violent crime\".<ref name=\"Harding\"/>{{rp|11}}\n\n=== Twin myths ===\nThe ''twin myths'' suggest that a victim\u2019s previous sexual history i) makes them less believable, and/or ii) more likely to consent. Canadian law does allow for the inclusion of previous sexual history, but defence counsel must present a s.276 application and a hearing is held to ensure the evidence will not be used in the context of the twin myths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://certificate.queenslaw.ca/blog/the-supreme-court-sexual-assault-and-twin-myths|title=The Supreme Court, Sexual Assault and \"Twin Myths\"|last=Rawson|first=Kate|date=2019|website=Queen's Certificate in Law Blog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n==Rape myth acceptance==\n===Measures===\nIn 1980, Martha R. Burt introduced the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (RMA, or RMAS).<ref name=\"Martha Burt\"/><ref name=hb>{{cite book |first=Carole A. |last=Beere |title=Sex and Gender Issues: A Handbook of Tests and Measures |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |url= https://archive.org/details/sexand_bee_1990_00_5030 |url-access=registration |via=Internet Archive |page=[https://archive.org/details/sexand_bee_1990_00_5030/page/400 400]|isbn=9780313274626 |year=1990 }}</ref> The scale was the first method for measuring an individual's level of belief in rape myths, and became the most widely used.<ref name=\"irma1999\"/> Using Burt's method, rape myth acceptance is measured by asking subjects 19 questions. The first 10 questions each consist of a statement which suggests that rape victims are responsible for their own rape, and ask the subject to assess its truthfulness, rating each statement on a seven-point scale from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" The 11th statement tests for the inverse of this idea, asking whether or not it is true that any woman can be raped. The remaining questions ask test subjects to guess the proportion of reported rapes that are false, and assess whether they are more or less likely to believe a rape victim based on the victim's personal characteristics (for example, their gender, their race or ethnicity, their age, or their relationship to the test subject).<ref name=\"hb\"/>\n\nBurt's original study concluded that many Americans believed in rape myths. More than half of the individuals sampled in her original survey had agreed that \"a woman who goes to the home or apartment of a man\" on the first date \"implies she is willing to have sex,\" and that in the majority of rapes \"the victim was promiscuous or had a bad reputation.\" More than half of Burt's respondents had suggested 50% or more of reported rapes were reported \"only because the woman was trying to get back at a man\" or \"trying to cover up an illegitimate pregnancy.\"<ref name=\"Martha Burt\"/>\n\nAnother measure is the 45-item Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (IRMA), developed by Diana L.

The scale operates under a culturally-adapted definition of rape, specifically, in China the legal definition of rape makes no provision for marital rape and does not apply to male victims. Additionally, the definition excludes \u201ctypes of coercive sexual behavior, such as other forms of penetrative sex, including oral sex, anal sex, and penetrations of the vagina or anus by other body parts like fingers or other objects.\u201d The CRMA retains 25 of 45 items from the IRMA scale and produces a five-factor structure. These myth component factors are: rape victims want to be raped; rape allegations are often false; rape must involve violence; victims are responsible for being raped; and, the motivation to rape is understandable.<ref>Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R.
