He was initially known as the Prince of Yu (\u88d5\u738b) from 1539 to 1567 before he became the emperor. His [[Chinese era name|era name]], Longqing, means \"great celebration\".\n\n==Reign==\nAfter the death of the [[Jiajing Emperor]], the Longqing Emperor inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. Realizing the depth of chaos his father's long reign had caused, the Longqing Emperor set about reforming the government by re-employing talented officials previously banished by his father, such as [[Hai Rui]]. He also purged the government of corrupt officials namely Daoist priests whom the Jiajing Emperor had favoured in the hope of improving the situation in the empire. Furthermore, the Longqing Emperor restarted trade with other empires in Europe, Africa and other parts of Asia. Territorial security was reinforced through the appointment of several generals to patrol both land and sea borders. This included the fortification of seaports along the [[Zhejiang]] and [[Fujian]] coast to deter pirates, a constant nuisance during the Jiajing Emperor's reign. The Longqing Emperor also repulsed the Mongol army of [[Altan Khan]], who had penetrated the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and reached as far as [[Beijing]]. A peace treaty to trade horses for silk was signed with the Mongols shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Longqing Emperor's reign, which was not unlike that of any previous Ming emperor, saw a heavy reliance on court [[eunuch]]s. One particular eunuch, [[Meng Cong]], who was introduced by the Longqing Emperor's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] [[Gao Gong]], came to dominate the inner court towards the end of the emperor's reign. Meng Cong gained favours by introducing [[Nu Er Huahua]], a female dancer of ethnic Turkish origin, to the Longqing Emperor, whose beauty was said to have captured the ruler's full attention. Despite initial hopeful beginnings, the Longqing Emperor quickly abandoned his duties as a ruler and set about pursuing personal enjoyment. The emperor also made contradictory decisions by re-employing Daoist priests that he himself had banned at the start of his reign.\n\nIn October 1567, [[Xu Jie (Ming dynasty)|Xu Jie]] firmly told the Emperor to stop eunuchs supervising the capital training divisions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rV4rAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA179|title=A Political Life in Ming China: A Grand Secretary and His Times|last=Dardess|first=John W.|date=2013-09-25|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781442223783|pages=179|language=en}}</ref> Enraged, Longqing said \"I ordered eunuchs to sit with the training divisions, and the speaking officials objected, and you all objected too.

Unfortunately, the country was still in decline due to corruption in the ruling class. Before the Longqing Emperor died, he had instructed minister [[Zhang Juzheng]] to oversee affairs of state and become the dedicated advisor to the [[Wanli Emperor]] who was only 10.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Longqing Emperor's reign lasted a mere six years and was succeeded by his son. It was said that the emperor also suffered from speech impairment which caused him to stutter and stammer when speaking in public.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mote|first=Frederick W.|year=2003|title=Imperial China 900\u20131800 |location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-01212-7|page=725}}</ref> He is generally considered one of the more liberal and open-minded emperors of the Ming dynasty, even though he lacked the talent keenly needed for rulership and he eventually became more interested in pursuing personal gratification rather than ruling itself.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Longqing Emperor was buried in [[Ming tombs#List of the Imperial Tombs|Zhaoling]] (\u662d\u9675) of the [[Ming tombs]].\n\n==Family==\n* Parents:\n** Zhu Houcong, the [[Jiajing Emperor]] ({{lang|zh|\u4e16\u5b97 \u6731\u539a\u719c}};

4{{nbsp}}March 1537{{snd}}5{{nbsp}}July 1572), personal name '''Zhu Zaiji''' (\u6731\u8f09\u5756), was the 13th [[List of emperors of the Ming dynasty|Emperor of the Ming dynasty]], reigned from 1567 to 1572. He was initially known as the Prince of Yu (\u88d5\u738b) from 1539 to 1567 before he became the emperor. His [[Chinese era name|era name]], Longqing, means \"great celebration\".\n\n==Reign==\nAfter the death of the [[Jiajing Emperor]], the Longqing Emperor inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. Realizing the depth of chaos his father's long reign had caused, the Longqing Emperor set about reforming the government by re-employing talented officials previously banished by his father, such as [[Hai Rui]]. He also purged the government of corrupt officials namely Daoist priests whom the Jiajing Emperor had favoured in the hope of improving the situation in the empire. Furthermore, the Longqing Emperor restarted trade with other empires in Europe, Africa and other parts of Asia. Territorial security was reinforced through the appointment of several generals to patrol both land and sea borders. This included the fortification of seaports along the [[Zhejiang]] and [[Fujian]] coast to deter pirates, a constant nuisance during the Jiajing Emperor's reign. The Longqing Emperor also repulsed the Mongol army of [[Altan Khan]], who had penetrated the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and reached as far as [[Beijing]]. A peace treaty to trade horses for silk was signed with the Mongols shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Longqing Emperor's reign, which was not unlike that of any previous Ming emperor, saw a heavy reliance on court [[eunuch]]s. One particular eunuch, [[Meng Cong]], who was introduced by the Longqing Emperor's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] [[Gao Gong]], came to dominate the inner court towards the end of the emperor's reign. Meng Cong gained favours by introducing [[Nu Er Huahua]], a female dancer of ethnic Turkish origin, to the Longqing Emperor, whose beauty was said to have captured the ruler's full attention. Despite initial hopeful beginnings, the Longqing Emperor quickly abandoned his duties as a ruler and set about pursuing personal enjoyment. The emperor also made contradictory decisions by re-employing Daoist priests that he himself had banned at the start of his reign.\n\nIn October 1567, [[Xu Jie (Ming dynasty)|Xu Jie]] firmly told the Emperor to stop eunuchs supervising the capital training divisions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rV4rAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA179&dq=longqing&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxs4fZ7KrfAhWF1lkKHc9mCjEQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=longqing&f=false|title=A Political Life in Ming China: A Grand Secretary and His Times|last=Dardess|first=John W.|date=2013-09-25|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=|isbn=9781442223783|location=|pages=179|language=en}}</ref> Enraged, Longqing said \"I ordered eunuchs to sit with the training divisions, and the speaking officials objected, and you all objected too. What's the idea? Explain your disobedience.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Xu Jie explained that the [[Jiajing Emperor]] had abolished eunuch-run divisions and that thy [[Hongwu Emperor|founder]] never set up eunuchs to run divisions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Longqing backed down for now.\n\n==Death==\nThe Longqing Emperor died in 1572 and was only 35. Unfortunately, the country was still in decline due to corruption in the ruling class. Before the Longqing Emperor died, he had instructed minister [[Zhang Juzheng]] to oversee affairs of state and become the dedicated advisor to the [[Wanli Emperor]] who was only 10.\n==Legacy==\nThe Longqing Emperor's reign lasted a mere six years and was succeeded by his son. It was said that the emperor also suffered from speech impairment which caused him to stutter and stammer when speaking in public.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mote|first=Frederick W.|year=2003|title=Imperial China 900\u20131800 |location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-01212-7|page=725}}</ref> He is generally considered one of the more liberal and open-minded emperors of the Ming dynasty, even though he lacked the talent keenly needed for rulership and he eventually became more interested in pursuing personal gratification rather than ruling itself.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Longqing Emperor was buried in [[Ming tombs#List of the Imperial Tombs|Zhaoling]] (\u662d\u9675) of the [[Ming tombs|Ming Tombs]].\n\n==Family==\n* Parents:\n** Zhu Houcong, the [[Jiajing Emperor]] ({{lang|zh|\u4e16\u5b97 \u6731\u539a\u719c}}; 16 September 1507 \u2013 23 January 1567)\n** Empress Xiaoke, of the Du clan ({{lang|zh|\u5b5d\u606a\u7687\u540e \u675c\u6c0f}}; d. 1554)\n* Consorts and Issue:\n** Empress Xiaoyizhuang, of the Li clan ({{lang|zh|\u5b5d\u61ff\u838a\u7687\u540e \u674e\u6c0f}}; d. 1558)\n*** ''Zhu Yiyi, Crown Prince Xianhuai'' ({{lang|zh|\u61b2\u61f7\u7687\u592a\u5b50 \u6731\u7fca\u91f4}}; 15 October 1555 \u2013 11 May 1559), first son\n*** ''Zhu Yiling, Prince Jingdao'' ({{lang|zh|\u9756\u60bc\u738b \u6731\u7fca\u9234}}), second son\n*** ''Princess Penglai'' ({{lang|zh|\u84ec\u840a\u516c\u4e3b}}; 1557), first daughter\n** [[Empress Chen (Longqing)|Empress Xiao'an]], of the Chen clan ({{lang|zh|\u5b5d\u5b89\u7687\u540e \u9673\u6c0f}}; d. 1596)\n*** ''Princess Taihe'' ({{lang|zh|\u592a\u548c\u516c\u4e3b}}; d. 1560), second daughter\n** [[Empress Dowager Xiaoding]], of the Li clan ({{lang|zh|\u5b5d\u5b9a\u7687\u592a\u540e \u674e\u6c0f}}; 19 November 1546 \u2013 9 February 1614)\n*** Zhu Yijun, the [[Wanli Emperor]] ({{lang|zh|\u795e\u5b97 \u6731\u7fca\u921e}}; 4 September 1563 \u2013 18 August 1620), third son\n*** Princess Shouyang ({{lang|zh|\u58fd\u967d\u516c\u4e3b}}; 1565\u20131590), personal name Yao'e ({{lang|zh|\u582f\u5a25}}), third daughter\n**** Married Hou Gongchen ({{lang|zh|\u4faf\u62f1\u8fb0}}) in 1581\n*** Princess Yongning ({{lang|zh|\u6c38\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b}}; 11 March 1567 \u2013 22 July 1594), personal name Yaoying ({{lang|zh|\u582f\u5a96}}), fourth daughter\n**** Married Liang Bangrui ({{lang|zh|\u6881\u90a6\u745e}}; d. 9 May 1582) in 1582\n*** Zhu Yiliu, Prince Lujian ({{lang|zh|\u6f5e\u7c21\u738b \u6731\u7fca\u93d0}}; 3 March 1568 \u2013 4 July 1614), fourth son\n*** Princess Rui'an ({{lang|zh|\u745e\u5b89\u516c\u4e3b}}; 1569\u20131629), personal name Yaoyuan ({{lang|zh|\u582f\u5a9b}})\n**** Married Wan Wei ({{lang|zh|\u842c\u7152}}; d. 1644) in 1585, and had issue (one son)\n** Consort Duanjingshu, of the Qin clan ({{lang|zh|\u7aef\u975c\u6dd1\u5983 \u79e6\u6c0f}})\n*** ''Princess Qixia'' ({{lang|zh|\u68f2\u971e\u516c\u4e3b}}; 1571\u20131572), personal name Yaolu ({{lang|zh|\u582f\ud845\udfb1}}), seventh daughter\n** Consort Gonghuizhuang, of the Liu clan ({{lang|zh|\u606d\u60e0\u838a\u5983 \u5289\u6c0f}}; d. 1582)\n** Consort Zhuangxirong, of the Wang clan ({{lang|zh|\u838a\u50d6\u69ae\u5983 \u738b\u6c0f}}; d. 1580)\n** Unknown\n*** Princess Yanqing ({{lang|zh|\u5ef6\u6176\u516c\u4e3b}}; b. 1570), personal name Yaoji ({{lang|zh|\u582f\u59ec}}), sixth daughter\n**** Married Wang Bing ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u663a}}) in 1587\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chinese emperors family tree (late)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{commons category}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[House of Zhu]]|4 March|1537|5 July|1572}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{succession box|title=[[List of emperors of the Ming dynasty|Emperor of the Ming dynasty]]<br>[[Emperor of China]]|before=[[Jiajing Emperor]]|after=[[Wanli Emperor]]|years=1567\u20131572}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Ming emperors}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2010}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Longqing Emperor}}\n[[Category:1537 births]]\n[[Category:1572 deaths]]\n[[Category:Ming dynasty emperors]]\n[[Category:16th-century Chinese monarchs]]\n[[Category:Emperors from Beijing]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "date format audit, link maintenance", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longqing_Emperor"}

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and other wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharshtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel's widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai. More down the road on the hill is BSES Niwas, a property now being developed for and by [[Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group|Reliance ADAG]]now Adnani. lying adjacent is the Reservoir at 'The Top Of The Hill' holding and supplying Water to the residents of both side of the Hill.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and other wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharshtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel's widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai. More down the road on the hill is BSES Niwas, a property now being developed for and by [[Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group|Reliance ADAG]]now Adnani. lying adjacent is the Reservoir at 'The Top Of The Hill' holding and supplying Water to the residents of both side of the Hill. Further down the southern slopes of the hill resided the Late Nagris Dutt and her husband the late Sunil Dutt, the two besides been thespians were also connected politically Mr Sunil Dutt, a politician, after he joined the Indian National Congress party, he had the unique distinction of getting elected to the Parliament of India for five terms from the Mumbai North West constituency.\nOn the bend is the Residence of the famous Dilip Kumar whose thespian wife Saira Banu live therein.\n\nDown towards Union Park & Golf Links at the North end if the hill is the residence of the former chief minister of Maharashtra Mr Narayan Rane.\nThe Golf Course today is no more, it is filed by high rise buildings over seeing the nets of The \"Danda' fishing Village.\n\nOther landmarks include Kangaroo Kids Nursery and Playschool, Juice Salon, Sundaram Stores, cozy home apartments. At Union Park lies Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls' High School.\ndown the slope on the eastern side is the Pali Market, now under reconstruction.\nIn the 19th Century Pali Hill was called Pakhari HIll\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\n* President of The Indian Music Industry & Phonographic Performance Ltd. and Ex-Chairman of Polygram Music Ltd. and Universal Music India, Vijay Lazarus;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indianmi.org/newsletter/August%201/The%20President's%20Desk.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018013738/http://www.indianmi.org/newsletter/August%201/The%20President's%20Desk.html |archive-date=18 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[[Indian Music Industry]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioandmusic.com/biz/music/representative-bodies/imi/imi-president-vijay-lazarus-differences-radio-industry-need-be-bridged|title=IMI president Vijay Lazarus - Differences with the radio industry need to be bridged|website=www.radioandmusic.com}}</ref>\n* Late politician and actor, [[Sunil Dutt]]'s bungalow, as well as his daughter and Member of Parliament [[Priya Dutt]]'s and her brother [[Sanjay Dutt]]'s building;\n*[[Kripashankar Singh]] EX- Home Minister of Maharashtra, Presidents of [[Mumbai Regional Congress Committee|Mumbai Congress]], & MLA From [[Kalina (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Kalina]] \n* [[Kumar Gaurav]] of Love Story fame\n* Actor [[Dilip Kumar]]'s and [[Saira Banu]]'s bungalow (currently caught in a heritage structure row and in a semi-ruin state);<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/We-dont-want-Bollywood-in-our-backyard/articleshow/16119072.cms|title=We don't want Bollywood in our backyard|last=Apr 18|first=Updated|last2=2011|website=Mumbai Mirror|language=en|access-date=2019-07-31|last3=Ist|first3=02:40}}</ref>\n* Film personality Nasir's Hussain's bungalow \u2013 Pali Annexe (now being renovated); with grandson [[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]]\n* [[Rajendranath Zutshi]] at Summer Palace\n* [[Aamir Khan]]'s flat at Belavista and [[Faisal Khan]] at Marina Apartments near the Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls' High School at Union Park;\n* Film maker and director [[Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra]]'s bungalow \u2013 Mamta\n* [[Gulzar]], poet, lyricist, writer, at his bungalow Boskiyana\n* [[Gulshan Bawra]], lyricist<ref name=down>{{cite web |title=Down the memory lane with Gulshan Bawra |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/07/09/2839/index.html |date=9 July 2007 |publisher=Screen Weekly }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]], his wife [[Neetu Kapoor]] at the bungalow Krishna Raj\n*[[Ranbir Kapoor]] at Vastu Apartment with [[Alia Bhatt]]\n* [[Narayan Rane]] at Gautam Apartments\n* Actors [[Sanjeev Kumar]] near Petit School \n* [[Prem Chopra]], [[Moushmi Chatterjee]], [[Vinod Mehra]] and others\n* [[Anil Dhawan]], at Nibbana Apartments; \n* [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] and his family\n* Actor [[Pran (actor)|Pran]] and other eminent Film production icons\n* [[Mahesh Bhatt]] and [[Pooja Bhatt]] who used to stay at Green Acres\n* Models [[Tapur Chatterjee]] and [[Kirat Bhattal]] \n* [[Anna Singh]], fashion designer\n* [[Sameer Pitalwalla]], CEO of [[Culture Machine]]\n* [[Haresh Chawla]], CEO of [[CNBC-TV18]]\n* [[Kunal Kapoor]], film director\n* [[Emraan Hashmi]], Bollywood Actor; at Nibhana\n* [[Asha Sachdev]] at Sunset Heights\n* [[A.M.

Jonestown Project: San Diego State University.</ref>\n\nOn that tape, Jones tells Temple members that the Soviet Union, with whom the Temple had been negotiating a potential exodus for months, would not take them after the airstrip murders. The reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with his previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would \"parachute in here on us,\" \"shoot some of our innocent babies\" and \"they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors.\" Jones's prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to [[fascism]] would lead many members who held strong opposing views to fascism to view the suicide as valid. <ref name=\"tape\" />\n\nWith that reasoning, Jones and several members argued that the group should commit \"revolutionary suicide\" by drinking [[cyanide]]-laced grape-flavored [[Flavor Aid]]. Later-released Temple films show Jones opening a storage container full of [[Kool Aid]] in large quantities. However, empty packets of grape Flavor Aid found on the scene show that this is what was used to mix the solution, along with a [[sedative]]. One member, Christine Miller, dissents toward the beginning of the tape.<ref name=\"tape\"/>\n\nWhen members apparently cried, Jones counseled, \"Stop these hysterics. This is not the way for people who are socialists or communists to die. No way for us to die. We must die with some dignity.\" Jones can be heard saying, \"Don't be afraid to die,\" that death is \"just stepping over into another plane\" and that it's \"a friend.\" At the end of the tape, Jones concludes: \"We didn't commit suicide; we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world.\"<ref name=\"tape\"/>\n\nAccording to escaping Temple members, children were given the drink first by their own parents, families were told to lie down together.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=559}}</ref> Mass suicide had been previously discussed in simulated events called \"White Nights\" on a regular basis.<ref name=\"laytonaff\">[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=13072 \"Affidavit of Deborah Layton Blakey\".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''.

Jonestown Project: San Diego State University.</ref>\n\nOn that tape, Jones tells Temple members that the Soviet Union, with whom the Temple had been negotiating a potential exodus for months, would not take them after the airstrip murders. The reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with his previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would \"parachute in here on us,\" \"shoot some of our innocent babies\" and \"they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors.\" Jones's prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to [[fascism]] would lead many members who held strong opposing views to fascism to view the suicide as valid. <ref name=\"tape\" />\n\nWith that reasoning, Jones and several members argued that the group should commit \"revolutionary suicide\" by drinking [[cyanide]]-laced grape-flavored [[Flavor Aid]]. Later-released Temple films show Jones opening a storage container full of [[Kool Aid]] in large quantities. However, empty packets of grape Flavor Aid found on the scene show that this is what was used to mix the solution, along with a [[sedative]]. One member, Christine Miller, dissents toward the beginning of the tape.<ref name=\"tape\"/>\n\nWhen members apparently cried, Jones counseled, \"Stop these hysterics. This is not the way for people who are socialists or communists to die. No way for us to die. We must die with some dignity.\" Jones can be heard saying, \"Don't be afraid to die,\" that death is \"just stepping over into another plane\" and that it's \"a friend.\" At the end of the tape, Jones concludes: \"We didn't commit suicide; we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world.\"<ref name=\"tape\"/>\n\nAccording to escaping Temple members, children were given the drink first by their own parents, families were told to lie down together.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=559}}</ref> Mass suicide had been previously discussed in simulated events called \"White Nights\" on a regular basis.<ref name=\"laytonaff\">[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=13072 \"Affidavit of Deborah Layton Blakey\".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''.

Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring. There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 199\u2013221}}</ref>\n\n==American comic books==\n{{main|American comic book}}\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of an english version of the classic european comic book ''[[Histoire de M.

The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"[[small press]]\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers \u2013 such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] \u2013 had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"[[minicomic]]s\" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202055024/https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].\n\n===Graphic novels===\n[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]\n{{Main|Graphic novel}}\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],<ref>Sabin, Roger.

Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the first issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974.

(See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. Since then, other grading companies have arisen. Because condition is important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man are considered priceless.\n\n===Advertisements===\n[[Advertising in comic books|Comic book advertisement]]s were a common feature in American comic books from the 1950s to the 1980s. They were typically grouped together on the inside back cover in, displayed in black and white with an illustration of the product. As these advertisements were directed at young people, many made sensational claims and sold the products for a few dollars to be sent to a post office box.

There was a comic created about the 99th squadron, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen, an all black air force unit. Instead of making the comic about their story the comic the comic was about Hop Harrigan. A white pilot who captures a Nazi, shows him videos of the 99th squadron defeating his man and then reveals to the Nazi that his men were defeated by African Americans which infuriated him as he sees them as a less superior race and can't believe they bested his men.\"...[The] Tuskegee Airmen, and images of black aviators appear in just three of the fifty three panels...[the] pilots of the 99th squadron have no dialogue and interact with neither Hop Harrigan nor his Nazi captive.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> During this time, they also used black characters in comic books as a means to invalidate the militant black groups that were fighting for equality within America. \"Spider-Man 'made it clear that militant black power was not the remedy for racial injustice'.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> \"The Falcon openly criticized black behavior stating' maybe it's important fo[sic] us to cool things down-so we can protect the rights we been fightin' for'.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> This poor portrayal and character development of black characters can be partially blamed on the fact that, during this time, \"there had rarely been a black artist or writer allowed in a major comics company\"<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nAsian characters faced some of the same treatment in comics as black characters did.

Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvi\u00e8me art'' (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, the authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\n===British comics===\n{{Main|British comics}}\n\n[[File:Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (front cover - 27 December 1884).png|thumb|upright|200px|Cover to 27 December 1884 edition of ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]''.

The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.<ref>Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), \"Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero\", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished.

Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972.

The magazine ''[[TBO (comics)|TBO]]'' was influential in popularizing the medium.

Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring. There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 199\u2013221}}</ref>\n\n==American comic books==\n{{main|American comic book}}\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M.

The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"[[small press]]\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers \u2013 such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] \u2013 had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"[[minicomic]]s\" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202055024/https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].\n\n===Graphic novels===\n[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]\n{{Main|Graphic novel}}\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],<ref>Sabin, Roger.

Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the first issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974.

(See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. Since then, other grading companies have arisen. Because condition is important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man are considered priceless.\n\n===Advertisements===\n[[Advertising in comic books|Comic book advertisement]]s were a common feature in American comic books from the 1950s to the 1980s. They were typically grouped together on the inside back cover in, displayed in black and white with an illustration of the product. As these advertisements were directed at young people, many made sensational claims and sold the products for a few dollars to be sent to a post office box.

The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunts the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.\n\n===Webtoons===\n{{Main|Webtoons}}\n\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwa]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include [[Lezhin]], [[Naver]], and [[Kakao]].\n\n===Chinese manhua===\n{{Main|Manhua}}\n\n==European comics==\n{{Main|European comics}}\n\n===Franco-Belgian comics===\n\n{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] (1926\u20131977), writer of the ''[[Ast\u00e9rix]]'' comic book series.]] \nFrance and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessin\u00e9es'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvi\u00e8me art'' (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, the authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\n===British comics===\n{{Main|British comics}}\n\n[[File:Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (front cover - 27 December 1884).png|thumb|upright|200px|Cover to 27 December 1884 edition of ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]''.

The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.<ref>Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), \"Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero\", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished.

Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the US, such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972.
