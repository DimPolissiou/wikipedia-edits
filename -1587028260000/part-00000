He conceived of a Chinese or East Asian cultural sphere distinct from cultures of the west. According to Nishijima, this cultural sphere shared the philosophy of Confucianism, the religion of Buddhism, and similar political and social structures.

It is thought to have spread from India (perhaps Northeast India) via the Silk Road through Pakistan, Xinjiang, east as well as through SEA, Vietnam, then north through Guangzhou and Fujian. From China it proliferated to Korea and Japan, especially during the Tang dynasty (see Kukai). It could have also re-spread from China south to Vietnam.

During the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. Neo-Confucianism has its origins in the [[Tang dynasty]]; the Confucianist scholar [[Han Yu]] is seen as a forebear of the Neo-Confucianists of the Song dynasty.<ref name=\"huang\">''Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods'' by Huang, Siu-chi. {{Harvnb|Huang|1999|p=5}}.</ref> The Song dynasty philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] is seen as the first true \"pioneer\" of Neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy.<ref name=\"chan\">''A Sourcebook of Chinese Philosophy'' by Chan, Wing-tsit. {{Harvnb|Chan|2002|p=460}}.</ref>\n\nElsewhere in East Asia, [[Japanese philosophy]] began to develop as indigenous [[Shinto]] beliefs fused with [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and other schools of [[Chinese philosophy]]. Similar to Japan, in [[Korean philosophy]] elements of [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] were integrated into the [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] imported from China. In Vietnam, neo-Confucianism was developed into Vietnamese own Tam gi\u00e1o as well, along with indigenous Vietnamese beliefs and [[Mahayana Buddhism]].\n\n==== Other religions ====\nThough not commonly identified with that of East Asia, the following religions have been influential in its history:\n\n# [[Hinduism]], see [[Hinduism in Vietnam]], [[Hinduism in China]]\n# Islam, see Xinjiang, [[Islam in China|Muslims in China]], [[Islam in Hong Kong]], [[Islam in Japan]], [[Islam in Korea]], [[Islam in Vietnam]].\n# Christianity, one of the most popular religions in Hong Kong, Korea etc.\n\n=== Language ===\n\n==== Historical linguistics ====\nVarious languages are thought to have originated in East Asia and have various degrees of influence on each other.

Historically, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam have used Chinese characters. Today, they are mainly used in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.\n\nMainland China and Singapore use [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]], whereas Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]].\n\nJapan uses [[kanji]] but has also invented [[kana]], believed to be inspired by the abugida scripts of southern Asia.\n\nKorea writes in [[hanja]] but has also invented an alphabetic system called [[hangul]], which were inspired by Chinese and [[\u02bcPhags-pa script|phags-pa]] during the Mongol Empire that is nowadays the majority script. However hanja is a required subject in South Korea. Names are also written in hanja. Hanja is also studied and used in academia, newspapers, and law; areas where a lot of scholarly terms and [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean loanwords]] are used and necessary to distinguish between otherwise ambiguous homonyms.\n[[File:FlowRoot3824.svg|thumb|388.991x388.991px|Development of kana from Chinese characters]]\n[[File:Map-Chinese Characters.png|thumb|Country where Han character is/was used]]\nVietnam used to write in [[History of writing in Vietnam|ch\u1eef H\u00e1n]] or [[Classical Chinese]].

Since French colonization, they have switched to using a modified version of the Latin alphabet called [[Vietnamese alphabet|ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]. However, Chinese characters still hold a special place in the cultures as their history and literature have been greatly influenced by Chinese characters. In Vietnam (and North Korea), hanzi can be seen in temples, cemeteries, and monuments today, as well as serving as decorative motifs in art and design. And there are movements to restore H\u00e1n N\u00f4m in Vietnam.

Although each of these countries developed vernacular writing systems and used them for popular literature, they continued to use Chinese for all formal writing until it was swept away by rising nationalism around the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Kornicki\">{{citation|last=Kornicki|first=P.F.|title=New Word Order: Transnational Themes in Book History|pages=65\u201379|year=2011|postscript=.|editor1-last=Chakravorty|editor1-first=Swapan|chapter=A transnational approach to East Asian book history|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bjJBrKfCKIYC&pg=PA65|publisher=Worldview Publications|isbn=978-81-920651-1-3|authorlink=Peter Kornicki|editor2-last=Gupta|editor2-first=Abhijit}}{{Harvnb|Kornicki|2011|pp=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\nThroughout East Asia, Literary Chinese was the language of administration and scholarship. Although Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature. Chinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=66\u201367}} Though they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], which provide clues to the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]]. Chinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nBooks in Literary Chinese were widely distributed. By the 7th century and possibly earlier, [[woodblock printing]] had been developed in China. At first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed. By the 13th century, metal [[movable type]] was used by government printers in Korea, but seems to have not been extensively used in China, Vietnam, or Japan. At the same time manuscript reproduction remained important until the late 19th century.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=68}}\n\n==== Mythology ====\n[[East Asian dragon]], pandas, [[Chinese zodiac]], etc.\n\n==== Textual Scholarship ====\nJapan's textual scholarship had Chinese origin which made Japan one of the birthplaces of [[Sinology]].<ref>\"Given Japan\u2019s strong tradition of Chinese textual scholarship, encouraged further by visits by eminent Chinese scholars since the early twentieth century, Japan has been one of the birthplaces of modern sinology outside China\"\n\nEarly China - A Social and Cultural History, page 11.

It is thought to have spread from India (perhaps Northeast India) via the Silk Road through Pakistan, Xinjiang, east as well as through SEA, Vietnam, then north through Guangzhou and Fujian. From China it proliferated to Korea and Japan, especially during the Tang dynasty (see Kukai). It could have also re-spread from China south to Vietnam.

During the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. Neo-Confucianism has its origins in the [[Tang dynasty]]; the Confucianist scholar [[Han Yu]] is seen as a forebear of the Neo-Confucianists of the Song dynasty.<ref name=\"huang\">''Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods'' by Huang, Siu-chi. {{Harvnb|Huang|1999|p=5}}.</ref> The Song dynasty philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] is seen as the first true \"pioneer\" of Neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy.<ref name=\"chan\">''A Sourcebook of Chinese Philosophy'' by Chan, Wing-tsit. {{Harvnb|Chan|2002|p=460}}.</ref>\n\nElsewhere in East Asia, [[Japanese philosophy]] began to develop as indigenous [[Shinto]] beliefs fused with [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and other schools of [[Chinese philosophy]]. Similar to Japan, in [[Korean philosophy]] elements of [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] were integrated into the [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] imported from China. In Vietnam, neo-Confucianism was developed into Vietnamese own Tam gi\u00e1o as well, along with indigenous Vietnamese beliefs and [[Mahayana Buddhism]].\n\n==== Other religions ====\nThough not commonly identified with that of East Asia, the following religions have been influential in its history:\n\n# [[Hinduism]], see [[Hinduism in Vietnam]], [[Hinduism in China]]\n# Islam, see Xinjiang, [[Islam in China|Muslims in China]], [[Islam in Hong Kong]], [[Islam in Japan]], [[Islam in Korea]], [[Islam in Vietnam]].\n# Christianity, one of the most popular religions in Hong Kong, Korea etc.\n\n=== Language ===\n\n==== Historical linguistics ====\nVarious languages are thought to have originated in East Asia and have various degrees of influence on each other.

Historically, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam have used Chinese characters. Today, they are mainly used in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.\n\nMainland China and Singapore use [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]], whereas Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]].\n\nJapan uses [[kanji]] but has also invented [[kana]], believed to be inspired by the abugida scripts of southern Asia.\n\nKorea writes in [[hanja]] but has also invented an alphabetic system called [[hangul]], which were inspired by Chinese and [[\u02bcPhags-pa script|phags-pa]] during the Mongol Empire that is nowadays the majority script. However hanja is a required subject in South Korea. Names are also written in hanja. Hanja is also studied and used in academia, newspapers, and law; areas where a lot of scholarly terms and [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean loanwords]] are used and necessary to distinguish between otherwise ambiguous homonyms.\n[[File:FlowRoot3824.svg|thumb|388.991x388.991px|Development of kana from Chinese characters]]\n[[File:Map-Chinese Characters.png|thumb|Country where Han character is/was used]]\nVietnam used to write in [[History of writing in Vietnam|ch\u1eef H\u00e1n]] or [[Classical Chinese]].

Since French colonization, they have switched to using a modified version of the Latin alphabet called [[Vietnamese alphabet|ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]. However, Chinese characters still hold a special place in the cultures as their history and literature have been greatly influenced by Chinese characters. In Vietnam (and North Korea), hanzi can be seen in temples, cemeteries, and monuments today, as well as serving as decorative motifs in art and design. And there are movements to restore H\u00e1n N\u00f4m in Vietnam.

Although each of these countries developed vernacular writing systems and used them for popular literature, they continued to use Chinese for all formal writing until it was swept away by rising nationalism around the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Kornicki\">{{citation|last=Kornicki|first=P.F.|title=New Word Order: Transnational Themes in Book History|pages=65\u201379|year=2011|postscript=.|editor1-last=Chakravorty|editor1-first=Swapan|chapter=A transnational approach to East Asian book history|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bjJBrKfCKIYC&pg=PA65|publisher=Worldview Publications|isbn=978-81-920651-1-3|authorlink=Peter Kornicki|editor2-last=Gupta|editor2-first=Abhijit}}{{Harvnb|Kornicki|2011|pp=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\nThroughout East Asia, Literary Chinese was the language of administration and scholarship. Although Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature. Chinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=66\u201367}} Though they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], which provide clues to the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]]. Chinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nBooks in Literary Chinese were widely distributed. By the 7th century and possibly earlier, [[woodblock printing]] had been developed in China. At first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed. By the 13th century, metal [[movable type]] was used by government printers in Korea, but seems to have not been extensively used in China, Vietnam, or Japan. At the same time manuscript reproduction remained important until the late 19th century.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=68}}\n\n==== Mythology ====\n[[East Asian dragon]], pandas, [[Chinese zodiac]], etc.\n\n==== Textual Scholarship ====\nJapan's textual scholarship had Chinese origin which made Japan one of the birthplaces of [[Sinology]].<ref>\"Given Japan\u2019s strong tradition of Chinese textual scholarship, encouraged further by visits by eminent Chinese scholars since the early twentieth century, Japan has been one of the birthplaces of modern sinology outside China\"\n\nEarly China - A Social and Cultural History, page 11.

Reischauer]] also grouped China, Korea, and Japan together into a cultural sphere that he called the ''Sinic world''. These countries are centralized states that share a Confucian ethical philosophy. Reischauer states that this culture originated in Northern China, and compared the relationship between Northern China and East Asia to that of Greco-Roman civilization and Europe. The elites of East Asia were tied together through a common written language based on Chinese characters, much in the way that [[Latin]] had functioned in Europe.<ref name=\"Reischauer\" />\n\nThe American political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]] considered the Sinic world as one of many civilizations in his book ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]''.

After attending the ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)#Humanistisches Gymnasium .28humanities-oriented.29|Humanistisches Gymnasium]]'' ([[humanities]]-oriented [[high school]]) in [[Kulmbach]], he studied [[history]] and [[German studies|German philology]], eventually taking his exams as a teacher for primary and secondary schools; however, it was during this time that he discovered his true vocation:  entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1971 on, Gottschalk worked as a freelancer for the youth program of the [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] (Bavarian Broadcasting); in 1973, he became anchor for a news program. In 1976, after a brief detour to the newspaper ''M\u00fcnchner Merkur'', he became a regular contributor at the Bayerischer Rundfunk, and subsequently gained popularity as the host of the show ''Pop nach acht''. He was awarded the ''Kurt-Magnus-Preis'' for his \"outstanding talents\" as a radio host in 1978.\n\nStarting in 1977, Gottschalk hosted the TV show ''Telespiele''. Initially broadcast on the Bayerischer Rundfunk's television channel, it switched to the national public [[ARD (TV)|ARD]] channel in 1980. In the same year, Gottschalk founded GLS United, the first [[German hip hop|German Hip Hop]] group and performed the first German rap song, \"Rapper's Deutsch\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/de/article/exzjp7/thomas-gottschalk-war-der-erste-deutsche-rapper|title=Thomas Gottschalk war der erste deutsche Rapper\u2014Auch wenn es weh tut|date=2016-08-16|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-01-19|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/song/G.L.S.-United/Rapper's-Deutsch-292739|title=G.L.S.-United \u2013 Rapper's Deutsch \u2013 hitparade.ch|last=Hung|first=Steffen|website=hitparade.ch|access-date=2018-01-19}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1982 to 1987, Gottschalk hosted the show ''Na sowas'' on [[ZDF]] and was awarded the [[Goldene Kamera]] (golden camera) for his performance on that show in 1985. During that period he also starred in several German comedies with actor [[Mike Kr\u00fcger]]. Gottschalk occasionally works as an actor until today, taking roles in the Hollywood movies ''[[Trabbi goes to Hollywood]]'' (1991) and ''[[Zookeeper (film)|Zookeeper]]'' (2011). In 1993, Gottschalk starred in ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]'' (1993) as a consequence of leading actress [[Whoopi Goldberg]] losing a bet in Gottschalk's gameshow ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]''.<ref>https://www.express.de/news/wetten--dass----thomas-gottschalk-bald-bei--sister-act--15249028</ref> He plays the sausage-obsessed German cook, Father Wolfgang.\n\nIn 1987, Gottschalk replaced [[Frank Elstner]] as host of ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'', which he continued until December 3, 2011, with only a brief interruption from 1992 to 1994 when the show was taken over by [[Wolfgang Lippert (actor)|Wolfgang Lippert]]. Reportedly, his withdrawal from the show was related to an accident that happened live on ''Wetten, dass..?'' in December 2010.

He is best known for hosting ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'', for many years Europe's biggest television show,<ref>https://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/wetten-dass-so-lief-die-letzte-ausgabe-von-wetten-dass-/11112270.html</ref><ref>https://www.presseportal.de/pm/7840/807173</ref> which he led to a huge success in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[South Tyrol]] between 1987 and 2011. Until 2015 he was also the [[testimonial]] personality in television advertisements for [[Haribo]] confectionery.\n\n==Early life==\nGottschalk was born in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Bamberg]], [[Bavaria]], as the son of a [[lawyer]]. After attending the ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)#Humanistisches Gymnasium .28humanities-oriented.29|Humanistisches Gymnasium]]'' ([[humanities]]-oriented [[high school]]) in [[Kulmbach]], he studied [[history]] and [[German studies|German philology]], eventually taking his exams as a teacher for primary and secondary schools; however, it was during this time that he discovered his true vocation:  entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1971 on, Gottschalk worked as a freelancer for the youth program of the [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] (Bavarian Broadcasting); in 1973, he became anchor for a news program. In 1976, after a brief detour to the newspaper ''M\u00fcnchner Merkur'', he became a regular contributor at the Bayerischer Rundfunk, and subsequently gained popularity as the host of the show ''Pop nach acht''. He was awarded the ''Kurt-Magnus-Preis'' for his \"outstanding talents\" as a radio host in 1978.\n\nStarting in 1977, Gottschalk hosted the TV show ''Telespiele''. Initially broadcast on the Bayerischer Rundfunk's television channel, it switched to the national public [[ARD (TV)|ARD]] channel in 1980. In the same year, Gottschalk founded GLS United, the first [[German hip hop|German Hip Hop]] group and performed the first German rap song, \"Rapper's Deutsch\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/de/article/exzjp7/thomas-gottschalk-war-der-erste-deutsche-rapper|title=Thomas Gottschalk war der erste deutsche Rapper\u2014Auch wenn es weh tut|date=2016-08-16|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-01-19|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/song/G.L.S.-United/Rapper's-Deutsch-292739|title=G.L.S.-United \u2013 Rapper's Deutsch \u2013 hitparade.ch|last=Hung|first=Steffen|website=hitparade.ch|access-date=2018-01-19}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1982 to 1987, Gottschalk hosted the show ''Na sowas'' on [[ZDF]] and was awarded the [[Goldene Kamera]] (golden camera) for his performance on that show in 1985. During that period he also starred in several German comedies with actor [[Mike Kr\u00fcger]]. Gottschalk occasionally works as an actor until today, taking roles in the Hollywood movies ''[[Trabbi goes to Hollywood]]'' (1991) and ''[[Zookeeper (film)|Zookeeper]]'' (2011). In 1993, Gottschalk starred in ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]'' (1993) as a consequence of leading actress [[Whoopi Goldberg]] losing a bet in Gottschalk's gameshow ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]''.<ref>https://www.express.de/news/wetten--dass----thomas-gottschalk-bald-bei--sister-act--15249028</ref> He plays the sausage-obsessed German cook, Father Wolfgang.\n\nIn 1987, Gottschalk replaced [[Frank Elstner]] as host of ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'', which he continued until December 3, 2011, with only a brief interruption from 1992 to 1994 when the show was taken over by [[Wolfgang Lippert (actor)|Wolfgang Lippert]]. Reportedly, his withdrawal from the show was related to an accident that happened live on ''Wetten, dass..?'' in December 2010. A contestant in the show, a young gymnast, was paralyzed from the shoulders down after being hit by a car during a stunt.\n\n[[File:2017-07-06-Cosmo - Wir wollen das Meer sehen-3485.jpg|thumb|Free [[Deniz Y\u00fccel]] campaign in Cologne, 6 July 2017]]\nFrom 1992 to 1995, Gottschalk also hosted a late night show on television, ''Gottschalk Late Night'', and while it was not very successful, it is considered a predecessor to such shows such as the ''[[Harald Schmidt]] Show'', ''[[TV Total]]'' and the ''[[Johannes B.

The full, subtitled title of the novel is '''The Shadow-Line, ''A Confession''''', which immediately alerts the reader to the retrospective nature of the novella. The ironic constructions following from the conflict between the 'young' protagonist (who is never named) and the 'old' drive much of the underlying points of the novella, namely the nature of wisdom, experience and maturity. Conrad also extensively uses irony by comparison in the work, with characters such as Captain Giles and the ship's 'factotum' Ransome used to emphasise strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist.\n\nThe novel has often been cited as a metaphor of the [[First World War]], given its timing and references to a long struggle, the importance of camaraderie, etc. This viewpoint may also be reinforced by the knowledge that Conrad's elder son, Borys, was wounded in the First World War. Others however see the novel as having a strong [[supernatural]] influence, referring to various plot-lines in the novella such as the 'ghost' of the previous captain potentially cursing the ship, and the madness of first mate Mr Burns.

It is the most powerful passenger locomotive in the Indian Railways' fleet. It is a passenger variant of the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-9|WAG 9]] freight locomotive with a modified [[gear ratio]] to pull lighter loads at higher speeds. It is capable of hauling 24 coach trains at speeds ranging {{convert|110|-|140|km/h|abbr=on}}, depending on the MPS (Maximum Permissible Speed) of the sector, and is now largely used by [[Northern Railway (India)|Northern Railways]] (NR), [[South Central Railway zone|South Central Railway]] (SCR), [[Central Railways]] (CR), [[South East Central Railway Zone]] (SECR), [[South Eastern Railway (India)|South Eastern Railways]] (SER), [[West Central Railway zone|West Central Railways]] (WCR), [[Eastern Railway zone|Eastern Railways]] (ER), [[Western Railway zone]] (WR), [[North Central Railway zone]] (NCR), [[South Western Railway zone|South Western Railway]] (SWR) etc among other zones. As of April 2020, there are 1046 locomotives in service, all of which are fitted with [[tightlock coupler]]s (for [[Buffers and chain coupler#Center-buffer-and-chain(s)|central buffer coupling]]) and chain link couplers. In February 2017, [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] built their first WAP 7 class locomotive.<ref name=\"prod_dlw\">{{cite web|title=Brief History of DLW|url=http://www.dlw.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,702|publisher=Ministry of Railways, Government of India|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nWith a maximum speed rating of {{convert|140|km/h|abbr=on}} the WAP-7 has the highest acceleration figures while hauling mail/express trains.

The locomotives have been used as a regular link for many of the [[Garib Rath Express|Garib Rath express]] and many [[Humsafar Express|Humsafar express]]<nowiki/>services and eventually extended to a significant number of [[AC Express (Indian Railways)|AC Express]] and [[Superfast/Mail Trains in India|Mail/Superfast Express]] services like [[Jaipur Superfast Express]], [[Thiruvananthapuram Mail]], [[Mangalore Mail]], [[Bangalore Mail]], [[Sewagram Express|Sewagram]] express and so on. It is soon to be the most commonly used passenger locomotive. Upgrades are underway to increase power output and maximum speed. The First High Speed version WAP-7 HS loco ( loco no 30750) was launched on 28 February 2019 capable of attaining 160 km/h with overall reduction in weight by 14 tons.\n\n[[File:WAP730333.jpg|thumb|30333 WAP-7 locomotive of RPM ([[Royapuram Railway Station|Royapuram]]) shed at [[Mysore|Mysuru]], [[Karnataka]].]]\nThe WAP-7 locomotive can deliver {{convert|6125|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} continuously, with [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] being one of its salient features.

It is capable of hauling 24 coach trains at speeds ranging {{convert|110|-|140|km/h|abbr=on}}, depending on the MPS (Maximum Permissible Speed) of the sector, and is now largely used by [[Northern Railway (India)|Northern Railways]] (NR), [[South Central Railway zone|South Central Railway]] (SCR), [[Central Railways]] (CR), [[South East Central Railway Zone]] (SECR), [[South Eastern Railway (India)|South Eastern Railways]] (SER), [[West Central Railway zone|West Central Railways]] (WCR), [[Eastern Railway zone|Eastern Railways]] (ER), [[Western Railway zone]] (WR), [[North Central Railway zone]] (NCR), [[South Western Railway zone|South Western Railway]] (SWR) etc among other zones. As of April 2020, there are 1046 locomotives in service, all of which are fitted with [[tightlock coupler]]s (for [[Buffers and chain coupler#Center-buffer-and-chain(s)|central buffer coupling]]) and chain link couplers. In February 2017, [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] built their first WAP 7 class locomotive.<ref name=\"prod_dlw\">{{cite web|title=Brief History of DLW|url=http://www.dlw.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,702|publisher=Ministry of Railways, Government of India|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nWith a maximum speed rating of {{convert|140|km/h|abbr=on}} the WAP-7 has the highest acceleration figures while hauling mail/express trains.

It is soon to be the most commonly used passenger locomotive. Upgrades are underway to increase power output and maximum speed. The First High Speed version WAP-7 HS loco ( loco no 30750) was launched on 28 February 2019 capable of attaining 160 km/h with overall reduction in weight by 14 tons.\n\n[[File:WAP730333.jpg|thumb|30333 WAP-7 locomotive of RPM ([[Royapuram Railway Station|Royapuram]]) shed at [[Mysore|Mysuru]], [[Karnataka]].]]\nThe WAP-7 locomotive can deliver {{convert|6125|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} continuously, with [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] being one of its salient features.

The film focuses on Richard and Rachel, a middle-aged married couple of New York City creatives, who are desperately trying to have a child by any means possible.\n\nThe film had its world premiere on January 18 at the [[2018 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]]. It was released on October 5, 2018, by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nRichard ([[Paul Giamatti]]) and Rachel ([[Kathryn Hahn]]) are a middle-aged couple desperately trying to have a child. After multiple failed attempts at [[artificial insemination]], they attempt [[in vitro fertilisation]]. The couple learn that Richard has a blockage that is not letting him produce sperm, forcing him to undergo a surgery that puts him $10,000 in debt to his brother Charlie and his wife Cynthia. At the same time they are also attempting to [[adoption|adopt]] a child after having previously being matched with a pregnant teenager from [[Arkansas]] who was looking to give up her child but then stopped contacting them.\n\nAfter the IVF fails, their doctor floats the idea of using a donor egg to inseminate Rachel which would raise their chances of success from 4 to 65 percent. Rachel is initially against the idea, but slowly begins to contemplate it with Richard's encouragement.\n\nMeanwhile, Cynthia's 25-year-old daughter, Sadie, decides to leave her college writing program to finish ''in absentia'' and go live with Richard and Rachel, with whom she is already very close. Rachel, who struggled with the idea of an unknown egg donor, decides that she wants to ask Sadie for her eggs. To their surprise Sadie quickly agrees, both because she loves Richard and Rachel and because she thinks the egg donation will bring meaning to her life.\n\nSadie informs her mother she will be donating her egg during Thanksgiving, much to her mother's displeasure. Despite the fact that Richard and Rachel tell Cynthia they will not go through with the donation without her consent, they decide to go through with pre-screening.\n\nRichard, Rachel and Sadie happily go through the egg donor treatments together, but Sadie is told at an appointment that she is not developing eggs quickly enough. Determined not to let Richard and Rachel down, she increases her drug dosage on her own. The egg retrieval is a success, but Sadie becomes ill. Richard and Rachel take her to the hospital, where they learn of the increased dosage. Sadie moves out of their apartment.\n\nRichard and Rachel go through with the implantation but it is a failure. While Rachel is devastated, Richard admits to being relieved that they are finally done with trying as their marriage and intimacy have suffered.\n\nSometime later they drop Sadie off at the [[Yaddo]] colony, where she will take up a residency as a writer. She thanks Rachel for her help getting in and Rachel informs her she did nothing to aid her application and that Sadie did it all on her own.\n\nNine months later Richard and Rachel are celebrating Halloween when they receive a call from another woman looking at them as potential parents to adopt her child. They drive to an Applebee's where they wait to meet the woman. Richard moves from his usual opposite seat to sit next to Rachel and hold her hand, waiting together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Rachel Biegler\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Richard Grimes\n*

Despite the fact that Richard and Rachel tell Cynthia they will not go through with the donation without her consent, they decide to go through with pre-screening.\n\nRichard, Rachel and Sadie happily go through the egg donor treatments together, but Sadie is told at an appointment that she is not developing eggs quickly enough. Determined not to let Richard and Rachel down, she increases her drug dosage on her own. The egg retrieval is a success, but Sadie becomes ill. Richard and Rachel take her to the hospital, where they learn of the increased dosage. Sadie moves out of their apartment.\n\nRichard and Rachel go through with the implantation but it is a failure. While Rachel is devastated, Richard admits to being relieved that they are finally done with trying as their marriage and intimacy have suffered.\n\nSometime later they drop Sadie off at the [[Yaddo]] colony, where she will take up a residency as a writer. She thanks Rachel for her help getting in and Rachel informs her she did nothing to aid her application and that Sadie did it all on her own.\n\nNine months later Richard and Rachel are celebrating Halloween when they receive a call from another woman looking at them as potential parents to adopt her child. They drive to an Applebee's where they wait to meet the woman. Richard moves from his usual opposite seat to sit next to Rachel and hold her hand, waiting together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Rachel Biegler\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Richard Grimes\n*

Both Jiya and Arsal are against the marriage as the nikaah was done as per the wishes of their dying grandfather without taking their consent. Jiya dreams of joining London School of Economics for higher studies after her BBA. Bi Jaan ([[Samina Ahmad]]), the head of family is Arsal and Jiya's grandmother. She has two sons Jamshed Ali ([[Farhan Ali Agha]]) and Nazakat Ali ([[Sohail Sameer]]) and a daughter Masooma ([[Tara Mahmood]]) who is married to Jalal Khan ([[Adnan Shah Tipu]]). They live in [[Peshawar]]. \nJamshed Ali is married to Shahana ([[Nadia Afgan]]) and Nazakat Ali to Naeema ([[Farah Shah]]).\nJiya has a younger brother Daniyal Nazakat Ali (DJ) who has his reporting system. He is always on sting operations making videos of family members and breaking news.\n\nArsal and Jiya being cousins are childhood companions. They play pranks on each other. The undesired nikah has put them in a war like situation.\n\nThe only daughter of family Masooma with her husband Jalal and their daughter Kinza arrives to fix the date of marriage. Arsal and Jiya do not want to marry as they have personality clash, but are forced by their family to honour the wishes of dying grandfather. Jiya and Arsal are constantly scheming as they plan to stop the wedding. Jiya, Arsal and their cousin (Masooma and Jalal's daughter) has a secret crush on Arsal and wants to stop the wedding too thus she helps Arsal and Jiya in cancelling the wedding by creating problems and rifts among the family members. Shah Jahan (brother-in-law of Bi Jaan) and his grandson Shehryar ([[Nabeel Zuberi]]) who are settled in London visit Pakistan for Arsal and Jiya's marriage function which is planned to happen after Eid. They were invited by Jiya unknowingly to Bi Jaan against her will. Bi Jaan dislikes Shah Jahan (Agha Jaan), her late husband's brother as he made her to marry his brother in extenuating circumstances, while she liked him. Sherry is close to his cousins and a co-conspirator in their plots to stop marriage. Sherry asks both Arsal and Jiya to sort out their problem amicably. Sherry also helps Jiya to fulfill her dream of joining the London School of Economics and they plan to study together. Sherry eventually develops feelings for Jiya which makes Arsal jealous. Meanwhile Bi Jaan's niece (sister's daughter), Arbela ([[Mizna Waqas]]) (Billo) arrives to attend the wedding. Billo was supposed to marry Jamshed, Arsal's father but Jamshed chose to marry Shahana instead. Shahana gets jealous with Jamshed and Billo's growing closeness and angrily leaves the house. Kinza and Arsal too come to live with her. Jiya's parents Naema and Nazakat cancel the wedding due to misunderstanding and rift caused by the actions of Arsal and Jiya. Jamshed Ali stages a false heart attack drama to bring her wife back. Later in the show Shahana also cancels the wedding and wants Arsal to marry Kinza. Plots and sub-plots are executed by Masooma and Shahana. Kinza is happy about these turn of events. Jiya and Arsal are finally happy that they are no longer getting married. But, seeing their parents at loggerheads, they bond together as crime masters. Meanwhile, Jiya finally gets a scholarship to LSE (London School of Economics). As their parents are against each other Jiya and Arsal are forbidden  to talk to each other. They are even having separate Iftari on the same dining table by partitioning the table. As Jiya and Arsal get closer to each other for making schemes, Arsal while talking to Kinza and Sherry realises he loves Jiya. He starts talking about Jiya around Sherry (Shehriyar) and Kinza. Both Sherry and Kinza get jealous, so Kinza gets tired of hearing Jiya's name whenever Arsal and Kinza are talking and wants to drop their wedding proposal as well.\n\nJiya's and Arsal's parents want Arsal to give divorce to Jiya but he is not happy about it. He has started developing strong feelings towards Jiya. Jiya's father however sends her to a lawyer to file for [[khula]]. Seeing this, Arsal confesses his love for Jiya but she rejects him and tells him that he is only jealous of the fact that Jiya wants to go abroad for higher studies. Arsal denies this and says that he will not divorce her and help her to continue her studies. Meanwhile, Arsal receives a notice from the court which infuriates him and he tells Jiya that he would not lose hope even if she has filed a case in court. Sherry says that Arsal and Jiya should resolve this matter by mutual discussions and so he convinces Jiya to meet Arsal at Iftar. The three go to an eatery for Iftar and there Arsal asks Jiya to try and understand his feelings but she says that she is more than sure that Arsal has not fallen in love with her. She asks him to give it a second thought, but he replies that he has thought it over many times and he knows that he has actually fallen in love with her. Jiya says that even if he has she can do nothing about it and she is sorry for that. On their way back home, thieves attack them causing Sherry to run away abandoning the two. They try to kidnap Jiya but Arsal fights with them and protects her and as a consequence they shoot Arsal in the arm. Sherry gets back to the house and tells everyone what happened. Meanwhile Jiya takes Arsal to the hospital and the doctor tells them everything is okay and that the bullet only brushed his arm. Later Jiya realizes her mistake says sorry to Arsal and he accepts it. Meanwhile Kinza is noticing Jiya and Arsal are getting close again, after their fight has stopped. She accepts Sherry's offer to help teach her everything about life. It starts mutual liking between them.\n\nThe shooting incident and Arsal risking his life for her develops soft corner for Arsal in Jiya's heart. At first she is confused about her feelings for Arsal but soon expresses her love towards Arsal to her close friend and confidante Huma. At the same time Arsal who is desperate to know what is in Jiya's mind asks DJ to make a video of conversation of Jiya and Huma.Jiya is unable to convey her feelings to her parents, however accepts the same in front of Bi Jaan and seeks her guidance. Bi Jaan asks Arsal to take her to the lawyer and withdraw the divorce proceeding, which Jiya does without informing her parents. Meanwhile, Arsal gets his hands on the video and gets to know about Jiya's feelings. He is elated to know that and thanks God. Jiya also starts acting a little strange in front of Arsal and he being aware of her feelings, tries to extract a confession out of her. In the meanwhile Naeema's friend Aaliyyh visits Jiya's house with regard to the marriage of Jiya to her son, which Arsal stops by showing them the invitation card of their wedding.\n\nLater the family comes to know about the fact that Arsal and Jiya have fallen in love. But their parents are still against this and Nazakat asks Jiya that she has to chose between her parents and her husband (Arsal). Bi Jaan gets to know about this, she hatches a plan and asks Nazakat and Jamshed if they want the divorce of their children or their mother. She gives them ultimatum to leave the house of their father if they can't honour his last wish. Bi Jaan calls an estate agent to see the house, Meanwhile Shahanas cousin and ex-fiance Joji (Jawad) ([[Ali Safina]]) visits the family where he meets Billo and start flirting with her, at this Jalal becomes jealous who was also flirting with her. Shahana has a private talk with Joji about their engagement that she thought was false as it happened in childhood. At same moment DJ makes their video and shows to Jamshed. Nazakat asks Jiya in presence of whole family to sign on the divorce papers and instead she writes \"I love my husband\" on stamp papers. Nazakat gets shocked while Arsal is very happy.\n\nSo family decides to go forward with the marriage of Arsal and Jiya as planned, by reconciling their differences. Preparations for Jiya and Arsal's wedding are going on meanwhile Agha Jaan asks Jalal the hand of  Kinza for Sherry. Kinza's parents agree. Arsal and Jiya are meeting privately which is disliked by Bi Jaan, she asks Jiya to stay away from Arsal till the wedding day which is to be held after EID.\n\nShahana became aware through Billo, of Jamshed's fake heart attack drama and creates a scene but Jiya and Arsal handle it as they tell Shahana that it has increased her face value among female members of the family. Shahana says sorry to Jiya as she has scolded Jiya so much. Arsal also begs forgiveness from Jiya's father for getting hyper during certain times. Bi Jaan asks Joji to call his mother for Billo's marriage proposal to which he happily agrees. Arsal gifts Jiya dress for [[Mehndi]] and sangeet function and asks her to wear it. The family celebrates Eid the next day. Arsal and Jiya meet secretly and exchange Eid greetings. The next day [[Mehndi]] ceremony takes place.

Both Jiya and Arsal are against the marriage as the nikaah was done as per the wishes of their dying grandfather without taking their consent. Jiya dreams of joining London School of Economics for higher studies after her BBA. Bi Jaan ([[Samina Ahmad]]), the head of family is Arsal and Jiya's grandmother. She has two sons Jamshed Ali ([[Farhan Ali Agha]]) and Nazakat Ali ([[Sohail Sameer]]) and a daughter Masooma ([[Tara Mahmood]]) who is married to Jalal Khan ([[Adnan Shah Tipu]]). They live in [[Peshawar]]. \nJamshed Ali is married to Shahana ([[Nadia Afgan]]) and Nazakat Ali to Naeema ([[Farah Shah]]).\nJiya has a younger brother Daniyal Nazakat Ali (DJ) who has his reporting system. He is always on sting operations making videos of family members and breaking news.\n\nArsal and Jiya being cousins are childhood companions. They play pranks on each other. The undesired nikah has put them in a war like situation.\n\nThe only daughter of family Masooma with her husband Jalal and their daughter Kinza arrives to fix the date of marriage. Arsal and Jiya do not want to marry as they have personality clash, but are forced by their family to honour the wishes of dying grandfather. Jiya and Arsal are constantly scheming as they plan to stop the wedding. Jiya, Arsal and their cousin (Masooma and Jalal's daughter) has a secret crush on Arsal and wants to stop the wedding too thus she helps Arsal and Jiya in cancelling the wedding by creating problems and rifts among the family members. Shah Jahan (brother-in-law of Bi Jaan) and his grandson Shehryar ([[Nabeel Zuberi]]) who are settled in London visit Pakistan for Arsal and Jiya's marriage function which is planned to happen after Eid. They were invited by Jiya unknowingly to Bi Jaan against her will. Bi Jaan dislikes Shah Jahan (Agha Jaan), her late husband's brother as he made her to marry his brother in extenuating circumstances, while she liked him. Sherry is close to his cousins and a co-conspirator in their plots to stop marriage. Sherry asks both Arsal and Jiya to sort out their problem amicably. Sherry also helps Jiya to fulfill her dream of joining the London School of Economics and they plan to study together. Sherry eventually develops feelings for Jiya which makes Arsal jealous. Meanwhile Bi Jaan's niece (sister's daughter), Arbela ([[Mizna Waqas]]) (Billo) arrives to attend the wedding. Billo was supposed to marry Jamshed, Arsal's father but Jamshed chose to marry Shahana instead. Shahana gets jealous with Jamshed and Billo's growing closeness and angrily leaves the house. Kinza and Arsal too come to live with her. Jiya's parents Naema and Nazakat cancel the wedding due to misunderstanding and rift caused by the actions of Arsal and Jiya. Jamshed Ali stages a false heart attack drama to bring her wife back. Later in the show Shahana also cancels the wedding and wants Arsal to marry Kinza. Plots and sub-plots are executed by Masooma and Shahana. Kinza is happy about these turn of events. Jiya and Arsal are finally happy that they are no longer getting married. But, seeing their parents at loggerheads, they bond together as crime masters. Meanwhile, Jiya finally gets a scholarship to LSE (London School of Economics). As their parents are against each other Jiya and Arsal are forbidden  to talk to each other. They are even having separate Iftari on the same dining table by partitioning the table. As Jiya and Arsal get closer to each other for making schemes, Arsal while talking to Kinza and Sherry realises he loves Jiya. He starts talking about Jiya around Sherry (Shehriyar) and Kinza. Both Sherry and Kinza get jealous, so Kinza gets tired of hearing Jiya's name whenever Arsal and Kinza are talking and wants to drop their wedding proposal as well.\n\nJiya's and Arsal's parents want Arsal to give divorce to Jiya but he is not happy about it. He has started developing strong feelings towards Jiya. Jiya's father however sends her to a lawyer to file for [[khula]]. Seeing this, Arsal confesses his love for Jiya but she rejects him and tells him that he is only jealous of the fact that Jiya wants to go abroad for higher studies. Arsal denies this and says that he will not divorce her and help her to continue her studies. Meanwhile, Arsal receives a notice from the court which infuriates him and he tells Jiya that he would not lose hope even if she has filed a case in court. Sherry says that Arsal and Jiya should resolve this matter by mutual discussions and so he convinces Jiya to meet Arsal at Iftar. The three go to an eatery for Iftar and there Arsal asks Jiya to try and understand his feelings but she says that she is more than sure that Arsal has not fallen in love with her. She asks him to give it a second thought, but he replies that he has thought it over many times and he knows that he has actually fallen in love with her. Jiya says that even if he has she can do nothing about it and she is sorry for that. On their way back home, thieves attack them causing Sherry to run away abandoning the two. They try to kidnap Jiya but Arsal fights with them and protects her and as a consequence they shoot Arsal in the arm. Sherry gets back to the house and tells everyone what happened. Meanwhile Jiya takes Arsal to the hospital and the doctor tells them everything is okay and that the bullet only brushed his arm. Later Jiya realizes her mistake says sorry to Arsal and he accepts it. Meanwhile Kinza is noticing Jiya and Arsal are getting close again, after their fight has stopped. She accepts Sherry's offer to help teach her everything about life. It starts mutual liking between them.\n\nThe shooting incident and Arsal risking his life for her develops soft corner for Arsal in Jiya's heart. At first she is confused about her feelings for Arsal but soon expresses her love towards Arsal to her close friend and confidante Huma. At the same time Arsal who is desperate to know what is in Jiya's mind asks DJ to make a video of conversation of Jiya and Huma.Jiya is unable to convey her feelings to her parents, however accepts the same in front of Bi Jaan and seeks her guidance. Bi Jaan asks Arsal to take her to the lawyer and withdraw the divorce proceeding, which Jiya does without informing her parents. Meanwhile, Arsal gets his hands on the video and gets to know about Jiya's feelings. He is elated to know that and thanks God. Jiya also starts acting a little strange in front of Arsal and he being aware of her feelings, tries to extract a confession out of her. In the meanwhile Naeema's friend Aaliyyh visits Jiya's house with regard to the marriage of Jiya to her son, which Arsal stops by showing them the invitation card of their wedding.\n\nLater the family comes to know about the fact that Arsal and Jiya have fallen in love. But their parents are still against this and Nazakat asks Jiya that she has to chose between her parents and her husband (Arsal). Bi Jaan gets to know about this, she hatches a plan and asks Nazakat and Jamshed if they want the divorce of their children or their mother. She gives them ultimatum to leave the house of their father if they can't honour his last wish. Bi Jaan calls an estate agent to see the house, Meanwhile Shahanas cousin and ex-fiance Joji (Jawad) ([[Ali Safina]]) visits the family where he meets Billo and start flirting with her, at this Jalal becomes jealous who was also flirting with her. Shahana has a private talk with Joji about their engagement that she thought was false as it happened in childhood. At same moment DJ makes their video and shows to Jamshed. Nazakat asks Jiya in presence of whole family to sign on the divorce papers and instead she writes \"I love my husband\" on stamp papers. Nazakat gets shocked while Arsal is very happy.\n\nSo family decides to go forward with the marriage of Arsal and Jiya as planned, by reconciling their differences. Preparations for Jiya and Arsal's wedding are going on meanwhile Agha Jaan asks Jalal the hand of  Kinza for Sherry. Kinza's parents agree. Arsal and Jiya are meeting privately which is disliked by Bi Jaan, she asks Jiya to stay away from Arsal till the wedding day which is to be held after EID.\n\nShahana became aware through Billo, of Jamshed's fake heart attack drama and creates a scene but Jiya and Arsal handle it as they tell Shahana that it has increased her face value among female members of the family. Shahana says sorry to Jiya as she has scolded Jiya so much. Arsal also begs forgiveness from Jiya's father for getting hyper during certain times. Bi Jaan asks Joji to call his mother for Billo's marriage proposal to which he happily agrees. Arsal gifts Jiya dress for [[Mehndi]] and sangeet function and asks her to wear it. The family celebrates Eid the next day. Arsal and Jiya meet secretly and exchange Eid greetings. The next day [[Mehndi]] ceremony takes place. At wedding ceremony Arsal and Jiya began to fight again but on insistence of family patch up saying sorry to each other. At the time of [[Marriage in Pakistan#Regional variations|Doodh Pilai]] ceremony whole family gathers to cheer the bride and groom. In the backdrop of ceremony Sherry is teasing Kinza and she proposes to Sherry for marriage which delightfully surprises Sherry and both accept each other.\n\nOn their wedding night Jia and Arsal fight again but later realize their folly and say sorry to each other and promise not to repeat the same mistakes. The drama ends with Arsal and Jiya confessing their love for each other.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name !! Role !!
