In 1878, [[Samuel Langley]], [[Henry Draper]], and other American scientists needed a highly sensitive instrument that could be used to measure minute temperature changes in heat emitted from the Sun's [[solar corona|corona]] during the [[Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878|July 29 solar eclipse]], due to occur along the [[Rocky Mountains]]. To satisfy those needs Edison devised a ''microtasimeter'' employing a [[carbon]] button.<ref name=PMM>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_14/December_1878/Edison%27s_Telephonic_and_Acoustic_Inventions?uselang=en-gb |title=Popular Science Monthly, Volume 14, December 1878|access-date=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Description of operation==\nThe value of the instrument lies in its ability to detect small variations of temperature. This is accomplished indirectly. The change of temperature causes expansion or contraction of a rod of [[vulcanite]], which changes the resistance of an electric circuit by varying the pressure it exerts upon a carbon-button included in the circuit. During the total eclipse of the sun in 1878, it successfully demonstrated the existence of heat in the corona. It is also of service in ascertaining the relative expansion of substances due to a rise of temperature.<ref name=PMM />\n\nThe functional parts are represented in the partial cross section, which shows its construction and mode of operation. The substance whose expansion is to be measured is shown at ''A''. It is firmly clamped at ''B'', its lower end fitting into a slot in the metal\nplate, ''M'', which rests upon the carbon-button. The latter is in an electric circuit, which includes also a delicate [[galvanometer]]. Any variation in the length of the rod changes the pressure upon the carbon, and alters the resistance of the circuit. This causes a deflection of the galvanometer-needle\u2014a movement in one direction denoting expansion of ''A'', while an opposite motion signifies contraction.

In 1878, [[Samuel Langley]], [[Henry Draper]], and other American scientists needed a highly sensitive instrument that could be used to measure minute temperature changes in heat emitted from the Sun's [[corona]] during the [[Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878|July 29 solar eclipse]], due to occur along the [[Rocky Mountains]]. To satisfy those needs Edison devised a ''microtasimeter'' employing a [[carbon]] button.<ref name=PMM>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_14/December_1878/Edison%27s_Telephonic_and_Acoustic_Inventions?uselang=en-gb |title=Popular Science Monthly, Volume 14, December 1878|access-date=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Description of operation==\nThe value of the instrument lies in its ability to detect small variations of temperature. This is accomplished indirectly. The change of temperature causes expansion or contraction of a rod of [[vulcanite]], which changes the resistance of an electric circuit by varying the pressure it exerts upon a carbon-button included in the circuit. During the total eclipse of the sun in 1878, it successfully demonstrated the existence of heat in the corona. It is also of service in ascertaining the relative expansion of substances due to a rise of temperature.<ref name=PMM />\n\nThe functional parts are represented in the partial cross section, which shows its construction and mode of operation. The substance whose expansion is to be measured is shown at ''A''. It is firmly clamped at ''B'', its lower end fitting into a slot in the metal\nplate, ''M'', which rests upon the carbon-button. The latter is in an electric circuit, which includes also a delicate [[galvanometer]]. Any variation in the length of the rod changes the pressure upon the carbon, and alters the resistance of the circuit. This causes a deflection of the galvanometer-needle\u2014a movement in one direction denoting expansion of ''A'', while an opposite motion signifies contraction. To avoid any deflection which might arise from change in strength of battery, the tasimeter is inserted in an arm of a [[Wheatstone bridge]].<ref name=PMM />\n\nIn order to ascertain the exact amount of expansion in decimals of an inch, the screw ''S'', seen in front of the dial, is turned until the deflection previously caused by the change of temperature is reproduced. The screw works a second screw, causing the rod to ascend or descend, and the exact distance through which the rod moves is indicated by the needle, ''N'', on the dial.<ref name=PMM />\n\nThe instrument can also be advantageously used to measure changes in the humidity of the atmosphere.

Numerous tornadoes touched down across several states, including Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas. Most of those tornadoes were weak, but a few of them caused considerable damage. A long-tracked wedge tornado caused EF2 damage in rural portions of Texas and Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tornado Outbreak of April 25\u201327, 2011 |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/shv/events/select.php?date=04262011_1 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |work=National Weather Service in Shreveport, Louisiana |accessdate=July 11, 2011 |date=April 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205221/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/shv/events/select.php?date=04262011_1 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> An EF3 tornado destroyed structures and caused severe damage at [[Fort Campbell, Kentucky]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=NCDC Storm Events Database|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=290471|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=May 9, 2011|year=2011}}</ref> A total of 55 tornadoes were confirmed the 26th, although no fatalities occurred.\n\n===April 27===\nSignificant severe weather was ongoing early on April 27 (in the overnight hours) and continued for the entire calendar day virtually unbroken. For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a high risk of severe weather for the Southern United States. Later that morning, the SPC even increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from [[Meridian, Mississippi]], to [[Huntsville, Alabama]], an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions became increasingly favorable for tornadoes during such an extreme tornado outbreak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2011/day1otlk_20110427_1630.html |title=April 27, 2011 1630 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Morning squall lines====\nDuring the early morning hours, a cold front with several embedded low pressure areas extended from east [[Texas]] northeastward into the [[Ohio River Valley]]. An upper-level disturbance that had moved across the frontal boundary the previous evening sparked an area of thunderstorms that morphed into a [[squall line]]. This line of severe thunderstorms would produce tornadic activity from the evening on April 26 into the late morning of April 27. Early in the morning the squall line, packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]] before proceeding to affect [[North Alabama|North]] and [[Central Alabama]] and parts of [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]] and [[East Tennessee]]. The line strengthened as it moved through [[Alabama]], partially due to a high amount of low-level moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and increasing [[wind shear]].\n\nA majority of the tornadoes embedded in this initial squall line were weak, though several were strong and as such caused significant damage. An EF3 tornado caused major damage to homes in [[Coaling, Alabama]], an EF2 and an EF3 tornado produced severe damage and a fatality near [[Eupora, Mississippi]]. Another EF3 tornado resulted in heavy damage in downtown [[Cordova, Alabama]], which was struck by a violent EF4 tornado later that afternoon. One embedded cell that began in [[Cullman County, Alabama]] produced a long-tracked EF2 tornado that struck the town of [[Hanceville, Alabama|Hanceville]], killing one person. That cell would then produce over ten tornadoes (most rated EF1) to the northeast in [[Marshall County, Alabama|Marshall County]] and another EF1 tornado in [[Dade County, Georgia]]. The initial storms caused widespread [[power line|power]] and [[telephone line]] outages across Alabama and Tennessee. This line of storms also caused some [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[NOAA Weather Radio|weather radio]] transmitter sites to stop functioning for the remainder of the outbreak. Because of this, more than one million customers were without power and had no warning of any approaching tornadoes later that day.<ref name=\"April 27 Conditions HUN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hun/?n=hunsur2011-04-27_setup|title=April 27th 2011 Severe Weather Setup|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|work=National Weather Service in Huntsville, Alabama|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom the late morning to the early afternoon, another squall line moved through northern parts of Mississippi and Alabama as high wind shear and low-level moisture persisted. However, this time several discrete [[supercell]]s developed along and in front of the line, spawning seven weak tornadoes across [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan]], [[Limestone County, Alabama|Limestone]], and [[Madison County, Alabama|Madison]] Counties in northern Alabama around noon that day.<ref name=\"April 27 Conditions HUN\"/>\n\n====Afternoon supercells====\n[[File:Philadelphia, MS ground scouring.jpg|thumb|Extremely deep ground scouring near [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]] caused by a fast-moving EF5 tornado that killed three people.]]\nThe most intense supercells of the outbreak developed around midday in central Mississippi and began tracking eastward. During the early afternoon, as wind shear and low-level moisture continued to dramatically increase, a [[tornado emergency]] was declared for [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]], as a large tornado was reported on the ground by both storm spotters and a camera atop a television tower from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WTOK-TV]] (channel 11) in [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. This powerful EF5 tornado caused incredible damage northeast of [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], where pavement was torn off from roads, vehicles were thrown, and the ground was scoured out to a depth of {{convert|2|ft|m}} by the tornado. Three people died when a mobile home was thrown {{convert|300|yd|m|}} into a wooded area, obliterating it in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jan/?n=2011_04_25_27_neshoba_kemper_winston_noxubee|title=Neshoba/Kemper/Winston/Noxubee Counties Tornado|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|work=National Weather Service in Jackson, Mississippi|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=September 8, 2011}}</ref> Another very long-tracked EF4 tornado passed near the town of [[Enterprise, Clarke County, Mississippi|Enterprise, Mississippi]], killing seven people before crossing into Alabama and eventually dissipating. Responding to the high risk issued by the SPC and the already unstable atmosphere expected to become even more unstable throughout the afternoon hours, a [[Particularly Dangerous Situation|PDS]] [[tornado watch]] was issued at 1:45&nbsp;p.m. CDT (1845 UTC) for much of Alabama and portions of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Georgia. A widespread complex of supercell storms overspread the states of Mississippi and Alabama and violent tornadoes began rapidly touching down as the evening progressed.<ref name=\"April 27 Conditions HUN\"/> Four tornadoes were officially rated EF5 on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]] that day. One of those EF5 tornadoes struck the town of [[Smithville, Mississippi]], where many well-built brick homes were reduced to bare slabs, numerous hardwood trees were completely debarked, and an SUV was hurled half a mile into the top of the town's water tower, subsequently leaving behind a visible dent. Another long-tracked EF5 wedge tornado passed through rural portions of Alabama and Tennessee, becoming the deadliest tornado of the outbreak as it completely devastated the towns of [[Hackleburg, Alabama|Hackleburg]], [[Phil Campbell, Alabama|Phil Campbell]], [[Mount Hope, Lawrence County, Alabama|Mount Hope]], [[Tanner, Alabama|Tanner]], and [[Harvest, Alabama|Harvest]], killing 72 people. This marks only the second day in history (after [[1974 Super Outbreak|April 3, 1974]]) that there were more than two F5/EF5 tornadoes reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/f5torns.html|title=F5 and EF5 Tornadoes of the United States|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe tornadoes continued tracking through central Alabama that afternoon and into the early evening hours. A dangerous and destructive tornado struck the city of [[Cullman, Alabama]] at around 3:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT (2000 UTC). This large, multiple-vortex tornado was captured on several tower cameras from [[television station]]s, such as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WBRC]] (channel 6) and ABC affiliate [[WBMA-LD]]/[[WSES|WCFT-TV]]/[[WGWW|WJSU-TV]] (channels 58, 33, and 40) both out of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].

Two violent EF4 tornadoes also ripped through [[Jackson County, Alabama]], one of which caused a fatality near [[Bridgeport, Alabama|Bridgeport]] while the other passed near [[Pisgah, Alabama|Pisgah]] and into Georgia where it caused major damage in [[Trenton, Georgia|Trenton]] and killed 14 people. At around 5:10&nbsp;p.m. CDT (2210 UTC), a very large and exceptionally destructive tornado struck [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] and about 40 minutes later, that same tornado struck the northern suburbs of nearby Birmingham.<ref name=\"massive\"/> A tornado emergency was issued for both cities, along with many other cities that day. Many local television stations, including WBRC and WBMA-LD/WCFT/WJSU, as well as [[CBS]] affiliate [[WIAT]] (channel 42), broadcast live footage of this long-tracked tornado in both Tuscaloosa and Birmingham.

The supercell that produced the Tuscaloosa/Birmingham EF4 tornado originated in [[Newton County, Mississippi]]. The supercell also produced an EF4 tornado later that evening that killed 22 people and struck the [[Ohatchee, Alabama]] area and eventually crossed into Georgia, causing additional damage near [[Cave Spring, Georgia|Cave Spring]] before dissipating. Further to the south, a mile-wide EF3 tornado killed 7 people in mostly rural areas and caused major damage in the small town of [[Eoline, Alabama|Eoline]]. The final EF5 tornado of the day caused remarkable damage in and around the town of [[Rainsville, Alabama]], killing 25 people before crossing into Georgia and dissipating. Tornadoes continued touching down further to the northeast as the sun set, particularly in Georgia. This included a long-tracked EF4 tornado that caused major damage in [[Ringgold, Georgia]], [[Apison, Tennessee]], and [[Cleveland, Tennessee]], killing 20 people along the path. After dark, violent tornadoes continued to touch down, and a nighttime EF4 tornado destroyed many lakeside homes at [[Lake Martin]] in eastern Alabama, killing seven people.

The tornado then moved back into Tuscaloosa County, causing mostly minor tree and structural damage at EF1 strength before rapidly intensifying and crossing into Fayette County once again. There, it completely destroyed at least one mobile home, with the frame being separated and the remaining debris being thrown a considerable distance. The tornado appeared to strengthen even further and several mobile homes were completely obliterated with debris thrown a considerable distance and frames twisted and thrown. Damage was rated EF3 in this area. Many trees were downed as well before the tornado moved into [[Walker County, Alabama|Walker County]]. It then weakened to EF1 strength and caused mostly minor damage to trees and mobile homes.

One of the surface lows tracked northeast along the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Wisconsin]] as it occluded. Tornado watches were issued for the Lower Great Lakes during the afternoon hours as supercell thunderstorms developed along the warm front lifting north across central [[Michigan]]. Two tornadoes touched down in Michigan and caused damage to farm structures. Further east, severe thunderstorms caused scattered wind damage and large hail across Pennsylvania and New York.

As the low formed across Texas and deepened while moving east, a tightening pressure gradient force further strengthened the low-level jet, therefore creating a broad warm sector across the southeastern states. This also generated stronger wind shear, providing better organization for the supercell storms as a result. Numerous tornadoes touched down across several states, including Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas. Most of those tornadoes were weak, but a few of them caused considerable damage.

For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a high risk of severe weather for the Southern United States. Later that morning, the SPC even increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from [[Meridian, Mississippi]], to [[Huntsville, Alabama]], an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions became increasingly favorable for tornadoes during such an extreme tornado outbreak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2011/day1otlk_20110427_1630.html |title=April 27, 2011 1630 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Morning squall lines====\nDuring the early morning hours, a cold front with several embedded low pressure areas extended from east [[Texas]] northeastward into the [[Ohio River Valley]]. An upper-level disturbance that had moved across the frontal boundary the previous evening sparked an area of thunderstorms that morphed into a [[squall line]]. This line of severe thunderstorms would produce tornadic activity from the evening on April 26 into the late morning of April 27. Early in the morning the squall line, packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]] before proceeding to affect [[North Alabama|North]] and [[Central Alabama]] and parts of [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]] and [[East Tennessee]]. The line strengthened as it moved through [[Alabama]], partially due to a high amount of low-level moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and increasing [[wind shear]].\n\nA majority of the tornadoes embedded in this initial squall line were weak, though several were strong and as such caused significant damage. An EF3 tornado caused major damage to homes in [[Coaling, Alabama]], an EF2 and an EF3 tornado produced severe damage and a fatality near [[Eupora, Mississippi]]. Another EF3 tornado resulted in heavy damage in downtown [[Cordova, Alabama]], which was struck by a violent EF4 tornado later that afternoon. One embedded cell that began in [[Cullman County, Alabama]] produced a long-tracked EF2 tornado that struck the town of [[Hanceville, Alabama|Hanceville]], killing one person. That cell would then produce over ten tornadoes (most rated EF1) to the northeast in [[Marshall County, Alabama|Marshall County]] and another EF1 tornado in [[Dade County, Georgia]]. The initial storms caused widespread [[power line|power]] and [[telephone line]] outages across Alabama and Tennessee. This line of storms also caused some [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[NOAA Weather Radio|weather radio]] transmitter sites to stop functioning for the remainder of the outbreak. Because of this, more than one million customers were without power and had no warning of any approaching tornadoes later that day.<ref name=\"April 27 Conditions HUN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hun/?n=hunsur2011-04-27_setup|title=April 27th 2011 Severe Weather Setup|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|work=National Weather Service in Huntsville, Alabama|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom the late morning to the early afternoon, another squall line moved through northern parts of Mississippi and Alabama as high wind shear and low-level moisture persisted. However, this time several discrete [[supercell]]s developed along and in front of the line, spawning seven weak tornadoes across [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan]], [[Limestone County, Alabama|Limestone]], and [[Madison County, Alabama|Madison]] Counties in northern Alabama around noon that day.<ref name=\"April 27 Conditions HUN\"/>\n\n====Afternoon supercells====\n[[File:Philadelphia, MS ground scouring.jpg|thumb|Extremely deep ground scouring near [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]] caused by a fast-moving EF5 tornado that killed three people.]]\nThe most intense supercells of the outbreak developed around midday in central Mississippi and began tracking eastward. During the early afternoon, as wind shear and low-level moisture continued to dramatically increase, a [[tornado emergency]] was declared for [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]], as a large tornado was reported on the ground by both storm spotters and a camera atop a television tower from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WTOK-TV]] (channel 11) in [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. This powerful EF5 tornado caused incredible damage northeast of [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], where pavement was torn off from roads, vehicles were thrown, and the ground was scoured out to a depth of {{convert|2|ft|m}} by the tornado.

Responding to the high risk issued by the SPC and the already unstable atmosphere expected to become even more unstable throughout the afternoon hours, a [[Particularly Dangerous Situation|PDS]] [[tornado watch]] was issued at 1:45&nbsp;p.m. CDT (1845 UTC) for much of Alabama and portions of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Georgia. A widespread complex of supercell storms overspread the states of Mississippi and Alabama and violent tornadoes began rapidly touching down as the evening progressed.<ref name=\"April 27 Conditions HUN\"/> Four tornadoes were officially rated EF5 on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]] that day. One of those EF5 tornadoes struck the town of [[Smithville, Mississippi]], where many well-built brick homes were reduced to bare slabs, numerous hardwood trees were completely debarked, and an SUV was hurled half a mile into the top of the town's water tower, subsequently leaving behind a visible dent. Another long-tracked EF5 wedge tornado passed through rural portions of Alabama and Tennessee, becoming the deadliest tornado of the outbreak as it completely devastated the towns of [[Hackleburg, Alabama|Hackleburg]], [[Phil Campbell, Alabama|Phil Campbell]], [[Mount Hope, Lawrence County, Alabama|Mount Hope]], [[Tanner, Alabama|Tanner]], and [[Harvest, Alabama|Harvest]], killing 72 people.

The supercell that produced the Tuscaloosa/Birmingham EF4 tornado originated in [[Newton County, Mississippi]]. The supercell also produced an EF4 tornado later that evening that killed 22 people and struck the [[Ohatchee, Alabama]] area and eventually crossed into Georgia, causing additional damage near [[Cave Spring, Georgia|Cave Spring]] before dissipating. Further to the south, a mile-wide EF3 tornado killed 7 people in mostly rural areas and caused major damage in the small town of [[Eoline, Alabama|Eoline]]. The final EF5 tornado of the day caused remarkable damage in and around the town of [[Rainsville, Alabama]], killing 25 people before crossing into Georgia and dissipating. Tornadoes continued touching down further to the northeast as the sun set, particularly in Georgia. This included a long-tracked EF4 tornado that caused major damage in [[Ringgold, Georgia]], [[Apison, Tennessee]], and [[Cleveland, Tennessee]], killing 20 people along the path. After dark, violent tornadoes continued to touch down, and a nighttime EF4 tornado destroyed many lakeside homes at [[Lake Martin]] in eastern Alabama, killing seven people.
