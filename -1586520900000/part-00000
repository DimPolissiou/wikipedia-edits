These languages include [[Latin]] (as Sicilian is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] itself), [[Ancient Greek]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Arabic]] and [[Germanic languages]], and the influence from the island's [[pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European]] inhabitants. The very earliest influences, visible in Sicilian to this day, exhibit both prehistoric Mediterranean elements and prehistoric [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] elements, and occasionally a blending of both.{{sfn|Ruffino|2001|pages=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Giarrizzo|1989|pages=1\u20134}}\n\nBefore the [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Roman conquest]] (3rd century BC), Sicily was occupied by various populations. The earliest of these populations were the [[Sicanians]], considered to be autochthonous. The [[Sicels]] and the [[Elymians]] arrived between the second and first millennia BC. These aboriginal populations in turn were followed by the [[Phoenicians]] (between the 10th and 8th centuries BC) and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].<ref name=Ruffino>{{harvnb|Ruffino|2001|pages=9\u201311}}</ref> The Greek-language influence remains strongly visible, while the influences from the other groups are less obvious.<ref name=Ruffino/> What can be stated with certainty is that in Sicilian remain pre-Indo-European words of an ancient Mediterranean origin, but one cannot be more precise than that: in fact, of the three main prehistoric groups, only the Sicels were known to be Indo-European with a degree of certainty, and their speech is likely to have been closely related to that of the Romans.<ref name=Ruffino/>\n\n=== Stratification ===\nThe following table, listing words for \"twins\", illustrates the difficulty linguists face in tackling the various sub-strata of the Sicilian language.{{sfn|Ruffino|2001|page=8}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Stratum\n! scope=\"col\" | Word\n! scope=\"col\" | Source\n|-\n| Modern\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | giameddi\n| [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|gemelli}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Medieval\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | bizzuni, vuzzuni\n| [[Old French]] or [[Catalan language|Catalan]] {{lang|nrf|bessons}}<ref>[[Albert Dauzat]], ''Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique des noms de famille et pr\u00e9noms de France'', \u00e9ditions Larousse, 1980, p. 41a</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | binelli\n| [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] {{lang|lij|beneli}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Ancient\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | \u00e8mmuli\n| [[Latin]] {{lang|la|gemelli}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | cucchi\n| Latin {{lang|la|copula}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | minzuddi\n| Latin {{lang|la|medii}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | i\u00e8middi, i\u00e8ddimi\n| [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9}} {{transl|grc|ALA-LC|d\u00eddymoi}}\n|}\n\nA similar qualifier can be applied to many of the words that appear in this article. Sometimes we may know that a particular word has a prehistoric derivation, but we do not know whether the Sicilians inherited it directly from the indigenous populations, or whether it came via another route. Similarly, we might know that a particular word has a Greek origin but we do not know from which Greek period the Sicilians first used it (pre-Roman occupation or during its [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]]), or once again, whether the particular word may even have come to Sicily via another route. For instance, by the time the Romans had occupied Sicily, the Latin language had made its own borrowings from Greek.{{sfn|Ruffino|2001|pages=11\u201312}}\n\n=== Pre-classical period ===\nThe words with a prehistoric Mediterranean derivation often refer to plants native to the Mediterranean region or to other natural features.<ref name=Ruffino/> Bearing in mind the qualifiers mentioned above (alternative sources are provided where known), examples of such words include:\n* {{lang|scn|alastra}} \u2013 \"[[spiny broom]]\" (a thorny, prickly plant native to the Mediterranean region; but also Greek {{transl|grc|ALA-LC|k\u00e9lastron}} and may in fact have penetrated Sicilian via one of the [[Gaulish languages]])<ref name=Ruffino/><ref name=Giarrizzo>{{harvnb|Giarrizzo|1989}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|ammarrari}} \u2013 \"to dam or block a canal or running water\" (but also Spanish {{lang|es|embarrar}} \"to muddy\")<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|calancuni}} \u2013 \"ripples caused by a fast running river\"\n* {{lang|scn|calanna}} \u2013 \"landslide of rocks\"\n* {{lang|scn|racioppu}} \u2013 \"stalk or stem of a fruit etc.\" (ancient Mediterranean word ''rak'')<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|timpa}} \u2013 \"crag, cliff\" (but also Greek {{transl|grc|ALA-LC|t\u00fdmba}}, Latin {{lang|la|tumba}} and Catalan {{lang|ca|timba}}).<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n\nThere are also Sicilian words with an ancient Indo-European origin that do not appear to have come to the language via any of the major language groups normally associated with Sicilian, i.e. they have been independently derived from a very early Indo-European source. The Sicels are a possible source of such words, but there is also the possibility of a cross-over between ancient Mediterranean words and introduced Indo-European forms.

Latins) for the various populations of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]]]\nBy 1000 AD, the whole of what is today [[southern Italy]], including Sicily, was a complex mix of small [[Sovereign state|states]] and [[Principality|principalities]], languages and religions.<ref name=Hull/> The whole of Sicily was controlled by Saracens, at the elite level, but the general population remained a mix of Muslims and Greek or Siculo-Arabic speaking Catholic Christians. There were also a component of immigrants from North Africa (''Ifriqiya''). The far south of the Italian peninsula was part of the Byzantine empire although many communities were reasonably independent from [[Constantinople]]. The [[Principality of Salerno]] was controlled by Lombards (or Langobards), who had also started to make some incursions into Byzantine territory and had managed to establish some isolated independent [[city-state]]s.<ref name=Norwich>{{harvnb|Norwich|1992}}</ref> It was into this climate that the Normans thrust themselves with increasing numbers during the first half of the 11th century.\n\n=== Norman and French influence ===\nWhen the two most famous of Southern Italy's Norman adventurers, [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger of Hauteville]] and his brother, [[Robert Guiscard]], began their conquest of Sicily in 1061, they already controlled the far south of Italy ([[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]]). It took Roger 30 years to complete the conquest of Sicily (Robert died in 1085).<ref name=Norwich/> In the aftermath of the Norman conquest of Sicily, the revitalization of Latin in Sicily had begun, and some Norman and Norman-French words would be absorbed:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80167171.pdf|last1=Trofimova|first1=Olga|last2=Di Legnani|first2=Flora|last3=Sciarrino|first3=Chiara|title=I Normanni in Inghilterra e in Sicilia.

The Gallo-Italic influence was also felt on the Sicilian language itself, as follows:<ref name=Hull/>\n* {{lang|scn|s\u00f2ggiru}} \u2013 \"father-in-law\" (from ''suoxer'')\n* {{lang|scn|cugnatu}} \u2013 \"brother-in-law\" (from ''cognau'') (cognate of Maltese ''kunjat'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/522d85b16f3bad51370002b1|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|figghiozzu}} \u2013 \"godson\" (from ''figlioz'') (cognate of Maltese ''filjozz'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/55ad1ebb29f971201b95cb64|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|orbu}}/{{lang|scn|orvu}} \u2013 blind (from ''orb'')\n* {{lang|scn|arricintari}} \u2013 \"to rinse\" (from ''rexentar'')\n* {{lang|scn|unni}} \u2013 \"where\" (from ''ond'')\n* the names of the days of the week:\n** {{lang|scn|luni}} \u2013 \"Monday\" (from ''lunes'')\n** {{lang|scn|marti}} \u2013 \"Tuesday\" (from ''martes'')\n** {{lang|scn|m\u00e8rcuri}} \u2013 \"Wednesday\" (from ''m\u00e8rcor'')\n** {{lang|scn|jovi}} \u2013 \"Thursday\" (from ''juovia'')\n** {{lang|scn|v\u00e8nniri}} \u2013 \"Friday\" (from ''v\u00e8nner'')\n\n=== Old Occitan influence ===\nThe origins of another Romance influence, that of [[Old Occitan]], had three possible sources:\n# As mentioned above, the number of actual Normans in Sicily is unlikely to have ever been significant. They were boosted by mercenaries from southern Italy, but it is possible also that mercenaries came from as far away as southern France. The Normans made [[San Fratello]] a garrison town in the early years of the occupation of the northeastern corner of Sicily. To this day (in ever decreasing numbers) a Siculo-Gallic dialect is spoken in San Fratello that is clearly influenced by Old Occitan, which leads to the conclusion that a significant number in the garrison came from that part of France.<ref name=Privitera>{{cite book|last=Privitera|first=Joseph Frederic|year=2003|title=Sicilian|publisher=[[Hippocrene Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|pages=3\u20134}}</ref> This may well explain the dialect spoken only in San Fratello, but it does not wholly explain the diffusion of many Occitan words into the Sicilian language. On that point, there are two other possibilities:\n# Some Occitan words may have entered the language during the regency of [[Margaret of Navarre]] between 1166 and 1171, when her son, [[William II of Sicily]], succeeded to the throne at the age of 12. Her closest advisers, entourage and administrators were from the south of France,<ref name=Norwich/> and many Occitan words entered the language during this period.\n# The [[Sicilian School]] of poetry was strongly influenced by the Occitan of the [[troubadour]] tradition.<ref name=Privitera/> This element is deeply embedded in Sicilian culture: for example, the tradition of Sicilian puppetry ({{lang|scn|[[Opera dei Pupi|\u00f2pira d\u00ee pupi]]}}) and the tradition of the {{lang|scn|cantastorii}} (literally \"story-singers\"). Occitan troubadours were active during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and some Occitan words would have passed into the Sicilian language via this route.\n\nSome examples of Sicilian words derived from Occitan:\n* {{lang|scn|addumari}} \u2013 \"to light, to turn something on\" (from {{lang|pro|allumar}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> \n* {{lang|scn|aggrifari}} \u2013 \"to kidnap, abduct\" (from {{lang|pro|grifar}}; but also German {{lang|de|greiffen}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|banna}} \u2013 \"side, place\" (from {{lang|pro|banda}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|burgisi}} \u2013 \"landowner, citizen\" (from {{lang|pro|borges}})\n* {{lang|scn|lascu}} \u2013 \"sparse, thin, infrequent\" (from {{lang|pro|lasc}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>(cognate of Maltese ''laxk'' \"loose\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/522d86276f3bad5137000e12|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|paraggiu}} \u2013 \"equal\" (from {{lang|pro|paratge}}).<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''pari\u0121\u0121'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/522d85f36f3bad513700090c?lang=eng|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Sicilian School of Poetry ===\n{{Main|Sicilian School}}\nIt was during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] (or Frederick I of Sicily) between 1198 and 1250, with his patronage of the Sicilian School, that Sicilian became the first of the modern Italic languages to be used as a [[literary language]].<ref name=Cipolla141>{{harvnb|Cipolla|2004|page=141}}</ref> The influence of the school and the use of Sicilian itself as a poetic language was acknowledged by the two great Tuscan writers of the early Renaissance period, [[Dante]] and [[Petrarch]]. The influence of the Sicilian language should not be underestimated in the eventual formulation of a ''[[lingua franca]]'' that was to become modern [[Italian language|Italian]]. The victory of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] army over the Sicilians at [[Benevento]] in 1266 not only marked the end of the 136-year Norman-[[Swabians|Swabian]] reign in Sicily but also effectively ensured that the centre of literary influence would eventually move from Sicily to Tuscany.<ref name=Cipolla141/> While Sicilian, as both an official and a literary language, would continue to exist for another two centuries, the language would soon follow the fortunes of the kingdom itself in terms of prestige and influence.\n\n=== Catalan influence ===\nFollowing the [[Sicilian Vespers]] of 1282, the kingdom was to come under the influence of the [[Crown of Aragon]],{{sfn|Runciman|1958}} and so the [[Catalan language]] (and the closely related [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]) would add a new layer of vocabulary in the succeeding century. For the whole of the 14th century, both Catalan and Sicilian were the official languages of the royal court.{{sfn|Hughes|2011}} Sicilian was also used to record the proceedings of the [[Parliament of Sicily]] (one of the oldest parliaments in Europe) and for other official purposes.<ref name=Cipolla153>{{harvnb|Cipolla|2004|pages=153\u2013155}}</ref> While it is often difficult to determine whether a word came directly from Catalan (as opposed to Proven\u00e7al or Spanish), the following are likely to be such examples:\n* {{lang|scn|addun\u00e0risi}} \u2013 \"to notice, realise\" (from {{lang|ca|adonar-se}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''induna'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/522d863d6f3bad513700102a|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|affrunt\u00e0risi}} \u2013 \"to be embarrassed\" (from {{lang|ca|afrontar-se}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|arruciari}} \u2013 \"to moisten, soak\" (from {{lang|ca|arruixar}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''raxx'' \"to shower\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/5200a366e36f237975001281|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|criscimonia}} \u2013 \"growth, development\" (from {{lang|ca|creiximoni}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|muccaturi}} \u2013 \"handkerchief\" (from {{lang|ca|mocador}}; but also French {{lang|fr|mouchoir}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''maktur'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/5200a380e36f23798800036a|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|pri\u00e0risi}} \u2013 \"to be pleased\" (from {{lang|ca|prear-se}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|taliari}} \u2013 \"to look at somebody/something\" (from {{lang|ca|talaiar}}; but also Arabic {{lang|ar|\u0637\u0644\u064a\u0639\u0629|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|\u1e6dal\u012b\u02bfa}}).\n\n=== Spanish period to the modern age ===\nBy the time [[Catholic Monarchs|the crowns of Castille and Aragon were united]] in the late 15th century, the Italianisation of written Sicilian in the parliamentary and court records had commenced. By 1543 this process was virtually complete, with the [[Tuscan dialect]] of Italian becoming the ''lingua franca'' of the Italian peninsula and supplanting written Sicilian.<ref name=Cipolla153/>\n\nSpanish rule had hastened this process in two important ways:\n* Unlike the Aragonese, almost immediately the Spanish placed [[viceroy]]s on the Sicilian throne. In a sense, the diminishing prestige of the Sicilian kingdom reflected the decline of Sicilian from an official, written language to eventually a spoken language amongst a predominantly illiterate population.\n* The [[expulsion of the Jews from Sicily|expulsion of all Jews]] from Spanish dominions ca. 1492 altered the population of Sicily. Not only did the population decline, many of whom were involved in important educated industries, but some of these Jewish families had been in Sicily for around 1,500 years, and Sicilian was their native language which they used in their schools. Thus the seeds of a possible broad-based education system utilising books written in Sicilian was lost.<ref name=Cipolla153/>\n\nSpanish rule lasted over three centuries (not counting the Aragonese and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] periods on either side) and had a significant influence on the Sicilian vocabulary. The following words are of Spanish derivation:\n* {{lang|scn|arricuggh\u00ecrisi}} \u2013 \"to return home\" (from {{lang|es|recogerse}}; but also Catalan {{lang|ca|recollir-se}})\n* {{lang|scn|balanza}}/{{lang|scn|valanza}} \u2013 \"scales\" (from {{lang|es| balanza}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|fileccia}} \u2013 \"arrow\" (from {{lang|es|flecha}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''vle\u0121\u0121a'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/5200a36ce36f2379880000a9|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|l\u00e0stima}} \u2013 \"lament, annoyance\" (from {{lang|es|l\u00e1stima}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|pinzeddu}} \u2013 \"brush\" (from {{lang|es|pincel}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''pinzell'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/5200a382e36f2379880003b8|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|ricivu}} \u2013 \"receipt\" (from {{lang|es|recibo}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|spagnari}} \u2013 \"to be frightened\" (crossover of local {{lang|scn|appagnari}} with Spanish {{lang|es|espantarse}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|spatari}} \u2013 \"to impede or disarm someone of his sword\" (from local {{lang|scn|spata}} with Spanish {{lang|es|espadar}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|sulit\u00e0}}/{{lang|scn|sulitati}} \u2013 \"solitude\" (from {{lang|es|soledad}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n\nSince the [[Italian Unification]] (the Risorgimento of 1860\u20131861), the Sicilian language has been significantly influenced by (Tuscan) Italian. During the [[Fascist]] period it became obligatory that Italian be taught and spoken in all schools, whereas up to that point, Sicilian had been used extensively in schools.<ref name=Cipolla163>{{harvnb|Cipolla|2004|page=163}}</ref> This process has quickened since [[World War II]] due to improving educational standards and the impact of mass media, such that increasingly, even within the family home, Sicilian is not necessarily the language of choice.<ref name=Cipolla163/> The [[Sicilian Regional Assembly]] voted to make the teaching of Sicilian a part of the school curriculum at primary school level, but as of 2007 only a fraction of schools teach Sicilian.<ref name=Cipolla163/> There is also little in the way of mass media offered in Sicilian. The combination of these factors means that the Sicilian language continues to adopt Italian vocabulary and grammatical forms to such an extent that many Sicilians themselves cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect Sicilian language usage.<ref>{{cite book|last=La Rocca|first=Luigi|year=2000|language=it,scn|title=Dizionario Siciliano Italiano|publisher=Terzo Millennio|location=[[Caltanissetta]]|pages=7\u20138}}</ref>{{sfn|Bonner|2001|page=21}}{{sfn|Ruffino|2001|pages=90\u201392}}\n\n== Distinguishing features of Sicilian ==\n=== Phonetics and phonology ===\n{{for|the sound-to-spelling correspondence|Sicilian orthography}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=text-align:center\n|+\nPhonemic consonants<ref name=\":12\" />\n!\n![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n![[Labiodental consonant|Labio-<br>dental]]\n![[Dental consonant|Dental]]/<br>[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Palato-alveolar consonant|Palato-<br>alveolar]]\n![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!'''[[Stop consonant|Stop]]'''\n|{{IPA|p}}\u2003{{IPA|b}}\n|\n|{{IPA|t}}\u2003{{IPA|d}}\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|k}}\u2003{{IPA|\u0261}}\n|-\n![[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|ts}}\u2003{{IPA|dz}}\n|{{IPA|t\u0283}}\u2003{{IPA|d\u0292}}\n|\n|\n|-\n!'''[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]'''\n|\n|{{IPA|f}}\u2003{{IPA|v}}\n|{{IPA|s}}\u2003{{IPA|z}}\n|{{IPA|\u0283}}\u2003{{IPA|\u0292}}\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|r}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Tap and flap consonants|Flap]]\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|\u027e}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!'''[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]'''\n|{{IPA|m}}\n|\n|{{IPA|n}}\n|\n|{{IPA|\u0272}}\n|{{IPA|[\u014b]}}\n|-\n![[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|l}}\n|\n|{{IPA|j}}\n|{{IPA|[w]}}\n|}\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Phonemic vowels<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=Basic Sicilian : a brief reference grammar|last=1914-|first=Privitera, Joseph Frederic|date=1998|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=0773483357|location=Lewiston, N.Y.|oclc=39051820}}</ref>\n!Siclian orthography\n!IPA\n!English example\n!Sicilian example\n|-\n|a\n|{{IPA|/a/}}\n|f'''a'''ther\n|p'''a'''tri\n|-\n|e\n|{{IPA|/\u025b/}}\n|b'''e'''st\n|b'''e'''dda\n|-\n|i\n|{{IPA|/i/}}\n|b'''ea'''st\n|ch'''i'''ddu\n|-\n|o\n|{{IPA|/\u0254/}}\n|cl'''aw'''\n|s'''\u00f2'''\n|-\n|u\n|{{IPA|/u/}}\n|t'''o'''\n|t'''u'''tt'''u'''\n|}\n\n==== Consonants ====\nSicilian has a number of consonant sounds that, although not unique to Sicilian, certainly set it apart from the other major Romance languages. The most unusual sounds include, but are not limited to, the [[retroflex consonant]]s.{{sfn|Cipolla|2005|pages=5\u20139}}<ref name=Bonner11>{{harvnb|Bonner|2001|pages=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\n* ''\u1e0c\u1e0c''/''DD'' \u2014 The ''-ll-'' sound (in words of Latin origin, for example) manifests itself in Sicilian as a voiced retroflex stop {{IPAblink|\u0256|\u0256\u02d0}} with the tip of the tongue curled up and back, a sound rare in the Romance languages (the only other notable exceptions being [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], and to an extent [[Asturian language|Asturian]]; such a realization of Latin ''-ll-'' may also be found elsewhere in Southern Italy, and in certain northwestern Tuscan dialects). Traditionally in Sicilian Latin, this sound was written as ''-\u0111\u0111-'', and in more contemporary usage ''-dd-'' has been used, also often found written ''-ddh-'' or even ''-ddr-'' (the first and latter of which are often considered confusing as they may also represent {{IPAblink|d\u032a|d\u02d0}} and {{IPA|[\u0256\u02d0\u027d]}}, respectively). In the [[Cademia Siciliana]] orthographical proposal as well as the [[Vocabolario siciliano]] descriptive orthography the letter ''-\u1e0d\u1e0d-'' is used.<ref name=\"Cademia\">{{Cite web|url=http://cademiasiciliana.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Proposta-di-normalizzazione-ortografica-comune-della-lingua-siciliana-I-edizione-2017.pdf|title=Proposta di normalizzazione ortografica comune della lingua siciliana per le variet\u00e0 parlate nell'isola di Sicilia, arcipelaghi ed isole satelliti, e nell'area di Reggio Calabria di Cademia Siciliana 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=cademiasiciliana.org|access-date=28 Dec 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SwNdAAAAMAAJ&dq=vocabolario+siciliano+volume+four|title=Vocabolario siciliano|last=Piccitto|first=Giorgio|date=1997|publisher=Centro di studi filologici e linguistici siciliani, Opera del Vocabolario siciliano|language=it}}</ref> For example, the Italian word {{lang|it|bello}} {{IPA-it|\u02c8b\u025bllo|}} is {{lang|scn|be\u1e0d\u1e0du}} {{IPA-scn|\u02c8b\u025b\u0256\u02d0\u028a|}} in Sicilian.<ref name=Bonner11/>\n* ''DR'' and ''TR'' \u2014 The Sicilian pronunciation of the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''-dr-'' and ''-tr-'' is {{IPA|[\u0256{{IPAplink|\u027d}}]}} and {{IPA|[\u0288\u027d]}},<ref name=\"Cademia\"/> or even {{IPAblink|\u0256\u0290}}, {{IPAblink|\u0288\u0282}}.\n* ''RR'' \u2014 The [[consonant cluster]] ''-rr-'', depending on the variety of Sicilian, can be a strongly trilled {{IPAblink|r|r\u02d0}}<ref name=Cademia/> or a voiced retroflex sibilant {{IPAblink|\u0290|\u0290\u02d0}}.<ref name=Bonner11/> This innovation is also found under slightly different circumstances in [[Polish language|Polish]], where it is spelled ''-rz-'', and in some Northern [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialects, where speakers vary between {{IPA|[\u0290]}} and {{IPAblink|\u0279\u031d}}. At the beginning of a word, the single letter ''r'' is similarly always pronounced double, though this is not indicated orthographically. This phenomenon, however, does not include words that start with a single ''r'' resulting from rhotacism or apheresis (see below), which should not be indicated orthographically to avoid confusion with regular double ''r''.\n* ''STR'' \u2014 The Sicilian [[Digraphs and trigraphs|trigraph]] ''-str-'' is {{IPA|[\u0282\u02d0\u027d]}}<ref name=Cademia/> or {{IPAblink|\u0282|\u0282\u02d0}}. The ''t'' is not pronounced at all and there is a faint whistle between the ''s'' and the ''r'', producing a similar sound to the ''shr'' of English {{lang|en|shred|italic=yes}}.\n* Latin ''FL'' \u2014 The other unique Sicilian sound is found in those words that have been derived from Latin words containing ''-fl-''. In standard literary Sicilian, the sound is rendered as ''-ci-'' (representing the voiceless palatal fricative {{IPAslink|\u00e7}}), e.g. {{lang|scn|ciumi}} {{IPA-scn|\u02c8\u00e7u\u02d0m\u026a|}} (\"river\", from Latin {{wiktla|flumen|fl\u016bmen}}), but can also be found in written forms such as ''-hi-'', ''-x(h)-'', ''-\u00e7i-'', or erroneously ''-sci-''.<ref name=\"Filologici e Linguistici Siciliani 2002\">{{harvnb|Piccitto|2002}}</ref>\n* Consonantal [[lenition]] \u2014 A further range of consonantal sound shifts occurred between the Vulgar Latin introduced to the island following Norman rule and the subsequent development of the Sicilian language. These sound shifts include: Latin ''-nd-'' to Sicilian ''-nn-''; Latin ''-mb-'' to Sicilian ''-mm-''; Latin ''-pl-'' to Sicilian ''-chi-''; and Latin ''-li-'' to Sicilian ''-gghi-''.{{sfn|Pitr\u00e8|2002}}\n* Rhotacism and apheresis \u2014 This transformation is characterized by the substitution of single ''d'' by ''r''. In Sicilian this is produced by a single flap of the tongue against the upper alveolar ridge {{IPAblink|\u027e}}. This phenomenon is known as [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]], that is, the substitution of ''r'' for another consonant; it is commonly found both in Eastern and Western Sicilian, and elsewhere in Southern Italy, especially in [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]]. It can occur internally, or it can affect initial ''d'', in which case it should not be represented orthographically to avoid confusion with the regular ''r'' (see above). Examples : {{lang|scn|pedi}} (\"foot\") is pronounced {{IPA-scn|\u02c8p\u025b\u02d0\u027e\u026a|}}; {{lang|scn|Madonna}} (\"Virgin Mary\") is pronounced {{IPA-scn|ma\u02c8\u027e\u0254nna|}}; {{lang|scn|lu diri}} (\"to say it\") is pronounced {{IPA-scn|l\u028a \u02c8\u027ei\u02d0\u027e\u026a|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linguasiciliana.org/2009/03/principal-differences-among-sicilian-dialects/|title=Principal Differences among Sicilian Dialects - Lingua Siciliana \u2013 Sicilian language|website=www.linguasiciliana.org}}</ref> Similarly, [[Apheresis_(linguistics)|apheresis]] of some clusters may occur in certain dialects, producing instances such as {{lang|scn|'ranni}} {{IPA-scn|\u02c8\u027eann\u026a|}} for {{lang|scn|granni}} \"big\".\n\n==== Vowels ====\n{{Main|Sicilian vowel system}}\n[[File:Sicilian Vowel System (development).jpg|thumb|The development of the Sicilian vowel system.]]\nUnlike the seven vowels of [[Vulgar Latin]] and many modern Romance languages, the Sicilian vowel system only includes five: ''a'' {{IPAslink|\u00e4|a}}, ''e'' {{IPAslink|\u025b}}, ''i'' {{IPAslink|i}}, ''o'' {{IPAslink|\u0254}}, ''u'' {{IPAslink|u}}, reduced to only three in unstressed position: ''a'' {{IPA|/a/}}, ''i'' {{IPAblink|\u026a}}, ''u'' {{IPAblink|\u028a}} (unstressed vowels ''o'' and ''e'' of Latin became unstressed ''u'' and ''i'' in Sicilian). This causes the vowels ''u'' and ''i'' to have a far greater presence than ''o'' and ''e'' in Sicilian,<ref name=Hull/> whereas the opposite is true in other Romance languages such as Spanish and Italian (notwithstanding the conservative nature of Sicilian, which retains the vowel ''u'' of the Latin stems ''-us'' and ''-um''): in this Sicilian is closer to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] instead (which however spells such unstressed vowels as ''o'' and ''e'', too). In addition, one will never find a Sicilian word ending in the unaccented vowels ''e'' or ''o'', with the exception of monosyllabic conjunctions and certain recent loanwords: in fact, due to the influence of Italian in the media after [[World War II]], as well as the recent influx of English terminology related to technology and globalization, there is an increasing number of words entering the Sicilian lexicon that do not adhere to the Sicilian vowel system.\n\n===== Omission of initial ''i'' =====\nIn the vast majority of instances where the originating word has had an initial ''i'', the Sicilian has dropped it completely. This can also happen occasionally where there was once an initial ''e'', and to a lesser extent ''a'' and ''o''. Examples: {{lang|scn|mpurtanti}} \"important\", {{lang|scn|gnuranti}} \"ignorant\", {{lang|scn|nimicu}} \"enemy\", {{lang|scn|ntirissanti}} \"interesting\", {{lang|scn|llustrari}} \"to illustrate\", {{lang|scn|mm\u00e0ggini}} \"image\", {{lang|scn|cona}} \"icon\", {{lang|scn|miricanu}} \"American\".<ref name=\"Filologici e Linguistici Siciliani 2002\"/>{{sfn|Camilleri|1998}}\n\n==== Gemination and contractions ====\nIn Sicilian, [[gemination]] is distinctive for most consonant phonemes, though a few can only be geminated after a vowel: these are {{IPAslink|b}}, {{IPAslink|d\u0292}}, {{IPAslink|\u0256}}, {{IPAslink|\u0272}}, {{IPAslink|\u0283}} and {{IPAslink|ts}}. Rarely indicated in writing, spoken Sicilian also exhibits [[syntactic gemination]] (or ''dubbramentu''),{{sfn|Cipolla|2004|page=14}} which means that the first consonant of a word is lengthened when it is preceded by certain vowel-ending words, e.g. {{lang|scn|\u00e8 caru}} {{IPA-scn|\u02cc\u025b k\u02c8ka\u02d0\u027e\u028a|}}.{{sfn|Bonner|2001|page=13}}\n\nThe letter ''j'' at the start of a word can have two separate sounds, depending on what precedes the word.{{sfn|Cipolla|2005}} For instance, in {{lang|scn|jornu}} (\"day\"), the ''j'' is pronounced {{IPAblink|j}} as in English ''y'', {{IPA-scn|\u02c8j\u0254\u027en\u028a|}}. However, after a [[nasal consonant]] or triggered by syntactic gemination, it is pronounced {{IPAblink|\u025f}} (like English ''gu'' in {{lang|en|argue|italic=yes}}) as in {{lang|scn|un jornu}} \"one day\" {{IPA-scn|\u028a\u0272 \u02c8\u025f\u0254\u027en\u028a|}} or {{lang|scn|tri jorna}} (\"three days\") {{IPA-scn|\u02cc\u0288\u027di \u025f\u02c8\u025f\u0254\u027ena|}}.{{sfn|Cipolla|2004|pages=10\u201311}}\n\nAnother difference between the written and spoken languages is the extent to which [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] will occur in everyday speech. Thus a common expression such as {{lang|scn|avemu a accattari...}} (\"we have to go and buy...\") will generally be reduced to {{lang|scn|am\u00e2 'ccattari}} when talking to family and friends.<ref name=Bonner56>{{harvnb|Bonner|2001|page=56}}</ref>\n\nThe [[circumflex]] is commonly used in denoting a wide range of contractions in the written language, in particular, the joining of simple prepositions and the definite article. Examples: {{lang|scn|di lu}} = {{lang|scn|d\u00fb}} (\"of the\"), {{lang|scn|a lu}} = {{lang|scn|\u00f4}} (\"to the\"), {{lang|scn|pi lu}} = {{lang|scn|p\u00fb}} (\"for the\"), {{lang|scn|nta lu}} = {{lang|scn|nt\u00f4}} (\"in the\"), etc.{{sfn|Bonner|2001|page=39}}<ref name=\"Filologici e Linguistici Siciliani 2002\"/>\n\n=== Gender and plurals ===\nMost feminine nouns and adjectives end in ''-a'' in the singular, e.g. {{lang|scn|casa}} (\"house\"), {{lang|scn|porta}} (\"door\"), {{lang|scn|carta}} (\"paper\"). Exceptions include {{lang|scn|soru}} (\"sister\") and {{lang|scn|ficu}} (\"fig\"). The usual masculine singular ending is ''-u'', e.g. {{lang|scn|omu}} (\"man\"), {{lang|scn|libbru}} (\"book\"), {{lang|scn|nomu}} (\"name\"). The singular ending ''-i'' can be either masculine or feminine.<ref name=\"Bonner, J K 2001 p. 25\">{{harvnb|Bonner|2001|page=25}}</ref>\n\nUnlike standard Italian, Sicilian uses the same plural ending ''-i'' for both masculine and feminine nouns and adjectives, e.g. {{lang|scn|casi}} (\"houses\" or \"cases\"), {{lang|scn|porti}} (\"doors\" or \"harbors\"), {{lang|scn|t\u00e0uli}} (\"tables\"). Some masculine plural nouns end in ''-a'' instead, a feature derived from the Latin neuter endings ''-um, -a''. Examples include {{lang|scn|libbra}} (\"books\"), {{lang|scn|jorna}} (\"days\"), {{lang|scn|j\u00f2cura}} (\"games\"), {{lang|scn|vrazza}} (\"arms\", compare Italian ''braccio, braccia''), {{lang|scn|jardina}} (\"gardens\"), {{lang|scn|scrittura}} (\"writers\"), {{lang|scn|signa}} (\"signs\").<ref name=\"Bonner, J K 2001 p. 25\"/> The noun ''omu'' has the irregular plural ''\u00f2mini'' (compare Italian ''uomo, uomini''). Three nouns are invariable in the plural: {{lang|scn|manu}} (\"hand[s]\"), {{lang|scn|ficu}} (\"fig[s]\") and {{lang|scn|soru}} (\"sister[s]\").{{sfn|Pitr\u00e8|2002|page=54}}.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n==== Verb \"to have\" ====\nSicilian only has one [[auxiliary verb]], {{lang|scn|aviri}} \"to have\".<ref name=Camilleri488>{{harvnb|Camilleri|1998|page=488}}</ref>{{sfn|Bonner|2001|page=123}} This verb is also used to denote obligation (e.g. {{lang|scn|avi a jiri}} {{IPA-scn|\u02cca\u02d0vja\u025f\u02c8\u025fi\u02d0\u027e\u026a|}} \"[he/she] has to go\"),<ref name=Bonner56/> and to form the future tense, as Sicilian, for the most part, no longer has a synthetic future tense; for example: {{lang|scn|avi a cantari}} \"[he/she] will sing\" ({{IPA-scn|\u02cca\u02d0vjakkan\u02c8ta\u02d0\u027e\u026a|}} or {{IPA-scn|\u02cca\u02d0wakkan\u02c8da\u02d0\u027e\u026a|}}, depending on the dialect).<ref name=Camilleri488/>\n\n==== Verb \"to go\" and the periphrastic future ====\nAs in English, and most Romance languages, Sicilian may use the verb {{lang|scn|jiri}} \"to go\" to signify the act of being about to do something. {{lang|scn|Vaiu a cantari}} \"I'm going to sing\" (pronounced {{IPA-scn|\u02ccva\u02d0jwakkan\u02c8ta\u02d0\u027e\u026a|}}) \"I'm going to sing\". In this way, {{lang|scn|jiri}} + {{lang|scn|a}} + infinitive can also be a way to form the simple future construction.<ref name=Bonner54>{{harvnb|Bonner|2001|page=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\n==== Tenses and moods ====\nThe main conjugations in Sicilian are illustrated below with the verb {{lang|scn|\u00e8ssiri}} \"to be\".{{sfn|Pitr\u00e8|2002|pages=61\u201364}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n!

Local universities do not carry courses in Sicilian, or where they do it is described as {{lang|it|[[dialectology|dialettologia]]}}, that is, the study of dialects.\n\n=== Diaspora ===\nOutside Sicily, there is an extensive Sicilian diaspora living in several major cities across South and North America, as well as other parts of Europe and Australia, where Sicilian has been preserved to varying degrees.\n\n=== Media ===\nThe Sicilian-American organization [[Arba Sicula]] publishes stories, poems and essays, in Sicilian with English translations, in an effort to preserve the Sicilian language, in ''Arba Sicula'', its bi-lingual annual journal (latest issue: 2017), and in a biennial newsletter entitled ''Sicilia Parra''.\n\nThe movie ''[[La Terra Trema]]'' (1948) is entirely in Sicilian, using many local, non-professional actors.\n\nThe non-profit organisation [[Cademia Siciliana]] publishes a Sicilian version of the quarterly magazine the [[UNESCO Courier]].\n\n== Other words and phrases ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

These languages include [[Latin]] (as Sicilian is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] itself), [[Ancient Greek]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Arabic]] and [[Germanic languages]], and the influence from the island's [[pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European]] inhabitants. The very earliest influences, visible in Sicilian to this day, exhibit both prehistoric Mediterranean elements and prehistoric [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] elements, and occasionally a blending of both.{{sfn|Ruffino|2001|pages=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Giarrizzo|1989|pages=1\u20134}}\n\nBefore the [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Roman conquest]] (3rd century BC), Sicily was occupied by various populations. The earliest of these populations were the [[Sicanians]], considered to be autochthonous. The [[Sicels]] and the [[Elymians]] arrived between the second and first millennia BC. These aboriginal populations in turn were followed by the [[Phoenicians]] (between the 10th and 8th centuries BC) and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].<ref name=Ruffino>{{harvnb|Ruffino|2001|pages=9\u201311}}</ref> The Greek-language influence remains strongly visible, while the influences from the other groups are less obvious.<ref name=Ruffino/> What can be stated with certainty is that in Sicilian remain pre-Indo-European words of an ancient Mediterranean origin, but one cannot be more precise than that: in fact, of the three main prehistoric groups, only the Sicels were known to be Indo-European with a degree of certainty, and their speech is likely to have been closely related to that of the Romans.<ref name=Ruffino/>\n\n=== Stratification ===\nThe following table, listing words for \"twins\", illustrates the difficulty linguists face in tackling the various sub-strata of the Sicilian language.{{sfn|Ruffino|2001|page=8}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Stratum\n! scope=\"col\" | Word\n! scope=\"col\" | Source\n|-\n| Modern\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | giameddi\n| [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|gemelli}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Medieval\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | bizzuni, vuzzuni\n| [[Old French]] or [[Catalan language|Catalan]] {{lang|nrf|bessons}}<ref>[[Albert Dauzat]], ''Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique des noms de famille et pr\u00e9noms de France'', \u00e9ditions Larousse, 1980, p. 41a</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | binelli\n| [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] {{lang|lij|beneli}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Ancient\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | \u00e8mmuli\n| [[Latin]] {{lang|la|gemelli}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | cucchi\n| Latin {{lang|la|copula}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | minzuddi\n| Latin {{lang|la|medii}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\" | i\u00e8middi, i\u00e8ddimi\n| [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9}} {{transl|grc|ALA-LC|d\u00eddymoi}}\n|}\n\nA similar qualifier can be applied to many of the words that appear in this article. Sometimes we may know that a particular word has a prehistoric derivation, but we do not know whether the Sicilians inherited it directly from the indigenous populations, or whether it came via another route. Similarly, we might know that a particular word has a Greek origin but we do not know from which Greek period the Sicilians first used it (pre-Roman occupation or during its [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]]), or once again, whether the particular word may even have come to Sicily via another route.

The Normans made [[San Fratello]] a garrison town in the early years of the occupation of the northeastern corner of Sicily.

On that point, there are two other possibilities:\n# Some Occitan words may have entered the language during the regency of [[Margaret of Navarre]] between 1166 and 1171, when her son, [[William II of Sicily]], succeeded to the throne at the age of 12. Her closest advisers, entourage and administrators were from the south of France,<ref name=Norwich/> and many Occitan words entered the language during this period.\n# The [[Sicilian School]] of poetry was strongly influenced by the Occitan of the [[troubadour]] tradition.<ref name=Privitera/> This element is deeply embedded in Sicilian culture: for example, the tradition of Sicilian puppetry ({{lang|scn|[[Opera dei Pupi|\u00f2pira d\u00ee pupi]]}}) and the tradition of the {{lang|scn|cantastorii}} (literally \"story-singers\"). Occitan troubadours were active during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and some Occitan words would have passed into the Sicilian language via this route.\n\nSome examples of Sicilian words derived from Occitan:\n* {{lang|scn|addumari}} \u2013 \"to light, to turn something on\" (from {{lang|pro|allumar}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> \n* {{lang|scn|aggrifari}} \u2013 \"to kidnap, abduct\" (from {{lang|pro|grifar}}; but also German {{lang|de|greiffen}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|banna}} \u2013 \"side, place\" (from {{lang|pro|banda}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|burgisi}} \u2013 \"landowner, citizen\" (from {{lang|pro|borges}})\n* {{lang|scn|lascu}} \u2013 \"sparse, thin, infrequent\" (from {{lang|pro|lasc}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>(cognate of Maltese ''laxk'' \"loose\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/522d86276f3bad5137000e12|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|paraggiu}} \u2013 \"equal\" (from {{lang|pro|paratge}}).<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''pari\u0121\u0121'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/522d85f36f3bad513700090c?lang=eng|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Sicilian School of Poetry ===\n{{Main|Sicilian School}}\nIt was during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] (or Frederick I of Sicily) between 1198 and 1250, with his patronage of the Sicilian School, that Sicilian became the first of the modern Italic languages to be used as a [[literary language]].<ref name=Cipolla141>{{harvnb|Cipolla|2004|page=141}}</ref> The influence of the school and the use of Sicilian itself as a poetic language was acknowledged by the two great Tuscan writers of the early Renaissance period, [[Dante]] and [[Petrarch]]. The influence of the Sicilian language should not be underestimated in the eventual formulation of a ''[[lingua franca]]'' that was to become modern [[Italian language|Italian]]. The victory of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] army over the Sicilians at [[Benevento]] in 1266 not only marked the end of the 136-year Norman-[[Swabians|Swabian]] reign in Sicily but also effectively ensured that the centre of literary influence would eventually move from Sicily to Tuscany.<ref name=Cipolla141/> While Sicilian, as both an official and a literary language, would continue to exist for another two centuries, the language would soon follow the fortunes of the kingdom itself in terms of prestige and influence.\n\n=== Catalan influence ===\nFollowing the [[Sicilian Vespers]] of 1282, the kingdom was to come under the influence of the [[Crown of Aragon]],{{sfn|Runciman|1958}} and so the [[Catalan language]] (and the closely related [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]) would add a new layer of vocabulary in the succeeding century. For the whole of the 14th century, both Catalan and Sicilian were the official languages of the royal court.{{sfn|Hughes|2011}} Sicilian was also used to record the proceedings of the [[Parliament of Sicily]] (one of the oldest parliaments in Europe) and for other official purposes.<ref name=Cipolla153>{{harvnb|Cipolla|2004|pages=153\u2013155}}</ref> While it is often difficult to determine whether a word came directly from Catalan (as opposed to Proven\u00e7al or Spanish), the following are likely to be such examples:\n* {{lang|scn|addun\u00e0risi}} \u2013 \"to notice, realise\" (from {{lang|ca|adonar-se}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''induna'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/522d863d6f3bad513700102a|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|affrunt\u00e0risi}} \u2013 \"to be embarrassed\" (from {{lang|ca|afrontar-se}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|arruciari}} \u2013 \"to moisten, soak\" (from {{lang|ca|arruixar}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''raxx'' \"to shower\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/5200a366e36f237975001281|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|criscimonia}} \u2013 \"growth, development\" (from {{lang|ca|creiximoni}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|muccaturi}} \u2013 \"handkerchief\" (from {{lang|ca|mocador}}; but also French {{lang|fr|mouchoir}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''maktur'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/5200a380e36f23798800036a|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|pri\u00e0risi}} \u2013 \"to be pleased\" (from {{lang|ca|prear-se}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|taliari}} \u2013 \"to look at somebody/something\" (from {{lang|ca|talaiar}}; but also Arabic {{lang|ar|\u0637\u0644\u064a\u0639\u0629|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|\u1e6dal\u012b\u02bfa}}).\n\n=== Spanish period to the modern age ===\nBy the time [[Catholic Monarchs|the crowns of Castille and Aragon were united]] in the late 15th century, the Italianisation of written Sicilian in the parliamentary and court records had commenced. By 1543 this process was virtually complete, with the [[Tuscan dialect]] of Italian becoming the ''lingua franca'' of the Italian peninsula and supplanting written Sicilian.<ref name=Cipolla153/>\n\nSpanish rule had hastened this process in two important ways:\n* Unlike the Aragonese, almost immediately the Spanish placed [[viceroy]]s on the Sicilian throne. In a sense, the diminishing prestige of the Sicilian kingdom reflected the decline of Sicilian from an official, written language to eventually a spoken language amongst a predominantly illiterate population.\n* The [[expulsion of the Jews from Sicily|expulsion of all Jews]] from Spanish dominions ca. 1492 altered the population of Sicily. Not only did the population decline, many of whom were involved in important educated industries, but some of these Jewish families had been in Sicily for around 1,500 years, and Sicilian was their native language which they used in their schools. Thus the seeds of a possible broad-based education system utilising books written in Sicilian was lost.<ref name=Cipolla153/>\n\nSpanish rule lasted over three centuries (not counting the Aragonese and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] periods on either side) and had a significant influence on the Sicilian vocabulary. The following words are of Spanish derivation:\n* {{lang|scn|arricuggh\u00ecrisi}} \u2013 \"to return home\" (from {{lang|es|recogerse}}; but also Catalan {{lang|ca|recollir-se}})\n* {{lang|scn|balanza}}/{{lang|scn|valanza}} \u2013 \"scales\" (from {{lang|es| balanza}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|fileccia}} \u2013 \"arrow\" (from {{lang|es|flecha}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''vle\u0121\u0121a'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/5200a36ce36f2379880000a9|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|l\u00e0stima}} \u2013 \"lament, annoyance\" (from {{lang|es|l\u00e1stima}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|pinzeddu}} \u2013 \"brush\" (from {{lang|es|pincel}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/> (cognate of Maltese ''pinzell'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/lexemes/view/5200a382e36f2379880003b8|title=\u0120abra|website=mlrs.research.um.edu.mt|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n* {{lang|scn|ricivu}} \u2013 \"receipt\" (from {{lang|es|recibo}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|spagnari}} \u2013 \"to be frightened\" (crossover of local {{lang|scn|appagnari}} with Spanish {{lang|es|espantarse}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|spatari}} \u2013 \"to impede or disarm someone of his sword\" (from local {{lang|scn|spata}} with Spanish {{lang|es|espadar}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n* {{lang|scn|sulit\u00e0}}/{{lang|scn|sulitati}} \u2013 \"solitude\" (from {{lang|es|soledad}})<ref name=Giarrizzo/>\n\nSince the [[Italian Unification]] (the Risorgimento of 1860\u20131861), the Sicilian language has been significantly influenced by (Tuscan) Italian.

The most unusual sounds include, but are not limited to, the [[retroflex consonant]]s.{{sfn|Cipolla|2005|pages=5\u20139}}<ref name=Bonner11>{{harvnb|Bonner|2001|pages=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\n* ''\u1e0c\u1e0c''/''DD'' \u2014 The ''-ll-'' sound (in words of Latin origin, for example) manifests itself in Sicilian as a voiced retroflex stop {{IPAblink|\u0256|\u0256\u02d0}} with the tip of the tongue curled up and back, a sound rare in the Romance languages (the only other notable exceptions being [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], and to an extent [[Asturian language|Asturian]]; such a realization of Latin ''-ll-'' may also be found elsewhere in Southern Italy, and in certain northwestern Tuscan dialects). Traditionally in Sicilian Latin, this sound was written as ''-\u0111\u0111-'', and in more contemporary usage ''-dd-'' has been used, also often found written ''-ddh-'' or even ''-ddr-'' (the first and latter of which are often considered confusing as they may also represent {{IPAblink|d\u032a|d\u02d0}} and {{IPA|[\u0256\u02d0\u027d]}}, respectively). In the [[Cademia Siciliana]] orthographical proposal as well as the [[Vocabolario siciliano]] descriptive orthography the letter ''-\u1e0d\u1e0d-'' is used.<ref name=\"Cademia\">{{Cite web|url=http://cademiasiciliana.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Proposta-di-normalizzazione-ortografica-comune-della-lingua-siciliana-I-edizione-2017.pdf|title=Proposta di normalizzazione ortografica comune della lingua siciliana per le variet\u00e0 parlate nell'isola di Sicilia, arcipelaghi ed isole satelliti, e nell'area di Reggio Calabria di Cademia Siciliana 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=cademiasiciliana.org|access-date=28 Dec 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SwNdAAAAMAAJ&dq=vocabolario+siciliano+volume+four|title=Vocabolario siciliano|last=Piccitto|first=Giorgio|date=1997|publisher=Centro di studi filologici e linguistici siciliani, Opera del Vocabolario siciliano|language=it}}</ref> For example, the Italian word {{lang|it|bello}} {{IPA-it|\u02c8b\u025bllo|}} is {{lang|scn|be\u1e0d\u1e0du}} {{IPA-scn|\u02c8b\u025b\u0256\u02d0\u028a|}} in Sicilian.<ref name=Bonner11/>\n* ''DR'' and ''TR'' \u2014 The Sicilian pronunciation of the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''-dr-'' and ''-tr-'' is {{IPA|[\u0256{{IPAplink|\u027d}}]}} and {{IPA|[\u0288\u027d]}},<ref name=\"Cademia\"/> or even {{IPAblink|\u0256\u0290}}, {{IPAblink|\u0288\u0282}}.\n* ''RR'' \u2014 The [[consonant cluster]] ''-rr-'', depending on the variety of Sicilian, can be a strongly trilled {{IPAblink|r|r\u02d0}}<ref name=Cademia/> or a voiced retroflex sibilant {{IPAblink|\u0290|\u0290\u02d0}}.<ref name=Bonner11/> This innovation is also found under slightly different circumstances in [[Polish language|Polish]], where it is spelled ''-rz-'', and in some Northern [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialects, where speakers vary between {{IPA|[\u0290]}} and {{IPAblink|\u0279\u031d}}. At the beginning of a word, the single letter ''r'' is similarly always pronounced double, though this is not indicated orthographically. This phenomenon, however, does not include words that start with a single ''r'' resulting from rhotacism or apheresis (see below), which should not be indicated orthographically to avoid confusion with regular double ''r''.\n* ''STR'' \u2014 The Sicilian [[Digraphs and trigraphs|trigraph]] ''-str-'' is {{IPA|[\u0282\u02d0\u027d]}}<ref name=Cademia/> or {{IPAblink|\u0282|\u0282\u02d0}}. The ''t'' is not pronounced at all and there is a faint whistle between the ''s'' and the ''r'', producing a similar sound to the ''shr'' of English {{lang|en|shred|italic=yes}}.\n* Latin ''FL'' \u2014 The other unique Sicilian sound is found in those words that have been derived from Latin words containing ''-fl-''. In standard literary Sicilian, the sound is rendered as ''-ci-'' (representing the voiceless palatal fricative {{IPAslink|\u00e7}}), e.g. {{lang|scn|ciumi}} {{IPA-scn|\u02c8\u00e7u\u02d0m\u026a|}} (\"river\", from Latin {{wiktla|flumen|fl\u016bmen}}), but can also be found in written forms such as ''-hi-'', ''-x(h)-'', ''-\u00e7i-'', or erroneously ''-sci-''.<ref name=\"Filologici e Linguistici Siciliani 2002\">{{harvnb|Piccitto|2002}}</ref>\n* Consonantal [[lenition]] \u2014 A further range of consonantal sound shifts occurred between the Vulgar Latin introduced to the island following Norman rule and the subsequent development of the Sicilian language. These sound shifts include: Latin ''-nd-'' to Sicilian ''-nn-''; Latin ''-mb-'' to Sicilian ''-mm-''; Latin ''-pl-'' to Sicilian ''-chi-''; and Latin ''-li-'' to Sicilian ''-gghi-''.{{sfn|Pitr\u00e8|2002}}\n* Rhotacism and apheresis \u2014 This transformation is characterized by the substitution of single ''d'' by ''r''. In Sicilian this is produced by a single flap of the tongue against the upper alveolar ridge {{IPAblink|\u027e}}. This phenomenon is known as [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]], that is, the substitution of ''r'' for another consonant; it is commonly found both in Eastern and Western Sicilian, and elsewhere in Southern Italy, especially in [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]]. It can occur internally, or it can affect initial ''d'', in which case it should not be represented orthographically to avoid confusion with the regular ''r'' (see above). Examples : {{lang|scn|pedi}} (\"foot\") is pronounced {{IPA-scn|\u02c8p\u025b\u02d0\u027e\u026a|}}; {{lang|scn|Madonna}} (\"Virgin Mary\") is pronounced {{IPA-scn|ma\u02c8\u027e\u0254nna|}}; {{lang|scn|lu diri}} (\"to say it\") is pronounced {{IPA-scn|l\u028a \u02c8\u027ei\u02d0\u027e\u026a|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linguasiciliana.org/2009/03/principal-differences-among-sicilian-dialects/|title=Principal Differences among Sicilian Dialects - Lingua Siciliana \u2013 Sicilian language|website=www.linguasiciliana.org}}</ref> Similarly, [[Apheresis_(linguistics)|apheresis]] of some clusters may occur in certain dialects, producing instances such as {{lang|scn|'ranni}} {{IPA-scn|\u02c8\u027eann\u026a|}} for {{lang|scn|granni}} \"big\".\n\n==== Vowels ====\n{{Main|Sicilian vowel system}}\n[[File:Sicilian Vowel System (development).jpg|thumb|The development of the Sicilian vowel system.]]\nUnlike the seven vowels of [[Vulgar Latin]] and many modern Romance languages, the Sicilian vowel system only includes five: ''a'' {{IPAslink|\u00e4|a}}, ''e'' {{IPAslink|\u025b}}, ''i'' {{IPAslink|i}}, ''o'' {{IPAslink|\u0254}}, ''u'' {{IPAslink|u}}, reduced to only three in unstressed position: ''a'' {{IPA|/a/}}, ''i'' {{IPAblink|\u026a}}, ''u'' {{IPAblink|\u028a}} (unstressed vowels ''o'' and ''e'' of Latin became unstressed ''u'' and ''i'' in Sicilian). This causes the vowels ''u'' and ''i'' to have a far greater presence than ''o'' and ''e'' in Sicilian,<ref name=Hull/> whereas the opposite is true in other Romance languages such as Spanish and Italian (notwithstanding the conservative nature of Sicilian, which retains the vowel ''u'' of the Latin stems ''-us'' and ''-um''): in this Sicilian is closer to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] instead (which however spells such unstressed vowels as ''o'' and ''e'', too). In addition, one will never find a Sicilian word ending in the unaccented vowels ''e'' or ''o'', with the exception of monosyllabic conjunctions and certain recent loanwords: in fact, due to the influence of Italian in the media after [[World War II]], as well as the recent influx of English terminology related to technology and globalization, there is an increasing number of words entering the Sicilian lexicon that do not adhere to the Sicilian vowel system.\n\n===== Omission of initial ''i'' =====\nIn the vast majority of instances where the originating word has had an initial ''i'', the Sicilian has dropped it completely. This can also happen occasionally where there was once an initial ''e'', and to a lesser extent ''a'' and ''o''. Examples: {{lang|scn|mpurtanti}} \"important\", {{lang|scn|gnuranti}} \"ignorant\", {{lang|scn|nimicu}} \"enemy\", {{lang|scn|ntirissanti}} \"interesting\", {{lang|scn|llustrari}} \"to illustrate\", {{lang|scn|mm\u00e0ggini}} \"image\", {{lang|scn|cona}} \"icon\", {{lang|scn|miricanu}} \"American\".<ref name=\"Filologici e Linguistici Siciliani 2002\"/>{{sfn|Camilleri|1998}}\n\n==== Gemination and contractions ====\nIn Sicilian, [[gemination]] is distinctive for most consonant phonemes, though a few can only be geminated after a vowel: these are {{IPAslink|b}}, {{IPAslink|d\u0292}}, {{IPAslink|\u0256}}, {{IPAslink|\u0272}}, {{IPAslink|\u0283}} and {{IPAslink|ts}}. Rarely indicated in writing, spoken Sicilian also exhibits [[syntactic gemination]] (or ''dubbramentu''),{{sfn|Cipolla|2004|page=14}} which means that the first consonant of a word is lengthened when it is preceded by certain vowel-ending words, e.g. {{lang|scn|\u00e8 caru}} {{IPA-scn|\u02cc\u025b k\u02c8ka\u02d0\u027e\u028a|}}.{{sfn|Bonner|2001|page=13}}\n\nThe letter ''j'' at the start of a word can have two separate sounds, depending on what precedes the word.{{sfn|Cipolla|2005}} For instance, in {{lang|scn|jornu}} (\"day\"), the ''j'' is pronounced {{IPAblink|j}} as in English ''y'', {{IPA-scn|\u02c8j\u0254\u027en\u028a|}}. However, after a [[nasal consonant]] or triggered by syntactic gemination, it is pronounced {{IPAblink|\u025f}} (like English ''gu'' in {{lang|en|argue|italic=yes}}) as in {{lang|scn|un jornu}} \"one day\" {{IPA-scn|\u028a\u0272 \u02c8\u025f\u0254\u027en\u028a|}} or {{lang|scn|tri jorna}} (\"three days\") {{IPA-scn|\u02cc\u0288\u027di \u025f\u02c8\u025f\u0254\u027ena|}}.{{sfn|Cipolla|2004|pages=10\u201311}}\n\nAnother difference between the written and spoken languages is the extent to which [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] will occur in everyday speech. Thus a common expression such as {{lang|scn|avemu a accattari...}} (\"we have to go and buy...\") will generally be reduced to {{lang|scn|am\u00e2 'ccattari}} when talking to family and friends.<ref name=Bonner56>{{harvnb|Bonner|2001|page=56}}</ref>\n\nThe [[circumflex]] is commonly used in denoting a wide range of contractions in the written language, in particular, the joining of simple prepositions and the definite article. Examples: {{lang|scn|di lu}} = {{lang|scn|d\u00fb}} (\"of the\"), {{lang|scn|a lu}} = {{lang|scn|\u00f4}} (\"to the\"), {{lang|scn|pi lu}} = {{lang|scn|p\u00fb}} (\"for the\"), {{lang|scn|nta lu}} = {{lang|scn|nt\u00f4}} (\"in the\"), etc.{{sfn|Bonner|2001|page=39}}<ref name=\"Filologici e Linguistici Siciliani 2002\"/>\n\n=== Gender and plurals ===\nMost feminine nouns and adjectives end in ''-a'' in the singular, e.g. {{lang|scn|casa}} (\"house\"), {{lang|scn|porta}} (\"door\"), {{lang|scn|carta}} (\"paper\"). Exceptions include {{lang|scn|soru}} (\"sister\") and {{lang|scn|ficu}} (\"fig\"). The usual masculine singular ending is ''-u'', e.g. {{lang|scn|omu}} (\"man\"), {{lang|scn|libbru}} (\"book\"), {{lang|scn|nomu}} (\"name\"). The singular ending ''-i'' can be either masculine or feminine.<ref name=\"Bonner, J K 2001 p. 25\">{{harvnb|Bonner|2001|page=25}}</ref>\n\nUnlike standard Italian, Sicilian uses the same plural ending ''-i'' for both masculine and feminine nouns and adjectives, e.g. {{lang|scn|casi}} (\"houses\" or \"cases\"), {{lang|scn|porti}} (\"doors\" or \"harbors\"), {{lang|scn|t\u00e0uli}} (\"tables\"). Some masculine plural nouns end in ''-a'' instead, a feature derived from the Latin neuter endings ''-um, -a''. Examples include {{lang|scn|libbra}} (\"books\"), {{lang|scn|jorna}} (\"days\"), {{lang|scn|j\u00f2cura}} (\"games\"), {{lang|scn|vrazza}} (\"arms\", compare Italian ''braccio, braccia''), {{lang|scn|jardina}} (\"gardens\"), {{lang|scn|scrittura}} (\"writers\"), {{lang|scn|signa}} (\"signs\").<ref name=\"Bonner, J K 2001 p. 25\"/> The noun ''omu'' has the irregular plural ''\u00f2mini'' (compare Italian ''uomo, uomini'').

He won the 125cc World Championship in {{MGP|2004}}. He also finished third in the MotoGP class in {{MGP|2011}} and is a three-time runner-up in the premier class, after finishing second to [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] in [[2017 MotoGP season|2017]], [[2018 MotoGP season|2018]], and [[2019 MotoGP season|2019]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Forlimpopoli]], son of Antonio Dovizioso, a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] motorcycle racer,<ref>[http://www.cinquantamila.it/storyTellerArticolo.php?storyId=5a041123abdfb Lorenzo Longhi, ''Andrea Dovizioso \u00abha gi\u00e0 vinto\u00bb.

In 2001 Dovizioso won the 125cc European Championship and also competed in his first World Championship race at Mugello, in which he retired. During that year he worked with Guido Mancini, a former rider and mechanic who, in the past, had worked with [[Valentino Rossi]] and [[Loris Capirossi]]. A documentary film about Mancini's career, released in 2016 by director Jeffrey Zani, tells the story of that racing season.\n\n===125cc World Championship===\nIn [[2002 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2002]], Dovizioso competed in the 125cc World Championship with Team Scot Honda, finishing 16th in the final standings. His best results were two 9th places in Le Mans and Donington. He continued with the team in [[2003 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2003]], finishing 5th in the final standings and achieving four podium finishes. The [[2004 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2004 season]] saw him pick up five victories and six other podium finishes on his way to winning the championship with 293 points.\n\n===250cc World Championship===\n[[File:Honda NSR250 of Andrea Dovizioso.JPG|thumb|left|Honda NSR250 used by Dovizioso in the 250cc World Championship]]\nIn [[2005 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2005]] Dovizioso moved to the 250cc class, continuing with Team Scot Honda. The season included five podium finishes and 3rd place in the overall standings. He also won the Rookie of the Year award. In [[2006 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2006]] he remained with the team, who were now renamed as Humangest Racing. He won two races in Barcelona and Estoril and finished on the podium 11 times. He fought for the championship until the final race of the season, but had to settle for 2nd place behind [[Jorge Lorenzo]]. The [[2007 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2007 season]] saw him win two races in Istanbul and Donington and challenge once again for the championship, but he finished in 2nd place once again.\n\n===MotoGP World Championship===\n====Honda (2008\u20132011)====\n;2008\n[[File:Andrea Dovizioso at Donington 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Dovizioso at the [[2008 British motorcycle Grand Prix|2008 British Grand Prix]]]]\nOn 15 September 2007, Dovizioso announced that he would be making the move up to the MotoGP class with his existing team in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crash.net/news_view~cid~6~id~154512.htm|title=Dovizioso confirms MotoGP move|work=Crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=15 September 2007|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref> On his premier class debut, Dovizioso achieved a highly credible fourth place, at the season opener in Qatar, passing [[Valentino Rossi]] on the final lap.

The season started in a positive way for Dovizioso, as he obtained three top-five results in the first four races, including a third place in the [[2014 Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas|Grand Prix of the Americas in Texas]] and claimed his first pole position with Ducati in [[2014 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix|Japan]], his first pole position since {{MGP|2010}}.

Teammate Iannone finished just behind in third place, giving the factory team their first double podium finish since the [[2010 Aragon motorcycle Grand Prix|2010 Aragon Grand Prix]]. In the following two races, he finished in second position. However, Dovizioso's form took a huge dip as he struggled with mechanical and crashes. Having scored 4 podiums from the first 5 races, he only added 1 more to his total for the rest of the season. He finished seventh in the championship.\n\n;2016\n[[File:2016 Andrea Dovizioso Ducati Desmosedici GP16.jpg|thumb|right|Dovisioso in 2016]]\nDovizioso started the season strongly in Qatar again, finishing 2nd, but was taken out by his teammate in the Argentine Grand Prix when he was 2nd, he ultimately limped over to finish 13th. He was taken out by Pedrosa in Austin while 3rd and had a water pump failure in Jerez to leave him well down the standings. Around this time it was announced that [[Jorge Lorenzo]] would be joining Ducati for 2017. A few weeks later Ducati announced that Dovizioso was to stay at Ducati to partner Lorenzo, while Iannone signed a contract with the Suzuki team. In the inaugural Austrian Grand Prix, where Ducati were favourites to win, he finished 2nd to his teammate Iannone, which left disappointed. However he finished the season strongly and took only his 2nd MotoGP win in the Malaysian Grand Prix ahead of [[Valentino Rossi]] and Jorge Lorenzo, his first win in 7 years. He finished the season fifth in the championship.\n\n;2017\nOnce again, Dovizioso started the season by finishing 2nd in Qatar, this time to new factory [[Yamaha]] rider, [[Maverick Vinales]]. He was taken out again in Argentina, this time by [[Aleix Espargaro]], before finishing 6th, 5th, and 4th in Austin, Jerez and Le Mans, however Ducati was pretty far behind the winner in those races. At the Italian Grand Prix, Dovizioso looked strong throughout practice and qualified 3rd behind Vinales and Rossi. He controlled the pace in the race, didn't let Vinales get away and ultimately passed him and opened up a gap to win the race, becoming the first Italian rider to win the Italian Grand Prix on a Ducati motorcycle. It was also his first dry MotoGP victory. 7 days later in Catalunya, he astonishingly managed to win the race again, having started 7th, ahead of Marquez, Pedrosa and his teammate. Back to back wins for Dovizioso put him only 7 points behind Vinales at the top of the standings, though he had talked down the possibility of a title fight. With Vinales crashing in Assen, he took the lead of the championship. However, a series of mediocre results in Assen, Sachsenring and Brno put him down to 3rd in the standings. He again took back-to-back wins in Austria and Great Britain, retaking the lead as Marquez retired due to blown engine. At the San Marino grand prix, he finished third and a 7th position at Aragon saw him lose the title lead to Marc Marquez once again. At the Japanese GP however, he took his fifth win of the season after passing Marquez on the final lap, reducing the deficit to 11 points. In the final round in [[2017 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix|Valencia]] Dovizioso struggled,  qualifying only 9th. Despite getting a tow from teammate [[Jorge Lorenzo]], he ultimately crashed out of the race from 4th place with 5 laps remaining. He finished the season 2nd, losing the world championship battle to Marc Marquez, with total of 6 wins.\n\n;2018\n\nDovizioso took victory in the season opener in Qatar, beating [[Marc Marquez|Marc M\u00e1rquez]] to the line. He finished in sixth place at the second race of the season in Argentina. In total, he won 4 races in the [[2018 MotoGP season]], ultimately finishing runner-up to M\u00e1rquez for the second season in a row.\n\n;2019\n\nDovizioso won [[Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix|Qatar GP]] for a second time in a row and [[Austrian motorcycle Grand Prix|Austrian GP]] at [[Red Bull Ring]] with a final corner overtake on [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/ducati-protest-rejected-dovizioso-qatar/4350483/?filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Btitle%5D=Andrea+Dovizioso&filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=4601|title=Ducati protest rejected, Dovizioso keeps Qatar win|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/dovizioso-austria-win-ducati/4512933/?filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Btitle%5D=Andrea+Dovizioso&filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=4601|title=Dovizioso: Austrian GP win manner will rejuvenate Ducati|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> He suffered a large accident at [[British motorcycle Grand Prix|British GP]] where he was unable to avoid crashing [[Fabio Quartararo]] in front of him, running over the French rider's bike, sending him airborne and falling head-first to the ground heavily.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/dovizioso-hospitalised-huge-crash-silverstone/4519397/?filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Btitle%5D=Andrea+Dovizioso&filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=4601|title=Dovizioso hospitalised after temporary memory loss in crash|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> The accident caused him to have memory loss temporarily which he would fully recover from.

[[MotoGP|MotoGP world championship]] for the factory [[Ducati Corse]] team. He won the 125cc World Championship in {{MGP|2004}}. He also finished third in the MotoGP class in {{MGP|2011}} and is a three-time runner-up in the premier class, after finishing second to [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] in [[2017 MotoGP season|2017]], [[2018 MotoGP season|2018]], and [[2019 MotoGP season|2019]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Forlimpopoli]], son of Antonio Dovizioso, a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] motorcycle racer,<ref>[http://www.cinquantamila.it/storyTellerArticolo.php?storyId=5a041123abdfb Lorenzo Longhi, ''Andrea Dovizioso \u00abha gi\u00e0 vinto\u00bb.

In 2001 Dovizioso won the 125cc European Championship and also competed in his first World Championship race at Mugello, in which he retired. During that year he worked with Guido Mancini, a former rider and mechanic who, in the past, had worked with [[Valentino Rossi]] and [[Loris Capirossi]]. A documentary film about Mancini's career, released in 2016 by director Jeffrey Zani, tells the story of that racing season.\n\n===125cc World Championship===\nIn [[2002 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2002]], Dovizioso competed in the 125cc World Championship with Team Scot Honda, finishing 16th in the final standings. His best results were two 9th places in Le Mans and Donington. He continued with the team in [[2003 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2003]], finishing 5th in the final standings and achieving four podium finishes. The [[2004 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2004 season]] saw him pick up five victories and six other podium finishes on his way to winning the championship with 293 points.\n\n===250cc World Championship===\n[[File:Honda NSR250 of Andrea Dovizioso.JPG|thumb|left|Honda NSR250 used by Dovizioso in the 250cc World Championship]]\nIn [[2005 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2005]] Dovizioso moved to the 250cc class, continuing with Team Scot Honda. The season included five podium finishes and 3rd place in the overall standings. He also won the Rookie of the Year award. In [[2006 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2006]] he remained with the team, who were now renamed as Humangest Racing. He won two races in Barcelona and Estoril and finished on the podium 11 times. He fought for the championship until the final race of the season, but had to settle for 2nd place behind [[Jorge Lorenzo]]. The [[2007 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2007 season]] saw him win two races in Istanbul and Donington and challenge once again for the championship, but he finished in 2nd place once again.\n\n===MotoGP World Championship===\n====Honda (2008\u20132011)====\n;2008\n[[File:Andrea Dovizioso at Donington 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Dovizioso at the [[2008 British motorcycle Grand Prix|2008 British Grand Prix]]]]\nOn 15 September 2007, Dovizioso announced that he would be making the move up to the MotoGP class with his existing team in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crash.net/news_view~cid~6~id~154512.htm|title=Dovizioso confirms MotoGP move|work=Crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=15 September 2007|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref> On his premier class debut, Dovizioso achieved a highly credible fourth place, at the season opener in Qatar, passing [[Valentino Rossi|Valentino Ross]]<nowiki/>i on the final lap.

He ended the season fifth in the riders' championship.\n\n;2015\n[[File:Andrea Dovizioso-MotoGP-2015.JPG|thumb|right|Dovizioso at the [[2015 Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix|2015 Catalan Grand Prix.]]]]\nDovizioso remained at Ducati for a third successive season, where he was joined by fellow Italian rider, [[Andrea Iannone]], who moved from [[Pramac Racing]]. He took the first pole position of the season in [[2015 Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix|Qatar]], out-qualifying the rest of the field by 0.2 seconds.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dovizioso grabs sensational pole for Ducati|url=http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2015/03/29/dovizioso-grabs-sensational-pole-for-ducati/172720|date=29 March 2015|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=motogp.com|publisher=[[Dorna Sports]]}}</ref> In the race, he started well and battled with the factory [[Yamaha Motor Racing|Yamaha]]s of [[Valentino Rossi]] and [[Jorge Lorenzo]].

Teammate Iannone finished just behind in third place, giving the factory team their first double podium finish since the [[2010 Aragon motorcycle Grand Prix|2010 Aragon Grand Prix]]. In the following two races, he finished in second position. However, Dovizioso's form took a huge dip as he struggled with mechanical and crashes. Having scored 4 podiums from the first 5 races, he only added 1 more to his total for the rest of the season. He finished seventh in the championship.\n\n;2016\n[[File:2016 Andrea Dovizioso Ducati Desmosedici GP16.jpg|thumb|right|Dovisioso in 2016]]\nDovizioso started the season strongly in Qatar again, finishing 2nd, but was taken out by his teammate in the Argentine Grand Prix when he was 2nd, he ultimately limped over to finish 13th. He was taken out by Pedrosa in Austin while 3rd and had a water pump failure in Jerez to leave him well down the standings. Around this time it was announced that [[Jorge Lorenzo]] would be joining Ducati for 2017. A few weeks later Ducati announced that Dovizioso was to stay at Ducati to partner Lorenzo, while Iannone signed a contract with the Suzuki team. In the inaugural Austrian Grand Prix, where Ducati were favourites to win, he finished 2nd to his teammate Iannone, which left disappointed. However he finished the season strongly and took only his 2nd MotoGP win in the Malaysian Grand Prix ahead of [[Valentino Rossi]] and Jorge Lorenzo, his first win in 7 years. He finished the season fifth in the championship.\n\n;2017\nOnce again, Dovizioso started the season by finishing 2nd in Qatar, this time to new factory [[Yamaha]] rider, [[Maverick Vinales]]. He was taken out again in Argentina, this time by [[Aleix Espargaro]], before finishing 6th, 5th, and 4th in Austin, Jerez and Le Mans, however Ducati was pretty far behind the winner in those races. At the Italian Grand Prix, Dovizioso looked strong throughout practice and qualified 3rd behind Vinales and Rossi. He controlled the pace in the race, didn't let Vinales get away and ultimately passed him and opened up a gap to win the race, becoming the first Italian rider to win the Italian Grand Prix on a Ducati motorcycle. It was also his first dry MotoGP victory. 7 days later in Catalunya, he astonishingly managed to win the race again, having started 7th, ahead of Marquez, Pedrosa and his teammate. Back to back wins for Dovizioso put him only 7 points behind Vinales at the top of the standings, though he had talked down the possibility of a title fight. With Vinales crashing in Assen, he took the lead of the championship. However, a series of mediocre results in Assen, Sachsenring and Brno put him down to 3rd in the standings. He again took back-to-back wins in Austria and Great Britain, retaking the lead as Marquez retired due to blown engine. At the San Marino grand prix, he finished third and a 7th position at Aragon saw him lose the title lead to Marc Marquez once again. At the Japanese GP however, he took his fifth win of the season after passing Marquez on the final lap, reducing the deficit to 11 points. In the final round in [[2017 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix|Valencia]] Dovizioso struggled,  qualifying only 9th. Despite getting a tow from teammate [[Jorge Lorenzo]], he ultimately crashed out of the race from 4th place with 5 laps remaining. He finished the season 2nd, losing the world championship battle to Marc Marquez, with total of 6 wins.\n\n;2018\n\nDovizioso took victory in the season opener in Qatar, beating [[Marc Marquez|Marc M\u00e1rquez]] to the line. He finished in sixth place at the second race of the season in Argentina. In total, he won 4 races in the [[2018 MotoGP season]], ultimately finishing runner-up to M\u00e1rquez for the second season in a row.\n\n;2019\n\nDovizioso won [[Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix|Qatar GP]] for a second time in a row and [[Austrian motorcycle Grand Prix|Austrian GP]] at [[Red Bull Ring]] with a final corner overtake on [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/ducati-protest-rejected-dovizioso-qatar/4350483/?filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Btitle%5D=Andrea+Dovizioso&filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=4601|title=Ducati protest rejected, Dovizioso keeps Qatar win|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/dovizioso-austria-win-ducati/4512933/?filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Btitle%5D=Andrea+Dovizioso&filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=4601|title=Dovizioso: Austrian GP win manner will rejuvenate Ducati|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> He suffered a large accident at [[British motorcycle Grand Prix|British GP]] where he was unable to avoid crashing [[Fabio Quartararo]] in front of him, running over the French rider's bike, sending him airborne and falling head-first to the ground heavily.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/motogp/news/dovizioso-hospitalised-huge-crash-silverstone/4519397/?filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Btitle%5D=Andrea+Dovizioso&filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=4601|title=Dovizioso hospitalised after temporary memory loss in crash|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> The accident caused him to have memory loss temporarily which he would fully recover from.
