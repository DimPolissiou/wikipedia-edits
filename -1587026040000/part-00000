''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, British physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, German physicist [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]] began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

These radioactive elements (termed \"radioelements\") were accordingly placed at the bottom of the periodic table, as they were known to have greater atomic weights than stable elements, although their exact order was not known. Researchers believed there were still more radioactive elements yet to be discovered, and during the next decade, the [[decay chain#Actinide alpha decay chain|decay chain]]s of thorium and uranium were extensively studied. Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas [[radon]], and their chemical properties were investigated.{{r|ley196610}} By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist [[Bertram Boltwood]] proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>). This finding was accepted as an explanation of the fixed lengths of periods and led to repositioning of the noble gases from the left edge of the table to the right.<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Unwillingness of the noble gases to engage in chemical reaction was explained in the alluded stability of closed noble gas electron configurations; from this notion emerged the [[octet rule]].<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Among the notable works that established the importance of the periodicity of eight were the [[valence bond theory]], published in 1916 by American chemist [[Gilbert N.

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]]. The first person in history to discover a new element was [[Hennig Brand]], a [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] [[Germans|German]] merchant. Brand tried to discover the [[Philosopher's Stone]]\u2014a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base [[metal]]s into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with [[Distillation|distilled]] human [[urine]] resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (''kaltes Feuer'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/discoveryoftheel002045mbp#page/n135/mode/2up|title=Discovery of the Elements|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary|date=1956|publisher=Journal of Chemical Education|edition=6th|location=Easton, Pennsylvania, USA|page=122}}</ref> He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]] rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, British physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, German physicist [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]] began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here.

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively. However, preliminary investigations of their chemistry suggested a greater similarity to uranium than to lighter transition metals, challenging their placement in the periodic table.<ref name=clark/> During his [[Manhattan Project]] research in 1943, [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] experienced unexpected difficulties in isolating the elements [[americium]] and [[curium]], as they were believed to be part of a fourth series of transition metals. Seaborg wondered if these elements belonged to a different series, which would explain why their chemical properties, in particular the instability of higher [[oxidation state]]s, were different from predictions.<ref name=clark>{{cite report |title=The Discovery of Plutonium Reorganized the Periodic Table and Aided the Discovery of New Elements |last=Clark |first=D.L. |date=2009 |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/kennedy-c1/docs/la-ur-09-04783.pdf}}</ref> In 1945, against the advice of colleagues, he proposed a significant change to Mendeleev's table: the [[Actinide|actinide series]].<ref name=legacy>{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=D.L. |last2=Hobart |first2=D.E. |title=Reflections on the Legacy of a Legend: Glenn T.

The actinide series is the second row of the f-block (5f series), and comprises the elements from [[actinium]] to [[lawrencium]]. In both the actinide and lanthanide series, an inner [[electron shell]] is being filled.\n\n=== Relativistic effects and expansions beyond period 7 ===\nSeaborg's subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of [[Transuranium element|superheavy elements]] in a [[transactinide]] series comprising elements from [[Rutherfordium|104]] to [[Unbiunium|121]] and a [[superactinide]] series of elements from [[Unbibium|122]] to 153.<ref name=clark /> He proposed an [[extended periodic table]] with an additional period of 50&nbsp;elements (thus reaching element&nbsp;168); this eighth period was derived from an extrapolation of the [[Aufbau principle]] and placed elements&nbsp;121 to&nbsp;138 in a g-block, in which a new g subshell would be filled.<ref name=transu1>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=D.C |last2=Ghiorso |first2=A. |last3=Seaborg |first3=G.T. |title=The Transuranium People: The Inside Story |publisher=Imperial College Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-1-86094-087-3 |page=435\u2013436}}</ref> Seaborg's model, however, did not take into account [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] resulting from high atomic number and electron orbital speed.

Although models from Pyykk\u00f6 and Fricke generally place element&nbsp;172 as the next noble gas, there is no clear consensus on the electron configurations of elements beyond [[unbinilium|120]] and thus their placement in an extended periodic table. It is now thought that because of relativistic effects, such an extension will feature elements that break the periodicity in known elements, thus posing another hurdle to future periodic table constructs.<ref name=PT172/>\n\nThe discovery of [[tennessine]] in 2010 filled the last remaining gap in the seventh period. Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.\n\nDespite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law. In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at [[University of California, Berkeley]] observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5. More recent experiments on [[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]] have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas [[radon]] rather than mercury and lead, their respective [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s. As such, the chemistry of many superheavy elements has yet to be well-characterized, and it remains unclear whether the periodic law can still be used to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements.<ref name=\"NYT-20190827\">{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Siobhan |title=Is It Time to Upend the Periodic Table? - The iconic chart of elements has served chemistry well for 150 years.

During the interview, Sheindlin stated:\n<blockquote>I have a contract with the company to do the program through the 2006 season. At that point, we will have produced this program for 10 years. Right now, I would be satisfied with a good 10-year run. I think that would really be phenomenal. It would be lovely if we could end on a high note and for me to say \"10 years and I still had people watching and I had a second career that was a blast.\"<ref name=\"cbsnews1\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn September 14, 2015, Sheindlin began celebrating her 20th season anniversary presiding on ''Judge Judy''. The program is the first in the court show genre to make it to 20 seasons without cancellation as well as the first to make it to this extent under one arbitrator. Three years later by September 2018, the ''[[Judge Mathis]]'' court show entered its 20th season and became the second and only other court show to accomplish this feat. Sheindlin's distinction as television's longest serving judge or arbitrator rewarded Sheindlin a place in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' on September 14, 2015.<ref name=\"etonline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etonline.com/media/video/judge_judy_sets_a_guinness_world_record-171890/ |title=Judge Judy Sets a Guinness World Record! |publisher=etonline |date=September 14, 2015 |accessdate=September 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926035657/http://www.etonline.com/media/video/judge_judy_sets_a_guinness_world_record-171890/ |archive-date=September 26, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===On-air format===\nEach episode of ''Judge Judy'' begins with an introductory preview of the main case, sensationalizing various moments of the case with dramatic music, voice-over commentary, graphics, etc. This is followed by the show's opening music video. At the beginning of each court proceeding, information regarding who is suing whom and what for is revealed originally by [[voice-over]] artist [[Michael J. Stull|Michael Stull]], who was later replaced by the show's current voice-over artist Jerry Bishop. Sheindlin typically begins each case by questioning the parties as to dates, times, locations and other facts central to the lawsuit. Monopolizing the discourse throughout the cases, Sheindlin will sometimes only listen to bits and pieces of each of the testimonies as she is quick to reply, impose her spiel and disallow responses that are not concise or made during her desire to speak.<ref name=\"Asimow2009\">{{cite book|last=Asimow|first=Michael|title=Lawyers in Your Living Room!: Law on Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PtngkJi6PQC&pg=PA300|accessdate=March 7, 2014|year=2009|publisher=American Bar Association|isbn=9781604423280|page=300|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629090431/http://books.google.com/books?id=5PtngkJi6PQC&pg=PA300|archive-date=June 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Sometimes, however, Sheindlin will allow one or both of the opposing litigants to recount the entirety of their testimony. While delivering their testimony, litigants are not allowed to hesitate and must maintain fixed [[eye contact]] with Sheindlin at all times. Further, litigants are not allowed to speak out of turn or talk to each other.\n\nLike most modern court shows, cases on ''Judge Judy'' imitate [[small claims court]] cases in which [[Trial#Civil trial|civil trials]] (non-[[Criminal procedure|criminal cases]]) are heard and ruled on. Typically Sheindlin handles cases among former lovers, disputing neighbors, or family and friend relations.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|last1=Dines|first1=Gail|last2=Humez|first2=Jean M.|title=Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Critical Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNu3KMA73nwC&pg=PA487|accessdate=March 7, 2014|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412974417|page=487|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629090338/http://books.google.com/books?id=kNu3KMA73nwC&pg=PA487|archive-date=June 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Disputes generally revolve around issues such as broken engagements, unpaid personal [[loan]]s, contract breaches, personal injuries from other litigants or their pets, minor property damages (e.g., fender benders, carpet stains, etc.), the fate of jointly purchased [[home appliance|household appliances]] and rightful ownership of property.<ref name=\"google\"/> As is standard practice in small claims court and most reality court shows alike, ''Judge Judy'' proceedings operate in the form of a [[bench trial]] (as opposed to its more common counterpart, the [[jury trial]]). Moreover, lawyers are not present and litigants must represent themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.benchtrial.net/ |title=Bench Trial |publisher=Bench Trial |accessdate=December 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910104322/http://www.benchtrial.net/ |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Generally each show presents two cases, but infrequently, an episode will present a single long case, three shorter ones, or even four shorter ones.\n\nAfter expressing her views of the circumstances and behaviors of the litigants with regards to their testimonies, Sheindlin renders the judgment either by finding for the plaintiff, or by dismissing the case specifically with or without prejudice. Any counterclaims filed are handled similarly to this. Counterclaims are handled subsequently in the same segment, though often cursorily by Sheindlin as many counterclaims on the program have been filed out of vindictiveness as opposed to legitimacy. At the end of each case, there is typically a [[monologue]], where the litigators, and sometimes their witnesses, would express their feelings regarding the case directly to the viewers at home by speaking into the camcorder. Sometimes, however, these segments are omitted, especially after cases involving resentful litigants, too upset over the circumstances to remain in the studio and provide comment.<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|last=Asimow|first=Michael|title=Lawyers in Your Living Room!: Law on Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PtngkJi6PQC&pg=PA303|accessdate=March 7, 2014|year=2009|publisher=American Bar Association|isbn=9781604423280|page=303|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629090345/http://books.google.com/books?id=5PtngkJi6PQC&pg=PA303|archive-date=June 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Inner workings===\nThe producers of ''Judge Judy'' hire [[extra (actor)|extras]] from an audience service who compose the entire studio. Paid audience members are easier to control due to agreements and employment. They don't have to be trained or debriefed as much as the average person on how to act to make those in the spotlight look good. Producers also seek a certain demographic of individuals and seat them strategically throughout their audience. Most of these paid extras are aspiring actors.<ref name=\"wdrb\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvx3yb/inside-the-secret-not-so-glamorous-life-of-paid-audience-members-on-tv-shows-818 |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113204509/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvx3yb/inside-the-secret-not-so-glamorous-life-of-paid-audience-members-on-tv-shows-818 |archive-date=January 13, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Though tickets are not offered for the show, arrangements can sometimes be made with Sheindlin's production staff to allow fans of the show into the audience. The extras must not dress casually, and no logos or brand names may be visible on their clothing. Extras are also instructed to appear as if they are having discussions with each other before and after each case, so Byrd may make such announcements as \"Order! All rise.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidescam.info/enivaontrial3.htm |title=The Case of the Bad Vibe \u2013 Day Three |publisher=Worldwidescam.info |accessdate=July 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722012023/http://www.worldwidescam.info/enivaontrial3.htm |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe audience is not to make any noises during the proceedings and, unlike other court shows, may not applaud the judge or rightful litigant upon praiseworthy remarks; although on some occasions when Sheindlin delivers a crushing remark for a particularly egregious or ludicrous act, the audience is seen laughing or applauding without Sheindlin silencing them. For the most part, however, Sheindlin is seen bringing the audience to order (with a fountain pen; she never uses a gavel)  and admonishing them for engaging in any such noise throughout the cases.\n\nTo acquire cases, the show generally uses one of the following three options:\n* Its 60 to 65 researchers, spread out across the country, enter small claims courts and photocopy numerous cases. These photocopied cases are then sent to ''Judge Judy'' producers, who review them all in search of lawsuits they believe will make for good television. According to the show's producers, only 3% of the photocopied cases are worthy enough for television.<ref name=\"wdrb\"/>\n* Its telephone number posting/announcement presented on each episode for interested individuals to call in with lawsuits.\n* Its website whereby lawsuits can be written out and submitted into the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/tv/realjudges-alpha.html |title=Reality Courtroom Series |publisher=Tarlton.law.utexas.edu |accessdate=July 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717062506/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/tv/realjudges-alpha.html |archivedate=July 17, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAfter one of these three processes, if the producers are interested, their employees will then call both parties and ask them questions relating to their lawsuit, making sure they're suitable for ''Judge Judy''. If the parties agree to be on the show and sign an arbitration contract, agreeing that [[arbitration]] in Sheindlin's court is final and cannot be pursued elsewhere (unless Sheindlin dismisses the lawsuit [[Prejudice (legal procedure)|without prejudice]]), their case will air on ''Judge Judy''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Syndi-Court Justice: Judge Judy and Exploitation of Arbitration|url=http://www.abanet.org/dispute/essay/syndicourtjustice.pdf|work=American Bar Association|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=May 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007134503/http://www.abanet.org/dispute/essay/syndicourtjustice.pdf|archive-date=October 7, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe award limit on ''Judge Judy'', as on most \"syndi-court\" shows (and most small claims courts in the U.S.), is $5,000.

When ruled on in these manners, cases cannot be refiled or retried elsewhere. However, if Sheindlin specifically dismisses the lawsuit \"[[Prejudice (legal procedure)#Civil law|without prejudice]]\", that lawsuit may be refiled and retried in another forum. In some instances, Sheindlin has dismissed cases without prejudice deliberately so that complainants pursue defendants in an actual court of law so that the defendants themselves are held financially accountable, as opposed to on the show. In such cases, Sheindlin has expressed particular aversion to the defendants in question.<ref name=\"oocities1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oocities.org/entertalkmentsite/judgejudy.html |title=judgejudy |publisher=Oocities.org |accessdate=January 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002305/http://www.oocities.org/entertalkmentsite/judgejudy.html |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further, Sheindlin has dismissed cases without prejudice when she has suspected both the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) of conspiring together just to gain monetary rewards from the program.<ref name=\"oocities1\"/>\n\nBoth the [[plaintiff]](s) and the [[defendant]](s) also receive an appearance fee.

A modern version of a melody from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|5th Symphony]] was then adopted as the show's opening theme song. This arrangement was composed by Non-Stop Music Productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/ae/articles/0415fifth0415.html?&wired |title=Beethoven's beloved Fifth transcends pop culture |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=April 15, 2007 |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}</ref> For its scenes, Sheindlin is shown in a different courtroom from her own (part of a proposed renovation to the courtroom that was rejected by Sheindlin for being too dark), approaching the camera, followed by folding her arms and smiling at the camera. This is followed by showing various scenes of her presiding over different cases. As part of these modifications, the show's introductory previews, graphics, and images all began showing up in [[falu red]].\n\nPrior to the ninth season, the show used an original tune for its theme song composed by Bill Bodine. From the show's debut through its eighth season, various versions of this original tune were used, the show making moderate modifications to the tune every few seasons, as shown [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ3lE1EZE64 here] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcQGplgLvPoas here]. The actual full-length version of this original musical, which never played during the show's intro, played during the lengthier litigant-afterthought-segments [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=zv3g6Jod6xw as shown (full-length musical used for 1999-00, 2000\u201301, 2001\u201302)]. From seasons five through eight, the opening music video commenced with an approaching scene towards a [[computer animated]] [[courthouse]] display up until that scene entered into the courthouse. From there, several shots of Sheindlin [[gesture|gesticulating]] from her bench\u2014as though presiding over various cases\u2014were displayed in motion. These motioning images eventually developed into the courthouse logo that represents the program (the logo always displayed within the [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] \"D\" in \"Judy\") by the end of this opening music video. The music video in seasons prior to this used relatively similar music with disparities in scenes, images, [[musical instrument|instrumental sound type]] and theme song length.\n\nFurther, early seasons of the show used graphics and images that were [[sea green]] and saffron. Blue and saffron then came to represent multiple seasons of the show before the show's current color scheme. By the show's sixth season (2001\u201302), music and graphics used in the introductory previews no longer resembled the rest of the program as they had previously, but instead used a high blue color scheme and a different song for each episode/intro preview. While the introductory preview's inconstant tunes have continued to the present season, the color scheme in the introductory previews began resembling the color scheme used in the rest of the program (falu red) once again by the ninth season.\n\nEach opening music video consists of voice-over artist Jerry Bishop stating: \"You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Judith Sheindlin. The people are real. The cases are real. The rulings are final. This is ''Judge Judy''.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&dq=you+are+about+to+enter+the+courtroom+of+judge+judith&q=you+are+about+to+enter+the+courtroom |title=Terrace_6477-7 \u2013 Vincent Terrace \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=January 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103131250/http://books.google.com/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&dq=you+are+about+to+enter+the+courtroom+of+judge+judith&q=you+are+about+to+enter+the+courtroom |archive-date=January 3, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Originally between the statements \"The rulings are final\" and \"This is Judge Judy\" was the statement, \"This is her courtroom.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yankeepotroast.org/underrated/2010/03/judge-judy.html |title=Judge Judy \u2013 Underrated |publisher=Yankeepotroast.org |date=March 4, 2010 |accessdate=January 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019055152/http://yankeepotroast.org/underrated/2010/03/judge-judy.html |archive-date=October 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> This was removed in 2004.

Both the Beethoven remix and intro have been curtailed. The present intro states only \"You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Judith Sheindlin. This is Judge Judy.\" In addition to not using much of an intro theme any longer, a \"20th anniversary\" caption is depicted above the \"Judge Judy\" logo in the intro. These are the only two updates for season 20.\n\nLate into the show's 23rd season, Sheindlin drastically altered her short hairdo that she had sported since the show's beginnings into a very low trim bounded by a clip-on ponytail at the back of her head, sparking considerable negative reviews from viewers and media spectators alike to the point her Facebook moderator admonished viewers that they would be deleting commentary about the clip-on ponytail.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/magazine/judge-judy-tv.html |title=Judge Judy Is Still Judging You |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 20, 2019 |accessdate=June 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer bailiff, Petri Hawkins-Byrd, admitted to a preference for the original hairdo.

The litigants involved also walked away with an appearance fee of $250 each and an all-expense-paid vacation to Hollywood, California. In reality, all the litigants in question\u2014plaintiffs and defendants alike\u2014were friends who split the earnings up among each other. It was also reported that the show's producers were suspicious of the sham all along, but chose to look the other way.

In 1999, ''Judge Judy'' moved from [[Worldvision Enterprises]] to [[Paramount Domestic Television]], which also distributed her stablemate ''Judge Joe Brown'' and eventually ''[[Judge Mills Lane]]''.

These include [[Judge Mathis|Greg Mathis]], [[Judge Hatchett|Glenda Hatchett]], [[Judge Alex|Alex Ferrer]], [[Judge Maria Lopez|Maria Lopez]], [[Judge Karen|Karen Mills-Frances]], [[Cristina's Court|Cristina Perez]], [[Judge David Young|David Young]], and many others. In addition, the series helped to spawn various [[Court show#List of present-day nontraditional court shows|nontraditional court programs]]. These include the reality-based revival of ''[[Divorce Court]]'', which was originally presided over by [[Mablean Ephriam]] and now helmed by [[Lynn Toler]]; the short-lived ''[[Power of Attorney (TV series)|Power of Attorney]]'', capturing various high-profile attorneys arguing cases for litigants in front of [[Andrew Napolitano]]; ''[[Street Court]]'', which took litigation outside of the courtroom; ''[[Jury Duty (TV series)|Jury Duty]]'', featuring an all-celebrity jury hearing cases presided over by [[Bruce Cutler]]; etc. Furthermore, the role of ''Judge Judy'' in the rise in popularity of daytime court shows enabled several other non-real life judges to preside over courts, such as [[Nancy Grace]], [[Jeanine Pirro]], and [[Gloria Allred]].\n\nAlso, partly due to Sheindlin's popularity, the producers of ''The People's Court'' decided to replace [[Ed Koch]] with Sheindlin's husband, [[Jerry Sheindlin]], as their presiding judge during ''The People's Court''{{'}}s present incarnation 3rd season/overall series 15th season (1999\u20132000); this meant that husband and wife would be either part of the same afternoon lineup or competing for ratings against each other.

This variation benefits programs that air multiple, differing episodes a day. The updated method is totalling ratings points through adding all viewings for each daily episode\u2013even if one of those viewings come from an individual already counted in as having watched another of the show's daily episodes. For example, as ''Judge Judy'' airs two different episodes per day, two ratings points are counted for every one person who has watched both the first and second daily airings. This is as opposed to one person's viewing of the two daily episodes amounting to only one ratings point. Prior to the convert, the latest method was only used in GAA numbers, while the previous method was used in average audience measure. Some court shows air in one hour blocks and thus do not benefit at all from the updated method.<ref name=\"broadcastingcable2\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-ratings-judge-judy-queen-syndie-season-63915|title=Syndication Ratings: 'Judge Judy' Is Queen of Syndie Season |magazine=Broadcasting & Cable |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2020 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204225102/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/tv-ratings/syndication-ratings-judge-judy-queen-syndie-season/63915 |archivedate=December 4, 2013 }}</ref> Worth noting, however, is that shows airing multiple daily episodes may not directly benefit monetarily as the rating system that local stations use to sell to advertisers is based upon the prior method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/492073-Exclusive_Judge_Joe_Brown_Star_CTD_Explore_Split.php |title=Exclusive: 'Judge Joe Brown' Star, CTD Explore Split \u2013 February 27, 2013 23:55:00 &#124; Broadcasting & Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303175536/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/492073-Exclusive_Judge_Joe_Brown_Star_CTD_Explore_Split.php |archivedate=March 3, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n'''2012\u20132016'''\n\nFor its 17th season (2012\u201313), ''Judge Judy'' once again pulled in a 7.0 household rating.<ref name=\"tvnewscheck1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/495309-Syndication_Ratings_At_Syndie_Season_s_End_Phil_Judy_ET_Wheel_Big_Bang_on_Top.php |title=Syndication Ratings: At Syndie Season's End, 'Phil,' 'Judy,' 'ET,' 'Wheel,' 'Big Bang' on Top \u2013 September 4, 2013 17:41:39 &#124; Broadcasting & Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |accessdate=September 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908075852/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/495309-Syndication_Ratings_At_Syndie_Season_s_End_Phil_Judy_ET_Wheel_Big_Bang_on_Top.php |archivedate=September 8, 2013 }}</ref> The series delivered 9.63&nbsp;million average daily viewers that season, growing by +32,000 viewers over the prior season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-television-distribution/releases/view?id=36509 |title=Press Express &#124; Not Available |publisher=Cbspressexpress.com |accessdate=September 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927103042/http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-television-distribution/releases/view?id=36509 |archive-date=September 27, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite this, ''Judy'' lost its 1st place spot as the ratings leader in all of syndication that season, descending to 2nd place, only a tad behind ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' (off-network syndicate) which took home a 7.1 for that season.

I don't know where or by whom Judge Wapner was raised. But my parents taught me when you don't have something nice to say about someone, say nothing. Clearly, Judge Wapner was absent on the day that lesson was taught.\"\n\nSince then, Wapner had stated, \"She is a disgrace to the profession. She does things I don't think a judge should do. She tells people to shut up. She's rude. She's arrogant. She demeans people. If she does this on purpose, then that's even worse. Judges need to observe certain standards of conduct. She just doesn't do it and I resent that. The public is apt to gain the impression that this is how actual judges conduct themselves.

Rebel also claims they are owed for their contributions to launching the program and discovering Sheindlin through their terminated employees Kaye Switzer and Sandi Spreckman. The lawsuit alleges that CBS hasn't paid Rebel for the past six years, claiming that the show operates at a loss, and alleging that this is primarily due to Sheindlin's annual salary boost to $45 and then $47 million. The lawsuit goes on to attack Sheindlin's salary as being far too high. Rebel described it as \"exorbitant\" and \"grossly inconsistent with customary practice in the television industry\" and claims that similarly successful talk show hosts aren't paid nearly as much. Further, Rebel claims they were entitled to be consulted before any spin-offs of the show were produced, but were not when ''[[Hot Bench]]'' (another courtroom-arbitrated show) was launched by Sheindlin and her producers in 2014.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/judge-judy-center-potential-multimillion-dollar-lawsuit/story?id=37685872|title='Judge Judy' at Center of Potential Multimillion-Dollar Lawsuit|first=A.

Any counterclaims filed are handled similarly to this. Counterclaims are handled subsequently in the same segment, though often cursorily by Sheindlin as many counterclaims on the program have been filed out of vindictiveness as opposed to legitimacy. At the end of each case, there is typically a [[monologue]], where the litigators, and sometimes their witnesses, would express their feelings regarding the case directly to the viewers at home by speaking into the camcorder. Sometimes, however, these segments are omitted, especially after cases involving resentful litigants, too upset over the circumstances to remain in the studio and provide comment.<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|last=Asimow|first=Michael|title=Lawyers in Your Living Room!: Law on Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PtngkJi6PQC&pg=PA303|accessdate=March 7, 2014|year=2009|publisher=American Bar Association|isbn=9781604423280|page=303|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629090345/http://books.google.com/books?id=5PtngkJi6PQC&pg=PA303|archive-date=June 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Inner workings===\nThe producers of ''Judge Judy'' hire [[extra (actor)|extras]] from an audience service who compose the entire studio. Paid audience members are easier to control due to agreements and employment. They don't have to be trained or debriefed as much as the average person on how to act to make those in the spotlight look good. Producers also seek a certain demographic of individuals and seat them strategically throughout their audience. Most of these paid extras are aspiring actors.<ref name=\"wdrb\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvx3yb/inside-the-secret-not-so-glamorous-life-of-paid-audience-members-on-tv-shows-818 |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113204509/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvx3yb/inside-the-secret-not-so-glamorous-life-of-paid-audience-members-on-tv-shows-818 |archive-date=January 13, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Though tickets are not offered for the show, arrangements can sometimes be made with Sheindlin's production staff to allow fans of the show into the audience. The extras must not dress casually, and no logos or brand names may be visible on their clothing. Extras are also instructed to appear as if they are having discussions with each other before and after each case, so Byrd may make such announcements as \"Order!

For the most part, however, Sheindlin is seen bringing the audience to order (with a fountain pen; she never uses a gavel)  and admonishing them for engaging in any such noise throughout the cases.\n\nTo acquire cases, the show generally uses one of the following three options:\n* Its 60 to 65 researchers, spread out across the country, enter small claims courts and photocopy numerous cases. These photocopied cases are then sent to ''Judge Judy'' producers, who review them all in search of lawsuits they believe will make for good television. According to the show's producers, only 3% of the photocopied cases are worthy enough for television.<ref name=\"wdrb\"/>\n* Its telephone number posting/announcement presented on each episode for interested individuals to call in with lawsuits.\n* Its website whereby lawsuits can be written out and submitted into the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/tv/realjudges-alpha.html |title=Reality Courtroom Series |publisher=Tarlton.law.utexas.edu |accessdate=July 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717062506/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/tv/realjudges-alpha.html |archivedate=July 17, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAfter one of these three processes, if the producers are interested, their employees will then call both parties and ask them questions relating to their lawsuit, making sure they're suitable for ''Judge Judy''. If the parties agree to be on the show and sign an arbitration contract, agreeing that [[arbitration]] in Sheindlin's court is final and cannot be pursued elsewhere (unless Sheindlin dismisses the lawsuit [[Prejudice (legal procedure)|without prejudice]]), their case will air on ''Judge Judy''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Syndi-Court Justice: Judge Judy and Exploitation of Arbitration|url=http://www.abanet.org/dispute/essay/syndicourtjustice.pdf|work=American Bar Association|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=May 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007134503/http://www.abanet.org/dispute/essay/syndicourtjustice.pdf|archive-date=October 7, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe award limit on ''Judge Judy'', as on most \"syndi-court\" shows (and most small claims courts in the U.S.), is $5,000.

However, if Sheindlin specifically dismisses the lawsuit \"[[Prejudice (legal procedure)#Civil law|without prejudice]]\", that lawsuit may be refiled and retried in another forum. In some instances, Sheindlin has dismissed cases without prejudice deliberately so that complainants pursue defendants in an actual court of law so that the defendants themselves are held financially accountable, as opposed to on the show.

From the show's debut through its eighth season, various versions of this original tune were used, the show making moderate modifications to the tune every few seasons, as shown [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ3lE1EZE64 here] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcQGplgLvPoas here]. The actual full-length version of this original musical, which never played during the show's intro, played during the lengthier litigant-afterthought-segments [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=zv3g6Jod6xw as shown (full-length musical used for 1999-00, 2000\u201301, 2001\u201302)]. From seasons five through eight, the opening music video commenced with an approaching scene towards a [[computer animated]] [[courthouse]] display up until that scene entered into the courthouse. From there, several shots of Sheindlin [[gesture|gesticulating]] from her bench\u2014as though presiding over various cases\u2014were displayed in motion. These motioning images eventually developed into the courthouse logo that represents the program (the logo always displayed within the [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] \"D\" in \"Judy\") by the end of this opening music video. The music video in seasons prior to this used relatively similar music with disparities in scenes, images, [[musical instrument|instrumental sound type]] and theme song length.\n\nFurther, early seasons of the show used graphics and images that were [[sea green]] and saffron. Blue and saffron then came to represent multiple seasons of the show before the show's current color scheme. By the show's sixth season (2001\u201302), music and graphics used in the introductory previews no longer resembled the rest of the program as they had previously, but instead used a high blue color scheme and a different song for each episode/intro preview. While the introductory preview's inconstant tunes have continued to the present season, the color scheme in the introductory previews began resembling the color scheme used in the rest of the program (falu red) once again by the ninth season.\n\nEach opening music video consists of voice-over artist Jerry Bishop stating: \"You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Judith Sheindlin. The people are real. The cases are real. The rulings are final. This is ''Judge Judy''.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&dq=you+are+about+to+enter+the+courtroom+of+judge+judith&q=you+are+about+to+enter+the+courtroom |title=Terrace_6477-7 \u2013 Vincent Terrace \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=January 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103131250/http://books.google.com/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&dq=you+are+about+to+enter+the+courtroom+of+judge+judith&q=you+are+about+to+enter+the+courtroom |archive-date=January 3, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Originally between the statements \"The rulings are final\" and \"This is Judge Judy\" was the statement, \"This is her courtroom.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yankeepotroast.org/underrated/2010/03/judge-judy.html |title=Judge Judy \u2013 Underrated |publisher=Yankeepotroast.org |date=March 4, 2010 |accessdate=January 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019055152/http://yankeepotroast.org/underrated/2010/03/judge-judy.html |archive-date=October 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> This was removed in 2004.

Both the Beethoven remix and intro have been curtailed. The present intro states only \"You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Judith Sheindlin. This is Judge Judy.\" In addition to not using much of an intro theme any longer, a \"20th anniversary\" caption is depicted above the \"Judge Judy\" logo in the intro. These are the only two updates for season 20.\n\nLate into the show's 23rd season, Sheindlin drastically altered her short hairdo that she had sported since the show's beginnings into a very low trim bounded by a clip-on ponytail at the back of her head, sparking considerable negative reviews from viewers and media spectators alike to the point her Facebook moderator admonished viewers that they would be deleting commentary about the clip-on ponytail.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/magazine/judge-judy-tv.html |title=Judge Judy Is Still Judging You |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 20, 2019 |accessdate=June 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer bailiff, Petri Hawkins-Byrd, admitted to a preference for the original hairdo.

The operation, devised by musicians Kate Levitt and Jonathan Coward,  was successful: Sheindlin awarded the plaintiff (Levitt) $1,000. The litigants involved also walked away with an appearance fee of $250 each and an all-expense-paid vacation to Hollywood, California. In reality, all the litigants in question\u2014plaintiffs and defendants alike\u2014were friends who split the earnings up among each other. It was also reported that the show's producers were suspicious of the sham all along, but chose to look the other way.

In addition, the series helped to spawn various [[Court show#List of present-day nontraditional court shows|nontraditional court programs]]. These include the reality-based revival of ''[[Divorce Court]]'', which was originally presided over by [[Mablean Ephriam]] and now helmed by [[Lynn Toler]]; the short-lived ''[[Power of Attorney (TV series)|Power of Attorney]]'', capturing various high-profile attorneys arguing cases for litigants in front of [[Andrew Napolitano]]; ''[[Street Court]]'', which took litigation outside of the courtroom; ''[[Jury Duty (TV series)|Jury Duty]]'', featuring an all-celebrity jury hearing cases presided over by [[Bruce Cutler]]; etc. Furthermore, the role of ''Judge Judy'' in the rise in popularity of daytime court shows enabled several other non-real life judges to preside over courts, such as [[Nancy Grace]], [[Jeanine Pirro]], and [[Gloria Allred]].\n\nAlso, partly due to Sheindlin's popularity, the producers of ''The People's Court'' decided to replace [[Ed Koch]] with Sheindlin's husband, [[Jerry Sheindlin]], as their presiding judge during ''The People's Court''{{'}}s present incarnation 3rd season/overall series 15th season (1999\u20132000); this meant that husband and wife would be either part of the same afternoon lineup or competing for ratings against each other.

The updated method is totalling ratings points through adding all viewings for each daily episode\u2013even if one of those viewings come from an individual already counted in as having watched another of the show's daily episodes.

On November 26, 2002, Wapner criticized Judge Judy's courtroom behavior, stating \"She is not portraying a judge as I view a judge should act. Judge Judy is discourteous, and she's abrasive. She's not slightly insulting. She's insulting in capital letters.\"\n\nJudge Judy replied through her publicist, stating, \"I refuse to engage in similar mud slinging. I don't know where or by whom Judge Wapner was raised. But my parents taught me when you don't have something nice to say about someone, say nothing. Clearly, Judge Wapner was absent on the day that lesson was taught.\"\n\nSince then, Wapner had stated, \"She is a disgrace to the profession. She does things I don't think a judge should do. She tells people to shut up. She's rude. She's arrogant. She demeans people. If she does this on purpose, then that's even worse. Judges need to observe certain standards of conduct. She just doesn't do it and I resent that. The public is apt to gain the impression that this is how actual judges conduct themselves.

Rebel also claims they are owed for their contributions to launching the program and discovering Sheindlin through their terminated employees Kaye Switzer and Sandi Spreckman. The lawsuit alleges that CBS hasn't paid Rebel for the past six years, claiming that the show operates at a loss, and alleging that this is primarily due to Sheindlin's annual salary boost to $45 and then $47 million. The lawsuit goes on to attack Sheindlin's salary as being far too high. Rebel described it as \"exorbitant\" and \"grossly inconsistent with customary practice in the television industry\" and claims that similarly successful talk show hosts aren't paid nearly as much. Further, Rebel claims they were entitled to be consulted before any spin-offs of the show were produced, but were not when ''[[Hot Bench]]'' (another courtroom-arbitrated show) was launched by Sheindlin and her producers in 2014.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/judge-judy-center-potential-multimillion-dollar-lawsuit/story?id=37685872|title='Judge Judy' at Center of Potential Multimillion-Dollar Lawsuit|first=A.

That being said, Judge O'Donnell ruled partially in Rebel's favor, agreeing that it was a breach of contract for the defendants to have failed to consult Lawrence before launching \"spin-off\" series, ''Hot Bench''. Dissatisfied with being granted one part of their motion while denied the other, Bryan Freedman (Lawrence's attorney) stated that the plaintiffs intend to appeal Judge O'Donnell's verdict. Freedman is quoted as stating, \"As for admitting and then ignoring Rebel's uncontroverted expert opinion evidence that frontloading the 45 million dollar salary of Ms. Sheindlin was not consistent with the United States television industry, the court committed a reversible error. That issue will be decided by the court of appeal.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/judge-judy-salary-not-unreasonable-judge-rules-1202745414/ |title=Judge Judy's $45 Million Salary Is Not Unreasonable, Says New Ruling |first=Gene |last=Maddaus |date=April 5, 2018 |work=Variety |access-date=April 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406002414/http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/judge-judy-salary-not-unreasonable-judge-rules-1202745414/#article-comments |archive-date=April 6, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Lawsuit by Kaye Switzer and trust of Sandi Spreckman against Sheindlin, CBS and Big Ticket====\nOn January 19, 2018, a breach-of-contract lawsuit\u2014similar and loosely related to the case filed by Rebel Entertainment\u2014was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court against Sheindlin, CBS Corporation, CBS Studios and Big Ticket Television by Kaye Switzer and the trust of the now deceased Sandi Spreckman.<ref name=\"HR20180123\">{{cite web |last1=Cullins |first1=Ashley |title='Judge Judy' Library Sale Sparks Profits Lawsuit |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/judge-judy-library-sale-sparks-profits-lawsuit-1077510 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=September 12, 2018 |date=January 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913040153/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/judge-judy-library-sale-sparks-profits-lawsuit-1077510 |archive-date=September 13, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Switzer and Sandi Spreckman are former employees of Rebel Entertainment, terminated by the employer.

The Blue Nile flows about 1,400 kilometres to Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile join to form the Nile.[38] Ninety percent of the water and ninety-six percent of the transported sediment carried by the Nile[39] originates in Ethiopia, with fifty-nine percent of the water from the Blue Nile (the rest being from the Tekez\u00e9, Atbarah, Sobat, and small tributaries). The erosion and transportation of silt only occurs during the Ethiopian rainy season in the summer, however, when rainfall is especially high on the Ethiopian Plateau; the rest of the year, the great rivers draining Ethiopia into the Nile (Sobat, Blue Nile, Tekez\u00e9, and Atbarah) have a weaker flow. In harsh and arid seasons and droughts the Blue Nile dries out completely.[40]\n\nThe Nile has two major [[tributary|tributaries]] \u2013 the [[White Nile]] and the [[Blue Nile]]. The White Nile is considered to be the [[headwaters]] and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the [[water]], containing 80% of the water and [[silt]]. The White Nile is longer and rises in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region of central Africa, with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi. It flows north through Tanzania, [[Lake Victoria]], Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at [[Lake Tana]] in Ethiopia<ref>The river's outflow from that lake occurs at {{coord|12|02|09|N|37|15|53|E|type:waterbody_region:ET}}</ref> and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of [[Khartoum]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/Whats-the-Blue-Nile-and-the-White-Nile/articleshow/4027990.cms|title=What's the Blue Nile and the White Nile? |work=The Times of India|access-date=31 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308001739/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/Whats-the-Blue-Nile-and-the-White-Nile/articleshow/4027990.cms|archivedate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese [[desert]] to Egypt, then ends in [[Nile Delta|a large delta]] and flows into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. [[History of Egypt|Egyptian civilization]] and [[History of Sudan|Sudanese kingdoms]] have depended on the river since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile [[valley]] north of [[Aswan]], and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of [[Ancient Egypt]] are found along river banks.\n\n== Etymology and names  ==\nThe standard English names \"White Nile\" and \"Blue Nile\", to refer to the river's source, derive from [[Arabic]] names formerly applied only to the Sudanese stretches which meet at Khartoum.<ref>{{cite EB1911|ref=harv|wstitle=Nile|volume=19|pages=695}}</ref>\n\nIn the ancient [[Egyptian language]], the Nile is called ''[http://medu.ipetisut.com/index.php?og=nile \u1e24'p\u012b]'' (Hapy) or ''Iteru'', meaning \"river\".

After leaving Lake Albert, the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the [[Albert Nile]].\n\n=== In South Sudan ===\nThe Nile river flows into [[South Sudan]] just south of [[Nimule]], where it is known as the [[White Nile|Bahr al Jabal]] (\"Mountain River\"{{refn|Arabic ''bahr'' can refer to either seas or large rivers.<ref name=\"EB-name\"/>}}). Just south of the town it has the [[confluence]] with the [[Achwa River]]. The [[Bahr el Ghazal River|Bahr al Ghazal]], itself {{convert|716|km|sp=us}} long, joins the Bahr al Jabal at a small lagoon called [[Lake No]], after which the Nile becomes known as the ''Bahr al Abyad'', or the [[White Nile]], from the whitish [[clay]] suspended in its waters. When the [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] it leaves a rich silty deposit which fertilizes the soil. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the [[Aswan Dam]] in 1970. An [[anabranch]] river, the [[Bahr el Zeraf]], flows out of the Nile's Bahr al Jabal section and rejoins the White Nile.\n\nThe flow rate of the Bahr al Jabal at [[Mongalla, South Sudan]] is almost constant throughout the year and averages {{convert|1048|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. After Mongalla, the Bahr Al Jabal enters the enormous swamps of the [[Sudd]] region of South Sudan. More than half of the Nile's water is lost in this swamp to [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]]. The average flow rate of the White Nile at the tails of the swamps is about {{convert|510|m3/s|sigfig=2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. From here it soon meets with the [[Sobat River]] at [[Malakal]].

One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins, only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan. Rushdi Said postulated that Egypt itself supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.<ref name=Said1981>Said, R. (1981). ''The geological evolution of the River Nile''. [[Springer Verlag]].</ref>\n\nThe other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile, the Atbara and the [[Tekez\u00e9 River|Takazze]] flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into [[Tertiary]] times.<ref name=WW1980>Williams, M.A.J.; Williams, F.

Geophysical exploration of the Blue Nile Rift System estimated the depth of the sediments to be {{convert|5|\u2013|9|km|sp=us|sigfig=2}}. These basins were not interconnected until their subsidence ceased, and the rate of sediment deposition was enough to fill and connect them. The Egyptian Nile connected to the Sudanese Nile, which captures the Ethiopian and Equatorial [[headwater]]s during the current stages of tectonic activity in the Eastern, Central and Sudanese Rift Systems.<ref name=Salama1997>Salama, R.B.

ElSevier, Amsterdam.</ref> The connection of the different Niles occurred during cyclic wet periods. The River Atbara overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100,000 to 120,000 years ago. The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 70,000\u201380,000 years B.P. wet period. The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12,500 years ago during the [[African humid period]].\n\n=== Role in the founding of Egyptian civilization ===\n[[File:Dhows on the Nile.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A [[felucca]] traversing the Nile near Aswan]]\n\nThe Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that \"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\". An unending source of sustenance, it played a crucial role in the development of Egyptian civilization. Because the river overflowed its banks annually and deposited new layers of silt, the surrounding land was very fertile. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians cultivated and traded [[wheat]], [[flax]], [[papyrus]] and other crops around the Nile. Wheat was a crucial crop in the famine-plagued Middle East. This trading system secured Egypt's diplomatic relationships with other countries, and contributed to economic stability. Far-reaching trade has been carried on along the Nile since ancient times. A tune, [[Hymn to the Nile]], was created and sung by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|title=Hymn to the Nile|date=23 March 2010|publisher=ARCJOHN|access-date=20 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123133714/https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Domestic buffalo|Water buffalo]] were introduced from Asia and the Assyrians introduced [[camel]]s in the 7th century BC. These animals were killed for meat, and were domesticated and used for ploughing\u2014or in the camels' case, carriage. Water was vital to both people and livestock. The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods.\n\nThe Nile was also an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]] was the god of the annual floods, and both he and the [[pharaoh]] were thought to control the flooding. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and the afterlife. The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth, and the west was considered the place of death, as the god [[Ra]], the Sun, underwent birth, death, and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky. Thus, all tombs were west of the Nile, because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife, they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death.\n\nAs the Nile was such an important factor in Egyptian life, the ancient calendar was even based on the three cycles of the Nile. These seasons, each consisting of four months of thirty days each, were called [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]], [[Season of the Emergence|Peret]], and [[Shemu]]. Akhet, which means inundation, was the time of the year when the Nile flooded, leaving several layers of fertile soil behind, aiding in agricultural growth.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\">{{cite book|last1=Springer|first1=Lisa|author2=Neil Morris|title=Art and Culture of Ancient Egypt|year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4358-3589-4|page=8}}</ref> Peret was the growing season, and Shemu, the last season, was the harvest season when there were no rains.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\"/>\n\n=== Search for the source of the Nile ===\n[[File:JH Speke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Hanning Speke|John&nbsp;Hanning&nbsp;Speke]]&nbsp;{{circa|lk=no|1863}}.

P\u00e1ez's account of the source of the Nile<ref>''History of Ethiopia'', circa 1622</ref> is a long and vivid account of Ethiopia.

Telles also used his account.\n\nThe White Nile was even less understood. The ancients mistakenly believed that the [[Niger River]] represented the upper reaches of the White Nile. For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that the Nile had its origins \"in a mountain of lower [[Mauretania]]\", flowed above ground for \"many days\" distance, then went underground, reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the [[Masaesyli]], then sank again below the desert to flow underground \"for a distance of 20 days' journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians.\"<ref>''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 5.10</ref> A merchant named Diogenes reported that the Nile's water attracted game such as buffalo.\n[[File:1911Nile.png|left|thumb|upright=0.9|A map of the Nile {{circa|lk=no|1911}}, a time when its entire primary course ran through British occupations, condominiums, colonies, and protectorates{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=693}}]]\n[[Lake Victoria]] was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when British explorer [[John Hanning Speke]] reached its southern shore while traveling with [[Richard Francis Burton]] to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after the then [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]]. Burton, recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]], was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. British explorer and missionary [[David Livingstone]] pushed too far west and entered the [[Congo River]] system instead. It was ultimately Welsh-American explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] who confirmed Speke's discovery, circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at [[Ripon Falls]] on the lake's northern shore.\n\nEuropean involvement in Egypt goes back to the time of [[Napoleon]].  [[Laird Shipyard]] of [[Liverpool]] sent an iron steamer to the Nile in the 1830s. With the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|British takeover of Egypt]] in the 1882, more British river steamers followed.\n\nThe Nile is the area's natural navigation channel, giving access to Khartoum and Sudan by steamer. The [[Siege of Khartoum]] was broken with purpose-built [[sternwheelers]] shipped from England and steamed up the river to retake the city. After this came regular steam navigation of the river. With [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|British Forces in Egypt]] in the [[World War I|First World War]] and the inter-war years, river steamers provided both security and sightseeing to the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Steam navigation remained integral to the two countries as late as 1962. Sudan steamer traffic was a lifeline as few railways or roads were built in that country. Most paddle steamers have been retired to shorefront service, but modern diesel tourist boats remain on the river.\n\n[[File:Village on the Nile, 1891.jpg|thumb|Village on the Nile, 1891]]\n\n=== Since 1950 ===\n[[File:KageraRuvubu.jpg|thumb|right|The confluence of the [[Kagera river|Kagera]] and [[Ruvubu river|Ruvubu]] rivers near [[Rusumo Falls]], part of the Nile's upper reaches]]\n[[File:Nile03(js).jpg|thumb|[[Dhows]] on the Nile]] [[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|The Nile passes through Cairo, Egypt's capital city.]]\nThe Nile has long been used to transport goods along its length. Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river, and down river using the flow of the river.\nWhile most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The rivers's flow is disturbed at several points by the [[Cataracts of the Nile]], which are sections of faster-flowing water with many small islands, shallow water, and rocks, which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The [[Sudd]] wetlands in Sudan also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impede water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to canalize (the [[Jonglei Canal]]) to bypass the swamps.<ref>{{cite book |last= Shahin |first= Mamdouh |title= Hydrology and Water Resources of Africa |year= 2002 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 1-4020-0866-X |pages= 286\u2013287 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |access-date= 25 July 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222900/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |archive-date= 5 September 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 \"Big Canal To Change Course of Nile River\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905230928/https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 |date=5 September 2015 }}.

M.P. Barnett directed the software development and computer operations. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle was the use of over-year storage, to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water as a function of the month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer.

On 14 May 2010 at [[Entebbe]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]] signed a new agreement on sharing the Nile water even though this agreement raised strong opposition from Egypt and Sudan. Ideally, such international agreements should promote equitable and efficient usage of the Nile basin's water resources. Without a better understanding about the availability of the future water resources of the Nile, it is possible that conflicts could arise between these countries relying on the Nile for their water supply, economic and social developments.<ref name=\"hdl.handle\" />\n\n== Modern achievements and exploration ==\n=== White Nile ===\nIn 1951, the American [[John Goddard (adventurer)|John Goddard]] together with two French explorers became the first to successfully navigate the entire Nile river from its source in Burundi at the potential [[headsprings]] of the [[Kagera River]] in [[Burundi]] to its mouth on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], a journey of approximately {{cvt|6800|km|||}}.

Their approximately {{convert|5230|km|mi|adj=on}} journey took 114 days, from 25 December 2003 to 28 April 2004.

Credited with being the first European to view the source of the Blue Nile which he describes in this volume.\n* ''Voyage historique d'Abissinie'', [[Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo]] (aka Girolamo Lobo), Piero Matini, Firenze; 1693\n\n:One of the most important and earliest sources on Ethiopia and the Nile. Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo (1595\u20131687), a [[Jesuit]] priest, stayed in Ethiopia, mostly in [[Tigray Province|Tigre]], for 9 years and travelled to [[Lake Tana]] and the Blue Nile, reaching the province of [[Damot]]. When the Jesuits were expelled from the country, he too had to leave and did so via [[Massaua]] and [[Suakin]]. \"He was the best expert on Ethiopian matters. After Pais, Lobo is the second European to describe the sources of the Blue Nile and he did so more exactly than Bruce\" (transl. from Henze).\n\n'''18th century'''\n* ''[[Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile|Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile in the Years&nbsp;\u2013 1768, 1770, 1771, 1772, and 1773]]'', [[James Bruce]] of Kinnaird. J. Ruthven for G. GJ. and J. Robinson et al., Edinburgh, 1790 (5 Volumes)\n\n:With time on his hands and at the urging of a friend, Bruce composed this account of his travels on the African continent, including comments on the history and religion of Egypt, an account of Indian trade, a history of [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]], and other material. Although Bruce would not be confused with \"a great scholar or a judicious critic, few books of equal compass are equally entertaining; and few such monuments exist of the energy and enterprise of a single traveller\" (DNB). \"The result of his travels was a very great enrichment of the knowledge of geography and ethnography\" (Cox II, p. 389.) Bruce was one of the earliest westerners to search for the source of the Nile. In November 1770 he reached the source of the Blue Nile, and though he acknowledged that the White Nile was the larger stream, he claimed that the Blue Nile was the Nile of the ancients and that he was thus the discoverer of its source. The account of his travels was written twelve years after his journey and without reference to his journals, which gave critics grounds for disbelief, but the substantial accuracy of the book has since been amply demonstrated.\n\n'''1800\u20131850'''\n* ''Egypt And Mohammed Ali, Or Travels in the Valley of The Nile'', [[James Augustus St. John]], Longman, London, 1834\n\n:St. John traveled extensively in Egypt and [[Nubia]] in 1832\u201333, mainly on foot. He gives a very interesting picture of Egyptian life and politics under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], a large part of volume II deals with the Egyptian campaign in [[Syria]].\n* ''Travels in Ethiopia Above the Second Cateract of the Nile; Exhibiting the State of That Country and Its Various Inhabitants Under the Dominion of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]]; and Illustrating the Antiquities, Arts, and History of the Ancient Kingdom of Meroe'', G.A.

[[William Clowes Ltd.|W. Clowes]], London; 1860\n\n:Sir Richard Burton's presentation of his expedition with [[John Speke]]. Ultimately, Burton's view of the sources of the Nile failed and Speke's prevailed.\n* ''Travels, researches, and missionary labours, during eighteen years' residence in eastern Africa. Together with journeys to Jagga, Usambara, Ukambani, Shoa, Abessinia, and Khartum; and a coasting voyage from Mombaz to Cape Delgado.

Krapf]], Trubner and Co, London; 1860; [[Ticknor and Fields]], Boston; 1860\n\n:Krapf went to East Africa in the service of the English Church Missionary Society, arriving at [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]] in 1844 and staying in East Africa until 1853. While stationed there he was the first to report the existence of [[Lake Baringo]] and a sighting of the snow-clad [[Kilimanjaro]]. Krapf, during his travels, collected information from the Arab traders operating inland from the coast. From the traders Krapf and his companions learned of great lakes and snow-capped mountains, which Krapf claimed to have seen for himself, much to the ridicule of English explorers who could not believe the idea of snow on the equator. However, Krapf was correct and had seen Mounts Kilimanjaro and Kenya, the first European to do so.\n* ''Egypt, Soudan and Central Africa: With Explorations From Khartoum on the White Nile to the Regions of the Equator, Being Sketches from Sixteen Years' Travel'', [[John Petherick]]. [[William Blackwood]], Edinburgh; 1861\n\n:Petherick was a well known Welsh traveler in East Central Africa where he had adopted the profession of mining engineer. This work describes sixteen years of his travel throughout Africa. In 1845, he entered the service of Mehemet Ali, and was employed in examining Upper Egypt, Nubia, the [[Red Sea]] coast and [[Kordofan]] in an unsuccessful search for coal. In 1848, he left the Egyptian service and established himself at El Obeid as a trader and was, at the same time made British Consul for the Sudan. In 1853, he removed to [[Khartoum]] and became an ivory trader. He traveled extensively in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr-el-Ghazal]] region, then almost unknown, exploring the [[Jur River|Jur]], [[Yalo]] and other affluents of the [[Ghazal]] and in 1858 he penetrated the [[Zande people|Niam-Niam]] country. Petherick's additions to the knowledge of natural history were considerable, being responsible for the discovery of a number of new species. In 1859, he returned to England where he became acquainted with [[John Speke]], then arranging for an expedition to discover the source of the Nile. While in England, Petherick married and published this account of his travels. He got the idea to join Speke in his travels, and in this volume is an actual subscription and list of subscribers to raise money to send Petherick to join Speke. His subsequent adventures as a consul in Africa were published in a later work.\n* ''Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile'', [[John Hanning Speke]]. [[William Blackwood]], Edinburgh, 1863; Harper & Brothers, New York; 1864\n\n:Speke had previously made an expedition with Sir Richard Burton under the auspices of the Indian government, during which Speke was convinced that he had discovered the source of the Nile. Burton, however, disagreed and ridiculed Speke's account. Speke set off on another expedition, recounted here, in the company of Captain Grant. During the course of this expedition he not only produced further evidence for his discoveries but he also met (later Sir) [[Samuel Baker|Samuel]] and [[Florence Baker]]. Speke and Burton provided them with essential information which helped Baker in the discovery of the [[Albert Nyanza]].<ref>Dorothy Middleton, 'Baker, Florence Barbara Maria, Lady Baker (1841\u20131916)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/42346, accessed 11 Sept 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155059/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/42346 |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> The importance of Speke's discoveries can hardly be overestimated.

For the remaining part it flows merely westerly through the [[Murchison Falls]] until it reaches the very northern shores of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] where it forms a significant [[river delta]].

After leaving Lake Albert, the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the [[Albert Nile]].\n\n=== In South Sudan ===\nThe Nile river flows into [[South Sudan]] just south of [[Nimule]], where it is known as the [[White Nile|Bahr al Jabal]] (\"Mountain River\"{{refn|Arabic ''bahr'' can refer to either seas or large rivers.<ref name=\"EB-name\"/>}}). Just south of the town it has the [[confluence]] with the [[Achwa River]]. The [[Bahr el Ghazal River|Bahr al Ghazal]], itself {{convert|716|km|sp=us}} long, joins the Bahr al Jabal at a small lagoon called [[Lake No]], after which the Nile becomes known as the ''Bahr al Abyad'', or the [[White Nile]], from the whitish [[clay]] suspended in its waters. When the [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] it leaves a rich silty deposit which fertilizes the soil. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the [[Aswan Dam]] in 1970. An [[anabranch]] river, the [[Bahr el Zeraf]], flows out of the Nile's Bahr al Jabal section and rejoins the White Nile.\n\nThe flow rate of the Bahr al Jabal at [[Mongalla, South Sudan]] is almost constant throughout the year and averages {{convert|1048|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. After Mongalla, the Bahr Al Jabal enters the enormous swamps of the [[Sudd]] region of South Sudan. More than half of the Nile's water is lost in this swamp to [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]]. The average flow rate of the White Nile at the tails of the swamps is about {{convert|510|m3/s|sigfig=2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. From here it soon meets with the [[Sobat River]] at [[Malakal]].

The Nile was much longer at that time, with its furthest headwaters in northern [[Zambia]].\n\n=== Integrated Nile ===\nThere are two theories about the age of the integrated Nile. One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins, only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan. Rushdi Said postulated that Egypt itself supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.<ref name=Said1981>Said, R. (1981). ''The geological evolution of the River Nile''. [[Springer Verlag]].</ref>\n\nThe other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile, the Atbara and the [[Tekez\u00e9 River|Takazze]] flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into [[Tertiary]] times.<ref name=WW1980>Williams, M.A.J.; Williams, F.

The White Nile Rift System, although shallower than the [[Bahr el Arab rift]], is about {{convert|9|km|mi|sp=us|sigfig=2}} deep. Geophysical exploration of the Blue Nile Rift System estimated the depth of the sediments to be {{convert|5|\u2013|9|km|sp=us|sigfig=2}}. These basins were not interconnected until their subsidence ceased, and the rate of sediment deposition was enough to fill and connect them. The Egyptian Nile connected to the Sudanese Nile, which captures the Ethiopian and Equatorial [[headwater]]s during the current stages of tectonic activity in the Eastern, Central and Sudanese Rift Systems.<ref name=Salama1997>Salama, R.B.

ElSevier, Amsterdam.</ref> The connection of the different Niles occurred during cyclic wet periods. The River Atbara overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100,000 to 120,000 years ago. The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 70,000\u201380,000 years B.P. wet period. The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12,500 years ago during the [[African humid period]].\n\n=== Role in the founding of Egyptian civilization ===\n[[File:Dhows on the Nile.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A [[felucca]] traversing the Nile near Aswan]]\n\nThe Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that \"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\". An unending source of sustenance, it played a crucial role in the development of Egyptian civilization. Because the river overflowed its banks annually and deposited new layers of silt, the surrounding land was very fertile. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians cultivated and traded [[wheat]], [[flax]], [[papyrus]] and other crops around the Nile. Wheat was a crucial crop in the famine-plagued Middle East. This trading system secured Egypt's diplomatic relationships with other countries, and contributed to economic stability. Far-reaching trade has been carried on along the Nile since ancient times. A tune, [[Hymn to the Nile]], was created and sung by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|title=Hymn to the Nile|date=23 March 2010|publisher=ARCJOHN|access-date=20 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123133714/https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Domestic buffalo|Water buffalo]] were introduced from Asia and the Assyrians introduced [[camel]]s in the 7th century BC. These animals were killed for meat, and were domesticated and used for ploughing\u2014or in the camels' case, carriage. Water was vital to both people and livestock. The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods.\n\nThe Nile was also an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]] was the god of the annual floods, and both he and the [[pharaoh]] were thought to control the flooding. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and the afterlife. The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth, and the west was considered the place of death, as the god [[Ra]], the Sun, underwent birth, death, and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky. Thus, all tombs were west of the Nile, because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife, they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death.\n\nAs the Nile was such an important factor in Egyptian life, the ancient calendar was even based on the three cycles of the Nile. These seasons, each consisting of four months of thirty days each, were called [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]], [[Season of the Emergence|Peret]], and [[Shemu]]. Akhet, which means inundation, was the time of the year when the Nile flooded, leaving several layers of fertile soil behind, aiding in agricultural growth.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\">{{cite book|last1=Springer|first1=Lisa|author2=Neil Morris|title=Art and Culture of Ancient Egypt|year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4358-3589-4|page=8}}</ref> Peret was the growing season, and Shemu, the last season, was the harvest season when there were no rains.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\"/>\n\n=== Search for the source of the Nile ===\n[[File:JH Speke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Hanning Speke|John&nbsp;Hanning&nbsp;Speke]]&nbsp;{{circa|lk=no|1863}}.

P\u00e1ez's account of the source of the Nile<ref>''History of Ethiopia'', circa 1622</ref> is a long and vivid account of Ethiopia.

Telles also used his account.\n\nThe White Nile was even less understood. The ancients mistakenly believed that the [[Niger River]] represented the upper reaches of the White Nile. For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that the Nile had its origins \"in a mountain of lower [[Mauretania]]\", flowed above ground for \"many days\" distance, then went underground, reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the [[Masaesyli]], then sank again below the desert to flow underground \"for a distance of 20 days' journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians.\"<ref>''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 5.10</ref> A merchant named Diogenes reported that the Nile's water attracted game such as buffalo.\n[[File:1911Nile.png|left|thumb|upright=0.9|A map of the Nile {{circa|lk=no|1911}}, a time when its entire primary course ran through British occupations, condominiums, colonies, and protectorates{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=693}}]]\n[[Lake Victoria]] was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when British explorer [[John Hanning Speke]] reached its southern shore while traveling with [[Richard Francis Burton]] to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after the then [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]]. Burton, recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]], was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. British explorer and missionary [[David Livingstone]] pushed too far west and entered the [[Congo River]] system instead. It was ultimately Welsh-American explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] who confirmed Speke's discovery, circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at [[Ripon Falls]] on the lake's northern shore.\n\nEuropean involvement in Egypt goes back to the time of [[Napoleon]].  [[Laird Shipyard]] of [[Liverpool]] sent an iron steamer to the Nile in the 1830s. With the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|British takeover of Egypt]] in the 1882, more British river steamers followed.\n\nThe Nile is the area's natural navigation channel, giving access to Khartoum and Sudan by steamer. The [[Siege of Khartoum]] was broken with purpose-built [[sternwheelers]] shipped from England and steamed up the river to retake the city. After this came regular steam navigation of the river. With [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|British Forces in Egypt]] in the [[World War I|First World War]] and the inter-war years, river steamers provided both security and sightseeing to the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Steam navigation remained integral to the two countries as late as 1962. Sudan steamer traffic was a lifeline as few railways or roads were built in that country.

Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river, and down river using the flow of the river.\nWhile most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The rivers's flow is disturbed at several points by the [[Cataracts of the Nile]], which are sections of faster-flowing water with many small islands, shallow water, and rocks, which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The [[Sudd]] wetlands in Sudan also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impede water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to canalize (the [[Jonglei Canal]]) to bypass the swamps.<ref>{{cite book |last= Shahin |first= Mamdouh |title= Hydrology and Water Resources of Africa |year= 2002 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 1-4020-0866-X |pages= 286\u2013287 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |access-date= 25 July 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222900/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |archive-date= 5 September 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 \"Big Canal To Change Course of Nile River\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905230928/https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 |date=5 September 2015 }}.

The first cataract, the closest to the mouth of the river, is at Aswan, north of the Aswan Dam. This part of the river is a regular tourist route, with cruise ships and traditional wooden sailing boats known as [[felucca]]s. Many cruise ships ply the route between Luxor and Aswan, stopping at [[Edfu]] and [[Kom Ombo]] along the way. Security concerns have limited cruising on the northernmost portion for many years.\n\nA computer simulation study to plan the economic development of the Nile was directed by H.A.W. Morrice and W.N.

M.P. Barnett directed the software development and computer operations. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle was the use of over-year storage, to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water as a function of the month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on [[hydrology transport model]]s, that have been used since the 1980s to analyze water quality.\n\nDespite the development of many reservoirs, drought during the 1980s led to widespread starvation in Ethiopia and Sudan, but Egypt was nourished by water impounded in [[Lake Nasser]]. Drought has proven to be a major cause of fatality in the Nile river basin.

Credited with being the first European to view the source of the Blue Nile which he describes in this volume.\n* ''Voyage historique d'Abissinie'', [[Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo]] (aka Girolamo Lobo), Piero Matini, Firenze; 1693\n\n:One of the most important and earliest sources on Ethiopia and the Nile. Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo (1595\u20131687), a [[Jesuit]] priest, stayed in Ethiopia, mostly in [[Tigray Province|Tigre]], for 9 years and travelled to [[Lake Tana]] and the Blue Nile, reaching the province of [[Damot]]. When the Jesuits were expelled from the country, he too had to leave and did so via [[Massaua]] and [[Suakin]]. \"He was the best expert on Ethiopian matters. After Pais, Lobo is the second European to describe the sources of the Blue Nile and he did so more exactly than Bruce\" (transl. from Henze).\n\n'''18th century'''\n* ''[[Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile|Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile in the Years&nbsp;\u2013 1768, 1770, 1771, 1772, and 1773]]'', [[James Bruce]] of Kinnaird. J. Ruthven for G. GJ. and J. Robinson et al., Edinburgh, 1790 (5 Volumes)\n\n:With time on his hands and at the urging of a friend, Bruce composed this account of his travels on the African continent, including comments on the history and religion of Egypt, an account of Indian trade, a history of [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]], and other material. Although Bruce would not be confused with \"a great scholar or a judicious critic, few books of equal compass are equally entertaining; and few such monuments exist of the energy and enterprise of a single traveller\" (DNB). \"The result of his travels was a very great enrichment of the knowledge of geography and ethnography\" (Cox II, p. 389.) Bruce was one of the earliest westerners to search for the source of the Nile. In November 1770 he reached the source of the Blue Nile, and though he acknowledged that the White Nile was the larger stream, he claimed that the Blue Nile was the Nile of the ancients and that he was thus the discoverer of its source. The account of his travels was written twelve years after his journey and without reference to his journals, which gave critics grounds for disbelief, but the substantial accuracy of the book has since been amply demonstrated.\n\n'''1800\u20131850'''\n* ''Egypt And Mohammed Ali, Or Travels in the Valley of The Nile'', [[James Augustus St. John]], Longman, London, 1834\n\n:St. John traveled extensively in Egypt and [[Nubia]] in 1832\u201333, mainly on foot.

Krapf, during his travels, collected information from the Arab traders operating inland from the coast. From the traders Krapf and his companions learned of great lakes and snow-capped mountains, which Krapf claimed to have seen for himself, much to the ridicule of English explorers who could not believe the idea of snow on the equator.

[[William Blackwood]], Edinburgh; 1861\n\n:Petherick was a well known Welsh traveler in East Central Africa where he had adopted the profession of mining engineer. This work describes sixteen years of his travel throughout Africa. In 1845, he entered the service of Mehemet Ali, and was employed in examining Upper Egypt, Nubia, the [[Red Sea]] coast and [[Kordofan]] in an unsuccessful search for coal. In 1848, he left the Egyptian service and established himself at El Obeid as a trader and was, at the same time made British Consul for the Sudan. In 1853, he removed to [[Khartoum]] and became an ivory trader. He traveled extensively in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr-el-Ghazal]] region, then almost unknown, exploring the [[Jur River|Jur]], [[Yalo]] and other affluents of the [[Ghazal]] and in 1858 he penetrated the [[Zande people|Niam-Niam]] country. Petherick's additions to the knowledge of natural history were considerable, being responsible for the discovery of a number of new species. In 1859, he returned to England where he became acquainted with [[John Speke]], then arranging for an expedition to discover the source of the Nile. While in England, Petherick married and published this account of his travels. He got the idea to join Speke in his travels, and in this volume is an actual subscription and list of subscribers to raise money to send Petherick to join Speke. His subsequent adventures as a consul in Africa were published in a later work.\n* ''Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile'', [[John Hanning Speke]]. [[William Blackwood]], Edinburgh, 1863; Harper & Brothers, New York; 1864\n\n:Speke had previously made an expedition with Sir Richard Burton under the auspices of the Indian government, during which Speke was convinced that he had discovered the source of the Nile. Burton, however, disagreed and ridiculed Speke's account. Speke set off on another expedition, recounted here, in the company of Captain Grant.

Human interference with or destruction of the natural world poses a threat therefore not only to humans but to all organisms constituting the natural order.\n\nDeep ecology's core principle is the belief that the living environment as a whole should be respected and regarded as having certain basic moral and legal [[rights]] to live and flourish, independent of its instrumental benefits for human use. Deep ecology is often framed in terms of the idea of a much broader sociality; it recognizes diverse communities of life on Earth that are composed not only through biotic factors but also, where applicable, through ethical relations, that is, the valuing of other beings as more than just resources. It describes itself as \"deep\" because it regards itself as looking more deeply into the actual reality of humanity's relationship with the natural world arriving at philosophically more profound conclusions than that of the prevailing view of ecology as a branch of biology.<ref name=\"Smith2014\">{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Mick |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology: What is Said and (to be) Done? |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1378/1660 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013156 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}</ref> The movement does not subscribe to [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] environmentalism (which is concerned with conservation of the environment only for exploitation by and for human purposes), since deep ecology is grounded in a quite different set of philosophical assumptions.

In a 2015 article Helen Kopnina advocated teaching deep ecology principles as a form of ecopedagogy to promote patriotism and civic and environmental responsibility in the younger generation in most educational fields by promoting it as a healthy lifestyle. She states there is a global environmental crisis and calls for teaching students to renounce capitalist practices and granting electoral representation to non-humans to remedy this, and claiming her method works by challenging the way we see education. Kopnina advocates confronting students in such a way that they will be forced to consider the moral implications of humanity's destruction of habitats and biodiversity. She advocates forcing students to watch activist propaganda as a trigger, and grading students' individual writing assignments as to how well they have accepted the messaging.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kopnina|first=Helen|date=2015-03-01|title=If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound: Teaching Deep Ecology to Business Students|journal=Journal of Education for Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1177/0973408215569119|issn=0973-4082}}</ref>\n\n===Spirituality===\nN\u00e6ss criticised the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, stating the [[Bible]]'s \"arrogance of stewardship consists in the idea of superiority which underlies the thought that we exist to watch over nature like a highly respected middleman between the Creator and Creation\".<ref name=N\u00e6ss1989/> N\u00e6ss further criticizes the reformation's view of creation as property to be put into maximum productive use.{{cf}}\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===Knowledge of non-human interests===\nAnimal rights activists state that for an entity to require intrinsic rights, it must have interests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/feinberg01.htm\n|last=Feinberg |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Feinberg |title=The Rights of Animals and Future Generations |accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref> Deep ecology is criticised for insisting they can somehow understand the thoughts and personal interests of non-humans such as plants or protists, which they claim thus proves that the assertion non-human lifeforms have interests that are nonexistent or unknowable is incorrect. For example, a single-celled bacteria might move towards a certain chemical stimulation, although such movement might be rationally explained, a deep ecologist might say that this was all invalid because according to ''his'' better understanding of the situation that the intention formulated by this particular bacteria was informed by its deep desire to succeed in life. One criticism of this belief is that the interests that a deep ecologist attributes to non-human organisms such as survival, reproduction, growth, and prosperity are really human interests, which is known as [[anthropomorphism]] or  a [[pathetic fallacy]], in which \"the earth is endowed with 'wisdom', wilderness equates with 'freedom', and life forms are said to emit 'moral' qualities\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Joff |url=http://library.nothingness.org/articles/anar/en/display/310 |title=The Possibility of an Anti-Humanist Anarchism |year=2000 |accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Pister |first=E.

Grey believes that developing a non-anthropocentric set of values is \"a hopeless quest\". He seeks an improved \"shallow\" view, writing, \"What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. We need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception.\"<ref>[http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html Anthropocentrism and Deep Ecology by William Grey]</ref>\n\n===Bookchin's criticisms===\nSome critics, particularly [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologist]] [[Murray Bookchin]], have interpreted deep ecology as being [[misanthropic]], due in part to the characterization of humanity by some deep ecologists, such as [[David Foreman]] of [[Earth First!]], as a pathological infestation on the Earth.<ref name=\"Goodrick-Clarke1998\">[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] (1998). ''[[Hitler's Priestess]]: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth, and Neo-Nazism''. NY: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-3110-4}}</ref> Bookchin therefore asserts that \"deep ecology, formulated largely by privileged male white academics, has managed to bring sincere naturalists like [[Paul Shepard]] into the same company as patently antihumanist and macho mountain men like David Foreman who preach a gospel that humanity is some kind of cancer in the world of life\". Bookchin mentions that some, like Foreman, defend misanthropic measures such as organising the rapid genocide most of humanity and claiming the best solution to kill humans in the Third World is \"to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve\".<ref name=\"Bookchin 1987\">{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/socecovdeepeco.html |title=Social Ecology versus Deep Ecology: A Challenge for the Ecology Movement |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |year=1987 |work=Green Perspectives/Anarchy Archives}}</ref> Fox rebuts that just because deep ecology criticizes anthropocentrism does not mean that deep ecology is misanthropic.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 1993\">{{cite web |url=http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/twimberley/EnviroPhilo/Zimmerman1.pdf |title=Rethinking the Heidegger-Deep Ecology Relationship |last=Zimmerman |first=Michael E |year=1993 |work=Environmental Ethics}}</ref>\n\nBookchin's second major criticism is that deep ecology fails to link environmental crises with [[authoritarianism]] and [[hierarchy]]. Social ecologists like him believe that environmental problems are firmly rooted in the manner of human social interaction, and suggest that deep ecologists fail to recognise the potential for human beings to solve environmental issues through a change of cultural attitudes. According to Bookchin, it is a social reconstruction alone that \"can spare the biosphere from virtual destruction.\"<ref name=\"Bookchin 1987\"/>\n\n===Botkin's criticism===\nDaniel Botkin concludes that although deep ecology challenges the assumptions of [[Western philosophy]] and must be taken seriously in the debate about the relationship between humans and nature, like its antithesis, the [[wise use movement]], they both \"misunderstand scientific information and then arrive at conclusions based on their misunderstanding, which are in turn used as justification for their ideologies. Both begin with an ideology and are political and social in focus\". Botkin has also criticized N\u00e6ss's belief in the concept of some ideal \"balance of nature\", and the contradiction between his argument that all species are morally equal and his disparaging description of [[pioneering species]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Botkin |first=Daniel B. |year=2000 |title=No Man's Garden: Thoreau and a New Vision for Civilization and Nature |publisher=Shearwater Books |pages=https://archive.org/details/nomansgardenthor0000botk/page/42 42, 39] |isbn=978-1-55963-465-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/nomansgardenthor0000botk/page/42}}</ref>\n\n==Links with other philosophies==\n[[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' critiqued anthropocentrism and put the case for animals to be given moral consideration.

Human interference with or destruction of the natural world poses a threat therefore not only to humans but to all organisms constituting the natural order.\n\nDeep ecology's core principle is the belief that the living environment as a whole should be respected and regarded as having certain basic moral and legal [[rights]] to live and flourish, independent of its instrumental benefits for human use. Deep ecology is often framed in terms of the idea of a much broader sociality; it recognizes diverse communities of life on Earth that are composed not only through biotic factors but also, where applicable, through ethical relations, that is, the valuing of other beings as more than just resources. It describes itself as \"deep\" because it regards itself as looking more deeply into the actual reality of humanity's relationship with the natural world arriving at philosophically more profound conclusions than that of the prevailing view of ecology as a branch of biology.<ref name=\"Smith2014\">{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Mick |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology: What is Said and (to be) Done? |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1378/1660 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013156 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}</ref> The movement does not subscribe to [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] environmentalism (which is concerned with conservation of the environment only for exploitation by and for human purposes), since deep ecology is grounded in a quite different set of philosophical assumptions.

In a 2015 article Helen Kopnina advocated teaching deep ecology principles as a form of ecopedagogy to promote patriotism and civic and environmental responsibility in the younger generation in most educational fields by promoting it as a healthy lifestyle. She states there is a global environmental crisis and calls for teaching students to renounce capitalist practices and granting electoral representation to non-humans to remedy this, and claiming her method works by challenging the way we see education. Kopnina advocates confronting students in such a way that they will be forced to consider the moral implications of humanity's destruction of habitats and biodiversity. She advocates forcing students to watch activist propaganda as a trigger, and grading students' individual writing assignments as to how well they have accepted the messaging.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kopnina|first=Helen|date=2015-03-01|title=If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound: Teaching Deep Ecology to Business Students|journal=Journal of Education for Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1177/0973408215569119|issn=0973-4082}}</ref>\n\n===Spirituality===\nN\u00e6ss criticised the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, stating the [[Bible]]'s \"arrogance of stewardship consists in the idea of superiority which underlies the thought that we exist to watch over nature like a highly respected middleman between the Creator and Creation\".<ref name=N\u00e6ss1989/> N\u00e6ss further criticizes the reformation's view of creation as property to be put into maximum productive use.{{cf}}\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===Knowledge of non-human interests===\nAnimal rights activists state that for an entity to require intrinsic rights, it must have interests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/feinberg01.htm\n|last=Feinberg |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Feinberg |title=The Rights of Animals and Future Generations |accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref> Deep ecology is criticised for insisting they can somehow understand the thoughts and personal interests of non-humans such as plants or protists, which they claim thus proves that the assertion non-human lifeforms have interests that are nonexistent or unknowable is incorrect. For example, a single-celled bacteria might move towards a certain chemical stimulation, although such movement might be rationally explained, a deep ecologist might say that this was all invalid because according to ''his'' better understanding of the situation that the intention formulated by this particular bacteria was informed by its deep desire to succeed in life. One criticism of this belief is that the interests that a deep ecologist attributes to non-human organisms such as survival, reproduction, growth, and prosperity are really human interests, which is known as [[anthropomorphism]] or  a [[pathetic fallacy]], in which \"the earth is endowed with 'wisdom', wilderness equates with 'freedom', and life forms are said to emit 'moral' qualities\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Joff |url=http://library.nothingness.org/articles/anar/en/display/310 |title=The Possibility of an Anti-Humanist Anarchism |year=2000 |accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Pister |first=E.

Grey believes that developing a non-anthropocentric set of values is \"a hopeless quest\". He seeks an improved \"shallow\" view, writing, \"What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. We need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception.\"<ref>[http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html Anthropocentrism and Deep Ecology by William Grey]</ref>\n\n===Bookchin's criticisms===\nSome critics, particularly [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologist]] [[Murray Bookchin]], have interpreted deep ecology as being [[misanthropic]], due in part to the characterization of humanity by some deep ecologists, such as [[David Foreman]] of [[Earth First!]], as a pathological infestation on the Earth.<ref name=\"Goodrick-Clarke1998\">[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] (1998). ''[[Hitler's Priestess]]: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth, and Neo-Nazism''. NY: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-3110-4}}</ref> Bookchin therefore asserts that \"deep ecology, formulated largely by privileged male white academics, has managed to bring sincere naturalists like [[Paul Shepard]] into the same company as patently antihumanist and macho mountain men like David Foreman who preach a gospel that humanity is some kind of cancer in the world of life\". Bookchin mentions that some, like Foreman, defend misanthropic measures such as organising the rapid genocide most of humanity and claiming the best solution to kill humans in the Third World is \"to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve\".<ref name=\"Bookchin 1987\">{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/socecovdeepeco.html |title=Social Ecology versus Deep Ecology: A Challenge for the Ecology Movement |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |year=1987 |work=Green Perspectives/Anarchy Archives}}</ref> Fox rebuts that just because deep ecology criticizes anthropocentrism does not mean that deep ecology is misanthropic.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 1993\">{{cite web |url=http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/twimberley/EnviroPhilo/Zimmerman1.pdf |title=Rethinking the Heidegger-Deep Ecology Relationship |last=Zimmerman |first=Michael E |year=1993 |work=Environmental Ethics}}</ref>\n\nBookchin's second major criticism is that deep ecology fails to link environmental crises with [[authoritarianism]] and [[hierarchy]]. Social ecologists like him believe that environmental problems are firmly rooted in the manner of human social interaction, and suggest that deep ecologists fail to recognise the potential for human beings to solve environmental issues through a change of cultural attitudes. According to Bookchin, it is a social reconstruction alone that \"can spare the biosphere from virtual destruction.\"<ref name=\"Bookchin 1987\"/>\n\n===Botkin's criticism===\nDaniel Botkin concludes that although deep ecology challenges the assumptions of [[Western philosophy]] and must be taken seriously in the debate about the relationship between humans and nature, like its antithesis, the [[wise use movement]], they both \"misunderstand scientific information and then arrive at conclusions based on their misunderstanding, which are in turn used as justification for their ideologies. Both begin with an ideology and are political and social in focus\". Botkin has also criticized N\u00e6ss's belief in the concept of some ideal \"balance of nature\", and the contradiction between his argument that all species are morally equal and his disparaging description of [[pioneering species]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Botkin |first=Daniel B. |year=2000 |title=No Man's Garden: Thoreau and a New Vision for Civilization and Nature |publisher=Shearwater Books |pages=https://archive.org/details/nomansgardenthor0000botk/page/42 42, 39] |isbn=978-1-55963-465-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/nomansgardenthor0000botk/page/42}}</ref>\n\n==Links with other philosophies==\n[[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' critiqued anthropocentrism and put the case for animals to be given moral consideration.

This produced the difference between the later accent classes A and B. The length of the previously-accented syllable remains.\n\nThe preservation of the original length is the primary source of pre-tonic length in the later Slavic languages (e.g. [[Serbo-Croatian]]), because inherited Balto-Slavic vowel length had previously been shortened in pre-tonic syllables, without a change in vowel quality. This caused the phonemicization of the previously automatic quality variations between short and long vowels \u2014 e.g. short *o vs. originally long *a.\n\n===Morphophonological theory===\nIn morphophonological theory, the Dybo's law is usually regarded as a right-side drift as a multi-stage process with the consecutive removal of prohibitions. Initially, [[Vladimir Dybo]] and [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] considered the shift of stress to the right to be a single [[Proto-Slavic]] process. This view of the law seems to have been preserved in phonetic theory to this day. Later, [[w:ru:\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Sergei Nikolaev]] discovered that the Early Slavic unified fixed accent paradigm was characterized by column accent on the root, and only in the Late Slavic dialects was the right-side drift of accent from short and circumflex syllables in certain positions carried out in parallel. At the same time, there are a couple of restrictions on right-side accent shift:\n* Prohibition on the right-side accent shift from syllables with a dominant acute.\n* Prohibition on the shift of the accent on syllables with a dominant circumflex.\nCommon Slavic is also considered a shift of accent on internal syllables, as well as on some endings with a dominant a\u0441ut\u0435.\n\n====In the dialects of the \u201cSlovenian\u201d group, with the common for them all:====\n* Prohibition on transferring accent from long syllables to subsequent long syllables, [[Kri\u017eani\u0107's law]].\n* Shift of accent from short syllables to internal and final short syllables and internal syllables with a recessive acute.\n* Shift of accent from long syllables to short syllables, the following systems are distinguished:\n# Prohibition on new shifts of accent \u2014 the [[Styrian dialect group]] and the Prekmurje dialect of Slovenian language, the Kajkavian Zagorski dialect.\n# Shift of accent from short syllables to subsequent middle long syllables, but does not shift to final long syllables \u2014 Ukrainian and Belarusian Polesia dialects, [[Southern Russian dialects]] and Ilmen-Slovenian Russian dialects.\n# Shift of accent from short syllables to subsequent long syllables \u2014 the [[Lower Carniolan dialect group]] (the Slovenian literary language has this system).\n\n====In the dialects of the \u201cAntes\u201d group, with the common for them all:====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n* Shift of accent from long syllables to final long syllables and from initial long and short syllables to internal short syllables.\n* Prohibition on shift accent from short syllables to final long syllables.\n* Prohibition on shift accent from internal short syllables to internal long syllables.\n\n==Examples==\n===Phonetic theory===\nWord-final syllables with the [[Proto-Balto-Slavic#Accent and the acute register|Balto-Slavic acute register]] were shortened and then lost the acute, before the time Dybo's law operated. It could then be lengthened again by [[Van Wijk's law]], producing a long non-acuted vowel. Therefore, when the accent shifted onto a final syllable, the new accent was either circumflex or short, but never acute.\n\nWhen the new accent was circumflex or fell on a [[yer]], the accent was subsequently shifted leftward again by [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]] (a.k.a. Stang's law), resulting in a [[neoacute]] accent:\n* Early Slavic ''*p\u00edrstu'' \"finger\" > MCS ''*p\u044c\u0311rst\u044a'' > (Dybo's law) ''*p\u044c\u0304rst\u044a\u0300'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) LCS ''*p\u044c\u0303rst\u044a'' > obsolete Russian ''perst'', [[genitive case|gen]] [[grammatical number|sg]] ''perst\u00e1''\n* Early Slavic ''*k\u00e1tu'' \"cat\" > MCS ''*k\u020dt\u044a'' > (Dybo's law) ''*kot\u044a\u0300'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) LCS ''*k\u00f5t\u044a''> Russian ''kot'', [[genitive case|gen]] [[grammatical number|sg]] ''kot\u00e1''\n* Early Slavic ''*v\u00e1lj\u0101\u02c0'' \"will\" > (loss of acute) MCS ''*v\u020flja'' > (Van Wijk's law) ''*v\u020flj\u0101'' > (Dybo's law) ''*v\u014dlj\u0203'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) LCS ''*v\u00f5lja'' > Russian ''v\u00f3lja'', Slovak ''v\u00f4\u013ea'' (note, Slovak ''\u00f4'' {{IPA|[u\u032fo]}} specifically reflects neoacute)\n\nWhen the new accent was short (either from an original short vowel or a shortened acute) and Van Wijk's law did not apply, then Iv\u0161i\u0107's law had no effect, and the accent remained on the second syllable:\n\n* Early Slavic ''*g\u00e9n\u0101\u02c0'' \"woman\" > (loss of acute) Middle Common Slavic (MCS) ''*\u017e\u0205na'' > (Dybo's law) Late Common Slavic (LCS) ''*\u017een\u00e0'' > [[Chakavian]] ''\u017een\u0201''\n* Latin ''v\u012bnum'' \"wine\" > MCS ''*v\u020bno'' > (Dybo's law) LCS *v\u012bn\u00f2 > Serbo-Croatian ''v\u00edno'' (with long rising accent, indicating [[neoshtokavian]] accent retraction from the following syllable)\n\nThe acute was preserved in non-final syllables, however. Thus, when shifting onto a non-final syllable, all three accents (acute, circumflex or short) were possible, depending on the state of the syllable before Dybo's law operated.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Jay Jasanoff]]|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|page=57}}</ref> Iv\u0161i\u0107's law in turn operated on forms where the new accent was circumflex, but not where it was acute or short.

In such forms, [[Meillet's law]] resulted in loss of the acute register on the root, so that all initial-accented mobile forms were in principle susceptible to Dybo's law. Jasanoff argues that such forms had a special \"left-marginal accent\", which was not affected by Dybo's law the way the \"lexical accent\" of fixed-accent paradigms was.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Jay Jasanoff]]|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|page=60}}</ref> Thus:\n* Early Slavic ''*v\u00e1d\u0101n'' \"water\" acc. sg. > MCS ''*v\u020dd\u01eb'' > LCS ''*v\u020dd\u01eb'' > Russian ''v\u00f3du'', SC ''v\u020ddu''\n* Early Slavic ''*g\u00e1l\u02c0v\u0101n'' \"head\" acc. sg. > (Meillet's law) MCS ''*g\u020flv\u01eb'' > LCS ''*g\u020flv\u01eb'' > Russian ''g\u00f3lovu'', SC ''gl\u0203vu''\n\n===Morphophonological theory===\nMasculine gender:\n* Early Slavic ''*dv\u00e3ru'' (\u201ccourt\u201d) \u21d2 MCS ''*dv\u00f5r\u044a'' \u21d2 (Dybo's law) LCS ''*dv\u00f5r\u044a'' \u21d2 Belarusian ''\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0301\u0440''; {{smallcaps|'''nom.sg'''}}, ''\u0441f.''

Like Dybo's law, it caused a rightward shift of the accent from non-acuted syllables and a split in the original accentual paradigms. There are some differences, however:\n* Dybo's law shifted the accent rightward regardless of what was in the next syllable, whereas De Saussure's law shifted it only when it was acuted.\n* Dybo's law was blocked in mobile-accented words. Such words never had an acute in the first syllable as a result of [[Meillet's law]], but they nonetheless retained the initial accent. Consequently, there was only a split into three paradigms, with the fixed-accented words splitting into paradigms ''a'' and ''b'', but the mobile-accented words remaining unified under paradigm ''c''.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book |author=[[Ranko Matasovi\u0107]]|title=Poredbenopovijesna gramatika hrvatskoga jezika |location=[[Zagreb]] |publisher=[[Matica hrvatska]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-953-150-840-7 |language=Croatian }}\n* {{cite journal |author=Ronald F.

There are some differences, however:\n* Dybo's law shifted the accent rightward regardless of what was in the next syllable, whereas De Saussure's law shifted it only when it was acuted.\n* Dybo's law was blocked in mobile-accented words. Such words never had an acute in the first syllable as a result of [[Meillet's law]], but they nonetheless retained the initial accent. Consequently, there was only a split into three paradigms, with the fixed-accented words splitting into paradigms ''a'' and ''b'', but the mobile-accented words remaining unified under paradigm ''c''.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book |author=[[Ranko Matasovi\u0107]]|title=Poredbenopovijesna gramatika hrvatskoga jezika |location=[[Zagreb]] |publisher=[[Matica hrvatska]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-953-150-840-7 |language=Croatian }}\n* {{cite journal |author=Ronald F.

Nubra.jpg|thumb|\"Experts Expect the Unexpected.\" Roadsign in [[Nubra Valley]], northern [[Ladakh]], India.]]\n\nAn '''expert''' is someone who has a broad and deep [[Competence (human resources)|competence]] in terms of [[knowledge]], [[skill]] and [[experience]] through practice and education in a particular field. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a [[reliabilism|reliable]] source of [[wikt:technique|technique]] or [[skill]] whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by [[Peer group|peer]]s or the [[General public|public]] in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive [[knowledge]] or [[Aptitude|ability]] based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of [[credential]]s, [[training]], [[education]], [[profession]], [[publication]] or [[experience]], to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may [[official]]ly (and [[expert witness|legally]]) rely upon the individual's [[opinion]] on that topic. Historically, an expert was referred to as a [[Wise old man|sage]] ([[Sage (Sophos)|Sophos]]). The individual was usually a profound [[Intellectual|thinker]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]].\n\nIn specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] for them to be accepted as an expert. In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. Another example from [[computer science]] is that an [[expert system]] may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. In [[law]], an [[expert witness]] must be recognized by [[Logical argument|argument]] and [[authority]].\n\nResearch in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.<ref name='Ericsson1989'>{{Harv|Ericsson|Stasewski|1989}}</ref>\n\n==Expertise==\nExpertise characteristics, skills and knowledge of a person (that is, expert) or of a system, which distinguish experts from novices and less experienced people. In many domains there are objective measures of performance capable of distinguishing experts from novices: expert chess players will almost always win games against recreational chess players; expert [[medical specialist]]s are more likely to diagnose a disease correctly; etc.\n\nThe word expertise is used to refer also to Expert Determination, where an expert is invited to decide a disputed issue. The decision may be binding or advisory, according to the agreement between the parties in dispute.\n\n===Academic views===\nThere are two academic approaches to the understanding and study of expertise. The first understands expertise as an emergent property of [[communities of practice]]. In this view expertise is socially constructed; tools for thinking and scripts for action are jointly constructed within social groups enabling that group jointly to define and acquire expertise in some domain.\n\nIn the second view expertise is a characteristic of individuals and is a consequence of the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. Many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. In many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years' experience<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\">{{Harv|Ericsson|Charness|Feltovich|Hoffman|2006}}</ref> deliberate practice are common. Recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the [[nature and nurture]] argument.<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\"/> Some factors not fitting the nature-nurture dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Chassy|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Campitelli|2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the field of education there is a potential \"expert blind spot\" (see also [[Dunning\u2013Kruger effect]]) in newly practicing educators who are experts in their content area. This is based on the \"expert blind spot hypothesis\" researched by [[Mitchell J. Nathan|Mitchell Nathan]] and Andrew Petrosino (2003: 906). Newly practicing educators with advanced subject-area expertise of an educational content area tend to use the formalities and analysis methods of their particular area of expertise as a major guiding factor of student instruction and knowledge development, rather than being guided by student learning and developmental needs that are prevalent among novice learners.\n\nThe blind spot metaphor refers to the physiological blind spot in human vision in which perceptions of surroundings and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. Beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. This expert blind spot is in part due to an assumption that novices\u2019 cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts\u2019 and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed (Borko & Livingston, 1989: 474). Essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter (Borko, Eisenhart, Brown, Underhill, Jones, & Agard, 1992: 195). Pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators\u2019 experience with instructing learners over time.\n{{sfn|Borko|Livingston|1989}}{{sfn|Nathan|Petrosino|2003}}\n\n===Historical views===\nIn line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of [[power (sociology)|power]]; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. By a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elite's power. In earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. The introduction of the [[printing press]] in Europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. The subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.\n\nPlato's \"[[Noble Lie]]\", concerns expertise. Plato did not believe most people were clever enough to look after their own and society's best interest, so the few clever people of the world needed to lead the rest of the flock. Therefore, the idea was born that only the elite should know the truth in its complete form and the rulers, Plato said, must tell the people of the city \"the noble lie\" to keep them passive and content, without the risk of upheaval and unrest.\n\nIn contemporary society, doctors and scientists, for example, are considered to be experts in that they hold a body of dominant knowledge that is, on the whole, inaccessible to the layman.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Intellectual|last=Fuller|first=Steve|publisher=Icon Books|year=2005|isbn=9781840467215|location=|pages=141}}</ref> However, this inaccessibility and perhaps even mystery that surrounds expertise does not cause the layman to disregard the opinion of the experts on account of the unknown. Instead, the complete opposite occurs whereby members of the public believe in and highly value the opinion of medical professionals or of scientific discoveries,<ref name=\":0\" /> despite not understanding it.\n\n===Related research===\nA number of computational models have been developed in [[cognitive science]] to explain the development from novice to expert. In particular, [[Herbert A. Simon]] and Kevin Gilmartin proposed a model of learning in chess called MAPP (Memory-Aided Pattern Recognizer).<ref>Simon and Gilmartin (1973)</ref> Based on simulations, they estimated that about 50,000 [[chunking (psychology)#Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures|chunks]] (units of memory) are necessary to become an expert, and hence the many years needed to reach this level. More recently, the [[CHREST|CHREST model]] (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures) has simulated in detail a number of phenomena in chess expertise (eye movements, performance in a variety of memory tasks, development from novice to expert) and in other domains.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Simon|2000}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|de Voogt|Retschitzki|2004}}</ref>\n\nAn important feature of expert performance seems to be the way in which experts are able to rapidly retrieve complex configurations of information from long-term memory. They recognize situations because they have meaning. It is perhaps this central concern with meaning and how it attaches to situations which provides an important link between the individual and social approaches to the development of expertise. Work on \"Skilled Memory and Expertise\" by [[Anders Ericsson]] and [[James J. Staszewski]] confronts the paradox of expertise and claims that people not only acquire content knowledge as they practice cognitive skills, they also develop mechanisms that enable them to use a large and familiar knowledge base efficiently.<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\n\nWork on [[expert systems]] (computer software designed to provide an answer to a problem, or clarify uncertainties where normally one or more human experts would need to be consulted) typically is grounded on the premise that expertise is based on acquired repertoires of rules and frameworks for decision making which can be elicited as the basis for computer supported judgment and decision-making. However, there is increasing evidence that expertise does not work in this fashion. Rather, experts recognize situations based on experience of many prior situations. They are in consequence able to make rapid decisions in complex and dynamic situations.\n\nIn a critique of the expert systems literature {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005}} suggest:\n<blockquote> If one asks an expert for the rules he or she is using, one will, in effect, force the expert to regress to the level of a beginner and state the rules learned in school. Thus, instead of using rules they no longer remember, as knowledge engineers suppose, the expert is forced to remember rules they no longer use. \u2026 No amount of rules and facts can capture the knowledge an expert has when he or she has stored experience of the actual outcomes of tens of thousands of situations.<ref>{{Harv|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005|p=788}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Skilled memory theory====\n<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\nThe role of long term memory in the skilled memory effect was first articulated by Chase and Simon in their classic studies of chess expertise. They asserted that organized patterns of information stored in long term memory (chunks) mediated experts' rapid encoding and superior retention. Their study revealed that all subjects retrieved about the same number of chunks, but the size of the chunks varied with subjects' prior experience. Experts' chunks contained more individual pieces than those of novices. This research did not investigate how experts find, distinguish, and retrieve the right chunks from the vast number they hold without a lengthy search of long term memory.\n\nSkilled memory enables experts to rapidly encode, store, and retrieve information within the domain of their expertise and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations that typically constrain novice performance. For example, it explains experts' ability to recall large amounts of material displayed for only brief study intervals, provided that the material comes from their domain of expertise. When unfamiliar material (not from their domain of expertise) is presented to experts, their recall is no better than that of novices.\n\nThe first principle of skilled memory, the ''meaningful encoding principle,'' states that experts exploit prior knowledge to durably encode information needed to perform a familiar task successfully. Experts form more elaborate and accessible memory representations than novices. The elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory codes that create multiple potential cues and avenues for retrieval.\n\nThe second principle, the ''retrieval structure principle'' states that experts develop memory mechanisms called retrieval structures to facilitate the retrieval of information stored in long term memory. These mechanisms operate in a fashion consistent with the meaningful encoding principle to provide cues that can later be regenerated to retrieve the stored information efficiently without a lengthy search.\n\nThe third principle, the ''speed up principle'' states that long term memory encoding and retrieval operations speed up with practice, so that their speed and accuracy approach the speed and accuracy of short term memory storage and retrieval.\n\nExamples of skilled memory research described within the Ericsson and Stasewski study include:\n* a '''waiter''' who can accurately remember up to 20 complete dinner orders in an actual restaurant setting by using mnemonic strategy, patterns, and spatial relations (position of the person ordering). At the time of recall all items of a category (e.g., all salad dressings, then all meat temperatures, then all steak types, then all starch type) would be recalled in clockwise for all customers.\n* a '''running enthusiast''' who grouped together short random sequences of digits and encoded the groups in terms of their meaning as running times, dates, and ages. He was thus able to recall over 84% of all digit groups presented in a session totaling 200-300 digits. His expertise was limited to digits; when a switch from digits to letters of the alphabet was made he exhibited no transfer\u2014his memory span dropped back to about six consonants.\n* '''math enthusiasts''' who can in less than 25 seconds mentally solve 2 x 5 digit multiplication problems (e.g., 23 x 48,856) that have been presented orally by the researcher.\n\n====In problem solving====\nMuch of the research regarding expertise involves the studies of how experts and novices differ in solving problems (Chi, M. T. H., Glasser R., & Rees, E.,1982). Mathematics (Sweller, J., Mawer, R. F., & Ward, M. R., 1983) and physics (Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981) are common domains for these studies.\n\nOne of the most cited works in this area, Chi et al. (1981), examines how experts (PhD students in physics) and novices (undergraduate students that completed one semester of mechanics) categorize and represent physics problems. They found that novices sort problems into categories based upon surface features (e.g., keywords in the problem statement or visual configurations of the objects depicted). Experts, however, categorize problems based upon their deep structures (i.e., the main physics principle used to solve the problem).\n\nTheir findings also suggest that while the schemas of both novices and experts are activated by the same features of a problem statement, the experts\u2019 schemas contain more procedural knowledge which aid in determining which principle to apply, and novices\u2019 schemas contain mostly declarative knowledge which do not aid in determining methods for solution.\n\n====Germain's scale====\nRelative to a specific field, an expert has:\n* Specific education, training, and knowledge\n* Required qualifications\n* Ability to assess importance in work-related situations\n* Capability to improve themselves\n* Intuition\n* Self-assurance and confidence in their knowledge\n\nMarie-Line Germain (Germain, 2006) developed a psychometric measure of perception of employee expertise called the Generalized Expertise Measure (GEM). She defined a behavioral dimension in experts, in addition to the dimensions suggested by Swanson and Holton (2001). Her 16-item scale contains objective expertise items and subjective expertise items. Objective items were named Evidence-Based items. Subjective items (the remaining 11 items from the measure below) were named Self-Enhancement items because of their behavioral component.\n\n* This person has knowledge specific to a field of work.\n* This person shows they have the education necessary to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has the qualifications required to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has been trained in their area of expertise.\n* This person is ambitious about their work in the company.\n* This person can assess whether a work-related situation is important or not.\n* This person is capable of improving themselves.\n* This person is charismatic.\n* This person can deduce things from work-related situations easily.\n* This person is intuitive in the job.\n* This person is able to judge what things are important in their job.\n* This person has the drive to become what they are capable of becoming in their field.\n* This person is self-assured.\n* This person has self-confidence.\n* This person is outgoing.\n(Condensed from Germain, 2006).\n\n; References\n* Germain, M.-L.

Considered an appeal to ethos or \"the personal character of the speaker\",<ref>Aristotle. \"Rhetoric.\" Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. The Basic Works of Aristotle. Ed. Richard McKeon. New York: Modern Library, 2001. Print.</ref> established expertise allows a speaker to make statements regarding special topics of which the audience may be ignorant. In other words, the expert enjoys the deference of the audience's judgment and can appeal to authority where a non-expert cannot.\n\nIn The Rhetoric of Expertise, E. Johanna Hartelius defines two basic modes of expertise: autonomous and attributed expertise. While an autonomous expert can \"possess expert knowledge without recognition from other people,\" attributed expertise is \"a performance that may or may not indicate genuine knowledge.\" With these two categories, Hartelius isolates the rhetorical problems faced by experts: just as someone with autonomous expertise may not possess the skill to persuade people to hold their points of view, someone with merely attributed expertise may be persuasive but lack the actual knowledge pertaining to a given subject. The problem faced by audiences follows from the problem facing experts: when faced with competing claims of expertise, what resources do non-experts have to evaluate claims put before them?<ref>Hartelius, E. Johanna. The Rhetoric of Expertise. Lanham: Lexington, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\n===Dialogic Expertise===\nHartelius and other scholars have also noted the challenges that projects such as Wikipedia pose to how experts have traditionally constructed their authority. In \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise\", she highlights Wikipedia as an example of the \"dialogic expertise\" made possible by collaborative digital spaces. Predicated upon the notion that \"truth emerges from dialogue\", Wikipedia challenges traditional expertise both because anyone can edit it and because no single person, regardless of their credentials, can end a discussion by fiat. In other words, the community, rather than single individuals, direct the course of discussion. The production of knowledge, then, as a process of dialogue and argumentation, becomes an inherently rhetorical activity.<ref>Hartelus, E. Johanna. \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise.\" Southern Communication Journal 75.5 (2010). Web.</ref>\n\nHartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: \u201cnetwork norms of dialogic collaboration\u201d and \u201cdeferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism\u201d; Wikipedia being evidence of the first.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\">Hartelius, E. Johanna. (2011). Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise. Southern Communication Journal, Vol. 75, No. 5, Nov\u2013Dec 2010, pp. 505\u2013526.</ref> Drawing on a [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtinian framework]], Hartelius posits that Wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals\u2019 ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius compares Wikipedia's methodology of open-ended discussions of topics to that of [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin's theory of speech communication]], where genuine [[dialogue]] is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius acknowledges that [[knowledge]], [[experience]], [[training]], [[skill]], and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, Hartelius explains that expertise: \u201c(...) is not simply about one person\u2019s skills being different from another\u2019s. It is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. Rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius further suggests that Wikipedia's dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges [[Encyclopedia|traditional encyclopedias]] and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, Hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. Wikipedia's use of [[hyperlink]]s to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that Wikipedia's way of knowing is dialogic.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the [[discourse community]].<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> The ongoing dialogue between contributors on Wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. As Hartelius explains: \u201cThe very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> While Wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. Knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> According to Hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on Wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site's hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> By Wikipedia's hortative discourse, Hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> One further reason to the emergence of dialogic expertise on Wikipedia is the site's [[Wikipedia:Community portal|community pages]], which function as a techne; explicating Wikipedia's expert methodology.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/>\n\n===Networked Expertise===\n{{See also|Wisdom of the crowd}}\nBuilding on Hartelius, Damien Pfister developed the concept of \"networked expertise\". Noting that Wikipedia employs a [[Many-to-many|\"many to many\"]] rather than a \"one to one\" model of communication, he notes how expertise likewise shifts to become a quality of a group rather than an individual. With the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. As he puts it, \"With the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the Web means that what and how to information is readily available.\" The rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is given to those with the procedural knowledge of how to find information called for by a situation.<ref>Pfister, Damien. \"Networked Expertise in the Era of Many-to-many Communication: On Wikipedia and Invention.\" Social Epistemology: A Journal of Knowledge, Culture, and Policy 25.3 (2011). Web.</ref>\n\n==Contrasts and comparisons==\n\n===Associated terms===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nAn expert differs from the specialist in that a specialist has to ''be able to solve'' a [[problem]] and an expert has to ''know its solution''. The opposite of an expert is generally known as a [[layperson]], while someone who occupies a middle grade of understanding is generally known as a [[technician]] and often employed to assist experts. A person may well be an expert in one field and a layperson in many other fields. The concepts of experts and expertise are debated within the field of [[epistemology]] under the general heading of expert knowledge. In contrast, the opposite of a specialist would be a [[wikt:generalist|generalist]] or [[polymath]].\n\nThe term is widely used informally, with people being described as 'experts' in order to bolster the relative value of their opinion, when no [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria for their expertise is available. The term [[crank (person)|crank]] is likewise used to disparage opinions. [[Academic elitism]] arises when experts become convinced that only their opinion is useful, sometimes on matters beyond their personal expertise.\n\nIn contrast to an expert, a [[novice]] (known [[colloquially]] as a [[newbie]] or 'greenhorn') is any person that is new to any science or field of study or activity or social cause and who is undergoing training in order to meet normal requirements of being regarded a mature and equal participant.\n\n\"Expert\" is also being mistakenly interchanged with the term \"[[authority]]\" in new media. An expert can be an authority if through relationships to people and technology, that expert is allowed to control access to his expertise. However, a person who merely wields authority is not by right an expert. In new media, users are being misled by the term \"authority\". Many sites and search engines such as Google and Technorati use the term \"authority\" to denote the link value and traffic to a particular topic. However, this authority only measures populist information. It in no way assures that the author of that site or blog is an expert.\n\n===Developmental characteristics===\nSome characteristics of the development of an expert have been found to include\n* A characterization of this practice as \"deliberate practice\", which forces the practitioner to come up with new ways to encourage and enable themselves to reach new levels of performance<ref name=\":1\" />\n* An early phase of learning which is characterized by enjoyment, excitement, and participation without outcome-related goals<ref>Janet L. Starkes, K Anders Ericsson (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=gl8nqUjyXWUC&pg=PA91 Expert Performance in Sports] Advances in Research on Sport Expertise. p. 91</ref>\n* The ability to rearrange or construct a higher dimension of creativity. Due to such familiarity or advanced knowledge experts can develop more abstract perspectives of their concepts and/or performances.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/expert|title=Definition of EXPERT|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Use in literature==\n[[Mark Twain]] defined an expert as \"an ordinary fellow from another town\".<ref>[needs quotation reference]{{Citation needed|reason=Is this the right template to use?|date=November 2016}}</ref> [[Will Rogers]] described an expert as \"A man fifty miles from home with a briefcase.\" Danish scientist and Nobel laureate [[Niels Bohr]] defined an expert as \"A person that has made every possible mistake within his or her field.\"<ref name=\"Life Magazine\">{{cite magazine|last1=Robert Coughlan|first1=Quoted by Dr Edward Teller|title=Dr. Edward Teller's Magnificent Obsession|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62#v=onepage&q&f=false|magazine=Life Magazine|accessdate=13 February 2017|date=1954-09-06}}</ref>\n[[Malcolm Gladwell]] describes expertise as a matter of practicing the correct way for a total of around 10,000 hours.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Education}}\n* {{annotated link|Perceptual learning}}\n* {{annotated link|Consultant}}\n* {{annotated link|Polymath}}\n\n===General===\n* {{annotated link|Scholar}}\n* {{annotated link|Know-how}}\n* {{annotated link|Skill}}\n* {{annotated link|Competence (human resources)|Competence}}\n* {{annotated link|Excellence}}\n* {{annotated link|Technocracy}}\n* {{annotated link|Insider}}\n* {{annotated link|Tutor expertise in adult education}}\n\n===Criticism===\n* {{annotated link|Anti-intellectualism}}\n* {{annotated link|Denialism}}\n* {{annotated link|The Death of Expertise}}\n* {{annotated link|Gibson's law}}\n\n===Psychology===\n* {{annotated link|Dreyfus model of skill acquisition}}\n* {{annotated link|Dunning\u2013Kruger effect}}\n* {{annotated link|Pygmalion effect}}\n* {{annotated link|Rational skepticism}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Borko |first=Hilda |last2=Livingston |first2=Carol |year=1989 |title=Cognition and Improvisation: Differences in Mathematics Instruction by Expert and Novice Teachers |jstor=1162861 |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=Winter 1989, Vol. 26, No. 4 |issue=4 |pages=473\u2013498|doi=10.3102/00028312026004473 }}\n* {{cite book | ref=harv | last=Chase | first=W.G. | last2=Simon | first2=Herbert A. | author2-link=Herbert A.

Nubra.jpg|thumb|\"Experts Expect the Unexpected.\" Roadsign in [[Nubra Valley]], northern [[Ladakh]], India.]]\n\nAn '''expert''' is someone who has a broad and deep [[Competence (human resources)|competence]] in terms of [[knowledge]], [[skill]] and [[experience]] through practice and education in a particular field. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a [[reliabilism|reliable]] source of [[wikt:technique|technique]] or [[skill]] whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by [[Peer group|peer]]s or the [[General public|public]] in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive [[knowledge]] or [[Aptitude|ability]] based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of [[credential]]s, [[training]], [[education]], [[profession]], [[publication]] or [[experience]], to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may [[official]]ly (and [[expert witness|legally]]) rely upon the individual's [[opinion]] on that topic. Historically, an expert was referred to as a [[Wise old man|sage]] ([[Sage (Sophos)|Sophos]]). The individual was usually a profound [[Intellectual|thinker]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]].\n\nIn specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] for them to be accepted as an expert. In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. Another example from [[computer science]] is that an [[expert system]] may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. In [[law]], an [[expert witness]] must be recognized by [[Logical argument|argument]] and [[authority]].\n\nResearch in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.<ref name='Ericsson1989'>{{Harv|Ericsson|Stasewski|1989}}</ref>\n\n==Expertise==\nExpertise characteristics, skills and knowledge of a person (that is, expert) or of a system, which distinguish experts from novices and less experienced people. In many domains there are objective measures of performance capable of distinguishing experts from novices: expert chess players will almost always win games against recreational chess players; expert [[medical specialist]]s are more likely to diagnose a disease correctly; etc.\n\nThe word expertise is used to refer also to Expert Determination, where an expert is invited to decide a disputed issue. The decision may be binding or advisory, according to the agreement between the parties in dispute.\n\n===Academic views===\nThere are two academic approaches to the understanding and study of expertise. The first understands expertise as an emergent property of [[communities of practice]]. In this view expertise is socially constructed; tools for thinking and scripts for action are jointly constructed within social groups enabling that group jointly to define and acquire expertise in some domain.\n\nIn the second view expertise is a characteristic of individuals and is a consequence of the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. Many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. In many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years' experience<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\">{{Harv|Ericsson|Charness|Feltovich|Hoffman|2006}}</ref> deliberate practice are common. Recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the [[nature and nurture]] argument.<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\"/> Some factors not fitting the nature-nurture dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Chassy|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Campitelli|2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the field of education there is a potential \"expert blind spot\" (see also [[Dunning\u2013Kruger effect]]) in newly practicing educators who are experts in their content area. This is based on the \"expert blind spot hypothesis\" researched by [[Mitchell J. Nathan|Mitchell Nathan]] and Andrew Petrosino (2003: 906). Newly practicing educators with advanced subject-area expertise of an educational content area tend to use the formalities and analysis methods of their particular area of expertise as a major guiding factor of student instruction and knowledge development, rather than being guided by student learning and developmental needs that are prevalent among novice learners.\n\nThe blind spot metaphor refers to the physiological blind spot in human vision in which perceptions of surroundings and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. Beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. This expert blind spot is in part due to an assumption that novices\u2019 cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts\u2019 and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed (Borko & Livingston, 1989: 474). Essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter (Borko, Eisenhart, Brown, Underhill, Jones, & Agard, 1992: 195). Pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators\u2019 experience with instructing learners over time.\n{{sfn|Borko|Livingston|1989}}{{sfn|Nathan|Petrosino|2003}}\n\n===Historical views===\nIn line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of [[power (sociology)|power]]; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. By a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elite's power. In earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. The introduction of the [[printing press]] in Europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. The subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.\n\nPlato's \"[[Noble Lie]]\", concerns expertise. Plato did not believe most people were clever enough to look after their own and society's best interest, so the few clever people of the world needed to lead the rest of the flock. Therefore, the idea was born that only the elite should know the truth in its complete form and the rulers, Plato said, must tell the people of the city \"the noble lie\" to keep them passive and content, without the risk of upheaval and unrest.\n\nIn contemporary society, doctors and scientists, for example, are considered to be experts in that they hold a body of dominant knowledge that is, on the whole, inaccessible to the layman.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Intellectual|last=Fuller|first=Steve|publisher=Icon Books|year=2005|isbn=9781840467215|location=|pages=141}}</ref> However, this inaccessibility and perhaps even mystery that surrounds expertise does not cause the layman to disregard the opinion of the experts on account of the unknown. Instead, the complete opposite occurs whereby members of the public believe in and highly value the opinion of medical professionals or of scientific discoveries,<ref name=\":0\" /> despite not understanding it.\n\n===Related research===\nA number of computational models have been developed in [[cognitive science]] to explain the development from novice to expert. In particular, [[Herbert A. Simon]] and Kevin Gilmartin proposed a model of learning in chess called MAPP (Memory-Aided Pattern Recognizer).<ref>Simon and Gilmartin (1973)</ref> Based on simulations, they estimated that about 50,000 [[chunking (psychology)#Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures|chunks]] (units of memory) are necessary to become an expert, and hence the many years needed to reach this level. More recently, the [[CHREST|CHREST model]] (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures) has simulated in detail a number of phenomena in chess expertise (eye movements, performance in a variety of memory tasks, development from novice to expert) and in other domains.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Simon|2000}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|de Voogt|Retschitzki|2004}}</ref>\n\nAn important feature of expert performance seems to be the way in which experts are able to rapidly retrieve complex configurations of information from long-term memory. They recognize situations because they have meaning. It is perhaps this central concern with meaning and how it attaches to situations which provides an important link between the individual and social approaches to the development of expertise. Work on \"Skilled Memory and Expertise\" by [[Anders Ericsson]] and [[James J. Staszewski]] confronts the paradox of expertise and claims that people not only acquire content knowledge as they practice cognitive skills, they also develop mechanisms that enable them to use a large and familiar knowledge base efficiently.<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\n\nWork on [[expert systems]] (computer software designed to provide an answer to a problem, or clarify uncertainties where normally one or more human experts would need to be consulted) typically is grounded on the premise that expertise is based on acquired repertoires of rules and frameworks for decision making which can be elicited as the basis for computer supported judgment and decision-making. However, there is increasing evidence that expertise does not work in this fashion. Rather, experts recognize situations based on experience of many prior situations. They are in consequence able to make rapid decisions in complex and dynamic situations.\n\nIn a critique of the expert systems literature {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005}} suggest:\n<blockquote> If one asks an expert for the rules he or she is using, one will, in effect, force the expert to regress to the level of a beginner and state the rules learned in school. Thus, instead of using rules they no longer remember, as knowledge engineers suppose, the expert is forced to remember rules they no longer use. \u2026 No amount of rules and facts can capture the knowledge an expert has when he or she has stored experience of the actual outcomes of tens of thousands of situations.<ref>{{Harv|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005|p=788}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Skilled memory theory====\n<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\nThe role of long term memory in the skilled memory effect was first articulated by Chase and Simon in their classic studies of chess expertise. They asserted that organized patterns of information stored in long term memory (chunks) mediated experts' rapid encoding and superior retention. Their study revealed that all subjects retrieved about the same number of chunks, but the size of the chunks varied with subjects' prior experience. Experts' chunks contained more individual pieces than those of novices. This research did not investigate how experts find, distinguish, and retrieve the right chunks from the vast number they hold without a lengthy search of long term memory.\n\nSkilled memory enables experts to rapidly encode, store, and retrieve information within the domain of their expertise and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations that typically constrain novice performance. For example, it explains experts' ability to recall large amounts of material displayed for only brief study intervals, provided that the material comes from their domain of expertise. When unfamiliar material (not from their domain of expertise) is presented to experts, their recall is no better than that of novices.\n\nThe first principle of skilled memory, the ''meaningful encoding principle,'' states that experts exploit prior knowledge to durably encode information needed to perform a familiar task successfully. Experts form more elaborate and accessible memory representations than novices. The elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory codes that create multiple potential cues and avenues for retrieval.\n\nThe second principle, the ''retrieval structure principle'' states that experts develop memory mechanisms called retrieval structures to facilitate the retrieval of information stored in long term memory. These mechanisms operate in a fashion consistent with the meaningful encoding principle to provide cues that can later be regenerated to retrieve the stored information efficiently without a lengthy search.\n\nThe third principle, the ''speed up principle'' states that long term memory encoding and retrieval operations speed up with practice, so that their speed and accuracy approach the speed and accuracy of short term memory storage and retrieval.\n\nExamples of skilled memory research described within the Ericsson and Stasewski study include:\n* a '''waiter''' who can accurately remember up to 20 complete dinner orders in an actual restaurant setting by using mnemonic strategy, patterns, and spatial relations (position of the person ordering). At the time of recall all items of a category (e.g., all salad dressings, then all meat temperatures, then all steak types, then all starch type) would be recalled in clockwise for all customers.\n* a '''running enthusiast''' who grouped together short random sequences of digits and encoded the groups in terms of their meaning as running times, dates, and ages. He was thus able to recall over 84% of all digit groups presented in a session totaling 200-300 digits. His expertise was limited to digits; when a switch from digits to letters of the alphabet was made he exhibited no transfer\u2014his memory span dropped back to about six consonants.\n* '''math enthusiasts''' who can in less than 25 seconds mentally solve 2 x 5 digit multiplication problems (e.g., 23 x 48,856) that have been presented orally by the researcher.\n\n====In problem solving====\nMuch of the research regarding expertise involves the studies of how experts and novices differ in solving problems (Chi, M. T. H., Glasser R., & Rees, E.,1982). Mathematics (Sweller, J., Mawer, R. F., & Ward, M. R., 1983) and physics (Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981) are common domains for these studies.\n\nOne of the most cited works in this area, Chi et al. (1981), examines how experts (PhD students in physics) and novices (undergraduate students that completed one semester of mechanics) categorize and represent physics problems. They found that novices sort problems into categories based upon surface features (e.g., keywords in the problem statement or visual configurations of the objects depicted). Experts, however, categorize problems based upon their deep structures (i.e., the main physics principle used to solve the problem).\n\nTheir findings also suggest that while the schemas of both novices and experts are activated by the same features of a problem statement, the experts\u2019 schemas contain more procedural knowledge which aid in determining which principle to apply, and novices\u2019 schemas contain mostly declarative knowledge which do not aid in determining methods for solution.\n\n====Germain's scale====\nRelative to a specific field, an expert has:\n* Specific education, training, and knowledge\n* Required qualifications\n* Ability to assess importance in work-related situations\n* Capability to improve themselves\n* Intuition\n* Self-assurance and confidence in their knowledge\n\nMarie-Line Germain (Germain, 2006) developed a psychometric measure of perception of employee expertise called the Generalized Expertise Measure (GEM). She defined a behavioral dimension in experts, in addition to the dimensions suggested by Swanson and Holton (2001). Her 16-item scale contains objective expertise items and subjective expertise items. Objective items were named Evidence-Based items. Subjective items (the remaining 11 items from the measure below) were named Self-Enhancement items because of their behavioral component.\n\n* This person has knowledge specific to a field of work.\n* This person shows they have the education necessary to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has the qualifications required to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has been trained in their area of expertise.\n* This person is ambitious about their work in the company.\n* This person can assess whether a work-related situation is important or not.\n* This person is capable of improving themselves.\n* This person is charismatic.\n* This person can deduce things from work-related situations easily.\n* This person is intuitive in the job.\n* This person is able to judge what things are important in their job.\n* This person has the drive to become what they are capable of becoming in their field.\n* This person is self-assured.\n* This person has self-confidence.\n* This person is outgoing.\n(Condensed from Germain, 2006).\n\n; References\n* Germain, M.-L.

Considered an appeal to ethos or \"the personal character of the speaker\",<ref>Aristotle. \"Rhetoric.\" Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. The Basic Works of Aristotle. Ed. Richard McKeon. New York: Modern Library, 2001. Print.</ref> established expertise allows a speaker to make statements regarding special topics of which the audience may be ignorant. In other words, the expert enjoys the deference of the audience's judgment and can appeal to authority where a non-expert cannot.\n\nIn The Rhetoric of Expertise, E. Johanna Hartelius defines two basic modes of expertise: autonomous and attributed expertise. While an autonomous expert can \"possess expert knowledge without recognition from other people,\" attributed expertise is \"a performance that may or may not indicate genuine knowledge.\" With these two categories, Hartelius isolates the rhetorical problems faced by experts: just as someone with autonomous expertise may not possess the skill to persuade people to hold their points of view, someone with merely attributed expertise may be persuasive but lack the actual knowledge pertaining to a given subject. The problem faced by audiences follows from the problem facing experts: when faced with competing claims of expertise, what resources do non-experts have to evaluate claims put before them?<ref>Hartelius, E. Johanna. The Rhetoric of Expertise. Lanham: Lexington, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\n===Dialogic Expertise===\nHartelius and other scholars have also noted the challenges that projects such as Wikipedia pose to how experts have traditionally constructed their authority. In \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise\", she highlights Wikipedia as an example of the \"dialogic expertise\" made possible by collaborative digital spaces. Predicated upon the notion that \"truth emerges from dialogue\", Wikipedia challenges traditional expertise both because anyone can edit it and because no single person, regardless of their credentials, can end a discussion by fiat. In other words, the community, rather than single individuals, direct the course of discussion. The production of knowledge, then, as a process of dialogue and argumentation, becomes an inherently rhetorical activity.<ref>Hartelus, E. Johanna. \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise.\" Southern Communication Journal 75.5 (2010). Web.</ref>\n\nHartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: \u201cnetwork norms of dialogic collaboration\u201d and \u201cdeferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism\u201d; Wikipedia being evidence of the first.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\">Hartelius, E. Johanna. (2011). Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise. Southern Communication Journal, Vol. 75, No. 5, Nov\u2013Dec 2010, pp. 505\u2013526.</ref> Drawing on a [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtinian framework]], Hartelius posits that Wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals\u2019 ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius compares Wikipedia's methodology of open-ended discussions of topics to that of [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin's theory of speech communication]], where genuine [[dialogue]] is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius acknowledges that [[knowledge]], [[experience]], [[training]], [[skill]], and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, Hartelius explains that expertise: \u201c(...) is not simply about one person\u2019s skills being different from another\u2019s. It is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. Rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius further suggests that Wikipedia's dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges [[Encyclopedia|traditional encyclopedias]] and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, Hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. Wikipedia's use of [[hyperlink]]s to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that Wikipedia's way of knowing is dialogic.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the [[discourse community]].<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> The ongoing dialogue between contributors on Wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. As Hartelius explains: \u201cThe very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> While Wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. Knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> According to Hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on Wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site's hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> By Wikipedia's hortative discourse, Hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> One further reason to the emergence of dialogic expertise on Wikipedia is the site's [[Wikipedia:Community portal|community pages]], which function as a techne; explicating Wikipedia's expert methodology.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/>\n\n===Networked Expertise===\n{{See also|Wisdom of the crowd}}\nBuilding on Hartelius, Damien Pfister developed the concept of \"networked expertise\". Noting that Wikipedia employs a [[Many-to-many|\"many to many\"]] rather than a \"one to one\" model of communication, he notes how expertise likewise shifts to become a quality of a group rather than an individual. With the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. As he puts it, \"With the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the Web means that what and how to information is readily available.\" The rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is given to those with the procedural knowledge of how to find information called for by a situation.<ref>Pfister, Damien. \"Networked Expertise in the Era of Many-to-many Communication: On Wikipedia and Invention.\" Social Epistemology: A Journal of Knowledge, Culture, and Policy 25.3 (2011). Web.</ref>\n\n==Contrasts and comparisons==\n\n===Associated terms===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nAn expert differs from the specialist in that a specialist has to ''be able to solve'' a [[problem]] and an expert has to ''know its solution''. The opposite of an expert is generally known as a [[layperson]], while someone who occupies a middle grade of understanding is generally known as a [[technician]] and often employed to assist experts. A person may well be an expert in one field and a layperson in many other fields. The concepts of experts and expertise are debated within the field of [[epistemology]] under the general heading of expert knowledge. In contrast, the opposite of a specialist would be a [[wikt:generalist|generalist]] or [[polymath]].\n\nThe term is widely used informally, with people being described as 'experts' in order to bolster the relative value of their opinion, when no [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria for their expertise is available. The term [[crank (person)|crank]] is likewise used to disparage opinions. [[Academic elitism]] arises when experts become convinced that only their opinion is useful, sometimes on matters beyond their personal expertise.\n\nIn contrast to an expert, a [[novice]] (known [[colloquially]] as a [[newbie]] or 'greenhorn') is any person that is new to any science or field of study or activity or social cause and who is undergoing training in order to meet normal requirements of being regarded a mature and equal participant.\n\n\"Expert\" is also being mistakenly interchanged with the term \"[[authority]]\" in new media. An expert can be an authority if through relationships to people and technology, that expert is allowed to control access to his expertise. However, a person who merely wields authority is not by right an expert. In new media, users are being misled by the term \"authority\".

By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown <ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>.  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

Similarly, if any of these elements is depicted in such a way that diverges from typical depictions, that strengthens the message they intend to communicate by drawing in the viewer's attention.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=46}} Contrasting gestures between right and left arm are typical and serve to sensitize the viewer to summon interpretation,{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=48}} or in the words of critic Philip Conisbee, a \"narrative portrait with a didactic purpose.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=49}}\n\nJander theorizes that an inspiration for M\u00e4hler's portrait is Leopold Radoux's 1773 portrait of Beethoven's grandfather, also named Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773), which the composer had prominently displayed in his apartment.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=57}} Notably, one of the features of this portrait (painted the same year as the subject's death) was a cape falling off the back of the subject.  To Jander, this represents the overcoming of grief that befell Beethoven's grandfather upon the death of his wife from alcoholism while maintaining a family life (his son [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]]\u2014the younger Ludwig van Beethoven's father\u2014also suffered and eventually died from alcoholism). To understand the possible effect upon the composer, Jander cites 18th century mathematician and art theorist [[Johann Georg Sulzer]] who in his ''Allgemeine Theorie der sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste'' provided an understanding on how an ancestor's portrait can have a healing effect on descendants.  \"The bonds of admiration and love between us and our ancestors are maintained and thus have a healing influence on the spirit, as though occasionally the deceased were still sitting among us\u2026.a portrait can make almost as powerful an impression upon us humans as can the person himself.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=57}}\n\n=== The plant ===\n\nJander notes that plant studies were part of the curriculum of the Dresden Art Academy where M\u00e4hler attended, so it is natural to expect plants in his graphic work. The plant at the bottom left of the portrait Jander identified as ''[[Polygonum bistorta]]'', commonly known as knotweed.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} The nature of this plant is of [[inflorescence]] (a cluster of flowers on a branch).  In the portrait there are groups of knotweed shown in various stages, from initial blossoming with pink to mature florets with the color receded. (Jander charactizes Beethoven as \"nature-loving\" and recalls the [[Heiligenstadt Testament]] where the composer wrote \"as the leaves of autumn fall and are withered\u2026,\" an allusion very similar to the one depicted in the portrait.){{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} Jander proposes that the fading color of the plant is a metaphor to the composer's loss of hearing.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=64}}\n\n=== The lyre-guitar ===\n\nThough M\u00e4hler described the instrument as a [[lyre]],{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}} Jander identified it specifically as a [[lyre-guitar]], an instrument popular in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=65}}  The interpretation is that, with his hand holding the instrument, Beethoven draws forth music. But lyre-guitars normally have six strings, while the one Beethoven is holding has only five.  With the pegs of the strings arranged in two rows, Jander identified the missing string as being one of the higher-pitched strings, suggesting a visual metaphor for Beethoven's inability to hear high frequencies.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}\n\n=== The cape ===\n\nJander quotes Sulzer who described the arrangement of clothing in graphic art could depict \"a soul agitated through passion.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}  Below Beethoven's back there is a dark blue cape which has fallen from his shoulders.  Most of the cape lies in a heap in the lower right hand corner of the picture, which \"intensifies the message of divestment.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}} In part this is a reference to the painting of the composer's grandfather, whose falling cape represented the overcoming of grief.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}\n\n=== The right hand ===\n\nSulzer (as quoted by Jander) said that gestures should never cause so much attention as to distract the viewer away from the face.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=68}} The enigmatic nature of the depiction of Beethoven's right hand appears to have puzzled both Thayer and Jander.  Thayer recalled M\u00e4hler offering a description: \"...the right hand is extended, as if, in a moment of musical enthusiasm, he was beating time...\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}} Thayer provided his own thoughts:{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337\u2013338}}\n\n{{quote|The extended right hand\u2014though, like the rest of the picture, not very artistically executed\u2014was evidently painted with care. It is rather broad for the length, is muscular and nervous, as the hand of a great pianist necessarily grows through much practice; but, on the whole, is neatly formed and well proportioned. Anatomically, it corresponds so perfectly with all the authentic description of Beethoven's person, that this alone proves it to have been copied from nature and not drawn after the painter's fancy. Whoever saw a long delicate hand with fingers exquisitely tapering, like Mendelssohn's, joined to the short stout muscular figure of a Beethoven or a Schubert?}}\n\nLike Thayer, Jander says the ambiguous meaning of the right hand is due to M\u00e4hler's deficiency as an artist.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=68}} Alessandra Comini observed that, in contradistinction to the portrait of his grandfather where his ancestor's hand is pointing at music already written, Beethoven's \"hand rises, palm outward, in response to music heard and to be written down for the future.\"{{sfn|Comini|2008|p=35}}\n\n=== The action ===\n\nIn Jander's interpretation \"the composer projects himself as turning his back (quite literally) to the darkness, turmoil, and half-dead tree that dominate the area to his left. Musical instrument in hand, he projects himself as beginning to move toward the calm, sun-drenched field [and temple to Apollo] to his right.\" Just as music had rescued his grandfather from overwhelming grief, so too does music provide life's direction for Beethoven and solace from deafness.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=69}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Thayer's copy]]\n\n== References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation|last=Bellofatto|first=Luigi|last2=Jander|first2=Owen|title=Thayer's Copy of the M\u00e4hler Portrait of Beethoven, ca. 1804|journal=Beethoven Journal|volume=21|issue=2 |year=2006|pages=13\u201315}}\n*{{citation|last=Comini|first=Alessandra|title=The Changing Image of Beethoven: a Study in Mythmaking|edition=Revised with a new foreword by the author|year=2008|location=Santa Fe, NM|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=9780865346611}}\n*{{citation|last=Jander|first=Owen|title='Let Your Deafness No Longer Be a Secret--Even in Art': Self-Portraiture and the Third Movement of the C-Minor Symphony|journal=Beethoven Forum|volume=8|issue=1|year=2008|pages=25\u201370}}\n*{{citation|last=Thayer|first=Alexander Wheelock|authorlink=Alexander Wheelock Thayer|title=Thayer's life of Beethoven|editor-last=Forbes|editor-first=Elliot|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1967|isbn=9780691027029|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/thayerslifeofbee00thay|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|last=von Breuning|first=Gerhard|title=Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause: Erinnerungen an L. van Beethoven aus meiner Jugendzeit|location=Wien|publisher=L.

To understand the possible effect upon the composer, Jander cites 18th century mathematician and art theorist [[Johann Georg Sulzer]] who in his ''Allgemeine Theorie der sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste'' provided an understanding on how an ancestor's portrait can have a healing effect on descendants.  \"The bonds of admiration and love between us and our ancestors are maintained and thus have a healing influence on the spirit, as though occasionally the deceased were still sitting among us\u2026.a portrait can make almost as powerful an impression upon us humans as can the person himself.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=57}}\n\n=== The plant ===\n\nJander notes that plant studies were part of the curriculum of the Dresden Art Academy where M\u00e4hler attended, so it is natural to expect plants in his graphic work. The plant at the bottom left of the portrait Jander identified as ''[[Polygonum bistorta]]'', commonly known as knotweed.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} The nature of this plant is of [[inflorescence]] (a cluster of flowers on a branch).  In the portrait there are groups of knotweed shown in various stages, from initial blossoming with pink to mature florets with the color receded. (Jander charactizes Beethoven as \"nature-loving\" and recalls the [[Heiligenstadt Testament]] where the composer wrote \"as the leaves of autumn fall and are withered\u2026,\" an allusion very similar to the one depicted in the portrait.){{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} Jander proposes that the fading color of the plant is a metaphor to the composer's loss of hearing.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=64}}\n\n=== The lyre-guitar ===\n\nThough M\u00e4hler described the instrument as a [[lyre]],{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}} Jander identified it specifically as a [[lyre-guitar]], an instrument popular in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=65}}  The interpretation is that, with his hand holding the instrument, Beethoven draws forth music. But lyre-guitars normally have six strings, while the one Beethoven is holding has only five.  With the pegs of the strings arranged in two rows, Jander identified the missing string as being one of the higher-pitched strings, suggesting a visual metaphor for Beethoven's inability to hear high frequencies.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}\n\n=== The cape ===\n\nJander quotes Sulzer who described the arrangement of clothing in graphic art could depict \"a soul agitated through passion.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}  Below Beethoven's back there is a dark blue cape which has fallen from his shoulders.  Most of the cape lies in a heap in the lower right hand corner of the picture, which \"intensifies the message of divestment.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}} In part this is a reference to the painting of the composer's grandfather, whose falling cape represented the overcoming of grief.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}\n\n=== The right hand ===\n\nSulzer (as quoted by Jander) said that gestures should never cause so much attention as to distract the viewer away from the face.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=68}} The enigmatic nature of the depiction of Beethoven's right hand appears to have puzzled both Thayer and Jander.  Thayer recalled M\u00e4hler offering a description: \"...the right hand is extended, as if, in a moment of musical enthusiasm, he was beating time...\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}} Thayer provided his own thoughts:{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337\u2013338}}\n\n{{quote|The extended right hand\u2014though, like the rest of the picture, not very artistically executed\u2014was evidently painted with care. It is rather broad for the length, is muscular and nervous, as the hand of a great pianist necessarily grows through much practice; but, on the whole, is neatly formed and well proportioned. Anatomically, it corresponds so perfectly with all the authentic description of Beethoven's person, that this alone proves it to have been copied from nature and not drawn after the painter's fancy. Whoever saw a long delicate hand with fingers exquisitely tapering, like Mendelssohn's, joined to the short stout muscular figure of a Beethoven or a Schubert?}}\n\nLike Thayer, Jander says the ambiguous meaning of the right hand is due to M\u00e4hler's deficiency as an artist.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=68}} Alessandra Comini observed that, in contradistinction to the portrait of his grandfather where his ancestor's hand is pointing at music already written, Beethoven's \"hand rises, palm outward, in response to music heard and to be written down for the future.\"{{sfn|Comini|2008|p=35}}\n\n=== The action ===\n\nIn Jander's interpretation \"the composer projects himself as turning his back (quite literally) to the darkness, turmoil, and half-dead tree that dominate the area to his left. Musical instrument in hand, he projects himself as beginning to move toward the calm, sun-drenched field [and temple to Apollo] to his right.\" Just as music had rescued his grandfather from overwhelming grief, so too does music provide life's direction for Beethoven and solace from deafness.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=69}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Thayer's copy]]\n\n== References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation|last=Bellofatto|first=Luigi|last2=Jander|first2=Owen|title=Thayer's Copy of the M\u00e4hler Portrait of Beethoven, ca. 1804|journal=Beethoven Journal|volume=21|issue=2 |year=2006|pages=13\u201315}}\n*{{citation|last=Comini|first=Alessandra|title=The Changing Image of Beethoven: a Study in Mythmaking|edition=Revised with a new foreword by the author|year=2008|location=Santa Fe, NM|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=9780865346611}}\n*{{citation|last=Jander|first=Owen|title='Let Your Deafness No Longer Be a Secret--Even in Art': Self-Portraiture and the Third Movement of the C-Minor Symphony|journal=Beethoven Forum|volume=8|issue=1|year=2008|pages=25\u201370}}\n*{{citation|last=Thayer|first=Alexander Wheelock|authorlink=Alexander Wheelock Thayer|title=Thayer's life of Beethoven|editor-last=Forbes|editor-first=Elliot|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1967|isbn=9780691027029|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/thayerslifeofbee00thay|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|last=von Breuning|first=Gerhard|title=Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause: Erinnerungen an L. van Beethoven aus meiner Jugendzeit|location=Wien|publisher=L.
