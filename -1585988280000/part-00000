This was partly because very few new characters were added to the [[ISCII]] code-set and these if at all were handled by extending and generating the character by the use of the nukta. The BIS document specifically mentions such characters. Hence the InScript keyboards were felt to be self-sufficient.

The club is owned by [[Mario Lemieux]] and [[Ronald Burkle]], who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy.\n\nThe franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the first expansion teams during the league's [[1967 NHL Expansion|expansion]] from six to twelve teams. The Penguins played in the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]], also known as The Igloo, from the time of their inception through the end of the [[2009\u201310 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2009\u201310 season]], when they moved to the Consol Energy Center, which was later renamed [[PPG Paints Arena]]. The [[1992\u201393 Pittsburgh Penguins season|1992\u201393 Penguins]] won the franchise's first-ever [[Presidents' Trophy]] for being the team with the most points at the end of the regular season. In addition to their eight division titles, they have qualified for six [[Stanley Cup Finals]], winning the [[Stanley Cup]] five times \u2013 in [[1990\u201391 NHL season|1991]], [[1991\u201392 NHL season|1992]], [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2009]], [[2015\u201316 NHL season|2016]], and [[2016\u201317 NHL season|2017]]. Along with the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among non-[[Original Six]] teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in 19 years (since the 1997\u201398 [[Detroit Red Wings]]) and the first team to do so since the introduction of the NHL [[salary cap]]. They also became the fifth team to accomplish this feat multiple times.\n\n==Team history==\n===Early years (1967\u20131968)===\nBefore the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pirates]] from 1925 to 1930 and of the [[American Hockey League]] [[Pittsburgh Hornets|Hornets]] franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, [[Jack McGregor]], a [[state senator]] from [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania|Kittanning]], began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included [[H. J. Heinz Company]] heir [[H. John Heinz III|H. J. Heinz III]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] owner [[Art Rooney]], and the [[Mellon family]]'s [[Richard Mellon Scaife]]. The [[1967 NHL expansion|projected league expansion]] depended on securing votes from the [[Original Six|then-current NHL owners]]; to ensure that Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from [[James D. Norris]], owner of the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], and his brother [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]], owner of the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the [[National Hockey League]] awarded an [[expansion team]] to Pittsburgh for the [[1967\u201368 NHL season|1967\u201368]] season. The Penguins paid $2.5&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2.6|1967|r=1}}}} million today) for their entry and $750,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.75|1967|r=1}}}} million today) more for start-up costs. The [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]]'s capacity was then boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Pens also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.<ref name=\"Steel City Legend\">{{cite web | url=http://pittsburghhockey.net/penguins| title=Steel City Legend: Sen.

The Pens, along with the rest of the expansion teams, were hampered by restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"[[Original Six]]\" teams. Beyond aging sniper [[Andy Bathgate]], All-Star defenseman [[Leo Boivin]] (who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and [[New York Rangers|Ranger]] veteran [[Earl Ingarfield, Sr.|Earl Ingarfield]], the first Penguins team was largely manned by a cast of former minor leaguers. A number of the players had played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers [[Val Fonteyne]] and [[Ab McDonald]], and goaltenders [[Hank Bassen]] and [[Joe Daley (ice hockey)|Joe Daley]]. [[George Sullivan (ice hockey)|George Sullivan]] was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain.\n\nOn October 11, 1967, league president [[Clarence Campbell]] and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the [[Montreal Canadiens]].<ref name=\"Steel City Legend\" /> On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] 4\u20132. However, the Penguins went 27\u201334\u201313 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime [[Cleveland Barons (1937\u201373)|Cleveland Barons]] AHL goaltender [[Les Binkley]], who recorded a 2.88 goals against average and was second in the league in shutouts with six. Defensive winger [[Ken Schinkel]] won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the [[21st National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]]. Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points, but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the [[St. Louis Blues]] in exchange for center [[Lou Angotti]].\n\nThe next season, [[1968\u201369 Pittsburgh Penguins season|1968\u201369]], saw the team slip in the standings in the midst of a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to try to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players\u2014including longtime future Pens star [[Jean Pronovost]]\u2014making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald, and the team went with four alternate captains. Schinkel was again the team's lone All-Star.\n\n====Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969\u20131974)====\n[[File:Michel Briere Penguins.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michel Bri\u00e8re|Michel Briere]]'s number was taken out of circulation after his career-ending accident in 1970. It was later formally retired in 2001.]]\nIn the [[1969 NHL Entry Draft|1969 draft]] the Penguins selected [[Michel Bri\u00e8re|Michel Briere]] who although being chosen 26th soon was drawing comparisons to [[Phil Esposito]] and [[Bobby Clarke]]. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] voting for Rookie of the Year honors to Chicago goaltender [[Tony Esposito]] in leading Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the [[Oakland Seals]] in a four-game sweep in the quarter-finals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semi-final round, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native [[Quebec]], suffering brain trauma and entering a coma from which he would never recover, dying a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation for the Penguins until it was formally retired in 2001.\n\nIn the [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970\u201371 season]], the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21\u201337\u201320 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in [[1971\u201372 NHL season|1972]] only to be swept by the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] in the first round. With the exception of a handful of decent players such as [[Ken Schinkel]], Pronovost, [[Syl Apps Jr.]], [[Keith McCreary]], agitator [[Bryan Watson (ice hockey)|Bryan Watson]] and goaltender [[Les Binkley]], talent was otherwise thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972.\nThe Penguins battled the [[California Golden Seals]] for the division cellar in [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1974]], when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced with [[Jack Button]]. Button traded for [[Steve Durbano]], [[Ab DeMarco, Jr.|Ab DeMarco]], [[J. Bob Kelly|Bob \"Battleship\" Kelly]] and [[Bob Paradise]]. The personnel moves proved successful, as the team improved to a 28\u201341\u20139 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth.\n\nHowever, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into [[bankruptcy]]. The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins might fold or relocate.<ref>{{cite web|date=1998-10-14|title=Penguins File For Chapter 11|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/penguins-file-for-chapter-11/|website=CBS News|accessdate=2019-07-24}}</ref> Around the same time, rumors had begun to circulate that the Penguins and [[California Golden Seals]] were to be relocated to [[Seattle]] and [[Denver]] respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the [[1976\u201377 NHL season|1976\u201377 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lfRUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3DwNAAAAIBAJ&dq=pittsburgh+penguins+seattle&pg=1128,1617031|title=Penguins like feel of home|date=January 23, 1975|work=The Leader-Post|via=Google News Archive Search}}</ref> Through the intervention of a group that included former [[Minnesota North Stars]] head coach [[Wren Blair]], the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by [[shopping mall]] magnate [[Edward J.

MacDonald played with the Penguins from 1970 to 1978.]]\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the \"Century Line\" of [[Syl Apps, Jr.|Syl Apps]], [[Lowell MacDonald]] and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the Stanley Cup semi-finals in [[1974\u201375 NHL season|1975]], but were ousted from the playoffs by the [[New York Islanders]] in one of the only four best-of-seven game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, the Penguins brought in other offensive weapons such as [[Rick Kehoe]], [[Pierre Larouche]] and [[Ron Schock]], along with solid blue-liners [[Ron Stackhouse]] and [[Dave Burrows]]. But the Pens' success beyond the regular season was always neutralized by mediocre team defense. Goaltender [[Denis Herron]] was a stalwart in goal for parts of six seasons. [[Baz Bastien]], a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in [[1977\u201378 NHL season|1977\u201378]] when their offense lagged, and Larouche was traded for [[Peter Mahovlich]] and [[Peter Lee (ice hockey)|Peter Lee]]. Bastien traded prime draft choices for several players whose best years were already behind them, such as [[Orest Kindrachuk]], [[Tom Bladon]] and [[Rick MacLeish]], and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the [[Buffalo Sabres]] before a second-round sweep at the hands of the [[Boston Bruins]].\n\nThe Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]], as well as the [[Flag of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Flag of Pittsburgh]]. Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both were fresh off world championship seasons at that time. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice by stating that the [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|NHL Pirates]] also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed and Pittsburgh was allowed to use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted wearing black and gold against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Wv8sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-MsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2348%2C6319320 |title= Pittsburgh penguins debut vs St Louis |date= January 30, 1980}}</ref> On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman [[Randy Carlyle]], and prolific scorers [[Paul Gardner (ice hockey)|Paul Gardner]] and [[Mike Bullard (ice hockey)|Mike Bullard]], but little else.\n\nDuring the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the [[1981\u201382 NHL season|1982 playoffs]], the Penguins held a 3\u20131 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by [[John Tonelli]]. It would be the Pens' final playoff appearance until [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1989]].\n\n===Lemieux\u2013Jagr era (1984\u20132005)===\n[[File:Mario Lemieux 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mario Lemieux]] played for the Penguins in three stints (1984\u20131994, 1995\u20131997, 2000\u20132006).]]\nThe team had the league's worst record in both the [[1982\u201383 NHL season|1983]] and [[1983\u201384 NHL season|1984]] seasons, and with the team suffering financial problems, it again looked as though the Penguins would either fold or relocate. [[Mario Lemieux]], one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the [[1984 NHL Entry Draft]]. Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the [[New Jersey Devils]], who were placed last, the Penguins made a number of questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short-term. The Penguins posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils management.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09351/1021485-125.stm Did the Penguins tank the '83\u2013'84 season to draft Lemieux] Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</ref> Pittsburgh head coach [[Lou Angotti]] later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, stating in an interview with the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, in light of the fact that there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted.<ref name=\"Angotti\">[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04088/292486.stm Finder: Lessons can be learned from Angotti and 1984] Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</ref> Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first ever shot of his first ever NHL shift, in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman [[Paul Coffey]] from the [[Edmonton Oilers]] (after the Oilers' [[1987 Stanley Cup Finals|1987 Stanley Cup]] win) and bringing in young talent such as scorers [[Kevin Stevens]], [[Rob Brown (ice hockey)|Rob Brown]] and [[John Cullen]] from the minors. Also, the team at last acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of [[Tom Barrasso]] from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Pens; but the Penguins struggled to make the playoffs. The [[1985\u201386 NHL season|1985\u201386]] Pens unluckily missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In [[1986\u201387 NHL season|1986\u201387]], the Penguins missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In [[1987\u201388 NHL season|1987\u201388]], the team again missed the playoffs on the last day of the season by one game.\n\nIn [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1989]], Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs, on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Pens shocked the [[New York Rangers]] in a four-game sweep in the first round, however their run was halted by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the second round. The seven game defeat featured Mario Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game.\n\n====Back-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989\u20131997)====\n[[File:Bob Johnson.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] coached the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup title in the [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals|1991]].]]\nA herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his [[1989\u201390 NHL season|1989\u201390 season]], although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. The Penguins opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free agent signings ([[Bryan Trottier]]) and trades ([[Joe Mullen]], [[Larry Murphy (ice hockey)|Larry Murphy]], [[Ron Francis]] and [[Ulf Samuelsson]]) played a major part of this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr|Jaromir Jagr]] with the fifth overall pick in the [[1990 NHL Entry Draft]]. The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent.\nThe roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] in six games, punctuated by an 8\u20130 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals]], the Penguins met with President [[George H. W. Bush]], the first NHL team to ever visit the [[White House]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.penguinjersey.com/Common/open.php | title=Pittsburgh Hockey History | publisher=PenguinsJersey.com}}</ref> The following season, the team lost coach [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] to [[cancer]], and [[Scotty Bowman]] took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in [[1991\u201392 NHL season|1991\u201392]].\n\nCancer revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was diagnosed with [[Hodgkin's disease]]. Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth [[Art Ross Trophy]] as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out [[Pat LaFontaine]] and [[Adam Oates]]. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56\u201321\u20137 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the franchise's first (and, as of 2019, only) [[Presidents' Trophy]]. After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it ever had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of this success, they were eliminated in the second round by the New York Islanders in overtime of Game 7.\n\nThe Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards [[Alexei Kovalev]], [[Martin Straka]], [[Alexei Morozov|Aleksey Morozov]], [[Robert Lang (ice hockey)|Robert Lang]] and [[Petr Nedv\u011bd|Petr Nedved]], and defensemen [[Sergei Zubov]], [[Darius Kasparaitis]] and [[Kevin Hatcher]]. Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the [[Washington Capitals]] in six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the [[Florida Panthers]] in seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games.\n\n====Lemieux's retirement and return (1997\u20132001)====\n[[File:Mario Lemieux 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lemieux with the Penguins during the [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301 season]], his first season back after unretiring.]]\nThe franchise was rocketed forward on April 6, 1997, when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns, and disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced that he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in the same year as he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure would essentially be the first in a series of events that would lead the Penguins once again into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin.\n\nThe team was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in 1998 by the Montreal Canadiens, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4\u20131 in the first round only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20132 in the second round. At this point, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were beginning to catch up with the franchise. Their free-spending ways culminated in the team owing in excess of $90&nbsp;million to various creditors. Then-owners [[Howard Baldwin]] and [[Morris Belzberg]] (who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) asked the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 [[bankruptcy]] in November 1998. At this point, Lemieux stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5&nbsp;million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed to recover this money by converting it into equity\u2014enough to give him controlling interest over the team. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon [[Ronald Burkle]]) assumed control on September 3, 1999, thus saving the franchise for the second time.\n\nLemieux once again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player\u2013owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the [[2001 Stanley Cup playoffs|2001 playoffs]], highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in Game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils.\n\n====Rebuilding (2001\u20132005)====\n[[File:Marc-Andre Fleury 2014-12-12.JPG|thumb|[[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury|Marc-Andre Fleury]] was drafted first overall in [[2003 NHL Entry Draft|2003]] by the Penguins.]]\nThe Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998\u201399, the Penguins had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year.<ref name=\"attendance\">[http://www.hockeycentral.co.uk/penguins/records/Penguins-Records.php Hockey Central] Penguins attendance records</ref> Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The return for Jagr was mediocre, at best, as the Penguins received prospects [[Kris Beech]], [[Michal Sivek]] and [[Ross Lupaschuk]]. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in [[2001\u201302 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2002]], finishing in a tie for third-to-last in the conference. Further financial difficulties saw them trade Alexei Kovalev back to the New York Rangers the next season, quickly followed by the free agency departure of Robert Lang. The [[2002\u201303 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2002\u201303 season]] was even worse, with the team finishing second-last in the conference. The situation began to echo the dark days of the early 1980s. Goaltender and hot prospect [[Vince Hermany]] was released due to injury at the college level. However, just like in the 1980s, the Penguins used these opportunities to rebuild through the draft and acquire other elite prospects. In the [[2003 NHL Entry Draft]], the Penguins selected goaltender [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury|Marc-Andre Fleury]] with the first overall pick.\n\nThe [[2003\u201304 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2003\u201304 season]] was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular-season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 (the lowest average out of any NHL team), with just one sellout.<ref name=\"attendance\"/> As the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach (and former Penguins player and commentator) [[Eddie Olczyk]], traded Martin Straka to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] and opted not to include the highly rated Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the 2003\u201304 season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, as they won just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL Entry Draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]], which went to the Washington Capitals. As expected, the Capitals made Russian superstar [[Alexander Ovechkin]] the top pick. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center [[Evgeni Malkin]], was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick.\n\nBy this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]], had become the oldest and was widely regarded as the worst arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling and/or relocating the team to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penguins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=590199|title=It Was a Great Night For Hockey \u2013 in Kansas City|website=National Hockey League}}</ref> The [[2004\u201305 NHL season]] was canceled due to a [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|lockout]].

[[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) superstar [[Sidney Crosby]] (who had been training with Lemieux over the summer)<ref name=\"lottery\"/> was the consensus first overall pick, with many referring to the draft lottery process as \"The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\". The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30, 2005, with the top pick, instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Penguins then began rebuilding the team under the salary cap. They signed free agents [[Sergei Gonchar]], [[John LeClair]] and [[\u017digmund P\u00e1lffy|Zigmund Palffy]] and traded for goaltender [[Jocelyn Thibault]]. However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, second overall, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately due to a playing rights dispute with the [[Russian Superleague]]. The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 on average in the 2005\u201306 season.<ref name=\"attendance\"/> However, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to [[Michel Therrien]]. Palffy announced his retirement mid-season due to a lingering shoulder injury as the team's second-leading scorer. Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, this time permanently, after developing an [[Atrial fibrillation|irregular heart beat]]. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), but also with the second highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second to [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s 1.92.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2304087 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | title=Lemieux announces retirement | date=2006-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Allen | first=Kevin | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/penguins/2006-01-24-lemieux-retire_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Lemieux says goodbye for final time | date=2006-01-25}}</ref>\n\nDespite the team's various struggles, Crosby lived up to the hype and became an instant superstar amassing 102 points in his debut season and finishing second to Washington's Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league's top rookie. In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top scoring rookie in Penguins history (eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins once again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top two pick in four years, in the [[2006 NHL Entry Draft]] and selected touted two-way forward [[Jordan Staal]]. The team announced on April 20 that the contract for general manager [[Craig Patrick]] would not be renewed. Patrick had been the general manager since December 1989.

It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs|2007 playoffs]], the Penguins were defeated 4\u20131 by the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators. At the season's end, rookies Evgeni Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie of the Year, which Malkin won.\n\nOn March 13, 2007, [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Governor]] [[Ed Rendell]], [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] [[County executive|Chief Executive]] [[Dan Onorato]], [[Pittsburgh]] [[Mayor of Pittsburgh|Mayor]] [[Luke Ravenstahl]] and Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins ownership group publicly announced that an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long sought arena. The state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility, the [[PPG Paints Arena|Consol Energy Center]], guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced that they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325&nbsp;million [[Bond (finance)|bond]] was issued and the Penguins signed a 30-year [[lease]], binding the Penguins to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040; the lease agreement was signed on September 19.<ref>{{cite web | title=Penguins to open new arena in 2010\u201311 season | url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?articleid=335606&page=NewsPage&service=page | website=[[National Hockey League]] | date=2007-08-02}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter a mediocre start to the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 season]], Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the Penguins flourished due to the play and leadership of center Evgeni Malkin and backup goaltender [[Ty Conklin]]. On February 26, the Penguins would acquire the [[Atlanta Thrashers]]' star right winger [[Mari\u00e1n Hossa|Marian Hossa]] and forward [[Pascal Dupuis]] at the [[NHL trade deadline]], trading away [[Colby Armstrong]], [[Erik Christensen]], [[Angelo Esposito]] and a first-round pick in [[2008 NHL Entry Draft|2008]].

However, they closed the season with a loss to the Flyers on the next night, relegating them to the second seed in the East behind the Montreal Canadiens. The Pens had spent most of the second half going back-and-forth with the Habs for first place in the East. Evgeni Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league, behind only Washington's Alexander Ovechkin, and also finished as a finalist for the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]].\n\n[[File:Sidney Crosby with Bill Guerin and Chris Kunitz 2009-06-06.JPG|thumb|Crosby, [[Bill Guerin]], and [[Chris Kunitz]] during the [[2009 Stanley Cup Finals]].

Pittsburgh went on to lose the [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals]] to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14\u20136 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying [[Conn Smythe Trophy]]-winner [[Henrik Zetterberg]] (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead.\n\nIn the [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2008\u201309 season]], Malkin won the Art Ross and was a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy for MVP. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after head coach Therrien was replaced by [[Dan Bylsma]] and defenseman Sergei Gonchar returned from injury. The effect was almost instantaneous and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round matchup against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. The next series, against Washington, took all seven games for the Penguins to win, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they eliminated the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in a four-game sweep.

The Penguins defeated the Capitals en route to all five of their Stanley Cup victories. They have met in a decisive game 7 in the 1992, 1995, 2009 and 2017 playoffs. This rivalry was showcased at the NHL's fourth [[Winter Classic]], played on January 1, 2011, at [[Heinz Field]] in Pittsburgh. The Capitals won the game 3\u20131.\n\nThe rivalry can also be seen in the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). Pittsburgh's top farm team is the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]], and their in-state and biggest rivals are the Capitals' top farm team, the [[Hershey Bears]].\n\n==Team information==\n===Crest and sweater design===\nWhen the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word \"Pittsburgh\" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the [[Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Golden Triangle]] of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker, \"meaner\" look. The circle encompassing the logo was removed mid-season in 1971\u201372.<ref name=uniform>{{cite web|title=Penguins Uniform History |url=https://www.nhl.com/penguins/team/uniform-history |website=National Hockey League | date=August 13, 2018 }}</ref>\nThe team's colors were originally [[powder blue]], [[navy blue]], and white. The powder blue was changed to [[royal blue]] in 1973, but returned in 1977 when navy became the predominant uniform color. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in January 1980 (the announcement was made at halftime of [[Super Bowl XIV]]) to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams, although like the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]], the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the [[Boston Bruins]] protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, thus were able to secure permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old [[Pittsburgh Police]] uniforms,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stark |first1=Logan |title=Hockey History: The Pirates - Pittsburgh\u2019s First NHL Team |url=https://www.pensburgh.com/2018/5/3/17314108/pirates-pittsburgh-first-nhl-team-1920s-history-retro-hockey-penguins-expansion-original-six-1925 |website=PensBurgh |accessdate=26 January 2019 |date=3 May 2018}}</ref> hence beginning the black and gold sports tradition in the city.<ref name=uniform/>\n\n[[File:Maillot Penguins Pittsburgh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The team's road jersey used in 1993\u20131998]]\nThis would remain unchanged until the [[1992\u201393 Pittsburgh Penguins season|1992\u201393 season]], when the team unveiled new uniforms and a new logo, made by Pittsburgh visual communications agency Vance Wright Adams.

Longtime [[KDKA-TV|KDKA]] anchor [[Bill Burns (anchor)|Bill Burns]] even went as far as calling the penguin in the logo \"a [[pigeon]].\" After [[Mario Lemieux]] (a personal fan of the \"skating penguin\" logo) purchased the team from bankruptcy court in 1999, he announced plans to bring back the \"skating penguin\" logo. This occurred for the [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301 season]], when the team revived the logo (albeit with a \"Vegas gold\" triangle instead of \"Pittsburgh gold\") on the chest of the team's new [[third jersey|alternate jersey]]. In 2002\u201303, the logo became the primary logo,<ref>{{cite news|title=Skating penguin logo returns to center ice|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/penguins/20020822logo5.asp|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=August 22, 2002|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}</ref> and the \"flying penguin\" logo (also with a \"Vegas gold\" triangle instead of \"Pittsburgh gold\") was relegated to secondary status and only on the shoulders of the team's jerseys, until it was retired in 2007 when the team introduced their version of the [[Rbk Edge]] uniforms.<ref name=uniform/><ref name=vwa/> Player names were first added in 1970. Until 1977, the team had some minor striping patterns on the jerseys change every few years. But in 1977, the team basically adopted their longest-lasting uniform style to date and a style they would wear for the next 16 seasons, winning the [[Stanley Cup]] twice in the process. When the colors were swapped from blue and white to black and gold in 1980, the uniform patterns themselves remained unchanged. This was likely due to the fact that the change was made in the middle of the season. From the [[1981\u201382 NHL season|1981\u201382 season]] to the [[1984\u201385 NHL season|1984\u201385 season]], the team had a gold [[third jersey|\"Sunday\" jersey]], called as such because the team only wore them on Sundays. This was a rare example of an NHL team having a [[third jersey]] before the rule allowing such jerseys was officially implemented in 1995.<ref name=uniform/>\n\nAfter winning their second Stanley Cup title in 1992, the team completely redesigned their uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo. The team's away uniforms were somewhat of a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second [[third jersey|alternate jersey]], featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey would prove to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the team unveiled yet another [[third jersey|alternate jersey]], the aforementioned black jersey featuring the revival of the \"skating penguin\" logo. This would later prove to be a test to see how the revived logo would do with fans, and the following season became the team's away uniform with a white version as the team's home jersey. This time, the gold used is known as \"Vegas gold\", a more metallic shade. When the Rbk Edge jerseys were unveiled for the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 season]] leaguewide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and quietly removed the \"flying penguin\" logo from the shoulders. They also added a \"Pittsburgh 250\" gold circular patch to the shoulders to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the city of Pittsburgh.<ref name=uniform/>\n\n[[File:Sidney Crosby and Chris Kunitz with Prince of Wales Trophy 2017-05-25 1.jpg|thumb|right|Throughout the 2016\u201317 season, a commemorative patch was added to the uniforms to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary.]]\nWhile the Penguins, as with the rest of the NHL, have worn their black jersey at home since the league made the initiative to do so starting with the [[2003\u201304 NHL season]], the team wore their white jerseys in some home games during the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 season]] and at least once during the [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2008\u201309 season]], as well as wearing their powder blue, 1968\u20131972 \"[[throwback uniform|throwbacks]]\" against the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in the [[2008 NHL Winter Classic]].

At his side was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator for Sam Nover since 1972\u201373.

During this time, local stations WPGH and [[WPNT|WPTT-TV]] also carried a handful of games that were not available on Fox Sports Pittsburgh during the 1996\u201397 season.

The Penguins also played two \"home\" games in the [[Cleveland]] suburb of [[Richfield, Ohio]], in 1992 and 1993 at the [[Richfield Coliseum]] (this is not unlike the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/photogallery/pittsburgh_051011.html|title=Scenes from Pittsburgh|website=Cleveland Cavaliers}}</ref> the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] also used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_fieldgoals.html|title=NBA.com: Regular Season Records: Field Goals|publisher=National Basketball Association|access-date=2019-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724045308/http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_fieldgoals.html|archive-date=2013-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:UPMCLemieux.png|thumb|left|The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex under construction in [[Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania|Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania]] in April 2015.

They compete in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a member of the [[Metropolitan Division]] of the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]]. The club is owned by [[Mario Lemieux]] and [[Ronald Burkle]], who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy.\n\nThe franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the first expansion teams during the league's [[1967 NHL Expansion|expansion]] from six to twelve teams. The Penguins played in the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]], also known as The Igloo, from the time of their inception through the end of the [[2009\u201310 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2009\u201310 season]], when they moved to the Consol Energy Center, which was later renamed [[PPG Paints Arena]]. The [[1992\u201393 Pittsburgh Penguins season|1992\u201393 Penguins]] won the franchise's first-ever [[Presidents' Trophy]] for being the team with the most points at the end of the regular season. In addition to their eight division titles, they have qualified for six [[Stanley Cup Finals]], winning the [[Stanley Cup]] five times \u2013 in [[1990\u201391 NHL season|1991]], [[1991\u201392 NHL season|1992]], [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2009]], [[2015\u201316 NHL season|2016]], and [[2016\u201317 NHL season|2017]]. Along with the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among non-[[Original Six]] teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in 19 years (since the 1997\u201398 [[Detroit Red Wings]]) and the first team to do so since the introduction of the NHL [[salary cap]]. They also became the fifth team to accomplish this feat multiple times.\n\n==Team history==\n===Early years (1967\u20131968)===\nBefore the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pirates]] from 1925 to 1930 and of the [[American Hockey League]] [[Pittsburgh Hornets|Hornets]] franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, [[Jack McGregor]], a [[state senator]] from [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania|Kittanning]], began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included [[H. J. Heinz Company]] heir [[H. John Heinz III|H. J. Heinz III]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] owner [[Art Rooney]], and the [[Mellon family]]'s [[Richard Mellon Scaife]]. The [[1967 NHL expansion|projected league expansion]] depended on securing votes from the [[Original Six|then-current NHL owners]]; to ensure that Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from [[James D. Norris]], owner of the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], and his brother [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]], owner of the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the [[National Hockey League]] awarded an [[expansion team]] to Pittsburgh for the [[1967\u201368 NHL season|1967\u201368]] season. The Penguins paid $2.5&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2.6|1967|r=1}}}} million today) for their entry and $750,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.75|1967|r=1}}}} million today) more for start-up costs. The [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]]'s capacity was then boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Pens also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.<ref name=\"Steel City Legend\">{{cite web | url=http://pittsburghhockey.net/penguins| title=Steel City Legend: Sen.

The arena served as the Penguins' home arena from 1967 to 2010.]]\nA contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked \"Penguins\" as the nickname for the team.

The Pens, along with the rest of the expansion teams, were hampered by restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"[[Original Six]]\" teams. Beyond aging sniper [[Andy Bathgate]], All-Star defenseman [[Leo Boivin]] (who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and [[New York Rangers|Ranger]] veteran [[Earl Ingarfield, Sr.|Earl Ingarfield]], the first Penguins team was largely manned by a cast of former minor leaguers. A number of the players had played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers [[Val Fonteyne]] and [[Ab McDonald]], and goaltenders [[Hank Bassen]] and [[Joe Daley (ice hockey)|Joe Daley]]. [[George Sullivan (ice hockey)|George Sullivan]] was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain.\n\nOn October 11, 1967, league president [[Clarence Campbell]] and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the [[Montreal Canadiens]].<ref name=\"Steel City Legend\" /> On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] 4\u20132. However, the Penguins went 27\u201334\u201313 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime [[Cleveland Barons (1937\u201373)|Cleveland Barons]] AHL goaltender [[Les Binkley]], who recorded a 2.88 goals against average and was second in the league in shutouts with six. Defensive winger [[Ken Schinkel]] won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the [[21st National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]]. Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points, but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the [[St. Louis Blues]] in exchange for center [[Lou Angotti]].\n\nThe next season, [[1968\u201369 Pittsburgh Penguins season|1968\u201369]], saw the team slip in the standings in the midst of a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to try to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players\u2014including longtime future Pens star [[Jean Pronovost]]\u2014making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald, and the team went with four alternate captains. Schinkel was again the team's lone All-Star.\n\n====Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969\u20131974)====\n[[File:Michel Briere Penguins.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michel Bri\u00e8re|Michel Briere]]'s number was taken out of circulation after his career-ending accident in 1970. It was later formally retired in 2001.]]\nIn the [[1969 NHL Entry Draft|1969 draft]] the Penguins selected [[Michel Bri\u00e8re|Michel Briere]] who although being chosen 26th soon was drawing comparisons to [[Phil Esposito]] and [[Bobby Clarke]]. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] voting for Rookie of the Year honors to Chicago goaltender [[Tony Esposito]] in leading Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the [[Oakland Seals]] in a four-game sweep in the quarter-finals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semi-final round, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native [[Quebec]], suffering brain trauma and entering a coma from which he would never recover, dying a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation for the Penguins until it was formally retired in 2001.\n\nIn the [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970\u201371 season]], the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21\u201337\u201320 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in [[1971\u201372 NHL season|1972]] only to be swept by the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] in the first round. With the exception of a handful of decent players such as [[Ken Schinkel]], Pronovost, [[Syl Apps Jr.]], [[Keith McCreary]], agitator [[Bryan Watson (ice hockey)|Bryan Watson]] and goaltender [[Les Binkley]], talent was otherwise thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972.\nThe Penguins battled the [[California Golden Seals]] for the division cellar in [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1974]], when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced with [[Jack Button]]. Button traded for [[Steve Durbano]], [[Ab DeMarco, Jr.|Ab DeMarco]], [[J. Bob Kelly|Bob \"Battleship\" Kelly]] and [[Bob Paradise]]. The personnel moves proved successful, as the team improved to a 28\u201341\u20139 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth.\n\nHowever, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into [[bankruptcy]]. The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins might fold or relocate.<ref>{{cite web|date=1998-10-14|title=Penguins File For Chapter 11|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/penguins-file-for-chapter-11/|website=CBS News|accessdate=2019-07-24}}</ref> Around the same time, rumors had begun to circulate that the Penguins and [[California Golden Seals]] were to be relocated to [[Seattle]] and [[Denver]] respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the [[1976\u201377 NHL season|1976\u201377 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lfRUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3DwNAAAAIBAJ&dq=pittsburgh+penguins+seattle&pg=1128,1617031|title=Penguins like feel of home|date=January 23, 1975|work=The Leader-Post|via=Google News Archive Search}}</ref> Through the intervention of a group that included former [[Minnesota North Stars]] head coach [[Wren Blair]], the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by [[shopping mall]] magnate [[Edward J.

MacDonald played with the Penguins from 1970 to 1978.]]\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the \"Century Line\" of [[Syl Apps, Jr.|Syl Apps]], [[Lowell MacDonald]] and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the Stanley Cup semi-finals in [[1974\u201375 NHL season|1975]], but were ousted from the playoffs by the [[New York Islanders]] in one of the only four best-of-seven game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, the Penguins brought in other offensive weapons such as [[Rick Kehoe]], [[Pierre Larouche]] and [[Ron Schock]], along with solid blue-liners [[Ron Stackhouse]] and [[Dave Burrows]]. But the Pens' success beyond the regular season was always neutralized by mediocre team defense. Goaltender [[Denis Herron]] was a stalwart in goal for parts of six seasons. [[Baz Bastien]], a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in [[1977\u201378 NHL season|1977\u201378]] when their offense lagged, and Larouche was traded for [[Peter Mahovlich]] and [[Peter Lee (ice hockey)|Peter Lee]]. Bastien traded prime draft choices for several players whose best years were already behind them, such as [[Orest Kindrachuk]], [[Tom Bladon]] and [[Rick MacLeish]], and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the [[Buffalo Sabres]] before a second-round sweep at the hands of the [[Boston Bruins]].\n\nThe Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]], as well as the [[Flag of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Flag of Pittsburgh]]. Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both were fresh off world championship seasons at that time. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice by stating that the [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|NHL Pirates]] also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed and Pittsburgh was allowed to use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted wearing black and gold against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Wv8sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-MsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2348%2C6319320 |title= Pittsburgh penguins debut vs St Louis |date= January 30, 1980}}</ref> On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman [[Randy Carlyle]], and prolific scorers [[Paul Gardner (ice hockey)|Paul Gardner]] and [[Mike Bullard (ice hockey)|Mike Bullard]], but little else.\n\nDuring the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the [[1981\u201382 NHL season|1982 playoffs]], the Penguins held a 3\u20131 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by [[John Tonelli]]. It would be the Pens' final playoff appearance until [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1989]].\n\n===Lemieux\u2013Jagr era (1984\u20132005)===\n[[File:Mario Lemieux 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mario Lemieux]] played for the Penguins in three stints (1984\u20131994, 1995\u20131997, 2000\u20132006).]]\nThe team had the league's worst record in both the [[1982\u201383 NHL season|1983]] and [[1983\u201384 NHL season|1984]] seasons, and with the team suffering financial problems, it again looked as though the Penguins would either fold or relocate. [[Mario Lemieux]], one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the [[1984 NHL Entry Draft]]. Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the [[New Jersey Devils]], who were placed last, the Penguins made a number of questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short-term. The Penguins posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils management.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09351/1021485-125.stm Did the Penguins tank the '83\u2013'84 season to draft Lemieux] Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</ref> Pittsburgh head coach [[Lou Angotti]] later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, stating in an interview with the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, in light of the fact that there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted.<ref name=\"Angotti\">[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04088/292486.stm Finder: Lessons can be learned from Angotti and 1984] Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</ref> Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first ever shot of his first ever NHL shift, in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman [[Paul Coffey]] from the [[Edmonton Oilers]] (after the Oilers' [[1987 Stanley Cup Finals|1987 Stanley Cup]] win) and bringing in young talent such as scorers [[Kevin Stevens]], [[Rob Brown (ice hockey)|Rob Brown]] and [[John Cullen]] from the minors. Also, the team at last acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of [[Tom Barrasso]] from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Pens; but the Penguins struggled to make the playoffs. The [[1985\u201386 NHL season|1985\u201386]] Pens unluckily missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In [[1986\u201387 NHL season|1986\u201387]], the Penguins missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In [[1987\u201388 NHL season|1987\u201388]], the team again missed the playoffs on the last day of the season by one game.\n\nIn [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1989]], Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs, on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Pens shocked the [[New York Rangers]] in a four-game sweep in the first round, however their run was halted by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the second round. The seven game defeat featured Mario Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game.\n\n====Back-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989\u20131997)====\n[[File:Bob Johnson.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] coached the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup title in the [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals|1991]].]]\nA herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his [[1989\u201390 NHL season|1989\u201390 season]], although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. The Penguins opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free agent signings ([[Bryan Trottier]]) and trades ([[Joe Mullen]], [[Larry Murphy (ice hockey)|Larry Murphy]], [[Ron Francis]] and [[Ulf Samuelsson]]) played a major part of this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr|Jaromir Jagr]] with the fifth overall pick in the [[1990 NHL Entry Draft]]. The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent.\nThe roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] in six games, punctuated by an 8\u20130 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals]], the Penguins met with President [[George H. W. Bush]], the first NHL team to ever visit the [[White House]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.penguinjersey.com/Common/open.php | title=Pittsburgh Hockey History | publisher=PenguinsJersey.com}}</ref> The following season, the team lost coach [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] to [[cancer]], and [[Scotty Bowman]] took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in [[1991\u201392 NHL season|1991\u201392]].\n\nCancer revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was diagnosed with [[Hodgkin's disease]]. Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth [[Art Ross Trophy]] as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out [[Pat LaFontaine]] and [[Adam Oates]]. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56\u201321\u20137 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the franchise's first (and, as of 2019, only) [[Presidents' Trophy]]. After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it ever had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of this success, they were eliminated in the second round by the New York Islanders in overtime of Game 7.\n\nThe Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards [[Alexei Kovalev]], [[Martin Straka]], [[Alexei Morozov|Aleksey Morozov]], [[Robert Lang (ice hockey)|Robert Lang]] and [[Petr Nedv\u011bd|Petr Nedved]], and defensemen [[Sergei Zubov]], [[Darius Kasparaitis]] and [[Kevin Hatcher]]. Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the [[Washington Capitals]] in six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the [[Florida Panthers]] in seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games.\n\n====Lemieux's retirement and return (1997\u20132001)====\n[[File:Mario Lemieux 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lemieux with the Penguins during the [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301 season]], his first season back after unretiring.]]\nThe franchise was rocketed forward on April 6, 1997, when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns, and disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced that he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in the same year as he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure would essentially be the first in a series of events that would lead the Penguins once again into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin.\n\nThe team was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in 1998 by the Montreal Canadiens, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4\u20131 in the first round only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20132 in the second round. At this point, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were beginning to catch up with the franchise. Their free-spending ways culminated in the team owing in excess of $90&nbsp;million to various creditors. Then-owners [[Howard Baldwin]] and [[Morris Belzberg]] (who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) asked the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 [[bankruptcy]] in November 1998. At this point, Lemieux stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5&nbsp;million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed to recover this money by converting it into equity\u2014enough to give him controlling interest over the team. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon [[Ronald Burkle]]) assumed control on September 3, 1999, thus saving the franchise for the second time.\n\nLemieux once again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player\u2013owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the [[2001 Stanley Cup playoffs|2001 playoffs]], highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in Game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils.\n\n====Rebuilding (2001\u20132005)====\n[[File:Marc-Andre Fleury 2014-12-12.JPG|thumb|[[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury|Marc-Andre Fleury]] was drafted first overall in [[2003 NHL Entry Draft|2003]] by the Penguins.]]\nThe Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998\u201399, the Penguins had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year.<ref name=\"attendance\">[http://www.hockeycentral.co.uk/penguins/records/Penguins-Records.php Hockey Central] Penguins attendance records</ref> Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The return for Jagr was mediocre, at best, as the Penguins received prospects [[Kris Beech]], [[Michal Sivek]] and [[Ross Lupaschuk]]. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in [[2001\u201302 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2002]], finishing in a tie for third-to-last in the conference. Further financial difficulties saw them trade Alexei Kovalev back to the New York Rangers the next season, quickly followed by the free agency departure of Robert Lang. The [[2002\u201303 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2002\u201303 season]] was even worse, with the team finishing second-last in the conference. The situation began to echo the dark days of the early 1980s. Goaltender and hot prospect [[Vince Hermany]] was released due to injury at the college level. However, just like in the 1980s, the Penguins used these opportunities to rebuild through the draft and acquire other elite prospects. In the [[2003 NHL Entry Draft]], the Penguins selected goaltender [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury|Marc-Andre Fleury]] with the first overall pick.\n\nThe [[2003\u201304 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2003\u201304 season]] was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular-season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 (the lowest average out of any NHL team), with just one sellout.<ref name=\"attendance\"/> As the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach (and former Penguins player and commentator) [[Eddie Olczyk]], traded Martin Straka to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] and opted not to include the highly rated Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the 2003\u201304 season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, as they won just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL Entry Draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]], which went to the Washington Capitals. As expected, the Capitals made Russian superstar [[Alexander Ovechkin]] the top pick. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center [[Evgeni Malkin]], was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick.\n\nBy this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]], had become the oldest and was widely regarded as the worst arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling and/or relocating the team to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penguins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=590199|title=It Was a Great Night For Hockey \u2013 in Kansas City|website=National Hockey League}}</ref> The [[2004\u201305 NHL season]] was canceled due to a [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|lockout]]. One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on the resolution of the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the [[Ottawa Senators]], which had filed for bankruptcy protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2003/01/09/senators_030109.html|title=Judge grants Ottawa Senators bankruptcy protection}}</ref> In the midst of the lockout, the Penguins dispersed between the club's [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]], and to European leagues.\n\n===Crosby\u2013Malkin era (2005\u2013present)===\n[[File:SidneyCrosby.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|left|[[Sidney Crosby]] during his [[2006\u201307 NHL season|sophomore]] season with the Penguins.

[[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) superstar [[Sidney Crosby]] (who had been training with Lemieux over the summer)<ref name=\"lottery\"/> was the consensus first overall pick, with many referring to the draft lottery process as \"The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\". The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30, 2005, with the top pick, instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Penguins then began rebuilding the team under the salary cap. They signed free agents [[Sergei Gonchar]], [[John LeClair]] and [[\u017digmund P\u00e1lffy|Zigmund Palffy]] and traded for goaltender [[Jocelyn Thibault]]. However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, second overall, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately due to a playing rights dispute with the [[Russian Superleague]]. The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 on average in the 2005\u201306 season.<ref name=\"attendance\"/> However, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to [[Michel Therrien]]. Palffy announced his retirement mid-season due to a lingering shoulder injury as the team's second-leading scorer. Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, this time permanently, after developing an [[Atrial fibrillation|irregular heart beat]]. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), but also with the second highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second to [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s 1.92.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2304087 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | title=Lemieux announces retirement | date=2006-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Allen | first=Kevin | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/penguins/2006-01-24-lemieux-retire_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Lemieux says goodbye for final time | date=2006-01-25}}</ref>\n\nDespite the team's various struggles, Crosby lived up to the hype and became an instant superstar amassing 102 points in his debut season and finishing second to Washington's Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league's top rookie. In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top scoring rookie in Penguins history (eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins once again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top two pick in four years, in the [[2006 NHL Entry Draft]] and selected touted two-way forward [[Jordan Staal]]. The team announced on April 20 that the contract for general manager [[Craig Patrick]] would not be renewed. Patrick had been the general manager since December 1989. On May 25, [[Ray Shero]] signed a five-year contract as general manager.\n\n====Runner\u2013up and third Stanley Cup title (2006\u20132009)====\n[[File:Evgeni Malkin 2017-11-10 1.jpg|thumb|[[Evgeni Malkin]] made an immediate impact, driving the Penguins to their first playoff appearance in six years.]]\nChange came for the Penguins on October 18, 2006, when rookie Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut. He went on to set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games. Malkin would go on to record points in 16 consecutive games with 14 wins and 2 overtime losses in early 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20062007/GS020892.HTM | title=Game Summary | website=[[National Hockey League]] | date=2007-02-19 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The Penguins finished the [[2006\u201307 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2006\u201307 season]] in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 47\u201324\u201311, totaling 105 points, only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners, the New Jersey Devils. It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs|2007 playoffs]], the Penguins were defeated 4\u20131 by the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators. At the season's end, rookies Evgeni Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie of the Year, which Malkin won.\n\nOn March 13, 2007, [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Governor]] [[Ed Rendell]], [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] [[County executive|Chief Executive]] [[Dan Onorato]], [[Pittsburgh]] [[Mayor of Pittsburgh|Mayor]] [[Luke Ravenstahl]] and Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins ownership group publicly announced that an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long sought arena. The state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility, the [[PPG Paints Arena|Consol Energy Center]], guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced that they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325&nbsp;million [[Bond (finance)|bond]] was issued and the Penguins signed a 30-year [[lease]], binding the Penguins to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040; the lease agreement was signed on September 19.<ref>{{cite web | title=Penguins to open new arena in 2010\u201311 season | url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?articleid=335606&page=NewsPage&service=page | website=[[National Hockey League]] | date=2007-08-02}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter a mediocre start to the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 season]], Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the Penguins flourished due to the play and leadership of center Evgeni Malkin and backup goaltender [[Ty Conklin]]. On February 26, the Penguins would acquire the [[Atlanta Thrashers]]' star right winger [[Mari\u00e1n Hossa|Marian Hossa]] and forward [[Pascal Dupuis]] at the [[NHL trade deadline]], trading away [[Colby Armstrong]], [[Erik Christensen]], [[Angelo Esposito]] and a first-round pick in [[2008 NHL Entry Draft|2008]].

However, they closed the season with a loss to the Flyers on the next night, relegating them to the second seed in the East behind the Montreal Canadiens. The Pens had spent most of the second half going back-and-forth with the Habs for first place in the East. Evgeni Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league, behind only Washington's Alexander Ovechkin, and also finished as a finalist for the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]].\n\n[[File:Sidney Crosby with Bill Guerin and Chris Kunitz 2009-06-06.JPG|thumb|Crosby, [[Bill Guerin]], and [[Chris Kunitz]] during the [[2009 Stanley Cup Finals]].

Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying [[Conn Smythe Trophy]]-winner [[Henrik Zetterberg]] (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead.\n\nIn the [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2008\u201309 season]], Malkin won the Art Ross and was a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy for MVP. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after head coach Therrien was replaced by [[Dan Bylsma]] and defenseman Sergei Gonchar returned from injury. The effect was almost instantaneous and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round matchup against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. The next series, against Washington, took all seven games for the Penguins to win, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they eliminated the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the [[2009 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they had lost the previous year. After losing Games 1 and 2 in [[Detroit]], just like the previous years, the Penguins won Games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in Games 5 and 6.

Malkin missed 17 games to a mild concussion and shoulder injury, while Crosby missed the entire month of April with a broken jaw. At the trade deadline, general manager Shero sold-off several prospects and draft picks to acquire [[Jarome Iginla]], [[Brendan Morrow]], [[Douglas Murray (ice hockey)|Douglas Murray]] and [[Jussi Jokinen]] in separate deals. At the end of the regular season, the Penguins finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching-up against the eighth-seeded New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Marc-Andre Fleury struggling once again and being replaced by [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Vokoun|Tomas Vokoun]] after Game 4. The Penguins then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the Conference Finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep.\n\nOn June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5&nbsp;million. This extension, along with Crosby's 12-year extension previously signed in the 2012 off-season, ensured that the duo would remain the core of the Penguins for the foreseeable future. In the [[2013\u201314 NHL season|2013\u201314 season]], the Penguins again suffered through numerous injuries throughout the campaign. Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team [[Metropolitan Division]], though Pittsburgh struggled in the [[2014 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]], requiring six games to defeat the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]], then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3\u20131 after four games.

As a result, the Penguins were in danger of elimination from [[2015 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoff contention]] with one game remaining in the regular season. However, in the final game, the Penguins clinched the eighth and final playoff spot with a win against the Buffalo Sabres, which simultaneously eliminated the Boston Bruins from playoff contention after the team's loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning.

But in 1977, the team basically adopted their longest-lasting uniform style to date and a style they would wear for the next 16 seasons, winning the [[Stanley Cup]] twice in the process. When the colors were swapped from blue and white to black and gold in 1980, the uniform patterns themselves remained unchanged. This was likely due to the fact that the change was made in the middle of the season. From the [[1981\u201382 NHL season|1981\u201382 season]] to the [[1984\u201385 NHL season|1984\u201385 season]], the team had a gold [[third jersey|\"Sunday\" jersey]], called as such because the team only wore them on Sundays. This was a rare example of an NHL team having a [[third jersey]] before the rule allowing such jerseys was officially implemented in 1995.<ref name=uniform/>\n\nAfter winning their second Stanley Cup title in 1992, the team completely redesigned their uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo. The team's away uniforms were somewhat of a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second [[third jersey|alternate jersey]], featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey would prove to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the team unveiled yet another [[third jersey|alternate jersey]], the aforementioned black jersey featuring the revival of the \"skating penguin\" logo. This would later prove to be a test to see how the revived logo would do with fans, and the following season became the team's away uniform with a white version as the team's home jersey. This time, the gold used is known as \"Vegas gold\", a more metallic shade. When the Rbk Edge jerseys were unveiled for the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 season]] leaguewide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and quietly removed the \"flying penguin\" logo from the shoulders. They also added a \"Pittsburgh 250\" gold circular patch to the shoulders to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the city of Pittsburgh.<ref name=uniform/>\n\n[[File:Sidney Crosby and Chris Kunitz with Prince of Wales Trophy 2017-05-25 1.jpg|thumb|right|Throughout the 2016\u201317 season, a commemorative patch was added to the uniforms to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary.]]\nWhile the Penguins, as with the rest of the NHL, have worn their black jersey at home since the league made the initiative to do so starting with the [[2003\u201304 NHL season]], the team wore their white jerseys in some home games during the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 season]] and at least once during the [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2008\u201309 season]], as well as wearing their powder blue, 1968\u20131972 \"[[throwback uniform|throwbacks]]\" against the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in the [[2008 NHL Winter Classic]].

The new 2011 Winter Classic jersey was first worn as the third jersey against the [[Los Angeles Kings]] on February 10, 2011.

Joe Tucker took over for Ed Conway during the 1969\u201370 season, when WPGH-TV and WTAE-TV split Penguins' broadcasts. WPGH-TV retained the rights to broadcast the Penguins for the 1970\u201371 season with Bill Hamilton handing the play-by-play duties. The 1970\u201371 season was also the first season where the Penguins introduced a [[color commentator]] to the broadcast team, with John MacDonald taking the position as the booth's color commentator.\n\nThe broadcasting rights to the Penguins were then transferred to [[WPXI|WIIC-TV 11]] in 1971, with [[Sam Nover]] handling the play-by-play with several color commentators interchanged during his tenure.

At his side was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator for Sam Nover since 1972\u201373. Lange and Schiffauer remained a team in the Penguins' broadcast booth until 1984\u201385, when Schiffauer was replaced by [[Paul Steigerwald]]. While the Penguins broadcast network transitioned from WPGH-TV (1979\u201390) to [[KDKA-TV]] (1990\u201396), along with the eventual transition to KBL (later [[Prime Sports]]) and eventually [[Fox Sports Pittsburgh]] 1996\u20132011), the team of Lange and Steigerwald remained a constant in the broadcast booth from 1985 until 1999. During this time, local stations WPGH and [[WPNT|WPTT-TV]] also carried a handful of games that were not available on Fox Sports Pittsburgh during the 1996\u201397 season. Also notable during the [[1996\u201397 NHL season]] is that former broadcaster Sam Nover returned to the team in a new role; this time as a post-game studio host, sharing duties with [[John Fedko]] and Thor Tolo.\n\nWith Steigerwald's departure in 1999, Mike Lange shared the broadcast booth with former Penguins' defenseman [[Peter Taglianetti]]. Taglianetti, a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the team in 1991 and 1992, remained in the position for one season before being replaced by [[Ed Olczyk]]. Lange and Olczyk were broadcast partners from 2000 until 2003, when Olczyk left the booth to become the 18th head coach in Penguins history that had become upon due to the firing of previous Head Coach [[Rick Kehoe]] after the 2002\u201303 season.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ksdk.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=38980 | title =Penguins Fire Coach Rick Kehoe | author=Jordan Palmer | publisher =kdsk.com | date = April 15, 2003 | accessdate = October 2, 2012}}</ref> With Olczyk's vacancy, the Penguins hired [[Bob Errey]] as their new color commentator for the start of the 2003\u201304 season (a position that he continues to hold as of the start of the 2012\u201313 season.

Instead, he was replaced by former broadcast partner Paul Steigerwald, who remained the TV play-by-play broadcaster for the team until the 2016\u201317 season. Lange returned to the radio broadcast booth and currently holds the position of radio play-by-play announcer, the same position he had held with the team in the mid-1970s. Following the 2016\u201317 season, Steigerwald moved back to the Penguins front office and [[NHL Network (U.S. TV network)|NHL Network]] personality [[Steve Mears]] was hired as the new television play-by-play announcer starting with the 2017\u201318 season.\n\nEvery Penguins game is currently carried on the [[AT&T SportsNet]] [[AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] network, which is carried by cable providers in most of two states and parts of four others: All of Pennsylvania (save the ten county Philadelphia metro area), all of West Virginia except the two counties in the Washington, D.C., metro area, eight counties in eastern and southern Ohio, three counties in Western Maryland, one county in Southwestern New York state and one county in Northeastern Kentucky. In addition, [[Fox Sports Ohio]] simulcasts Penguins hockey in the [[Cleveland]] metro area, as well as some parts of Eastern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Dish Network, Verizon FiOS and Direct TV all carry the Penguins games on their AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh channel in HD nationally.

It was co-produced by Daniels' [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]] Will Ferrell.\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]] was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, followed by an hour-long series retrospective.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|title='The Office' finale draws season high of 5.7 million viewers|date=May 17, 2013|work=Reuters|access-date=February 17, 2019|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217201113/https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|archive-date=February 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Crew ===\n\n<div class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:40em; font-size:85%; padding-left:5px; width:360px;\">\n'''List of showrunners throughout the series' run:'''\n\n* Season 1\u20134: [[Greg Daniels]]\n* Season 5\u20136: [[Paul Lieberstein]] & [[Jennifer Celotta]]\n* Season 7\u20138: Paul Lieberstein\n* Season 9: Greg Daniels\n\n</div>\n[[Greg Daniels]] served as the senior series [[showrunner]] for the first four seasons of the series and developed [[The Office (British TV series)|the British ''Office'' series]] for American television.

[[Jo Bennett]] ([[Kathy Bates]]) is the CEO of Sabre, a company that takes over Dunder Mifflin, and [[Gabe Lewis]] ([[Zach Woods]]), introduced in the middle of season six, is a Sabre employee who is assigned to the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch as the regional director of sales. In season seven, Bennett's friend [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) is interviewed to replace Scott, and later serves as a replacement regional manager for Bernard in season eight. In season nine [[Clark Green]] ([[Clark Duke]]) and [[Pete Miller]] ([[Jake Lacy]]) join as new customer service representatives who attempt to catch up on the ignored customer service complaints that Kelly has neglected while working at Dunder Mifflin.

It was co-produced by Daniels' [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]].\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006.

Morgan]]</span> and [[Simon Guggenheim]]. The Syndicate purchased the [http://www.nps.gov/wrst/planyourvisit/upload/BONANZA%20MINE%20TRAIL%20Update%2012-2.pdf Kennicott-Bonanza copper mine] and had majority control of the Alaskan steamship and rail transportation. The syndicate also was in charge of a large part of the salmon industry.\n\n== Guggenmorgan/Morganheims ==\nThe Alaska Syndicate faced intense scrutiny from Alaskans in favor of increased autonomy over their own affairs. The Syndicate, which divided its shares equally amongst M. Guggenheim & Sons and [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]],<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Morgans: Private International Bankers 1854-1913|last = Carosso|first = Vincent|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = 463}}</ref> continued to buy up hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness, which gave rise to the notion that Alaska was \"First a Colony of Russia, then a colony of Guggenmorgan\".<ref name=\"Davis 1989 107\">{{Cite book|title = The Guggenheims: An American Epic|last = Davis|first = John|publisher = SPI Books|year = 1989|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 107}}</ref>  Forester and conservationist [[Gifford Pinchot]] led the charge against the Alaska Syndicate and the so-called \"Morganheims\" and their supporter in Washington, Secretary of the Interior [[Richard Ballinger]].  Ballinger, a perceived enemy of the conservation movement of which Pinchot was a leading mover, had intervened in and investigated the legality of coal mining claims made by [[Clarence Cunningham]], a partner of [[J.P. Morgan]] and the Guggenheims.  Cunningham had been the representative of 32 individuals seeking claims in what would soon be protected by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1908 as the [[Chugach National Forest]]. Cunningham was accused of staking the claims on 5,280 acres in order to later transfer them to the Alaska Syndicate, despite this surrogacy being specifically banned by the recently passed Alaska Coal Act.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Alaska: A History|last = Claus|first = Naske|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Norman|pages = 149\u2013151}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Guggenmorgan- Another Triumph in the Far North.jpg|thumb|Guggenmorgan- Another Triumph in the Far North]]\n\nDespite his initial validation of the Cunningham claims, and successfully weathering (with the help of Senator [[Simon Guggenheim]]) a Congressional investigation into his dealings, Ballinger resigned in 1911 under sustained pressure from Pinchot and Congressional Democrats.  His successor [[Walter L. Fisher|Walter Fisher]] soon rejected the Cunningham claims.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Alaska: A History|last = Naske|first = Claus|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Norman|pages = 151}}</ref>  The controversy also provided substantial fodder to further the aims of proponents of Alaskan home rule.  Coupled with the growing distaste for wealthy bankers and \"Captains of Industry\" that was brewing across the country at the time, the public images of the Morgans and Guggenheims took a great hit.  Often portrayed together in political cartoons (with thinly veiled anti-Semitism) as the Shylock-like monster Morganheim (or Guggenmorgan), the controllers of the Alaska Syndicate continued to be a lightning rod for the press, conservationists, anti-business forces, small merchants, and all others who believed that Alaska's pristine lands should be exploited only through the careful regulation of the government.<ref name=\"Davis 1989 107\"/>\n\n== Stephen Birch ==\nIn 1901 [[Stephen Birch]], a young mining engineer, was in [[Valdez, Alaska]] in search of prosperous mining claims.

In 1905, Birch had gained support from John Rosene of Northwestern Commercial Company who agreed to construct the railway from Valdez to Bonanza mine; construction began in June 1905.<ref name=\":1\" />  It soon became apparent to Birch more funding was necessary to complete the railway and to develop the copper mines. In his search for investors, Birch met with [[J.P. Morgan Jr.]], [[William Peter Hamilton|W.P. Hamilton]] and Charles Steele of [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]] in March 1906. Two months later in May, Birch met with [[Daniel Guggenheim]], who was already convinced to back the railroad.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result of Birch's efforts, in June 1906 Guggenheim \"joined with the house of Morgan to form the Alaska Syndicate with the specific goal of developing Birch's copper mine.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  Birch was one of the three managing directors of the syndicate.<ref name=\":1\" />  With the financial backing of Guggenheim and Morgan, the railway was built and Birch developed the [[Kennecott, Alaska|Kennecott]] copper mines, which consisted of several large copper mines including the Bonanza and Jumbo mines.

Upon its completion, Heney, at age 21, was ready to become an independent contractor.

He surveyed a route that would well-serve the mining interests of the area and founded the Copper River Railway Company.

Ballinger, a perceived enemy of the conservation movement of which Pinchot was a leading mover, had intervened in and investigated the legality of coal mining claims made by [[Clarence Cunningham]], a partner of [[J.P. Morgan]] and the Guggenheims.  Cunningham had been the representative of 32 individuals seeking claims in what would soon be protected by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1908 as the [[Chugach National Forest]]. Cunningham was accused of staking the claims on 5,280 acres in order to later transfer them to the Alaska Syndicate, despite this surrogacy being specifically banned by the recently passed Alaska Coal Act.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Alaska: A History|last = Claus|first = Naske|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Norman|pages = 149\u2013151}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Guggenmorgan- Another Triumph in the Far North.jpg|thumb|Guggenmorgan- Another Triumph in the Far North]]\n\nDespite his initial validation of the Cunningham claims, and successfully weathering (with the help of Senator [[Simon Guggenheim]]) a Congressional investigation into his dealings, Ballinger resigned in 1911 under sustained pressure from Pinchot and Congressional Democrats.

Coupled with the growing distaste for wealthy bankers and \"Captains of Industry\" that was brewing across the country at the time, the public images of the Morgans and Guggenheims took a great hit.  Often portrayed together in political cartoons (with thinly veiled anti-Semitism) as the Shylock-like monster Morganheim (or Guggenmorgan), the controllers of the Alaska Syndicate continued to be a lightning rod for the press, conservationists, anti-business forces, small merchants, and all others who believed that Alaska's pristine lands should be exploited only through the careful regulation of the government.<ref name=\"Davis 1989 107\"/>\n\n== Stephen Birch ==\nIn 1901 [[Stephen Birch]], a young mining engineer, was in [[Valdez, Alaska]] in search of prosperous mining claims.

While some chatbot applications use extensive word-classification processes, [[natural language processing|Natural Language]] processors, and sophisticated [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], others simply scan for general keywords and generate responses using common phrases obtained from an associated library or [[database]].  \n\nToday, most chatbots are accessed on-line via website popups, or through [[virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant]]s such as [[Google Assistant]], [[Amazon Alexa]], or [[messaging apps]] such as [[Facebook Messenger]] or [[WeChat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/google-assistant-is-a-mega-chatbot-that-wants-to-be-abs-1777351140|title=Google Assistant Is a Mega AI Bot That Wants To Be Absolutely Everywhere|first=Darren|last=Orf|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/21/8-top-chatbots-of-2016/|title=The 8 best chatbots of 2016|date=21 December 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Chatbots are typically classified into usage categories that include: [[conversational commerce|commerce]] ([[e-commerce]] via chat), [[education]], [[entertainment]], [[finance]], [[health]], [[news]], and [[productivity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cai.tools.sap/blog/2017-messenger-bot-landscape/|title=2017 Messenger Bot Landscape, a Public Spreadsheet Gathering 1000+ Messenger Bots|date=3 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1950, [[Alan Turing]]'s famous article \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\" was published,<ref>{{Harv|Turing|1950}}</ref> which proposed what is now called the [[Turing test]] as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a [[computer program]] to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably\u2014on the basis of the conversational content alone\u2014between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]'s program [[ELIZA]], published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:\n\n<blockquote>[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ... The observer says to himself \"I could have written that\". With that thought, he moves the program in question from the shelf marked \"intelligent\", to that reserved for curios ... The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be \"explained\". Few programs ever needed it more.<ref>{{Harv|Weizenbaum|1966|p=36}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').<ref>{{Harv|Weizenbaum|1966|pp=44\u20135}}</ref> Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are ''capable of being interpreted'' as \"intelligent\".\n\nInterface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational\u2014even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching\u2014can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a \"friendlier\" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's \"shelf ... reserved for curios\" to that marked \"genuinely useful computational methods\".\n\n==Development==\nAmong the most notable early chatbots are [[ELIZA]] (1966) and [[PARRY]] (1972).<ref name=\"G\u00fczeldere\">{{Harvnb|G\u00fczeldereFranchi|1995}}</ref><ref name=\"comphis\">{{Harvnb|Computer History Museum|2006}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Sondheim|1997}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Network Working Group|1973}}\u2014Transcript of a session between Parry and Eliza. (This is ''not'' the dialogue from the ICCC, which took place October 24\u201326, 1972, whereas this session is from September 18, 1972.)</ref> More recent notable programs include [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity|A.L.I.C.E.]], [[Jabberwacky]] and D.U.D.E ([[Agence Nationale de la Recherche]] and [[CNRS]] 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include other functional features, such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called ''The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed'' was published, allegedly written by the chatbot [[Racter]] (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).<ref>[http://everything2.com/title/The+Policeman%2527s+Beard+is+Half+Constructed www.everything.com] 13 November 1999</ref>\n\nOne pertinent field of AI research is [[natural language processing]]. Usually, [[Artificial general intelligence|weak AI]] fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a [[markup language]] called [[AIML]], which is specific to its function as a [[dialogue system|conversational agent]], and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so-called, [[Alicebot]]s. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on [[pattern matching]] techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require [[sapience]] and logical reasoning abilities.\n\nJabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with [[evolutionary algorithm]]s that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, [[information retrieval]].\n\nChatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the [[Loebner Prize]] and The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however, materials can still be found from web archives).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.schwaebische.de/archiv_artikel,-Chatroboter-simulieren-Menschen-_arid,855141.html|title=Chatroboter simulieren Menschen}}</ref>\n\n[[DBpedia]] created a chatbot during the GSoC of 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chat.dbpedia.org/|title=DBpedia Chatbot|website=chat.dbpedia.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.dbpedia.org/blog/meet-dbpedia-chatbot|title=Meet the DBpedia Chatbot &#124; DBpedia|website=wiki.dbpedia.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.dbpedia.org/2018/08/22/dbpedia-chatbot-2/|title=Meet the DBpedia Chatbot|date=August 22, 2018}}</ref> and can communicate through Facebook Messenger.

However, a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health. The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors (73%) and having access to reliable and accurate health information (93%). While 80% were curious about new technologies that could improve their health, 66% reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and 65% thought that a chatbot was a good idea. Interestingly, 30% reported dislike about talking to computers, 41% felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot.

purposes including customer service, request routing, or for information gathering.  While some chatbot applications use extensive word-classification processes, [[natural language processing|Natural Language]] processors, and sophisticated [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], others simply scan for general keywords and generate responses using common phrases obtained from an associated library or [[database]].  \n\nToday, most chatbots are accessed on-line via website popups, or through [[virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant]]s such as [[Google Assistant]], [[Amazon Alexa]], or [[messaging apps]] such as [[Facebook Messenger]] or [[WeChat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/google-assistant-is-a-mega-chatbot-that-wants-to-be-abs-1777351140|title=Google Assistant Is a Mega AI Bot That Wants To Be Absolutely Everywhere|first=Darren|last=Orf|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/21/8-top-chatbots-of-2016/|title=The 8 best chatbots of 2016|date=21 December 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Chatbots are typically classified into usage categories that include: [[conversational commerce|commerce]] ([[e-commerce]] via chat), [[education]], [[entertainment]], [[finance]], [[health]], [[news]], and [[productivity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cai.tools.sap/blog/2017-messenger-bot-landscape/|title=2017 Messenger Bot Landscape, a Public Spreadsheet Gathering 1000+ Messenger Bots|date=3 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1950, [[Alan Turing]]'s famous article \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\" was published,<ref>{{Harv|Turing|1950}}</ref> which proposed what is now called the [[Turing test]] as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a [[computer program]] to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably\u2014on the basis of the conversational content alone\u2014between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]'s program [[ELIZA]], published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:\n\n<blockquote>[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ... The observer says to himself \"I could have written that\". With that thought, he moves the program in question from the shelf marked \"intelligent\", to that reserved for curios ... The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be \"explained\". Few programs ever needed it more.<ref>{{Harv|Weizenbaum|1966|p=36}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').<ref>{{Harv|Weizenbaum|1966|pp=44\u20135}}</ref> Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are ''capable of being interpreted'' as \"intelligent\".\n\nInterface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational\u2014even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching\u2014can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a \"friendlier\" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's \"shelf ... reserved for curios\" to that marked \"genuinely useful computational methods\".\n\n==Development==\nAmong the most notable early chatbots are [[ELIZA]] (1966) and [[PARRY]] (1972).<ref name=\"G\u00fczeldere\">{{Harvnb|G\u00fczeldereFranchi|1995}}</ref><ref name=\"comphis\">{{Harvnb|Computer History Museum|2006}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Sondheim|1997}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Network Working Group|1973}}\u2014Transcript of a session between Parry and Eliza. (This is ''not'' the dialogue from the ICCC, which took place October 24\u201326, 1972, whereas this session is from September 18, 1972.)</ref> More recent notable programs include [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity|A.L.I.C.E.]], [[Jabberwacky]] and D.U.D.E ([[Agence Nationale de la Recherche]] and [[CNRS]] 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include other functional features, such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called ''The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed'' was published, allegedly written by the chatbot [[Racter]] (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).<ref>[http://everything2.com/title/The+Policeman%2527s+Beard+is+Half+Constructed www.everything.com] 13 November 1999</ref>\n\nOne pertinent field of AI research is [[natural language processing]]. Usually, [[Artificial general intelligence|weak AI]] fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a [[markup language]] called [[AIML]], which is specific to its function as a [[dialogue system|conversational agent]], and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so-called, [[Alicebot]]s. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on [[pattern matching]] techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require [[sapience]] and logical reasoning abilities.\n\nJabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with [[evolutionary algorithm]]s that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, [[information retrieval]].\n\nChatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the [[Loebner Prize]] and The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however, materials can still be found from web archives).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.schwaebische.de/archiv_artikel,-Chatroboter-simulieren-Menschen-_arid,855141.html|title=Chatroboter simulieren Menschen}}</ref>\n\n[[DBpedia]] created a chatbot during the GSoC of 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chat.dbpedia.org/|title=DBpedia Chatbot|website=chat.dbpedia.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.dbpedia.org/blog/meet-dbpedia-chatbot|title=Meet the DBpedia Chatbot &#124; DBpedia|website=wiki.dbpedia.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.dbpedia.org/2018/08/22/dbpedia-chatbot-2/|title=Meet the DBpedia Chatbot|date=August 22, 2018}}</ref> and can communicate through Facebook Messenger.

In particular, chatbots can efficiently conduct a dialogue, usually replacing other communication tools such as email, phone, or [[SMS]].

The majority of participants would use a health chatbot for seeking general health information (78%), booking a medical appointment (78%) and looking for local health services (80%). However, a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health. The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors (73%) and having access to reliable and accurate health information (93%). While 80% were curious about new technologies that could improve their health, 66% reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and 65% thought that a chatbot was a good idea. Interestingly, 30% reported dislike about talking to computers, 41% felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot. Therefore, perceived trustworthiness, individual attitudes towards bots and dislike for talking to computers are the main barriers to health chatbots.\n\n===Politics===\nIn New Zealand, the chatbot SAM -short for [[Semantic analysis (machine learning)|Semantic Analysis Machine-]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tuiainnovation.com/sam%2c-the-virtual-politician|title=Sam, the virtual politician|website=Tuia Innovation}}</ref> (made by Nick Gerritsen of Touchtech<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/news/2017/12/meet-the-worlds-first-virtual-politician|title=Meet the world's first virtual politician|first=Victoria University of|last=Wellington|date=December 15, 2017|website=Victoria University of Wellington}}</ref>) has been developed.
