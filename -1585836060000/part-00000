{"title_page": "Toronto streetcar system rolling stock", "text_new": "{{use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:TTC Russell Carhouse streetcar storage.JPG|thumb|[[CLRV]]s and [[Presidents' Conference Committee (Toronto streetcar)|PCCs]] at [[Russell Carhouse]]]]\nIn 1921, the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] (TTC) was created to integrate and operate the [[Toronto streetcar system]]. It inherited the infrastructure of two separate streetcar operators: the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) and [[Toronto Civic Railways]] (TCR). The TTC immediately embarked on a program to connect the TRC and TCR lines into one network. The TTC had to rebuild most of the track to provide a wider devilstrip so that the wider [[Peter Witt (Toronto streetcar)|Peter Witt streetcars]] it was ordering could pass without sideswiping.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=19}} Between 1938 and 1945, it placed five orders for air-electric PCC streetcars to replace the old, wooden streetcars of the TRC, and to address rising ridership. Between 1947 and 1951, the TTC placed 3 orders for all-electric PCC cars, with one order equipped with couplers for multiple-unit operation. Between 1950 and 1957, the TTC purchased PCCs from four American cities (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Birmingham and Kansas City). By 1957, the TTC (later renamed the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] in 1954) had more PCCs than any other city in North America. After the opening of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway (today [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]) in 1966, the TTC considered terminating all streetcar service in Toronto. However, in 1972, a citizens group called Streetcars for Toronto persuaded the City to retain streetcar operation.<ref name=\"Torontoist-2012-11-02\" /> This led to the development of the Canadian Light Rail Vehicle (CLRV) and its longer, articulated cousin, the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV), to replace the aging PCC fleet. The ''[[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005]]'' (AODA) mandated that the next generation of streetcars be wheelchair-accessible. Thus, to replace the CLRVs and ALRVs, Bombardier adapted its low-floor [[Flexity Outlook]] model for the TTC to navigate the Toronto streetcar system's tight curves and single-point switches, characteristics set in the 1920s to accommodate Peter Witt streetcars.\n\n== Inherited streetcars ==\nWhen the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] was created in 1921, it inherited the facilities of its two predecessor companies: the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) and the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] (TCR).\n\n===Ex-TRC streetcars===\n[[File:TTC (ex-TRC) streetcar -1934 at College & Spadina.jpg|thumb|Class BB ex-TRC streetcar at College & Spadina in December 1925]]\nThe Toronto Transportation Commission inherited 830 streetcars from the Toronto Railway Company. However, the TTC found that only 351 of them were worth retaining; thus, the TTC disposed of the remaining 479 by 1924. (Two of the disposed cars were relics \u2013 [[horsecar]] 64, built in 1879, and streetcar 306, built in 1892 \u2013 both ultimately sent to the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum|National Museum of Science and Technology]] in Ottawa.){{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe 351 streetcars the TTC chose to retain were single-ended streetcars built between 1906 and 1917 in the TRC's own shops. They were all even-numbered and retained their original TRC car numbers. The TTC modified these streetcars and reclassified them into four classes by sets of features.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe A- and A1-class cars were operated from the mid-1920s as six-motor trains with an A1-class (4-motor) car leading a coupled A-class (2-motor) car.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=28}} These trains required a crew of three, two for the lead car and another for the trailing car.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}} Six-motor trains lasted until 1933 when the A-class cars were retired due to a decline of ridership during the [[Great Depression]]. After the retirement of the A-class cars, the A1-class cars would pull a Class N or Q trailer until 1934.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=53}}\n\nThe Class C cars had a Tomlinson coupler to pull a Class N or Q trailer, which in later years would be semi-permanently attached. The Class C cars were retired in 1949. The trailers were then reassigned.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=77}} Class C-1 was a variation of Class C omitting the coupler. These cars required a 2-man crew.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\nThe Class BB class was the largest group of ex-TRC cars. Twenty BB-class cars were transferred to other cities during World War II: 5 to Fort William, 10 to Ottawa and 5 to Quebec City.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=65}} The Class BB cars were the last of the ex-TRC cars to be retired, the last forty being retired in 1951. Class BB car 1326 is preserved at the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] museum.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=79}} These cars required a crew of one.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\nBetween 1923 and 1933, the TTC modified all of its ex-TRC cars, at least once, often twice and in one case (1328) three times, each time converting the car from one class to another. A common second conversion was from C or C1 (2-man operation) to BB class (1-man operation). All C1 cars and many C-class cars were converted to BB-class by 1933. The following tables reflect the classes of retained ex-TRC streetcars after the final modification. The table is in TRC class and year built sequence, and roughly in car number sequence.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! TTC<br />Class\n! Class characteristics\n!

All were scrapped in 1936, with the exception of car 2120, which the TTC converted into a snow scraper and used on the [[North Yonge Railways]] until 1948.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=28}}\n\nThe TTC used the double-truck Class H cars (TCR 100\u2013119, TTC 2128\u20132144 & 2148\u20132166) mainly on the [[Toronto Suburban Railway#Weston|Weston]] route and also on [[Spadina streetcar line (1923\u201348)|Spadina]] route until 1948.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=30}} TCR car 109 (TTC 2146) was destroyed by fire in 1921.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=158}}\n\nThe Class J (TCR 200\u2013212, TTC 2168\u20132192) double-truck streetcars, ran mainly on the Spadina route and also on the Weston route until 1948.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=31}}\n\nThe TTC used the Class F, single-truck streetcars (TCR 50\u201357, TTC 2200\u20132214) for rush-hour service until 1926 after which they were converted into snow scrapers. The only three survivors of the entire TCR fleet are from this class, and all three are preserved at the Halton County Radial Railway museum in [[Milton, Ontario]].{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=34}} Preserved TCR car 55 (TTC 2210) was restored to its original TCR condition. The TTC had converted the other two surviving Class F cars into [[rail grinder]]s and both are preserved as such at the museum. TCR 52 (TTC 2204) became subway rail grinder RT-7, and TCR 57 (TTC 2214) became streetcar system rail grinder W-28.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=79}}\n\nClass G (TCR: 60\u201384, TTC 2216\u20132264) consisted of single-truck, [[Birney (Toronto streetcar)|Birney cars]] which were used on various TTC routes, such as [[Toronto Suburban Railway#Davenport|Davenport]] and Coxwell, until 1940. The cars were sold in 1927, 1940 and 1941 to run in Cornwall and Halifax until 1949, after which they were scrapped.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=34\u201336}}\n\nIn May 1923, the TTC renumbered all the TCR streetcars with even numbers only.

The new cars were wider than the older TRC cars, and the [[devilstrip]] between parallel tracks was too narrow at {{convert|3|ft|10|in}}. The TTC had to relay track throughout the system to widen the devil strip to {{convert|5|ft|4|in}}.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=17}}\n\nThe Peter Witt streetcars, the first all-steel streetcars in Toronto, came in two versions: Large and small. The large Witts were {{convert|51|ft|10|in}} long and had 60 seats; the small Witts, {{convert|47|ft|m}} long and 55 seats. The large Witts had a slow speed but the strength to pull a trailer. The small Witts were faster in operation, could move along better in traffic but could not pull a trailer. Trailer-trains were used on heavily traveled routes such as [[Yonge streetcar line|Yonge]], [[Bloor streetcar line|Bloor]], College and Dundas.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=43}}\n\nA streetcar gets a \"Peter Witt\" designation if it was built using the Peter Witt fare payment design. With Peter Witt streetcars, passengers enter by the front doors and pay their fare as they walk past the conductor seated just before centre doors. Passengers must pay their fare when they pass the conductor either to exit the car by the centre doors or to access the rear of the car. This scheme was dubbed \"pay-as-you-pass\". Passengers could ride in the unpaid front portion of the car or in the paid rear portion.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=12}} During the Great Depression, many Witt cars were converted to one-man operation eliminating the conductor's position and relocating the fare box at the car's entrance.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=17}}\n\nThe \"Peter Witt\" trailers were not of the Peter Witt design because of their door arrangement. The Class N trailers had two narrow centre doors flanking the conductor's position, and were slow to load and unload. Thus, the three-door Class Q trailers (also known as Harvey trailers) were introduced with a double door on one side of the conductor's position and a single, narrow door on the other side. One of the doors had a gate so that it could be used as either an entry or exit.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=39\u201342}}\n\nOriginally, all but the class P small Witts had a fully enclosed operator cab. (This feature that would not be repeated in Toronto until the introduction of the [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|Flexity Outlook]] in 2014.) Around 1940, the cab walls were removed.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=56}}\n\nThe first major retirement came in 1938 with the introduction of PCC streetcars. All 60 class N trailers and 30 of the class Q trailers were withdrawn with PCCs replacing Peter Witt trailer-trains on the Bloor and Dundas streetcar routes. These were the first of the new cars purchased by the TTC to be scrapped after only 15\u201317 years of service.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=59}} The next major retirement came in 1954 with the opening of the Yonge subway (today a part of [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]]). All the remaining trailers and all of the large Peter Witt cars were retired. The subway replaced the Yonge streetcar line, which heavily used Peter Witt trailer-trains.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=88,159}} The final major retirement, this time of the remaining small Peter Witt cars, came in 1965 following the opening of the University subway (also a part of Line 1 Yonge\u2013University).{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=97,159}}\n\nMotor cars are even-numbered; trailers are odd-numbered:{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=159}}{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=46}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The TTC bought these cars to replace the [[Peter Witt streetcar|Peter Witt]] cars and older vehicles inherited from the Toronto Railway Company. The TTC's first purchase was in 1938, and by the end of the 1950s, they operated a larger fleet of PCCs than any other agency in the world with 744 cars in service.\n\nThe TTC purchased 745 PCC streetcars in all, 317 air-electric (with air-compressor) and 428 all-electric (no air-compressor), 540 new and 205 used (from [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|several U.S. operators abandoning streetcar service]]). 175 PCCs had couplers for multiple-unit operation, and the TTC used them to assemble two-car PCC trains. (The TTC had only a maximum of 744 PCCs in service because PCC 4063 was scrapped after it derailed and crashed into a carhouse wall in 1947.){{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=71}}\n\nIn 1963, with the opening of the University subway (part of today's Line 1 Yonge\u2013University) and the closure of the Dupont streetcar route, the last of the Peter Witt streetcars were retired resulting in a 100% PCC streetcar fleet.\n\nThe first major retirement of PCCs occurred with the opening of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway (today [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]) in 1966. The heavily used Bloor streetcar line (where two-car PCC trains ran) plus four intersecting streetcar routes (Coxwell, [[Harbord streetcar line|Harbord]], Parliament, [[511 Bathurst#History|Fort]]) were abandoned. The all-electric PCCs from the Bloor route were moved elsewhere displacing the older air-electric cars, many of which were sold to [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=117,114}}\n\nIn the late 1980s, as CLRVs were replacing the ageing PCC fleet, the TTC started to create a new class of PCC cars (class A15) by rebuilding A8-class cars. By 1992, it had rebuilt 19 PCCs for use on the new Harbourfront streetcar line (part of today's [[509 Harbourfront]] service). However, in 1995, the A15 class PCCs were retired because the CLRV fleet could handle the ridership, which had declined by that time. The TTC retained A15-class PCCs 4500 and 4549 for excursions and special events.<ref name=\"TT-4509\" />\n\nThe following PCC streetcars made up the TTC fleet:{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=161}}<ref name=\"TT-4507\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The UTDC hoped to sell CLRVs, or variations of it, to other streetcar and light rail systems in North America. Subsequently, in the 1980s, the UTDC developed the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV), the longer, articulated version of the CLRV.\n\nThe first six CLRVs (4000\u20134005, class L1) were built by [[Sig Holding AG|Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft]] (Swiss Industrial Company, SIG), and were tested in Switzerland serving as prototypes. The remaining 190 CLRVs (4010\u20134199, class L2) were built by [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] Limited in [[Thunder Bay]].<ref name=\"BlogTO2014-02-24\" /> The CLRVs went into revenue service on route [[507 Long Branch]] on September 30, 1979. The vehicles were originally equipped with couplers, but these were removed between 1984 and 1988, and shields were placed over the empty coupler pockets to protect pedestrians.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nIn August 1982, the UTDC delivered an ALRV prototype, number 4900, which the TTC operated in revenue service for several months. Prototype 4900 had features that were not implemented on either CLRVs or production ALRVs such as hand controls instead of foot controls, and electronic destination signs instead of linen rollsigns.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" /> The prototype had couplers while subsequent production units did not.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2010-06-16\" /> After sitting in storage at the St. Clair Carhouse since early 1983, prototype 4900 was returned to the UTDC's Kingston facility in 1987 where a year later it was damaged in a test track collision. It was scrapped in 1997.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nALRV 4200, the first of the 52 production ALRVs (4200\u20134251, class L3), arrived in Toronto on June 11, 1987; ALRV 4204 began revenue service on route 507 Long Branch on January 19, 1988. Unlike the CLRVs, none of the production ALRVs was equipped with couplers, and shields covered their coupler pockets.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nIn 2006, CLRV 4041 was modified for air conditioning with a visibly distinctive air conditioning unit installed on its roof. It was a prototype for a proposed refurbishment project that was shelved.<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-07-26\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe passage of ''[[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005|Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act]]'' in 2005 affected the high-floor CLRV/ALRV fleet because the act mandated all public transport to be fully accessible by 2025. In 2006, TTC staff explored ways to make the old fleet [[wheelchair]]-accessible, including constructing installing wheelchair lifts and attaching wheelchair-accessible trailers, but concluded that these options were impractical, and recommended replacing the old fleet with new low-floor streetcars.<ref name=\"TTC-2006-02-22\">{{cite web |url=http://autodocbox.com/Electric_Vehicle/71484077-Accessible-transit-services-plan.html |title=Accessible Transit Services Plan \u2013 2006 Status Report |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2018-02-22 }}</ref><ref name=\"TTC-2009-02-18\" />\n\nAs the CLRV/ALRV fleet aged, its reliability declined. In later years, the propulsion control system became unreliable and difficult to maintain as obsolete electronic and electrical parts became difficult to source.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" /> By 2014, the old fleet became vulnerable to extreme cold snaps resulting on January 3 in a breakdown of 50 out of the 195 streetcars required for rush hour service; water vapour had frozen in the pneumatic air lines preventing brakes and doors from functioning.<ref name=\"Torontoist-2014-01-03\" />\n\nDuring an extreme cold snap between January 20 and 21, 2019, the TTC withdrew all CLRV/ALRV streetcars from service due to the high risk of breakdowns in the cold weather.

In 2009, the TTC announced that it had chosen a customized version of the Bombardier [[Flexity Outlook]] as the model to replace the old fleet.<ref name=\"TTC-2009-04-24\" /> The TTC had required Bombardier to modify its Flexity Outlook design to handle the legacy system's trackwork, the standards for which mainly date back to the Peter Witt era of the 1920s. Specifically, Toronto's new streetcar had to navigate [[Railroad switch#Single-point switch|single-point switches]], a minimum curve radius of {{convert|11|m|ft}}, and a maximum 8% grade. Light rail vehicles typically require double-point switches, a {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=on}} radius and a maximum 5% grade. The minimum radius requirement was the most challenging for Bombardier. The TTC estimated that it would have taken ten years to widen the curve radius throughout the system.<ref name=\"TTC-2008-08-27\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2008/Aug_27_2008/Supplementary_Reports/LF_LRV_Procurement__.pdf |title=LF LRV Procurement Project - Cancellation of RFP & Way Forward |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2018-11-05 }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the CLRV/ALRV, the new vehicles feature a low-floor design, a loading ramp for wheel-chair access, air-conditioning (only one CLRV had air-conditioning), a doubling of the passenger capacity, an interior bicycle area, a separated enclosed driver/operator cab walled off from the passenger area,<ref name=\"Torontoist-2012-11-15\" /> on-board automatic fare vending machines, and electronic [[destination sign]]s at the front, side and rear of the vehicle (as opposed to roll signs). They were also the first streetcars which had two audible warning signals, featuring both an electronic gong and a horn, as opposed to the CLRVs and ALRVs, which were originally delivered with physical gongs only but had been retrofitted with horns in the late 1990s. The first two Flexity streetcars entered revenue service on August 31, 2014, on the [[510 Spadina]] route.\n\nEach Flexity streetcar is equipped with both a trolley pole and a pantograph for electrical pickup. (All older streetcars use a trolley pole.) Flexity streetcars operate with pantographs on routes where the electrical overhead has been converted for pantograph use. The introduction of Flexity streetcars is leading to the gradual phase-out of the trolley pole on the Toronto streetcar system.<ref name=\"TT-4506\" />\n\n{{further|Bombardier Transportation#Toronto Transit Commission}}\nDuring the manufacture of the Flexity streetcars, Bombardier experienced manufacturing and quality control problems mainly with welding at one of its plants. This resulted in major delivery delays, in that by the end of 2017, only 59 streetcars were delivered when about 150 were expected. In addition, in 2018, Bombardier requested the gradual recall of 67 vehicles to correct welding problems. With the delivery problems, and the retirement of many CLRV/ALRV streetcars too worn out to repair, a streetcar shortage occurred resulting in temporary bus replacements along some streetcar routes.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-07-03\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/07/03/most-new-ttc-streetcars-to-be-shipped-to-quebec-to-fix-welding-defect-bombardier-says.html |title=Most new TTC streetcars to be recalled to fix welding defect, Bombardier says |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=2018-07-03 |accessdate=2018-07-04}}</ref> Bombardier expects to return all recalled Flexity streetcars by 2023<!--2019+4years-->. {{As of|2018|10}}, Bombardier is still expected to deliver the remainder of the 204 vehicle order by the end of 2019.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-10-31\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/10/31/ttc-starts-shipping-new-streetcars-to-quebec-for-repairs.html |title=TTC starts shipping new streetcars to Quebec for repairs |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=2018-10-31 |accessdate=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\nOn January 24, 2020, the TTC took delivery of the last of 204 Flexity Outlook streetcars ordered from Bombardier. Streetcar 4603 was delivered by rail to the [[Hillcrest Complex]] from Bombardier's Thunder Bay plant. The last streetcar was a little over three weeks late, as Bombardier had promised to deliver the last car by the end of 2019.<ref name=\"TheStar-2020-01-25\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Builder\n!

The last such vehicles, rail grinding cars W-30 and W-31, were retired in 2002, their last assignment being in 1999.<ref name=\"TT-4508\" /> Except for rail grinders, all other types of work vehicles were retired before 1980.<ref name=\"TT-4510\" />\n\nWork cars had specialized duties. Besides rail grinding, there were work vehicles for snow clearing, construction (cranes, dump cars and flat cars) and deliveries for carhouses (e.g. sand cars, fare box cars). All these cars were self-propelled, taking power from the streetcar overhead wire. Some work cars\u2014such as dump cars, track plows and snow sweepers\u2014were purchased from outside rail equipment manufacturers. In some cases, the TTC inherited a car built in the shops of its predecessor, the Toronto Railway Company\u2014for example, crane C-1 and the fare box car (for hauling tickets and fare boxes between carhouses and head office). In many cases, cars such as rail grinders and snow scrapers were former passenger streetcars that the TTC converted to work cars. Old cars used for such conversions were usually inherited from the Toronto Railway Company and the Toronto Civic Railways.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=163\u2013166}} However, in one case, the TTC used a pair of PCCs to create rail grinding cars W-30 and W-31.<ref name=\"TT-4508\" />\n\nRail-based, snow clearing cars were retired in the 1970s when City of Toronto Public Works department trucks took over that function. To clear light snow, the TTC purchased 12 snow sweepers in 1940 from the [[Third Avenue Railway System]] (TARS) and numbered them S-30 to S-41. These cars were built by Russell Car Company in 1920\u20131921 and were double-truck, double-end vehicles. The TTC scrapped two of the sweepers in 1966; the remainder remained active until 1971 and were retired in 1972.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=163\u2013166}} After retirement, one sweeper was sold to a transit operator in New Jersey<!--to become car #5246 in Trenton? Newark?-->.<ref name=\"BSM\" /> For heavier snow, the TTC acquired two snow plows, TP-10 and TP-11, from [[National Steel Car]]. Both cars are preserved at museums.<ref name=\"TT-4510\" />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:TTC W-27 Rail Grinding Car outside Bathurst Shops in Toronto, ONT on September 8, 1965 (22631910121).jpg|W-27 rail grinding car at [[Hillcrest Complex]], 1965\nFile:TTC W-8 and W-4 street strip painting cars at Bathurst Shops, Toronto, ONT on September 8, 1965 (22568207152).jpg|W-8 & W-4 <!-- as per Bromley & May: -->construction cars at Hillcrest Complex, 1965\nFile:TTC TP-10 track plow and S-34 snow sweeper at Roncesvalles Div. yards, Toronto, ONT on July 2, 1966 (22631910911).jpg|TP-10 track plow (left) & S-34 Russell snow sweeper at [[Roncesvalles Carhouse]], 1966\nFile:19950529 13 TTC Hillcrest Shop (5344370365).jpg|W-30 & W-31 rail grinding cars at Hillcrest Complex, 1995\n</gallery>\n\nThe following table lists work cars preserved at museums, a few of which are pictured above:{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=163\u2013166}}<!--The table should include only those cars preserved as work cars in TTC or TRC colours.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It inherited the infrastructure of two separate streetcar operators: the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) and [[Toronto Civic Railways]] (TCR). The TTC immediately embarked on a program to connect the TRC and TCR lines into one network. The TTC had to rebuild most of the track to provide a wider devilstrip so that the wider [[Peter Witt (Toronto streetcar)|Peter Witt streetcars]] it was ordering could pass without sideswiping.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=19}} Between 1938 and 1945, it placed five orders for air-electric PCC streetcars to replace the old, wooden streetcars of the TRC, and to address rising ridership. Between 1947 and 1951, the TTC placed 3 orders for all-electric PCC cars, with one order equipped with couplers for multiple-unit operation. Between 1950 and 1957, the TTC purchased PCCs from four American cities (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Birmingham and Kansas City). By 1957, the TTC (later renamed the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] in 1954) had more PCCs than any other city in North America. After the opening of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway (today [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]) in 1966, the TTC considered terminating all streetcar service in Toronto. However, in 1972, a citizens group called Streetcars for Toronto persuaded the City to retain streetcar operation.<ref name=\"Torontoist-2012-11-02\" /> This led to the development of the Canadian Light Rail Vehicle (CLRV) and its longer, articulated cousin, the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV), to replace the aging PCC fleet. The ''[[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005]]'' (AODA) mandated that the next generation of streetcars be wheelchair-accessible. Thus, to replace the CLRVs and ALRVs, Bombardier adapted its low-floor [[Flexity Outlook]] model for the TTC to navigate the Toronto streetcar system's tight curves and single-point switches, characteristics set in the 1920s to accommodate Peter Witt streetcars.\n\n== Inherited streetcars ==\nWhen the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] was created in 1921, it inherited the facilities of its two predecessor companies: the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) and the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] (TCR).\n\n===Ex-TRC streetcars===\n[[File:TTC (ex-TRC) streetcar -1934 at College & Spadina.jpg|thumb|Class BB ex-TRC streetcar at College & Spadina in December 1925]]\nThe Toronto Transportation Commission inherited 830 streetcars from the Toronto Railway Company. However, the TTC found that only 351 of them were worth retaining; thus, the TTC disposed of the remaining 479 by 1924. (Two of the disposed cars were relics \u2013 [[horsecar]] 64, built in 1879, and streetcar 306, built in 1892 \u2013 both ultimately sent to the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum|National Museum of Science and Technology]] in Ottawa.){{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe 351 streetcars the TTC chose to retain were single-ended streetcars built between 1906 and 1917 in the TRC's own shops. They were all even-numbered and retained their original TRC car numbers. The TTC modified these streetcars and reclassified them into four classes by sets of features.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe A- and A1-class cars were operated from the mid-1920s as six-motor trains with an A1-class (4-motor) car leading a coupled A-class (2-motor) car.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=28}} These trains required a crew of three, two for the lead car and another for the trailing car.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}} Six-motor trains lasted until 1933 when the A-class cars were retired due to a decline of ridership during the [[Great Depression]]. After the retirement of the A-class cars, the A1-class cars would pull a Class N or Q trailer until 1934.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=53}}\n\nThe Class C cars had a Tomlinson coupler to pull a Class N or Q trailer, which in later years would be semi-permanently attached. The Class C cars were retired in 1949. The trailers were then reassigned.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=77}} Class C-1 was a variation of Class C omitting the coupler. These cars required a 2-man crew.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\nThe Class BB class was the largest group of ex-TRC cars. Twenty BB-class cars were transferred to other cities during World War II: 5 to Fort William, 10 to Ottawa and 5 to Quebec City.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=65}} The Class BB cars were the last of the ex-TRC cars to be retired, the last forty being retired in 1951. Class BB car 1326 is preserved at the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] museum.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=79}} These cars required a crew of one.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\nBetween 1923 and 1933, the TTC modified all of its ex-TRC cars, at least once, often twice and in one case (1328) three times, each time converting the car from one class to another. A common second conversion was from C or C1 (2-man operation) to BB class (1-man operation). All C1 cars and many C-class cars were converted to BB-class by 1933. The following tables reflect the classes of retained ex-TRC streetcars after the final modification. The table is in TRC class and year built sequence, and roughly in car number sequence.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! TTC<br />Class\n! Class characteristics\n!

All were scrapped in 1936, with the exception of car 2120, which the TTC converted into a snow scraper and used on the [[North Yonge Railways]] until 1948.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=28}}\n\nThe TTC used the double-truck Class H cars (TCR 100\u2013119, TTC 2128\u20132144 & 2148\u20132166) mainly on the [[Toronto Suburban Railway#Weston|Weston]] route and also on [[Spadina streetcar line (1923\u201348)|Spadina]] route until 1948.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=30}} TCR car 109 (TTC 2146) was destroyed by fire in 1921.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=158}}\n\nThe Class J (TCR 200\u2013212, TTC 2168\u20132192) double-truck streetcars, ran mainly on the Spadina route and also on the Weston route until 1948.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=31}}\n\nThe TTC used the Class F, single-truck streetcars (TCR 50\u201357, TTC 2200\u20132214) for rush-hour service until 1926 after which they were converted into snow scrapers.

The new cars were wider than the older TRC cars, and the [[devilstrip]] between parallel tracks was too narrow at {{convert|3|ft|10|in}}. The TTC had to relay track throughout the system to widen the devil strip to {{convert|5|ft|4|in}}.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=17}}\n\nThe Peter Witt streetcars, the first all-steel streetcars in Toronto, came in two versions: Large and small. The large Witts were {{convert|51|ft|10|in}} long and had 60 seats; the small Witts, {{convert|47|ft|m}} long and 55 seats. The large Witts had a slow speed but the strength to pull a trailer. The small Witts were faster in operation, could move along better in traffic but could not pull a trailer. Trailer-trains were used on heavily traveled routes such as [[Yonge streetcar line|Yonge]], [[Bloor streetcar line|Bloor]], College and Dundas.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=43}}\n\nA streetcar gets a \"Peter Witt\" designation if it was built using the Peter Witt fare payment design. With Peter Witt streetcars, passengers enter by the front doors and pay their fare as they walk past the conductor seated just before centre doors. Passengers must pay their fare when they pass the conductor either to exit the car by the centre doors or to access the rear of the car. This scheme was dubbed \"pay-as-you-pass\". Passengers could ride in the unpaid front portion of the car or in the paid rear portion.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=12}} During the Great Depression, many Witt cars were converted to one-man operation eliminating the conductor's position and relocating the fare box at the car's entrance.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=17}}\n\nThe \"Peter Witt\" trailers were not of the Peter Witt design because of their door arrangement. The Class N trailers had two narrow centre doors flanking the conductor's position, and were slow to load and unload. Thus, the three-door Class Q trailers (also known as Harvey trailers) were introduced with a double door on one side of the conductor's position and a single, narrow door on other side. One of the doors had a gate so that it could be used as either an entry or exit.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=39\u201342}}\n\nOriginally, all but the class P small Witts had a fully enclosed operator cab. (This feature that would not be repeated in Toronto until the introduction of the [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|Flexity Outlook]] in 2014.) Around 1940, the cab walls were removed.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=56}}\n\nThe first major retirement came in 1938 with the introduction of PCC streetcars. All 60 class N trailers and 30 of the class Q trailers were withdrawn with PCCs replacing Peter Witt trailer-trains on the Bloor and Dundas streetcar routes. These were the first of the new cars purchased by the TTC to be scrapped after only 15\u201317 years of service.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=59}} The next major retirement came in 1954 with the opening of the Yonge subway (today a part of [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]]). All the remaining trailers and all of the large Peter Witt cars were retired. The subway replaced the Yonge streetcar line, which heavily used Peter Witt trailer-trains.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=88,159}} The final major retirement, this time of the remaining small Peter Witt cars, came in 1965 following the opening of the University subway (also a part of Line 1 Yonge\u2013University).{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=97,159}}\n\nMotor cars are even-numbered; trailers are odd-numbered:{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=159}}{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=46}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The TTC bought these cars to replace the [[Peter Witt streetcar|Peter Witt]] cars and older vehicles inherited from the Toronto Railway Company. The TTC's first purchase was in 1938, and by the end of the 1950s, they operated a larger fleet of PCCs than any other agency in the world with 744 cars in service.\n\nThe TTC purchased 745 PCC streetcars in all, 317 air-electric (with air-compressor) and 428 all-electric (no air-compressor), 540 new and 205 used (from [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|several U.S. operators abandoning streetcar service]]). 175 PCCs had couplers for multiple-unit operation, and the TTC used them to assemble two-car PCC trains. (The TTC had only a maximum of 744 PCCs in service because PCC 4063 was scrapped after it derailed and crashed into a carhouse wall in 1947.){{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=71}}\n\nIn 1963, with the opening of the University subway (part of today's Line 1 Yonge\u2013University) and the closure of the Dupont streetcar route, the last of the Peter Witt streetcars were retired resulting in a 100% PCC streetcar fleet.\n\nThe first major retirement of PCCs occurred with the opening of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway (today [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]) in 1966. The heavily used Bloor streetcar line (where two-car PCC trains ran) plus four intersecting streetcar routes (Coxwell, [[Harbord streetcar line|Harbord]], Parliament, [[511 Bathurst#History|Fort]]) were abandoned.

By 1992, it had rebuilt 19 PCCs for use on the new Harbourfront streetcar line (part of today's [[509 Harbourfront]] service). However, in 1995, the A15 class PCCs were retired because the CLRV fleet could handle the ridership, which had declined by that time.

The UTDC hoped to sell CLRVs, or variations of it, to other streetcar and light rail systems in North America. Subsequently, in the 1980s, the UTDC developed the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV), the longer, articulated version of the CLRV.\n\nThe first six CLRVs (4000\u20134005, class L1) were built by [[Sig Holding AG|Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft]] (Swiss Industrial Company, SIG), and were tested in Switzerland serving as prototypes. The remaining 190 CLRVs (4010\u20134199, class L2) were built by [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] Limited in [[Thunder Bay]].<ref name=\"BlogTO2014-02-24\" /> The CLRVs went into revenue service on route [[507 Long Branch]] on September 30, 1979. The vehicles were originally equipped with couplers, but these were removed between 1984 and 1988, and shields were placed over the empty coupler pockets to protect pedestrians.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nIn August 1982, the UTDC delivered an ALRV prototype, number 4900, which the TTC operated in revenue service for several months. Prototype 4900 had features that were not implemented on either CLRVs or production ALRVs such as hand controls instead of foot controls, and electronic destination signs instead of linen rollsigns.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" /> The prototype had couplers while subsequent production units did not.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2010-06-16\" /> After sitting in storage at the St. Clair Carhouse since early 1983, prototype 4900 was returned to the UTDC's Kingston facility in 1987 where a year later it was damaged in a test track collision. It was scrapped in 1997.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nALRV 4200, the first of the 52 production ALRVs (4200\u20134251, class L3), arrived in Toronto on June 11, 1987; ALRV 4204 began revenue service on route 507 Long Branch on January 19, 1988. Unlike the CLRVs, none of the production ALRVs was equipped with couplers, and shields covered their coupler pockets.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nIn 2006, CLRV 4041 was modified for air conditioning with a visibly distinctive air conditioning unit installed on its roof. It was a prototype for a proposed refurbishment project that was shelved.<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-07-26\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe passage of ''[[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005|Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act]]'' in 2005 affected the high-floor CLRV/ALRV fleet because the act mandated all public transport to be fully accessible by 2025. In 2006, TTC staff explored ways to make the old fleet [[wheelchair]]-accessible, including constructing installing wheelchair lifts and attaching wheelchair-accessible trailers, but concluded that these options were impractical, and recommended replacing the old fleet with new low-floor streetcars.<ref name=\"TTC-2006-02-22\">{{cite web |url=http://autodocbox.com/Electric_Vehicle/71484077-Accessible-transit-services-plan.html |title=Accessible Transit Services Plan \u2013 2006 Status Report |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2018-02-22 }}</ref><ref name=\"TTC-2009-02-18\" />\n\nAs the CLRV/ALRV fleet aged, its reliability declined. In later years, the propulsion control system became unreliable and difficult to maintain as obsolete electronic and electrical parts became difficult to source.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" /> By 2014, the old fleet became vulnerable to extreme cold snaps resulting on January 3 in a breakdown of 50 out of the 195 streetcars required for rush hour service; water vapour had frozen in the pneumatic air lines preventing brakes and doors from functioning.<ref name=\"Torontoist-2014-01-03\" />\n\nDuring an extreme cold snap between January 20 and 21, 2019, the TTC withdrew all CLRV/ALRV streetcars from service due to the high risk of breakdowns in the cold weather. Streetcar service during this period was provided by the Flexity Outlook streetcars and supplemented by buses.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cp24.com/weather/bitterly-cold-temperatures-continue-in-toronto-1.4261802 |title=Bitterly cold temperatures continue in Toronto |work=CP24 |date=January 21, 2019 |access-date=March 15, 2019 |first=Codi |last=Wilson}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 2015, the TTC rebuilt 30 CLRVs and 20 ALRVs to extend their service life because of delays in delivery of the new Flexity streetcars.<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-05-13\" /> The TTC had expected to use some CLRVs and ALRVs to supplement the Flexity streetcars until 2024 to address increased ridership.<ref name=\"TO-2016-02-25\" /> However, by November 2018, the ALRV fleet had so deteriorated that only two or three of the 20 refurbished ALRVs were available for service on any one day.

In 2009, the TTC announced that it had chosen a customized version of the Bombardier [[Flexity Outlook]] as the model to replace the old fleet.<ref name=\"TTC-2009-04-24\" /> The TTC had required Bombardier to modify its Flexity Outlook design to handle the legacy system's trackwork, the standards for which mainly date back to the Peter Witt era of the 1920s. Specifically, Toronto's new streetcar had to navigate [[Railroad switch#Single-point switch|single-point switches]], a minimum curve radius of {{convert|11|m|ft}}, and a maximum 8% grade. Light rail vehicles typically require double-point switches, a {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=on}} radius and a maximum 5% grade. The minimum radius requirement was the most challenging for Bombardier. The TTC estimated that it would have taken ten years to widen the curve radius throughout the system.<ref name=\"TTC-2008-08-27\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2008/Aug_27_2008/Supplementary_Reports/LF_LRV_Procurement__.pdf |title=LF LRV Procurement Project - Cancellation of RFP & Way Forward |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2018-11-05 }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the CLRV/ALRV, the new vehicles feature a low-floor design, a loading ramp for wheel-chair access, air-conditioning (only one CLRV had air-conditioning), a doubling of the passenger capacity, an interior bicycle area, a separated enclosed driver/operator cab walled off from the passenger area,<ref name=\"Torontoist-2012-11-15\" /> on-board automatic fare vending machines, and electronic [[destination sign]]s at the front, side and rear of the vehicle (as opposed to roll signs). They were also the first streetcars which had two audible warning signals, featuring both an electronic gong and a horn, as opposed to the CLRVs and ALRVs, which were originally delivered with physical gongs only but had been retrofitted with horns in the late 1990s. The first two Flexity streetcars entered revenue service on August 31, 2014, on the [[510 Spadina]] route.\n\nEach Flexity streetcar is equipped with both a trolley pole and a pantograph for electrical pickup. (All older streetcars use a trolley pole.) Flexity streetcars operate with pantographs on routes where the electrical overhead has been converted for pantograph use. The introduction of Flexity streetcars is leading to the gradual phase-out of the trolley pole on the Toronto streetcar system.<ref name=\"TT-4506\" />\n\n{{further|Bombardier Transportation#Toronto Transit Commission}}\nDuring the manufacture of the Flexity streetcars, Bombardier experienced manufacturing and quality control problems mainly with welding at one of its plants. This resulted in major delivery delays, in that by the end of 2017, only 59 streetcars were delivered when about 150 were expected. In addition, in 2018, Bombardier requested the gradual recall of 67 vehicles to correct welding problems. With the delivery problems, and the retirement of many CLRV/ALRV streetcars too worn out to repair, a streetcar shortage occurred resulting in temporary bus replacements along some streetcar routes.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-07-03\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/07/03/most-new-ttc-streetcars-to-be-shipped-to-quebec-to-fix-welding-defect-bombardier-says.html |title=Most new TTC streetcars to be recalled to fix welding defect, Bombardier says |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=2018-07-03 |accessdate=2018-07-04}}</ref> Bombardier expects to return all recalled Flexity streetcars by 2023<!--2019+4years-->. {{As of|2018|10}}, Bombardier is still expected to deliver the remainder of the 204 vehicle order by the end of 2019.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-10-31\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/10/31/ttc-starts-shipping-new-streetcars-to-quebec-for-repairs.html |title=TTC starts shipping new streetcars to Quebec for repairs |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=2018-10-31 |accessdate=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\nOn January 24, 2020, the TTC took delivery of the last of 204 Flexity Outlook streetcars ordered from Bombardier.

The last such vehicles, rail grinding cars W-30 and W-31, were retired in 2002, their last assignment being in 1999.<ref name=\"TT-4508\" /> Except for rail grinders, all other types of work vehicles were retired before 1980.<ref name=\"TT-4510\" />\n\nWork cars had specialized duties. Besides rail grinding, there were work vehicles for snow clearing, construction (cranes, dump cars and flat cars) and deliveries for carhouses (e.g. sand cars, fare box cars). All these cars were self-propelled, taking power from the streetcar overhead wire. Some work cars\u2014such as dump cars, track plows and snow sweepers\u2014were purchased from outside rail equipment manufacturers. In some cases, the TTC inherited a car built in the shops of its predecessor, the Toronto Railway Company\u2014for example, crane C-1 and the fare box car (for hauling tickets and fare boxes between carhouses and head office). In many cases, cars such as rail grinders and snow scrapers were former passenger streetcars that the TTC converted to work cars. Old cars used for such conversions were usually inherited from the Toronto Railway Company and the Toronto Civic Railways.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=163\u2013166}} However, in one case, the TTC used a pair of PCCs to create rail grinding cars W-30 and W-31.<ref name=\"TT-4508\" />\n\nRail-based, snow clearing cars were retired in the 1970s when City of Toronto Public Works department trucks took over that function. To clear light snow, the TTC purchased 12 snow sweepers in 1940 from the [[Third Avenue Railway System]] (TARS) and numbered them S-30 to S-41. These cars were built by Russell Car Company in 1920\u20131921 and were double-truck, double-end vehicles. The TTC scrapped two of the sweepers in 1966; the remainder remained active until 1971 and were retired in 1972.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=163\u2013166}} After retirement, one sweeper was sold to a transit operator in New Jersey<!--to become car #5246 in Trenton?

The game show's tagline is \"''Ang Kapalaran mo, Desisyon Mo''\" which in turn translates in English as \"''Your Fate, [is] Your Decision''.\" At the time of its premiere, this was the first weekday primetime game show in the Philippines since the so-called primetime game show craze died down in late 2002, with ''Pilipinas, Game KNB?'', the last remaining show among the weekday primetime game shows, reformatted into a daytime one after a relatively brief hiatus (although it had a primetime spinoff called ''Pasko Na, Game KNB?'' for three weeks on December 2005 to January 2006).\n\nThe first season of the show was supposed to be a three-month stint, to give way to another Endemol-produced program ''[[Pinoy Dream Academy]]'', but its immense popularity caused the show to be extended to a nine-month-long season. The second season premiered in June 2007, and was supposed to end in October of the same year. Once again, the show's success amongst viewers resulted in an extended season, a new time slot, and lead programming for the [[TV Patrol World|evening news]]; the season concluded in January 2007. After an 18-month hiatus, the third season of the show premiered in July 2008, and became the first to also be broadcast on [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]]'s North American feed. The original series of the program ended on March 27, 2009.\n\nAfter a nearly two-year hiatus, the show returned In February 2012 with [[Luis Manzano]] as host. Original presenter Kris Aquino further elaborated that she could not host the show as she was having upcoming commitments for her upcoming drama series, ''[[Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw (TV series)|Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw]]'', with [[Anne Curtis]].<ref>[http://www.push.com.ph/features/4417/luis-manzano-on-hosting-kapamilya-deal-or-no-deal-mahirap-kumuha-ng-next-kris-aquino/ Luis Manzano on hosting Kapamilya Deal or No Deal: Mahirap kumuha ng next Kris Aquino] retrieved via www.push.com.ph 01-21-2012</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JEdAzfJT7g Kapamilya, Deal Or No deal with Luis Manzano Teaser] retrieved via www.youtube.com via abscbnonline user 01-31-2012</ref> Considered as a continuation of the original series, this fourth season lasted until September 2013, and had noticeable changes in game play, and in scheduling, airing only on Saturdays, as opposed to weekdays like the previous three seasons.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/10860/Are-you-ready-to-make-a-deal-with-Luis-Manzano-.aspx Are you ready to make a deal with Luis Manzano?] retrieved via www.abs-cbn.com 02-24-2012</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6zwzn24KqE Kapamilya Deal or No Deal ngayon Sabado na!] retrieved via www.youtube.com via abscbnonline user 02-23-2012</ref> The fifth season of the show premiered in February 2015 after numerous teasers hinting of the show's return, with further changes to game play (to be mentioned below).\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe [[Philippines|Philippine]] version is very similar to the [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|U.S. version]] of Deal or No Deal (including the logo), except for the sounds and musical scoring which were adapted from the [[Miljoenenjacht (Netherlands)|Dutch version]].\n\nBefore the game proper begins, a third party randomly places the possible amount of prize in the briefcases, which are distributed to 26 identically dressed models called the 26K who reveal the contents during the game. No one, including the host, knows what amounts are in the cases. Each contestant receives a new, randomly assigned set of cases. The prizes range in amounts from PHP1 to PHP2,000,000. See listing below.\n\nAfter picking a case, the contestant then selects six of the remaining 25 cases, revealed one at a time. This is followed by a \"phone call\" by \"The Banker\", a mysterious figure whose face is not shown (at times a silhouette can be seen). He purportedly sits in a [[balcony|skybox]] (situated between the two audience sections) and makes an offer, via telephone to the host (his voice is never heard) to buy the contestant's case based on the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the cash amounts still in play, and also based on the player's psychology. This amount is usually lower than the mean. In more recent episodes, the banker \"punishes\" a player of opening a large amount by offering a ''very'' small amount, despite the number of larger amounts still left in play. The player is then asked by Kris the title question: \"Deal or No Deal?\"\n\nShould the contestant refuse the offer (by stating \"No Deal!\"), they must choose five of the remaining cases to eliminate from consideration. The Banker makes another offer, and the game continues as before. The Banker's offer may be higher or lower than the previous offer (if a top prize is eliminated, generally the offer decreases; conversely, if lower amounts are eliminated the offer increases significantly).\n\nThe contestant is shown a button to press in case the contestant takes the banker's offer. The player can just push the button to take the offer, even without saying \"Deal.\" On the other hand, the contestant can simply close the button's cover to imply \"No Deal\" without actually saying the phrase.\n\nSubsequent rounds have the contestant withdrawing five, four, three, then two cases from play, with Banker's offer appearing in between rounds; should the contestant continue to decline The Banker's offer after the two cases were picked, he/she then eliminates one case at a time (with an intervening offer from The Banker) until two cases are left. If the player rejects the final offer, they receive whatever cash amount is contained inside the case that they originally chose.\n\nEach contestant has several supporters (usually three or four), who sit in a special section just off stage during his/her game. As the field of briefcases dwindles, one or more of the supporters are asked to consult with the contestant and help him/her make a decision. These exchanges have become emotional, particularly when very high and very small amounts remained and The Banker offers a large cash buyout. The contestant's supporters are typically revealed after the second Bank deal and before the third round; although if a contestant is doing well, the host will let the game run its course for some time, often consulting the supporters when the tide begins to turn.\n\nIf in case the contestant decides to accept the offer of the Banker at the end of any round, the host will let him go on (\"No Deal\" instead of \"Deal\" assumed at that point) until the end (at the end of every subsequent round, the amount offered by the Banker is revealed to him and \"No Deal\" is assumed) to determine if he made the correct decision.\n\nIn the fourth season (2012), due to the reduced number of briefcases from 26 to 24, the number of briefcases opened in each round is also modified, starting from five in the first round, three in each of the next three rounds, two in each the next three rounds, and one in each the final two rounds. Gameplay otherwise remains the same, with the exception of a routine option to swap briefcases in the end. The offer to swap briefcases was only given one time during Aquino's tenure.\n\nIn the fifth season (2015), once again due to the reduced number of briefcases from 24 to 20, for the very first time in this season and for this franchise, celebrities were the ones to hold the briefcases and a roulette is used to determine who among the 20 Lucky Stars would be the player of the day. Everyone would have a chance to play, since their tenureship as briefcase holders last for a month, and they would be replaced by a new batch of celebrities every month. The number of briefcases opened in each round is brought back to the usual format used in Season 1 to 4, but instead of six cases to open first, five were first opened, then four, three, two until one case is opened in succeeding rounds. However, the special section for the player's supporters has been removed, since the celebrity player of the day is also part of the 20 Lucky Stars, so after each star's situated briefcase is opened, they would sit in the audience space provided with a special platform row and would help the player in case if he/she has a difficult time during case selection at gameplay. Generally, the celebrity's designated briefcase as a Lucky Star would be their briefcase for play once chosen. However, the celebrity contestant has the option of swapping for a different briefcase, in which case the original holder of the new briefcase in play would then hold the swapped briefcase for the duration of play, then regain their designated briefcase afterwards.\n\nContestants, who joined through [[Short message service|text messaging]], are selected and screened with a series of interviews and tests, including a psychological one, before they appear on the show.\n\n==Case values==\nThe currency of the amounts on the money board, on the briefcases, and offered by the Banker to the contestants is in [[Philippine pesos]]. Throughout the show, the peso sign is never used in all of the amounts on the money board, on the briefcases, and offers by the Banker to the contestants. It is because of the limited font and/or character support for the actual peso sign (\u20b1).\n\nOn January 1, 2007, the \u20b12,500 and \u20b15,000 case values were replaced by the \u20b175,000 and the \u20b14,000,000 case values (the latter being the highest amount). On its second season, \u20b12,500 and \u20b15,000 came back in the board and new amounts like \u20b1250 and \u20b1250,000 appeared replacing the amounts, \u20b1750, \u20b1200,000, \u20b1300,000 and \u20b1400,000 of the first season together with the top amount of the season which is the \u20b13,000,000.\n\nThe briefcase amounts reverted to the original ones for the third season. But later in the third season, the five highest values were replaced with \u20b11,000,000 each, similar to the Million Dollar Missions of the [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|American version]].\n\nOn January 5, 2009, the case values for the \u20b14M Edition were brought back into play at par with the new year.\n<!-- FAIR USE of Deal_sign.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Deal_sign.jpg for rationale -->\n\nFor the fourth season, the \u20b1150 and \u20b12,500 case values were removed. In replacement, this season introduced a special prize hidden in one of the briefcases. If a contestant opens this briefcase during the game, he/she will win this guaranteed special prize in favor of normally opening its case value afterwards. The Christmas Edition returned on December 1, 2012 with the \u20b1400 and \u20b1750 cases replaced with two more \u20b1300,000 into play. From February 23, 2013 to March 23, 2013, the \u20b1750 case was replaced with one more \u20b11,000,000 for celebrating the first anniversary of the season.\n\nFor the fifth season, the \u20b175, \u20b1750, \u20b125,000, and the \u20b12,000,000 were removed. Only the \u20b11,000,000 was maintained, since this has been a common win for those who have been millionaires of the show. This board is also significant since this is the one with least total amount, over the past four seasons.\n\n{{col-start}}{{col-break}}\n\n===1st & 3rd Seasons===\n<div style=\"float:left; width:180px;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: gold;

The button itself now resembles a [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]] (except it itself does not make a sound until pressed). It looked like a sink and also lights up whenever the phone rings.\n*The landscape behind the 26K had been changed from a night [[cityscape]] to a sunset scene with columns. The staircase where the 26K stand also had columns and two more flights of stairs. Because of this, the models could appear from behind and at the side of the staircase.\n*The entrance of the 26K whenever Kris asked them to bring down the cases changed. The 26K theme was modified and became longer. There was also choreography included aside from the typical modeling entrance of the girls. The audience also clapped along with the entrance of the girls.\n*There was a bridge connecting from the Banker's skybox. It bore the show's logo. The bridge still exists in the succeeding seasons.\n*The money board now had an illuminated frame.\n*The telephone resembled the one used in the [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|US version]], only she placed the phone buttons-down. It had a pyramid-shaped base and a disc below the base which lights up like the podium.\n*The vault door was nowhere to be found. Instead, Kris comes out from a room at the back of the set.\n*The section for the player's companions was a metal bench.\n*The staircase was much higher than it used to be.\n*The theme color of the set was red (in contrast to black/gray in the first season).\n*As the show ended, ten girls entered from the back of the staircase and wave at the audience in silhouette.\n\n===Third season changes===\nWhile the money board reverted to the first-season values, there were also many changes applied for the third season:\n*The steps on which the 26K stand became larger with the background changed to a futuristic night skyline and simple boards replacing the pillars.\n*The music accompanying the 26K's entrance has also been altered to a more electronic sound. Meanwhile, a [[brass band]], dubbed \"Ang Parokya ni Banker\" (Banker's Parish) (derived from the name of the band [[Parokya ni Edgar]]) has been added to provide additional music, especially whenever a seven-digit amount is revealed. Along with the band are majorettes, who mock the contestant by saying ''\"Ubos na\"'' (\"All gone\") when both seven-digit figures have been revealed.\n*The stage itself is also considerably smaller and more circular.\n*The podium where the contestant stands is considerably smaller, even resembling a [[moped]]'s front end. The Deal button and the telephone used in the second season are still being used.\n*The section for the player's companions is a circular couch. Furthermore, there is a retractable bridge under the area which connects it with the main stage. The bridge appears whenever the companions enter the studio through a pair of sliding doors behind the couch after being called in by the host (in previous seasons, the contestant's companions are already seated by the time they are introduced).\n*The main theme color of the set has been reverted to black/gray, but the gold rectangles for the briefcase values, the Banker's offer, and even the show's logo are now made with a shiny background.\n*While the small monitor behind the contestant (and under the Banker's window) is retained, a third display monitor has been added beside the Banker's skybox. Its function is the same as the aforementioned smaller monitor: show the Banker's current offer. Sometimes, during the beginning of the show and in between offers, random images appear in the said third monitor.\n*A camera is placed behind the Banker, bounded by [[acrylic glass]].\n*The contestant now enters from a single set of doors from the back of the studio; Kris entered from the same doors during the first few episodes of the third season, but later resorted to appear on stage from the start. This set of doors is different from the one behind the companions' area mentioned earlier.\n\n===Fourth season changes===\n*The main theme color for the whole studio is dark midnight blue. This makes a new dramatic feel that contrast to previous seasons which had a lighter tone. The audience is more camouflaged behind the dark colors.\n*The steps of the 24K are sleeker and wider.\n*The stage is noticeably less circular, similar to the stage used in season two.\n*The landscape behind the 24K is now a simple layer of strings not like the past seasons.\n*The flights of the staircase for the 24K have a light of blue color.\n*The briefcases are now in black color and the numbers are in gold.\n*The host will call on the contestant with his/her companions then the host will call on the 24K. In past seasons, the 26K would be called first before the contestant.\n*The telephone resembles a back-to-basics [[rotary dial]] red telephone similarly used in other franchised countries, particularly the [[Deal or No Deal (UK game show)|British]] edition, although it is cordless like the previous telephones used in the show. The style is to take into account that the new Banker is the hat-wearing \"father\" of previous Banker, informally called \"Banker Sr.\"\n*The [[Eurostile]] font previously used in the briefcase values and the displayed values on the screens are replaced by [[Impact (font)|Impact]] and [[Verdana]]. Eurostile is still used in the show's television advertisements however.\n\n===Fifth season changes===\n*The total briefcases is now 20, instead of 24.\n*The 26K/24K Girls in the past seasons are no longer part of the new season.\n*For one two three and four batches of Lucky Stars, a roulette is used in this season, called ''Gulong ng Tala'' (\"Wheel of Stars,\" from the name \"Lucky Stars\") determining who will play among the 20 Lucky Stars, a first on the show.\n*The telephone was resembled back to the original one, applied in the US show, although its base is symmetrical to the phone itself.\n*The font of the displayed values has been changed.\n*20 Lucky Stars (celebrities) are now holding the briefcases.\n*The player of the day will come from the 20 Lucky Stars.\n*The top prize for this season is PHP1,000,000 (one half of PHP2,000,000).\n*The banker is female instead of male.\n*This season is like the Deal or no Deal US Syndicate, except the cases are 20, instead of 22.\n*The price was distributed to half to the contestant and to the chosen charity.\n*Animations of graphical elements on video displays of the show have been changed.\n*It was being Held in a Barangay where the Banker was sat inside at a Barangay OutPost.\n\n==Text promos==\n\n===''Kapamilya, Katext''===\nOn July 10, 2006, a text-messaging game was introduced as a new segment of the show for the viewers to participate and win cash prizes. In ''Katext, Deal or No Deal'', there are 10 special briefcases with amounts starting from PHP5,000 to P50,000, one of which is randomly selected for play. After a briefcase is chosen, 2 briefcases are randomly opened, after which the Banker makes an offer to buy the suitcase in play. Viewers can text whether they want to \"Deal\", signifying that they accept the banker's offer, or \"No Deal\", meaning they will accept whatever amount is in the suitcase. In the next episode, the suitcase is opened to reveal the amount it contains. If the amount in the suitcase is lower than the offer, one winner will be selected from those who texted \"Deal\", with the Banker's offer as the prize. If the amount in the suitcase is higher than the offer, one winner will be selected from those who texted \"No Deal\" to take home the amount in the suitcase. The winner is chosen each day from those who texted via electronic raffle. The amounts are:\n{{col-start}}{{col-break}}\n*5,000\n*10,000\n*15,000\n*20,000\n*25,000\n{{col-break}}\n*30,000\n*35,000\n*40,000\n*45,000\n*50,000\n{{col-end}}\nOn November 13, 2006, a segment was made that was named: ''Kapamilya, Katext, Deal or No Deal''. The range of the amounts inside the case still increased by PHP5,000 starting from PHP10,000, but the highest amount inside the case is PHP100,000. Same procedures still apply, but have been modified. On Monday, one briefcase and another has been chosen. The next day after the chosen briefcase has been opened, another briefcase is chosen, and the banker's offer is based on the briefcases already opened the previous day. This new process continues throughout the week. The amounts are:\n{{col-start}}{{col-break}}\n*10,000\n*15,000\n*20,000\n*25,000\n*30,000\n{{col-break}}\n*35,000\n*40,000\n*45,000\n*50,000\n*100,000\n{{col-end}}\n\n===''Ka-Text, Deal or No Deal''===\nAlong with the show's return, a new promo was launched, named after the first text promo ''Ka-text, Deal or No Deal'', wherein home viewers can win half of either what the contestant has won or the contents of the chosen briefcase (i.e. ranging from 50\u00a2 to PHP1,500,000). Viewers can text the contestant's possible final response of \"Deal\" or \"No Deal.\" Texting stops after the contestant has made his/her final decision. The next day, a winner is chosen from those who texted; if the contestant's final decision is \"No Deal,\" only those who text the same response would win. On the other hand, when the contestant says \"Deal,\" all who texted will be considered, regardless of response; what the winner would receive depends on the response.\n\nIn the show's third season, the rules were modified. Viewer could text \"Deal\" if the accepted offer was larger than the contents of the chosen briefcase or \"No Deal\" if the briefcase contents is larger than the accepted offer or the Banker's final offer if the contestant decides to say \"No Deal\" all the way. The correct response would depend on the outcome of the game; only those who text the correct response are eligible for prizes: P20,000 for the daily winners or P200,000 for the monthly winner. The promo was relaunched later with the same daily prizes, but this time, a [[Nissan Navara]] was up for grabs as the grand prize.\n\n===Unnamed text promo===\nIn a third promotion, this time using the show's title, viewers were invited to guess which briefcase contained P3,000,000. Those who correctly guessed the said briefcase would win PHP25,000 plus a \"[[nochebuena]]\" package.\n\n==''Tulong sa Barangay''==\nPrior to the start of the 4 Million Edition, a commercial of the show was released where [[barangay]] captains were invited to join and play as studio contestants. The aim of ''Tulong sa Barangay'' is to provide help for the needs and developments of different barangays in the Philippines by allowing the barangay captains to play as studio contestants and whatever the barangay captain will get, it will be donated to the barangay funds. A different set of text messaging instructions are given for interested barangay captains. The first episode involving barangay captains began on February 6, 2007.\n\n==''Kapamilya, Deal or No Deal sa Cebu''==\nOn November 30 to December 1, 2007, the show finally made its first out-studio episodes at the parking lot of [[SM City Cebu]]. The stage made for the show was noticeably larger, having a larger stage and two large staircases where the models stood. The Banker would stand at the screen behind the staircases obscured by a red clouded background. He only appeared in front of his \"helicopter\" whenever he made his offer.\n\nThe episodes were shown from December 3 to 7 of the same year. One of the contestants happened to be the mayor of [[Toledo City, Cebu]], who played as a regular contestant.\n\n==Winners of at least PHP1,000,000==\n<!-- Please list only those who won at least a million, not those who won less than it -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The banker spoke to him over the phone and congratulated him while Kris Aquino asked for Cua's necklace and shared the closing announcement of ''Deal or No Deal'' with him in the episode. The final three unopened values were the three highest prizes (PHP2,000,000, PHP1,000,000 and PHP500,000) and the final two briefcases contained the two highest amounts. The banker's last offer was PHP1,400,000.\n|-\n| 4\n| February 19, 2007\n| [[Robert Jaworski]]\n| Deal\n| 1,000,007\n| Former [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] and [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] player Robert Jaworski has the largest amount won by a celebrity player, although his briefcase contained PHP2,000,000. The amount of PHP1,000,007 was offered twice. In fact, some of the other offers either contain his former jersey number (7) or have its digits add up to it.\n|-\n| 5\n| July 10, 2007\n| Jennel Montero\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The last unopened briefcase contained PHP500,000, and the banker's last offer is PHP600,000. Jennel is the first millionaire of the second season, and the third ever person to win a seven-digit prize in a No Deal situation.\n|-\n| 6\n| August 6, 2007\n| Allen Paul Aguada\n| No Deal\n| 2,000,000\n| The last two unopened amounts were the two highest prizes (PHP2,000,000 and PHP3,000,000). The banker's offer is PHP2,250,000, the highest in the show's history. Allen was still declared by Kris as \"Lucky\" because his final position resulted after removing the last two small values still in play (PHP5 and PHP150). According to Allen, his father was supposed to join, but the father urged him to join instead.\n|-\n| 7\n| September 5, 2007\n| Jerhan Mama-O\n| No Deal\n| 2,000,000\n| Jerhan is the first winner of at least PHP1,000,000 from [[Mindanao]], from [[Marawi City]]. His choice of briefcase (#2) is purely by gut feel and while he did eliminate the two other seven-digit values in the first round, he firmly believed on the would-be contents of the briefcase to the end. As Jerhan is Muslim, the Banker's last offer is PHP999,999, which was based from the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|99 names of God according to Islam]]. Jerhan also correctly predicted where the two other unopened values (PHP1 and PHP250,000) were hidden; he eliminated the PHP1 briefcase before the Banker gave his final offer.\n|-\n| 8\n| October 2, 2007\n| Rene Lamprea\n| Deal\n| 1,250,000\n| Although omens from his late younger brother compelled him to choose briefcase #5 (October 5 and the five-peso coin said to be from the late brother), the hare-lipped contestant decided to follow his wife's advice to take the offer. His chosen briefcase contained only PHP400 (with the other amount being PHP3,000,000); he was also the first regular contestant since the show's time slot was moved to 6:00pm; seven celebrities (two as a team) played before him, two of them accepting six-digit offers from the Banker.\n|-\n| 9\n| October 16, 2007\n| Melody Macol\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP499,000, the unopened briefcase contained PHP250,000 (also the amount at which the house was pawned). Coincidentally, her chosen briefcase was Briefcase #9, the same numbered briefcase Kris chose when she played four days before and won only PHP50.\n|-\n| 10\n| October 22, 2007\n| [[Aiko Melendez]]\n| Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| According to the actress and [[Quezon City]] 2nd District Councilor, her prize is for the benefit of several patients in the [[East Avenue Medical Center]]. Although her briefcase contained PHP3,000,000, the other unopened amount is PHP50,000. She is also the second celebrity player to win at least PHP1,000,000.\n|-\n| 11\n| November 6, 2007\n| [[Kim Atienza]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer is PHP400,000, which according to him, is the life span in years of the quahog clam. The other unopened amount was PHP25,000.\n|-\n| 12\n| December 12, 2007\n| Maria Rosario Odabel\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The last unopened amount is PHP250,000. She kept all six-digit amounts and PHP1,000,000 after opening the last small amount (PHP75).\n|-\n| 13\n| November 3, 2008\n| Anthony Solis\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| He opened many amounts lower than PHP100,000 in the first two rounds, which continued until the third when he opened the PHP300,000. Even though he opened the PHP2,000,000 (not surprising held by model Charmel de Asis), his luck still continued that by the penultimate round, he opened the last small amount of PHP150. After he opened the PHP200,000, he was given the final offer of PHP490,000, which he refused. The last unopened amount was PHP100,000. He was the first millionaire of the third season.\n|-\n| 14\n| November 17, 2008\n| Rey Beltran\n| Deal\n| 1,100,000\n| He opened the final low amount, PHP50, in the eight round, leaving the PHP200,000, PHP400,000, and PHP2,000,000 still in play. He was offered PHP780,000, which he refused. In the final round, the PHP400,000 was opened, and this amount sufficed. His chosen briefcase contained PHP200,000. The reason for the non-exact amounts was because he was tithing some of his winnings for the Christian fellowships he was supporting.\n|-\n| 15\n| November 25, 2008\n| [[Aiko Melendez]] & Candy Pangilinan\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| Playing as a team, the two actresses had a final offer of PHP345,001, which they refused. They incidentally picked one of the five briefcases that each contained PHP1,000,000. The last unopened briefcase contained PHP10. Their game was their second appearance in the show; each of their first games ended in bad deals, albeit taking home six- and seven-digit prizes (see above) respectively. The two were jointly declared as the 15th millionaire and the first team to win a seven-digit prize.\n|-\n| 16\n| December 1, 2008\n| Jhaphet Flordeliza\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| He was first offered PHP466,000 with PHP50 and two PHP1,000,000 briefcases still in play in the penultimate round, but refused. When the second to the last PHP1,000,000 was opened, the Banker lowered his offer to PHP150,000. Upon advise from his father, Jhaphet said \"No Deal,\" and won the PHP1,000,000. He was the first and only regular contestant to become a millionaire for the 2008 Christmas Edition.\n|-\n| 17\n| December 11, 2008\n| [[Arnel Pineda]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| He was the second ever internationally known celebrity to play in the game (after [[apl.de.ap]] less than a year before) and the fourth celebrity to win the million pesos. He won this amount even after opening the four other million-peso briefcases and refusing the final offer of PHP249,999. The last unopened briefcase contained PHP200. He was in the Philippines to spend his Christmas in his homeland while his band, the American band [[Journey (band)|Journey]], was taking a tour break. He is the third celebrity millionaire.\n|-\n| 18\n| January 12, 2009\n| [[Judy Ann Santos]] & [[Ryan Agoncillo]]\n| Deal\n| 1,000,030\n| After the eighth round, with PHP4,000,000, PHP1,000,000, and PHP75 still in play, they were offered PHP1,150,000, but the Banker promised to increase the offer to PHP1,500,000 if their manager [[Alfie Lorenzo]] would join them; they both refused to both offers. After opening the PHP1,000,000 in the final round, they were offered this amount, which they accepted to play it safe after the loss of their final \"safety net.\" Their chosen briefcase contained only PHP75. The additional PHP30 referenced the total of the prizes two previously in won each of their first appearances (Judy Ann won PHP25 and Ryan got only PHP5; both went No Deal). They intended to use their winnings for their campaign to have the movie ''[[Ploning]]'' included in the official nominee list for the Best Foreign Language Film in the [[81st Academy Awards|81st Oscar Awards]].\n|-\n| 19\n| January 28, 2009\n| Maribuena Noche\n| Deal\n| 1,075,600\n| Her game went so well that only her mother was brought out to cheer her on as based from experience relatives were known to reverse the luck of one's game. After the eighth round, when she eliminated PHP10, she was offered this amount with PHP1, PHP500,000, and PHP4,000,000 still in play. She accepted the offer upon the suggestion of her mother. Unbelievably, it turned out that her briefcase contained only PHP1 with a potential final offer of PHP275,000 after seeing that the potential final briefcase she would have opened contained PHP4,000,000 (unsurpringly held by Charmel de Asis). The extra PHP75,600 was a reference to Maribuena's mother's medical bills.\n|-\n| 20\n| February 2, 2009\n| [[Gerald Anderson]] & [[Jake Cuenca]]\n| No Deal\n| 2,000,000\n| Initially having a bad game by having the PHP4,000,000 opened in the first round and revealing many six-digit prizes afterwards, they later had a game so good that they were given a final offer of PHP838,000, with the PHP2,000,000 and PHP75,000 still in play. They refused the offer and won the two million. Gerald and Jake, leading men of the show ''[[Tayong Dalawa]]'', were the third pair of returning celebrities to win a seven-digit prize as a unit and the one with the largest winnings. Also, their separate first appearances were in team games with different partners: Gerald with [[Kim Chiu]] in the first season and Jake with [[Roxanne Guinoo]] in the second. Probably to prevent any misunderstanding, all of the companions brought in to cheer and help them were men. Ironically in the fourth season, Gerald Anderson reappeared only winning one peso.\n|-\n| 21\n| February 16, 2009\n| Christopher Viray\n| Deal\n| 1,600,000\n| After eliminating the last low amount, PHP400, he was soon given large six- and seven-digit offers, starting with PHP750,000, and then PHP1,050,000, both of which he refused. After eliminating PHP500,000, he was offered this amount, with PHP4,000,000 and PHP75,000 still in play. Upon the advice of his companions, especially his elder brother (Robert Viray), he accepted the offer. However, despite the fact that his chosen briefcase contained the top prize of PHP4,000,000, he currently holds the distinction of winning the highest Banker's offer that has been accepted by a contestant in the show.\n|-\n| 22\n| August 18, 2012\n| [[Kean Cipriano]] & [[Enchong Dee]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP420,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP10. They were the first millionaire of the fourth season \n|-\n| 23\n| December 29, 2012\n| [[Janice de Belen]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP563,855 and the other unopened amount was PHP25,000.\n|-\n| 24\n| June 8, 2013\n| [[Boy Abunda]]\n| Deal\n| 1,186,003\n| According to him, he will take the risk saying No Deal but his priority is his chosen charity and therefore accepting this offer. His briefcase's amount was PHP2,000,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP5.\n|-\n| 25\n| August 31, 2013\n| Genelyn Sandaga\n| Deal\n| 1,123,000\n| Her briefcase's amount was PHP2,000,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP25,000.\n|-\n| 26\n| March 23, 2015\n| [[Bearwin Meily]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP614,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP 100,000. He was the first millionaire of the fifth season.\n|-\n| 27\n| April 17, 2015\n| [[Ara Mina]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| After eliminating the PHP500, she was given an offer of PHP407,000 which she refused. The last 3 lowest amounts were PHP100, PHP500,000, and PHP1,000,000. When she eliminated the PHP500,000, the offer went down to PHP355,000 which she refused. She was the second millionaire for the fifth season of the show.\n|- \n| 28 \n| August 14, 2015 \n| [[Bela Padilla]] & [[Joyce Bernal]]\n| No Deal \n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP699,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP400,000.

She is the fifth millionaire of the fifth season and first millionaire of 2016.\n|}\nSo far, only Terry Lim Cua, Allen Paul Aguada, Jerhan Mama-O, and the team of Gerald Anderson and Jake Cuenca won the largest amount, which is PHP2,000,000.\n\n==Statistics==\n*'''Largest amount won:''' PHP2,000,000 (December 29, 2006; August 6, 2007; September 5, 2007; and February 2, 2009 episodes)\n*'''Highest potential offer:''' PHP2,250,000 (August 6, 2007 episode)\n*'''Highest banker's offer accepted:''' PHP1,600,000 (February 16, 2009 episode)\n\n==Parodies==\n*[[Toni Gonzaga]] of ''[[Gudtaym]]'' (a sitcom previously aired on the same network) hosted \"Kapamilya Meal or No Meal,\" which was a parody of the show. Filipinos from low income brackets were invited to the studio to play for the meal they wish to eat. The contestants were literally not given dinner to eat before the game. In the pilot episode, the contestant won and got to eat ''tuyo'' (dried fish). The prizes were lechon (roasted pig) with PHP6,000, tinolang manok (stewed chicken soup) with PHP3,000, adobong daga (rat stewed with soy sauce), tuyo (dried fish) and asin (salt).\n*''[[Wazzup Wazzup]]'' of [[Studio 23]] (owned by the same network) also came up with a parody dating segment titled \"Kazupista, Feel or No Feel\".

John fought for his briefcase until the end, refusing the banker's offer of PHP101,000. His briefcase contained PHP200,000, while the other remaining briefcase contained PHP1.\n*When the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] opened the filing of candidacy for the midterm senatorial elections in the Philippines last January 15, 2007, several individuals applied for candidacy, even those that are considered ''nuisance candidates'' like a certain Daniel Magtira who introduced himself as Kris Aquino's husband.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Paghahain ng COC, nagsimula na | date=January 17, 2007 | publisher=[[TV Patrol World]] | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=63160 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=63160 | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 9, 2007 }}</ref> After two days, a certain Julieto Esmeralda Sr., who claims to be both a pastor and a businessman, filed his candidacy referring to himself as ''Mr. Deal'' signifying his aiming of building a culture of optimism to prevail among Filipinos.

Kris even made a \"Deal\" pose and catchphrase in the last part of the commercial, signifying her way of convincing the voters to vote for him. Ironically, Noynoy's response to Kris in the ad was ''\"Ayos, Game Na\"'', inspired from the catchphrase of Kris Aquino's game show ''Pilipinas, Game KNB?''. Noynoy won the senate race and landed on the 6th out of 12 slots.<ref>{{cite news | first=Erwin | last=Oliva | title=Kris Aquino, James Yap grace Noynoy\u2019s proclamation | date=June 7, 2007 | newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer | url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=69897 | access-date=July 8, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627095034/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=69897 | archive-date=June 27, 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*On the October 12, 2007 episode, [[McDonald's]] Philippines launched its advertisement featuring Kris Aquino playing \"Meal or No Meal\" over the counter with a McDonald's cashier. The McDonald's crew featured in the commercial were holding trays instead of briefcases containing the \"value meals\" that can be selected by patrons of the fast food chain. The restaurant chain also had a raffle promotion in which its winner eventually played in the show.\n\n==Criticisms==\n*''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' columnist Nestor U. Torre expressed disappointment on the show because it is not \"all that spellbinding and empathetic\" since the briefcase a contestant has chosen would keep it to the end (contrary to some versions which exchanging briefcases is allowed). Also, he pointed out that the format of the show limited Aquino's effectivity as a host.<ref>{{cite news| first=Nestor U. | last=Torre | pages=A2\u20137 | title=Viewfinder: Not that big a deal | date=June 12, 2006 | newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer | url=http://news.inq7.net/entertainment/index.php?index=2&story_id=78817&col=26}}</ref>\n*In his January 18, 2007 column, Nestor U. Torre expressed that the game show makes it so difficult for its players to win big because it's based on sheer luck, with a player's fate being sealed by the choice he makes of a particular briefcase to place his hopes on at the start of the game. He cited that another major factor that reduces players\u2019 winnings is the \u201cgreed\u201d motive that pushes contestants to reject already substantial deals from the show's resident \u201cbanker,\u201d because they want to make even more money by pushing the game into the next round. However, Torre does recognize that subsequent contestants were the first to benefit from the game show's beefed-up top prize and will bring new excitement in everyone involved\u2014the contestants, the studio audience, and the host. He mentioned that the move to double the game's pot sets the show apart from other game programs, many of which offer a couple of million pesos in potential top winnings. With its P4 million pot for the 2007 run of the first season, he pointed out that it is now the best game show to beat.<ref>{{cite news | first=Nestor U. | last=Torre | pages=A2\u20137 | title=Viewfinder: Luck of the draw | date=January 18, 2007 | newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer | url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=44235 | access-date=January 20, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014224958/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=44235 | archive-date=October 14, 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*The July 14, 2006 episode featuring psychic Rene Mariano became controversial when the host complemented Rene's abilities because the latter predicted the end of the career of [[Hero Angeles]], ''[[Star Circle Quest]]'' grand champion, at ''[[Morning Girls with Kris and Korina]]'' (previously aired on the same network).

The game show's tagline is \"''Ang Kapalaran mo, Desisyon Mo''\" which in turn translates in English as \"''Your Fate, [is] Your Decision''.\" At the time of its premiere, this was the first weekday primetime game show in the Philippines since the so-called primetime game show craze died down in late 2002, with ''Pilipinas, Game KNB?'', the last remaining show among the weekday primetime game shows, reformatted into a daytime one after a relatively brief hiatus (although it had a primetime spinoff called ''Pasko Na, Game KNB?'' for three weeks on December 2005 to January 2006).\n\nThe first season of the show was supposed to be a three-month stint, to give way to another Endemol-produced program ''[[Pinoy Dream Academy]]'', but its immense popularity caused the show to be extended to a nine-month-long season. The second season premiered in June 2007, and was supposed to end in October of the same year. Once again, the show's success amongst viewers resulted in an extended season, a new time slot, and lead programming for the [[TV Patrol World|evening news]]; the season concluded in January 2007. After an 18-month hiatus, the third season of the show premiered in July 2008, and became the first to also be broadcast on [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]]'s North American feed. The original series of the program ended on March 27, 2009.\n\nAfter a nearly two-year hiatus, the show returned In February 2012 with [[Luis Manzano]] as host. Original presenter Kris Aquino further elaborated that she could not host the show as she was having upcoming commitments for her upcoming drama series, ''[[Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw (TV series)|Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw]]'', with [[Anne Curtis]].<ref>[http://www.push.com.ph/features/4417/luis-manzano-on-hosting-kapamilya-deal-or-no-deal-mahirap-kumuha-ng-next-kris-aquino/ Luis Manzano on hosting Kapamilya Deal or No Deal: Mahirap kumuha ng next Kris Aquino] retrieved via www.push.com.ph 01-21-2012</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JEdAzfJT7g Kapamilya, Deal Or No deal with Luis Manzano Teaser] retrieved via www.youtube.com via abscbnonline user 01-31-2012</ref> Considered as a continuation of the original series, this fourth season lasted until September 2013, and had noticeable changes in game play, and in scheduling, airing only on Saturdays, as opposed to weekdays like the previous three seasons.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/10860/Are-you-ready-to-make-a-deal-with-Luis-Manzano-.aspx Are you ready to make a deal with Luis Manzano?] retrieved via www.abs-cbn.com 02-24-2012</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6zwzn24KqE Kapamilya Deal or No Deal ngayon Sabado na!] retrieved via www.youtube.com via abscbnonline user 02-23-2012</ref> The fifth season of the show premiered in February 2015 after numerous teasers hinting of the show's return, with further changes to game play (to be mentioned below).\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe [[Philippines|Philippine]] version is very similar to the [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|U.S. version]] of Deal or No Deal (including the logo), except for the sounds and musical scoring which were adapted from the [[Miljoenenjacht (Netherlands)|Dutch version]].\n\nBefore the game proper begins, a third party randomly places the possible amount of prize in the briefcases, which are distributed to 26 identically dressed models called the 26K who reveal the contents during the game. No one, including the host, knows what amounts are in the cases. Each contestant receives a new, randomly assigned set of cases. The prizes range in amounts from PHP1 to PHP2,000,000. See listing below.\n\nAfter picking a case, the contestant then selects six of the remaining 25 cases, revealed one at a time. This is followed by a \"phone call\" by \"The Banker\", a mysterious figure whose face is not shown (at times a silhouette can be seen). He purportedly sits in a [[balcony|skybox]] (situated between the two audience sections) and makes an offer, via telephone to the host (his voice is never heard) to buy the contestant's case based on the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the cash amounts still in play, and also based on the player's psychology. This amount is usually lower than the mean. In more recent episodes, the banker \"punishes\" a player of opening a large amount by offering a ''very'' small amount, despite the number of larger amounts still left in play. The player is then asked by Kris the title question: \"Deal or No Deal?\"\n\nShould the contestant refuse the offer (by stating \"No Deal!\"), they must choose five of the remaining cases to eliminate from consideration. The Banker makes another offer, and the game continues as before. The Banker's offer may be higher or lower than the previous offer (if a top prize is eliminated, generally the offer decreases; conversely, if lower amounts are eliminated the offer increases significantly).\n\nThe contestant is shown a button to press in case the contestant takes the banker's offer. The player can just push the button to take the offer, even without saying \"Deal.\" On the other hand, the contestant can simply close the button's cover to imply \"No Deal\" without actually saying the phrase.\n\nSubsequent rounds have the contestant withdrawing five, four, three, then two cases from play, with Banker's offer appearing in between rounds; should the contestant continue to decline The Banker's offer after the two cases were picked, he/she then eliminates one case at a time (with an intervening offer from The Banker) until two cases are left. If the player rejects the final offer, they receive whatever cash amount is contained inside the case that they originally chose.\n\nEach contestant has several supporters (usually three or four), who sit in a special section just off stage during his/her game. As the field of briefcases dwindles, one or more of the supporters are asked to consult with the contestant and help him/her make a decision. These exchanges have become emotional, particularly when very high and very small amounts remained and The Banker offers a large cash buyout. The contestant's supporters are typically revealed after the second Bank deal and before the third round; although if a contestant is doing well, the host will let the game run its course for some time, often consulting the supporters when the tide begins to turn.\n\nIf in case the contestant decides to accept the offer of the Banker at the end of any round, the host will let him go on (\"No Deal\" instead of \"Deal\" assumed at that point) until the end (at the end of every subsequent round, the amount offered by the Banker is revealed to him and \"No Deal\" is assumed) to determine if he made the correct decision.\n\nIn the fourth season (2012), due to the reduced number of briefcases from 26 to 24, the number of briefcases opened in each round is also modified, starting from five in the first round, three in each of the next three rounds, two in each the next three rounds, and one in each the final two rounds. Gameplay otherwise remains the same, with the exception of a routine option to swap briefcases in the end. The offer to swap briefcases was only given one time during Aquino's tenure.\n\nIn the fifth season (2015), once again due to the reduced number of briefcases from 24 to 20, for the very first time in this season and for this franchise, celebrities were the ones to hold the briefcases and a roulette is used to determine who among the 20 Lucky Stars would be the player of the day. Everyone would have a chance to play, since their tenureship as briefcase holders last for a month, and they would be replaced by a new batch of celebrities every month. The number of briefcases opened in each round is brought back to the usual format used in Season 1 to 4, but instead of six cases to open first, five were first opened, then four, three, two until one case is opened in succeeding rounds. However, the special section for the player's supporters has been removed, since the celebrity player of the day is also part of the 20 Lucky Stars, so after each star's situated briefcase is opened, they would sit in the audience space provided with a special platform row and would help the player in case if he/she has a difficult time during case selection at gameplay. Generally, the celebrity's designated briefcase as a Lucky Star would be their briefcase for play once chosen. However, the celebrity contestant has the option of swapping for a different briefcase, in which case the original holder of the new briefcase in play would then hold the swapped briefcase for the duration of play, then regain their designated briefcase afterwards.\n\nContestants, who joined through [[Short message service|text messaging]], are selected and screened with a series of interviews and tests, including a psychological one, before they appear on the show.\n\n==Case values==\nThe currency of the amounts on the money board, on the briefcases, and offered by the Banker to the contestants is in [[Philippine pesos]]. Throughout the show, the peso sign is never used in all of the amounts on the money board, on the briefcases, and offers by the Banker to the contestants. It is because of the limited font and/or character support for the actual peso sign (\u20b1).\n\nOn January 1, 2007, the \u20b12,500 and \u20b15,000 case values were replaced by the \u20b175,000 and the \u20b14,000,000 case values (the latter being the highest amount). On its second season, \u20b12,500 and \u20b15,000 came back in the board and new amounts like \u20b1250 and \u20b1250,000 appeared replacing the amounts, \u20b1750, \u20b1200,000, \u20b1300,000 and \u20b1400,000 of the first season together with the top amount of the season which is the \u20b13,000,000.\n\nThe briefcase amounts reverted to the original ones for the third season. But later in the third season, the five highest values were replaced with \u20b11,000,000 each, similar to the Million Dollar Missions of the [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|American version]].\n\nOn January 5, 2009, the case values for the \u20b14M Edition were brought back into play at par with the new year.\n<!-- FAIR USE of Deal_sign.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Deal_sign.jpg for rationale -->\n\nFor the fourth season, the \u20b1150 and \u20b12,500 case values were removed. In replacement, this season introduced a special prize hidden in one of the briefcases. If a contestant opens this briefcase during the game, he/she will win this guaranteed special prize in favor of normally opening its case value afterwards. The Christmas Edition returned on December 1, 2012 with the \u20b1400 and \u20b1750 cases replaced with two more \u20b1300,000 into play. From February 23, 2013 to March 23, 2013, the \u20b1750 case was replaced with one more \u20b11,000,000 for celebrating the first anniversary of the season.\n\nFor the fifth season, the \u20b175, \u20b1750, \u20b125,000, and the \u20b12,000,000 were removed. Only the \u20b11,000,000 was maintained, since this has been a common win for those who have been millionaires of the show. This board is also significant since this is the one with least total amount, over the past four seasons.\n\n{{col-start}}{{col-break}}\n\n===1st & 3rd Seasons===\n<div style=\"float:left; width:180px;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: gold;

The button itself now resembles a [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]] (except it itself does not make a sound until pressed). It looked like a sink and also lights up whenever the phone rings.\n*The landscape behind the 26K had been changed from a night [[cityscape]] to a sunset scene with columns. The staircase where the 26K stand also had columns and two more flights of stairs. Because of this, the models could appear from behind and at the side of the staircase.\n*The entrance of the 26K whenever Kris asked them to bring down the cases changed. The 26K theme was modified and became longer. There was also choreography included aside from the typical modeling entrance of the girls. The audience also clapped along with the entrance of the girls.\n*There was a bridge connecting from the Banker's skybox. It bore the show's logo. The bridge still exists in the succeeding seasons.\n*The money board now had an illuminated frame.\n*The telephone resembled the one used in the [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|US version]], only she placed the phone buttons-down. It had a pyramid-shaped base and a disc below the base which lights up like the podium.\n*The vault door was nowhere to be found. Instead, Kris comes out from a room at the back of the set.\n*The section for the player's companions was a metal bench.\n*The staircase was much higher than it used to be.\n*The theme color of the set was red (in contrast to black/gray in the first season).\n*As the show ended, ten girls entered from the back of the staircase and wave at the audience in silhouette.\n\n===Third season changes===\nWhile the money board reverted to the first-season values, there were also many changes applied for the third season:\n*The steps on which the 26K stand became larger with the background changed to a futuristic night skyline and simple boards replacing the pillars.\n*The music accompanying the 26K's entrance has also been altered to a more electronic sound. Meanwhile, a [[brass band]], dubbed \"Ang Parokya ni Banker\" (Banker's Parish) (derived from the name of the band [[Parokya ni Edgar]]) has been added to provide additional music, especially whenever a seven-digit amount is revealed. Along with the band are majorettes, who mock the contestant by saying ''\"Ubos na\"'' (\"All gone\") when both seven-digit figures have been revealed.\n*The stage itself is also considerably smaller and more circular.\n*The podium where the contestant stands is considerably smaller, even resembling a [[moped]]'s front end. The Deal button and the telephone used in the second season are still being used.\n*The section for the player's companions is a circular couch. Furthermore, there is a retractable bridge under the area which connects it with the main stage. The bridge appears whenever the companions enter the studio through a pair of sliding doors behind the couch after being called in by the host (in previous seasons, the contestant's companions are already seated by the time they are introduced).\n*The main theme color of the set has been reverted to black/gray, but the gold rectangles for the briefcase values, the Banker's offer, and even the show's logo are now made with a shiny background.\n*While the small monitor behind the contestant (and under the Banker's window) is retained, a third display monitor has been added beside the Banker's skybox. Its function is the same as the aforementioned smaller monitor: show the Banker's current offer. Sometimes, during the beginning of the show and in between offers, random images appear in the said third monitor.\n*A camera is placed behind the Banker, bounded by [[acrylic glass]].\n*The contestant now enters from a single set of doors from the back of the studio; Kris entered from the same doors during the first few episodes of the third season, but later resorted to appear on stage from the start. This set of doors is different from the one behind the companions' area mentioned earlier.\n\n===Fourth season changes===\n*The main theme color for the whole studio is dark midnight blue. This makes a new dramatic feel that contrast to previous seasons which had a lighter tone. The audience is more camouflaged behind the dark colors.\n*The steps of the 24K are sleeker and wider.\n*The stage is noticeably less circular, similar to the stage used in season two.\n*The landscape behind the 24K is now a simple layer of strings not like the past seasons.\n*The flights of the staircase for the 24K have a light of blue color.\n*The briefcases are now in black color and the numbers are in gold.\n*The host will call on the contestant with his/her companions then the host will call on the 24K. In past seasons, the 26K would be called first before the contestant.\n*The telephone resembles a back-to-basics [[rotary dial]] red telephone similarly used in other franchised countries, particularly the [[Deal or No Deal (UK game show)|British]] edition, although it is cordless like the previous telephones used in the show. The style is to take into account that the new Banker is the hat-wearing \"father\" of previous Banker, informally called \"Banker Sr.\"\n*The [[Eurostile]] font previously used in the briefcase values and the displayed values on the screens are replaced by [[Impact (font)|Impact]] and [[Verdana]]. Eurostile is still used in the show's television advertisements however.\n\n===Fifth season changes===\n*The total briefcases is now 20, instead of 24.\n*The 26K/24K Girls in the past seasons are no longer part of the new season.\n*For one two three and four batches of Lucky Stars, a roulette is used in this season, called ''Gulong ng Tala'' (\"Wheel of Stars,\" from the name \"Lucky Stars\") determining who will play among the 20 Lucky Stars, a first on the show.\n*The telephone was resembled back to the original one, applied in the US show, although its base is symmetrical to the phone itself.\n*The font of the displayed values has been changed.\n*20 Lucky Stars (celebrities) are now holding the briefcases.\n*The player of the day will come from the 20 Lucky Stars.\n*The top prize for this season is PHP1,000,000 (one half of PHP2,000,000).\n*The banker is female instead of male.\n*This season is like the Deal or no Deal US Syndicate, except the cases are 20, instead of 22.\n*The price was distributed to half to the contestant and to the chosen charity.\n*Animations of graphical elements on video displays of the show have been changed.\n*It was being Held in a Barangay where the Banker was sat inside at a Barangay OutPost.\n\n==Text promos==\n\n===''Kapamilya, Katext''===\nOn July 10, 2006, a text-messaging game was introduced as a new segment of the show for the viewers to participate and win cash prizes. In ''Katext, Deal or No Deal'', there are 10 special briefcases with amounts starting from PHP5,000 to P50,000, one of which is randomly selected for play. After a briefcase is chosen, 2 briefcases are randomly opened, after which the Banker makes an offer to buy the suitcase in play. Viewers can text whether they want to \"Deal\", signifying that they accept the banker's offer, or \"No Deal\", meaning they will accept whatever amount is in the suitcase. In the next episode, the suitcase is opened to reveal the amount it contains. If the amount in the suitcase is lower than the offer, one winner will be selected from those who texted \"Deal\", with the Banker's offer as the prize. If the amount in the suitcase is higher than the offer, one winner will be selected from those who texted \"No Deal\" to take home the amount in the suitcase. The winner is chosen each day from those who texted via electronic raffle. The amounts are:\n{{col-start}}{{col-break}}\n*5,000\n*10,000\n*15,000\n*20,000\n*25,000\n{{col-break}}\n*30,000\n*35,000\n*40,000\n*45,000\n*50,000\n{{col-end}}\nOn November 13, 2006, a segment was made that was named: ''Kapamilya, Katext, Deal or No Deal''. The range of the amounts inside the case still increased by PHP5,000 starting from PHP10,000, but the highest amount inside the case is PHP100,000. Same procedures still apply, but have been modified. On Monday, one briefcase and another has been chosen. The next day after the chosen briefcase has been opened, another briefcase is chosen, and the banker's offer is based on the briefcases already opened the previous day. This new process continues throughout the week. The amounts are:\n{{col-start}}{{col-break}}\n*10,000\n*15,000\n*20,000\n*25,000\n*30,000\n{{col-break}}\n*35,000\n*40,000\n*45,000\n*50,000\n*100,000\n{{col-end}}\n\n===''Ka-Text, Deal or No Deal''===\nAlong with the show's return, a new promo was launched, named after the first text promo ''Ka-text, Deal or No Deal'', wherein home viewers can win half of either what the contestant has won or the contents of the chosen briefcase (i.e. ranging from 50\u00a2 to PHP1,500,000). Viewers can text the contestant's possible final response of \"Deal\" or \"No Deal.\" Texting stops after the contestant has made his/her final decision. The next day, a winner is chosen from those who texted; if the contestant's final decision is \"No Deal,\" only those who text the same response would win. On the other hand, when the contestant says \"Deal,\" all who texted will be considered, regardless of response; what the winner would receive depends on the response.\n\nIn the show's third season, the rules were modified. Viewer could text \"Deal\" if the accepted offer was larger than the contents of the chosen briefcase or \"No Deal\" if the briefcase contents is larger than the accepted offer or the Banker's final offer if the contestant decides to say \"No Deal\" all the way. The correct response would depend on the outcome of the game; only those who text the correct response are eligible for prizes: P20,000 for the daily winners or P200,000 for the monthly winner. The promo was relaunched later with the same daily prizes, but this time, a [[Nissan Navara]] was up for grabs as the grand prize.\n\n===Unnamed text promo===\nIn a third promotion, this time using the show's title, viewers were invited to guess which briefcase contained P3,000,000. Those who correctly guessed the said briefcase would win PHP25,000 plus a \"[[nochebuena]]\" package.\n\n==''Tulong sa Barangay''==\nPrior to the start of the 4 Million Edition, a commercial of the show was released where [[barangay]] captains were invited to join and play as studio contestants. The aim of ''Tulong sa Barangay'' is to provide help for the needs and developments of different barangays in the Philippines by allowing the barangay captains to play as studio contestants and whatever the barangay captain will get, it will be donated to the barangay funds. A different set of text messaging instructions are given for interested barangay captains. The first episode involving barangay captains began on February 6, 2007.\n\n==''Kapamilya, Deal or No Deal sa Cebu''==\nOn November 30 to December 1, 2007, the show finally made its first out-studio episodes at the parking lot of [[SM City Cebu]]. The stage made for the show was noticeably larger, having a larger stage and two large staircases where the models stood. The Banker would stand at the screen behind the staircases obscured by a red clouded background. He only appeared in front of his \"helicopter\" whenever he made his offer.\n\nThe episodes were shown from December 3 to 7 of the same year. One of the contestants happened to be the mayor of [[Toledo City, Cebu]], who played as a regular contestant.\n\n==Winners of at least PHP1,000,000==\n<!-- Please list only those who won at least a million, not those who won less than it -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The banker spoke to him over the phone and congratulated him while Kris Aquino asked for Cua's necklace and shared the closing announcement of ''Deal or No Deal'' with him in the episode. The final three unopened values were the three highest prizes (PHP2,000,000, PHP1,000,000 and PHP500,000) and the final two briefcases contained the two highest amounts. The banker's last offer was PHP1,400,000.\n|-\n| 4\n| February 19, 2007\n| [[Robert Jaworski]]\n| Deal\n| 1,000,007\n| Former [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] and [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] player Robert Jaworski has the largest amount won by a celebrity player, although his briefcase contained PHP2,000,000. The amount of PHP1,000,007 was offered twice. In fact, some of the other offers either contain his former jersey number (7) or have its digits add up to it.\n|-\n| 5\n| July 10, 2007\n| Jennel Montero\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The last unopened briefcase contained PHP500,000, and the banker's last offer is PHP600,000. Jennel is the first millionaire of the second season, and the third ever person to win a seven-digit prize in a No Deal situation.\n|-\n| 6\n| August 6, 2007\n| Allen Paul Aguada\n| No Deal\n| 2,000,000\n| The last two unopened amounts were the two highest prizes (PHP2,000,000 and PHP3,000,000). The banker's offer is PHP2,250,000, the highest in the show's history. Allen was still declared by Kris as \"Lucky\" because his final position resulted after removing the last two small values still in play (PHP5 and PHP150). According to Allen, his father was supposed to join, but the father urged him to join instead.\n|-\n| 7\n| September 5, 2007\n| Jerhan Mama-O\n| No Deal\n| 2,000,000\n| Jerhan is the first winner of at least PHP1,000,000 from [[Mindanao]], from [[Marawi City]]. His choice of briefcase (#2) is purely by gut feel and while he did eliminate the two other seven-digit values in the first round, he firmly believed on the would-be contents of the briefcase to the end. As Jerhan is Muslim, the Banker's last offer is PHP999,999, which was based from the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|99 names of God according to Islam]]. Jerhan also correctly predicted where the two other unopened values (PHP1 and PHP250,000) were hidden; he eliminated the PHP1 briefcase before the Banker gave his final offer.\n|-\n| 8\n| October 2, 2007\n| Rene Lamprea\n| Deal\n| 1,250,000\n| Although omens from his late younger brother compelled him to choose briefcase #5 (October 5 and the five-peso coin said to be from the late brother), the hare-lipped contestant decided to follow his wife's advice to take the offer. His chosen briefcase contained only PHP400 (with the other amount being PHP3,000,000); he was also the first regular contestant since the show's time slot was moved to 6:00pm; seven celebrities (two as a team) played before him, two of them accepting six-digit offers from the Banker.\n|-\n| 9\n| October 16, 2007\n| Melody Macol\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP499,000, the unopened briefcase contained PHP250,000 (also the amount at which the house was pawned). Coincidentally, her chosen briefcase was Briefcase #9, the same numbered briefcase Kris chose when she played four days before and won only PHP50.\n|-\n| 10\n| October 22, 2007\n| [[Aiko Melendez]]\n| Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| According to the actress and [[Quezon City]] 2nd District Councilor, her prize is for the benefit of several patients in the [[East Avenue Medical Center]]. Although her briefcase contained PHP3,000,000, the other unopened amount is PHP50,000. She is also the second celebrity player to win at least PHP1,000,000.\n|-\n| 11\n| November 6, 2007\n| [[Kim Atienza]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer is PHP400,000, which according to him, is the life span in years of the quahog clam. The other unopened amount was PHP25,000.\n|-\n| 12\n| December 12, 2007\n| Maria Rosario Odabel\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The last unopened amount is PHP250,000. She kept all six-digit amounts and PHP1,000,000 after opening the last small amount (PHP75).\n|-\n| 13\n| November 3, 2008\n| Anthony Solis\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| He opened many amounts lower than PHP100,000 in the first two rounds, which continued until the third when he opened the PHP300,000. Even though he opened the PHP2,000,000 (not surprising held by model Charmel de Asis), his luck still continued that by the penultimate round, he opened the last small amount of PHP150. After he opened the PHP200,000, he was given the final offer of PHP490,000, which he refused. The last unopened amount was PHP100,000. He was the first millionaire of the third season.\n|-\n| 14\n| November 17, 2008\n| Rey Beltran\n| Deal\n| 1,100,000\n| He opened the final low amount, PHP50, in the eight round, leaving the PHP200,000, PHP400,000, and PHP2,000,000 still in play. He was offered PHP780,000, which he refused. In the final round, the PHP400,000 was opened, and this amount sufficed. His chosen briefcase contained PHP200,000. The reason for the non-exact amounts was because he was tithing some of his winnings for the Christian fellowships he was supporting.\n|-\n| 15\n| November 25, 2008\n| [[Aiko Melendez]] & Candy Pangilinan\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| Playing as a team, the two actresses had a final offer of PHP345,001, which they refused. They incidentally picked one of the five briefcases that each contained PHP1,000,000. The last unopened briefcase contained PHP10. Their game was their second appearance in the show; each of their first games ended in bad deals, albeit taking home six- and seven-digit prizes (see above) respectively. The two were jointly declared as the 15th millionaire and the first team to win a seven-digit prize.\n|-\n| 16\n| December 1, 2008\n| Jhaphet Flordeliza\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| He was first offered PHP466,000 with PHP50 and two PHP1,000,000 briefcases still in play in the penultimate round, but refused. When the second to the last PHP1,000,000 was opened, the Banker lowered his offer to PHP150,000. Upon advise from his father, Jhaphet said \"No Deal,\" and won the PHP1,000,000. He was the first and only regular contestant to become a millionaire for the 2008 Christmas Edition.\n|-\n| 17\n| December 11, 2008\n| [[Arnel Pineda]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| He was the second ever internationally known celebrity to play in the game (after [[apl.de.ap]] less than a year before) and the fourth celebrity to win the million pesos. He won this amount even after opening the four other million-peso briefcases and refusing the final offer of PHP249,999. The last unopened briefcase contained PHP200. He was in the Philippines to spend his Christmas in his homeland while his band, the American band [[Journey (band)|Journey]], was taking a tour break. He is the third celebrity millionaire.\n|-\n| 18\n| January 12, 2009\n| [[Judy Ann Santos]] & [[Ryan Agoncillo]]\n| Deal\n| 1,000,030\n| After the eighth round, with PHP4,000,000, PHP1,000,000, and PHP75 still in play, they were offered PHP1,150,000, but the Banker promised to increase the offer to PHP1,500,000 if their manager [[Alfie Lorenzo]] would join them; they both refused to both offers. After opening the PHP1,000,000 in the final round, they were offered this amount, which they accepted to play it safe after the loss of their final \"safety net.\" Their chosen briefcase contained only PHP75. The additional PHP30 referenced the total of the prizes two previously in won each of their first appearances (Judy Ann won PHP25 and Ryan got only PHP5; both went No Deal). They intended to use their winnings for their campaign to have the movie ''[[Ploning]]'' included in the official nominee list for the Best Foreign Language Film in the [[81st Academy Awards|81st Oscar Awards]].\n|-\n| 19\n| January 28, 2009\n| Maribuena Noche\n| Deal\n| 1,075,600\n| Her game went so well that only her mother was brought out to cheer her on as based from experience relatives were known to reverse the luck of one's game. After the eighth round, when she eliminated PHP10, she was offered this amount with PHP1, PHP500,000, and PHP4,000,000 still in play. She accepted the offer upon the suggestion of her mother. Unbelievably, it turned out that her briefcase contained only PHP1 with a potential final offer of PHP275,000 after seeing that the potential final briefcase she would have opened contained PHP4,000,000 (unsurpringly held by Charmel de Asis). The extra PHP75,600 was a reference to Maribuena's mother's medical bills.\n|-\n| 20\n| February 2, 2009\n| [[Gerald Anderson]] & [[Jake Cuenca]]\n| No Deal\n| 2,000,000\n| Initially having a bad game by having the PHP4,000,000 opened in the first round and revealing many six-digit prizes afterwards, they later had a game so good that they were given a final offer of PHP838,000, with the PHP2,000,000 and PHP75,000 still in play. They refused the offer and won the two million. Gerald and Jake, leading men of the show ''[[Tayong Dalawa]]'', were the third pair of returning celebrities to win a seven-digit prize as a unit and the one with the largest winnings. Also, their separate first appearances were in team games with different partners: Gerald with [[Kim Chiu]] in the first season and Jake with [[Roxanne Guinoo]] in the second. Probably to prevent any misunderstanding, all of the companions brought in to cheer and help them were men. Ironically in the fourth season, Gerald Anderson reappeared only winning one peso.\n|-\n| 21\n| February 16, 2009\n| Christopher Viray\n| Deal\n| 1,600,000\n| After eliminating the last low amount, PHP400, he was soon given large six- and seven-digit offers, starting with PHP750,000, and then PHP1,050,000, both of which he refused. After eliminating PHP500,000, he was offered this amount, with PHP4,000,000 and PHP75,000 still in play. Upon the advice of his companions, especially his elder brother (Robert Viray), he accepted the offer. However, despite the fact that his chosen briefcase contained the top prize of PHP4,000,000, he currently holds the distinction of winning the highest Banker's offer that has been accepted by a contestant in the show.\n|-\n| 22\n| August 18, 2012\n| [[Kean Cipriano]] & [[Enchong Dee]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP420,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP10. They were the first millionaire of the fourth season \n|-\n| 23\n| December 29, 2012\n| [[Janice de Belen]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP563,855 and the other unopened amount was PHP25,000.\n|-\n| 24\n| June 8, 2013\n| [[Boy Abunda]]\n| Deal\n| 1,186,003\n| According to him, he will take the risk saying No Deal but his priority is his chosen charity and therefore accepting this offer. His briefcase's amount was PHP2,000,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP5.\n|-\n| 25\n| August 31, 2013\n| Genelyn Sandaga\n| Deal\n| 1,123,000\n| Her briefcase's amount was PHP2,000,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP25,000.\n|-\n| 26\n| March 23, 2015\n| [[Bearwin Meily]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP614,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP 100,000. He was the first millionaire of the fifth season.\n|-\n| 27\n| April 17, 2015\n| [[Ara Mina]]\n| No Deal\n| 1,000,000\n| After eliminating the PHP500, she was given an offer of PHP407,000 which she refused. The last 3 lowest amounts were PHP100, PHP500,000, and PHP1,000,000. When she eliminated the PHP500,000, the offer went down to PHP355,000 which she refused. She was the second millionaire for the fifth season of the show.\n|- \n| 28 \n| August 14, 2015 \n| [[Bela Padilla]] & [[Joyce Bernal]]\n| No Deal \n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP699,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP400,000. They were the third millionaire of the fifth season.\n|-\n| 29 \n| September 7, 2015 \n| [[Kaye Abad]] & [[Nikki Valdez]]\n| No Deal \n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP510,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP50,000. They were the fourth millionaire of the fifth season.\n|-\n| 30\n| January 8, 2016 \n| [[Janine Tugonon]]\n| No Deal \n| 1,000,000\n| The Banker's final offer was PHP650,000 and the other unopened amount was PHP300,000. She is the fifth millionaire of the fifth season and first millionaire of 2016.\n|}\nSo far, only Terry Lim Cua, Allen Paul Aguada, Jerhan Mama-O, and the team of Gerald Anderson and Jake Cuenca won the largest amount, which is PHP2,000,000.\n\n==Statistics==\n*'''Largest amount won:''' PHP2,000,000 (December 29, 2006; August 6, 2007; September 5, 2007; and February 2, 2009 episodes)\n*'''Highest potential offer:''' PHP2,250,000 (August 6, 2007 episode)\n*'''Highest banker's offer accepted:''' PHP1,600,000 (February 16, 2009 episode)\n\n==Parodies==\n*[[Toni Gonzaga]] of ''[[Gudtaym]]'' (a sitcom previously aired on the same network) hosted \"Kapamilya Meal or No Meal,\" which was a parody of the show. Filipinos from low income brackets were invited to the studio to play for the meal they wish to eat. The contestants were literally not given dinner to eat before the game. In the pilot episode, the contestant won and got to eat ''tuyo'' (dried fish). The prizes were lechon (roasted pig) with PHP6,000, tinolang manok (stewed chicken soup) with PHP3,000, adobong daga (rat stewed with soy sauce), tuyo (dried fish) and asin (salt).\n*''[[Wazzup Wazzup]]'' of [[Studio 23]] (owned by the same network) also came up with a parody dating segment titled \"Kazupista, Feel or No Feel\". There is also a similarly named segment of [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]'s ''[[Lokomoko|Lokomoko High]]'' named \"Feel or No Feel,\" but this time involving underwear.\n*[[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]'s ''[[Wow Mali|Wow Maling Mali]]'', hosted by [[Joey de Leon]], impersonating Kris Aquino, made a spoof named \"Ka[[baranggay]], Beer or No Beer\", with some males as the crossdressing version of the (less than) 26K, and a [[go go dancing]]-Banker in a covered cage, offering beer in exchange with the briefcases.\n*''[[John En Shirley]]'', a sitcom aired on the same network, featured an episode where one of the title characters, John H. Puruntong (portrayed by Philippine Comedy King [[Dolphy (Filipino comedian)|Dolphy]]) played as a contestant of the game show. The episode was aired on September 16, 2006. John fought for his briefcase until the end, refusing the banker's offer of PHP101,000. His briefcase contained PHP200,000, while the other remaining briefcase contained PHP1.\n*When the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] opened the filing of candidacy for the midterm senatorial elections in the Philippines last January 15, 2007, several individuals applied for candidacy, even those that are considered ''nuisance candidates'' like a certain Daniel Magtira who introduced himself as Kris Aquino's husband.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Paghahain ng COC, nagsimula na | date=January 17, 2007 | publisher=[[TV Patrol World]] | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=63160 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=63160 | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 9, 2007 }}</ref> After two days, a certain Julieto Esmeralda Sr., who claims to be both a pastor and a businessman, filed his candidacy referring to himself as ''Mr. Deal'' signifying his aiming of building a culture of optimism to prevail among Filipinos.

In the commercial, Kris recalled how strict Noynoy was as well as how hard he struggled to take care of the family as requested by their father [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] prior to their father's assassination. Kris even made a \"Deal\" pose and catchphrase in the last part of the commercial, signifying her way of convincing the voters to vote for him. Ironically, Noynoy's response to Kris in the ad was ''\"Ayos, Game Na\"'', inspired from the catchphrase of Kris Aquino's game show ''Pilipinas, Game KNB?''.

The McDonald's crew featured in the commercial were holding trays instead of briefcases containing the \"value meals\" that can be selected by patrons of the fast food chain. The restaurant chain also had a raffle promotion in which its winner eventually played in the show.\n\n==Criticisms==\n*''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' columnist Nestor U. Torre expressed disappointment on the show because it is not \"all that spellbinding and empathetic\" since the briefcase a contestant has chosen would keep it to the end (contrary to some versions which exchanging briefcases is allowed). Also, he pointed out that the format of the show limited Aquino's effectivity as a host.<ref>{{cite news| first=Nestor U. | last=Torre | pages=A2\u20137 | title=Viewfinder: Not that big a deal | date=June 12, 2006 | newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer | url=http://news.inq7.net/entertainment/index.php?index=2&story_id=78817&col=26}}</ref>\n*In his January 18, 2007 column, Nestor U. Torre expressed that the game show makes it so difficult for its players to win big because it's based on sheer luck, with a player's fate being sealed by the choice he makes of a particular briefcase to place his hopes on at the start of the game. He cited that another major factor that reduces players\u2019 winnings is the \u201cgreed\u201d motive that pushes contestants to reject already substantial deals from the show's resident \u201cbanker,\u201d because they want to make even more money by pushing the game into the next round. However, Torre does recognize that subsequent contestants were the first to benefit from the game show's beefed-up top prize and will bring new excitement in everyone involved\u2014the contestants, the studio audience, and the host. He mentioned that the move to double the game's pot sets the show apart from other game programs, many of which offer a couple of million pesos in potential top winnings. With its P4 million pot for the 2007 run of the first season, he pointed out that it is now the best game show to beat.<ref>{{cite news | first=Nestor U. | last=Torre | pages=A2\u20137 | title=Viewfinder: Luck of the draw | date=January 18, 2007 | newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer | url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=44235 | access-date=January 20, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014224958/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=44235 | archive-date=October 14, 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*The July 14, 2006 episode featuring psychic Rene Mariano became controversial when the host complemented Rene's abilities because the latter predicted the end of the career of [[Hero Angeles]], ''[[Star Circle Quest]]'' grand champion, at ''[[Morning Girls with Kris and Korina]]'' (previously aired on the same network).

It is Cartoon Network's first animated series to be created solely by a woman. It is the [[coming-of-age story]] of a young boy, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]] (voiced by [[Zach Callison]]), who lives with the Crystal Gems\u2014magical, humanoid aliens named [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] ([[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]), [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] ([[Michaela Dietz]]), and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] ([[Deedee Magno Hall]])\u2014in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem, has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. Its pilot was first shown on May 21, 2013, and the series premiered on November 4, 2013. Its fifth and final season concluded in January 2019. The TV film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'' was released on September 2, 2019, and an epilogue [[Limited series (television)|limited series]], ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', premiered on December 7, 2019 and ended on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who is an artist for the series. She developed ''Steven Universe'' while she was a writer and storyboard artist on ''[[Adventure Time]]'', which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is storyboard-driven; when episodes are being produced the show's storyboard artists are responsible for writing the dialogue and creating the action. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released. \n\nThe series has developed a broad fan base and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] themes and [[science fantasy]] worldbuilding. The series won its first [[GLAAD Media Award]] for Outstanding Kids & Family Program in [[30th GLAAD Media Awards|2019]], becoming the first animated series to win the award. It also received its first [[Peabody Award]] for Children's & Youth Programming in 2019. It has been nominated for five [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation|Emmy Awards]] and five [[Annie Awards]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Steven Universe'' is set in the fictional town of Beach City, [[Delmarva]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|date=August 20, 2014|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|website=[[Reddit]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213200144/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|archivedate=December 13, 2015|df=}}</ref> where the Crystal Gems live in an ancient beachside temple and protect humanity from monsters and other threats. The Gems are ageless alien warriors who project female humanoid forms from magical gemstones at the core of their being. The Crystal Gems comprise Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven\u2014a young, half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, the Crystal Gems' former leader Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to understand his gradually expanding range of powers, he spends his days with his father Greg, his best friend Connie, his magical pet lion, other residents of Beach City, and the Gems. He explores the abilities inherited from his mother, which include fusion\u2014the ability of Gems to merge their bodies and abilities to form new, more powerful personalities.\n\nThe series's first season gradually reveals that the Crystal Gems are remnants of a great interstellar empire. During their missions they visit ruins that were once important to Gem culture but have been derelict for millennia. The Gems are cut off from the Gem homeworld, and Steven learns that many of the monsters and artifacts they encounter are Gems who were corrupted by a Gem weapon of mass destruction and can no longer maintain rational, humanoid form. By the end of the first season, Steven learns that, millennia ago, the Gem empire intended to sterilize the Earth to incubate new Gems, but Rose Quartz led her supporters, the Crystal Gems, in a violent and apparently successful rebellion against this genocidal plan. The discovery and release of Lapis Lazuli, a Gem trapped on Earth for millennia, puts the Crystal Gems at risk from the Gem empire once more, leading to the arrival of hostile envoys Peridot and Jasper.\n\nIn the second season, Peridot allies with and eventually joins the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a Gem \"geo-weapon\" buried in the planet. During the third season, Lapis Lazuli decides to live on Earth with Peridot; Jasper is defeated and captured; and Steven learns that his mother assassinated one of the Gem empire's matriarchs, Pink Diamond. In the fourth season, as Steven wrestles with his conflicted feelings about his mother's actions, the Gem empire leaders Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond begin to turn their full attention to Earth. In the fifth and final season, Steven learns that in fact his mother ''was'' Pink Diamond, who faked her death to assume the identity of Rose Quartz; he uses this revelation to persuade the other Diamonds to try to take responsibility for and fix the damage they have caused.\n\n==Conception==\n[[File:Rebecca Sugar Speaking at New York Comic Con 2014 - Peter Dzubay (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Rebecca Sugar, a smiling, bespectacled young woman|Rebecca Sugar (creator of ''Steven Universe'') is the first woman to create a show for Cartoon Network.]]\nIn 2011, after former Cartoon Network vice-president of comedy animation Curtis Lelash asked the staff for ideas for a new series, Rebecca Sugar\u2014an artist working for the network's series ''[[Adventure Time]]''\u2014described her initial ideas for what would become ''Steven Universe'', and the project was chosen for development. While developing her show, Sugar continued working on ''Adventure Time''.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=19}}</ref> The series evolved from a short story written by Sugar entitled \"Ballad of Margo and Dread\", about a sensitive child helping teenagers with problems they cannot verbalize.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=14}}</ref>\n\nCartoon Network executives commissioned the show after the crew's art presentation and Sugar became the first woman to create a show independently for the network.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=25}}</ref> Before a production team had been appointed, Sugar tried to alter elements of the show's plot and developed the character's identity so her crew would have the freedom she did when she worked for ''Adventure Time''.<ref name=\":3\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=43}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\nWhen Sugar's show was commissioned, she resigned from her role as a storyboard artist on ''Adventure Time'' to focus on her own series.<ref name=\":3\" /> Sugar focused the pilot short on the main characters and their personalities to demonstrate the series' humor. The pilot is a [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] episode that does not involve major events because the series' world was still in development.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sugar and her production team focused the plot on interaction between the Crystal Gems and Steven.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=24\u201325}}</ref> Sugar strove to make her pilot distinctive in terms of its artistic and aesthetic detail but the time limit imposed upon her by Cartoon Network hampered her. This unsuccessful experience helped Sugar develop the show's concept; she said, \"to know that there is so much more that you can't see and the way that knowledge frustrates and excites and confuses and scares you\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe title character Steven is loosely based on Steven Sugar, Rebecca's younger brother.<ref name=\"Cavna 2013-11-01\" /> During ''Steven Universe''{{'s}} development, Sugar repeatedly asked her brother whether naming the show after him was a good idea; she stopped asking when it was commissioned. Her brother had no problem with it and trusted Sugar to use his name wisely.<ref name=\":4\" /> In an interview with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' Sugar discussed developing the background of the show's protagonist, saying she wanted to base the character's viewpoint on her brother growing up \"where you're so comfortable in your life because you get all the attention, but you also want to rise up and not be the little brother\".<ref name=\"Ito 2013-07-26\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|title=Rising Animators Spring Into Motion|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=July 26, 2013|work=New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803055430/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|archivedate=August 3, 2013|url-status=live|author2=Jeremy Egner|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhen the original pilot was presented to Cartoon Network executives, they told the crew the series would air in 2013.<ref name=\":8\" /> Cartoon Network released the original pilot in May 2013. Sugar and her team panicked because the series was going to be very different from the pilot episode. The pilot was popular when it was released, engendering forum discussions in which people expressed their hopes of seeing it on the air soon. Those who knew Rebecca Sugar from ''Adventure Time'' were also interested. Positive reaction to the show reassured its crew.<ref name=\":9\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77}}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the show's commissioning by Cartoon Network, Sugar began assembling a production crew.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jackie Buscarino was engaged as a producer in September 2012 and was tasked with hiring people and supervising the show's crew.<ref name=\":5\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=48}}</ref> During this period of development, Sugar and her team were moved to a building behind the main Cartoon Network studio and based on the same floor as the crew of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' CGI special. Some artists who had worked on the special, such as colorist Tiffany Ford and art directors Kevin Dart, Ellie Michalka and Jasmin Lai, were later invited to join the ''Steven Universe'' team.<ref name=\":6\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=49}}</ref> Cartoon Network also provided Sugar with a list of suggested writers; when she saw Ben Levin and Matt Burnett (former writers for ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'') on the list she immediately asked them to join her team because she was familiar with their work.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> Freelance artist Danny Hynes, whom the former supervising director Ian Jones-Quartey knew from his own project ''[[OK K.O.!

Steven Sugar praised Dart's work and was inspired by him in college years, saying Dart had more ideas for the art than he did.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn the pilot, only two locations appeared (the Temple and the Big Donut). The Temple was designed by Ian Jones-Quartey, Steven Sugar, Ben Levin, Matt Burnett and [[Andy Ristaino]]. The Temple's dual faces were based on Guy Davis' ideas.<ref name=\":7\" /> Steven Sugar designed the rest of Beach City for the series; he was painstaking in his attention to detail. Sugar also designed people, houses, cars, buildings and restaurants. Because of Rebecca Sugar's redesigned drawings, the two original locations had to be redrawn.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nTo find inspiration for the show's backgrounds, the Sugars and Jones-Quartey went to their favorite beaches.<ref name=\":7\" /> The series' setting, Beach City, is loosely based on Delaware beaches [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]], [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]] and [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]], all of which Rebecca Sugar visited as a child.<ref name=\"Cavna 2013-11-01\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html |title='Steven Universe' creator Rebecca Sugar is a Cartoon Network trailblazer |last=Cavna |first=Michael |date=November 1, 2013 |work=The Washington Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111171925/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html |archive-date=November 11, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Steven Sugar drew Beach City with a boardwalk lined with a variety of shops.<ref name=\":6\" /> He wanted it to have a \"specific style\" so viewers could believe it was based on a real location; he drew the roads and shops consistently oriented with the Temple and a water tower.<ref name=\":7\" /> The concept for the primary setting was inspired by [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', which features a small environment in which the recurring characters live where they work.

The series' storyboard artists are also its writers.]]\nDuring storyboard meetings, artists draw their ideas on [[post-it note]]s, which are then attached to walls, table and boxes in the corners of their conference room. The drawings play a major role in forming episode ideas; Sugar looks at these designs and occasionally makes changes to key poses. Sugar likes to review and re-draw scenes and characters to add extra pathos and emotion to storyboards.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=207}}</ref> Each episode's storyboards are created by two artists, each of whom writes half of the dialogue and draws panels similar to comic strips. This process can be quite complex; the storyboard artists must create the [[cinematography]] and focus on [[scenic design]] in a way similar to film production. After the panels are made, the thumbnail-storyboard artists draw mannerisms and dialogue based on their own experiences; Sugar draws \"quintessential\" scenes from her memories of hanging out with her brother after school.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=118}}</ref> The storyboard artists then discuss their work with the rest of the crew and make any necessary changes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=119}}</ref> After the team discussion, the storyboard artists draw a revised board\u2014based on the thumbnail board\u2014on a full-size panel with notes. The storyboards are again discussed, corrected and finally approved.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=124}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nDuring the pilot development, Sugar wrote and sketched a number of plot ideas that later became episodes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=21}}</ref> The series' initial premise focused mostly on Steven's human side, rather than his magic side, but the premise was later changed.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=43; 48}}</ref> Sugar developed the Gems' history in conjunction with the pilot episode.<ref name=\":0\" /> While the first season of the show introduced the human and Gem characters and their relationships, Sugar began to plot and explore second-season storylines involving the Crystal Gems.<ref name=\":16\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=111}}</ref> Eventually, Sugar created a chart with taped printouts about a 2,000-year Gem and Earth history, with a number of events needing to be \"fleshed out\" for production. Although the series' overall plot is established, the writers improvise to arrive at its ending; according to Matt Burnett, the storylines will be resolved by the series' end.<ref name=\":10\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=105}}</ref> Sugar wanted the series to focus on comedy and positivity before exploring controversial subjects involving the main characters, thinking it was \"more honest\" to begin the show with happiness instead of action or drama.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe writers\u2014formerly Levin and Burnett\u2014would write the premises and outlines while the storyboarders wrote and drew the episodes.<ref name=\":13\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ianjq.tumblr.com/post/74241332119/hey-i-am-a-screenwriting-student-from-emerson |title=Hey!

They discuss episode pacing and vary each season's texture by balancing \"lighter\" and \"heavier\" story arcs.<ref name=\":17\" /> Changes in major-character appearances\u2014such as Yellow Diamond\u2014in a storyline can be difficult for the writers.<ref name=\":15\" /> According to Ben Levin, writing a season of ''Steven Universe'' is like a \"jigsaw puzzle\" because the writing team must assemble a number of plot ideas, which are discarded if they do not benefit character growth. After further discussion and questions about the writing, an idea becomes an episode. After discussing a season's proposed episodes the \"puzzle\" is complete, and they begin writing a major story arc or a season finale. Burnett said writing a season is like an algebraic equation \"where one side is the season finale, and the x's and y's are the episodes we need for that solution to make sense\"; he cited \"Ocean Gem\", \"[[Steven the Sword Fighter]]\", \"Monster Buddies\", \"An Indirect Kiss\" and \"Serious Steven\" as examples. Those episodes led to the season-one finale as a minor story arc.<ref name=\":17\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=106}}</ref> To develop new ideas for episodes, the writers play writing games. In one, a scenario with characters is drawn and passed to another writer. The second writer adds a few sentences before giving it to a third, until the drawing has a three-act story. Episodes such as \"Island Adventure\", \"Future Boy Zoltron\" and \"Onion Friend\" were written this way.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> The writers also play drawing games, which design new Gem characters and technological ideas. Burnett said he and Levin use fewer ideas from the storyboarders than they previously did; storyboarders change fewer things than they did before because the episodes have a \"stronger continuity\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAccording to Levin, he and Burnett try to balance the focus between the main characters\u2014with Steven in the center\u2014and the theme of episodes in their writing. The balance indicates Steven has the same interests on his human side as he does on his Gem side. Levin said the Gem mythology and drama would have been less interesting if Steven was not as well-developed in the first few episodes. Grateful to work on a show which is unafraid to be \"sincere and vulnerable\", he said if every episode was emotional the series would become formulaic; happy episodes balance out emotional ones.<ref name=\":17\" /> Levin said he and Burnett have found ways to integrate Steven's powers into the plot. The character's powers and home-world technology are revealed at a \"measured (very slow) pace\", satisfying the viewer and keeping the series clear of superhero territory.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nBefore significant plotlines air, the writers reveal information relevant to a \"climactic\" episode for the audience. According to storyboard artist Hilary Florido, much of the series' action and magic are narrative climaxes, demonstrating the characters' discoveries, difficulties and views. Florido said if a character's evolution is not directly related to the plot, there is no drama.<ref name=\":15\" /> The crew is discouraged from breaking perspective involving episode development as they want the audience to know the protagonist's point of view. Although the writers could hint at future events, they prefer to focus on plot and develop Steven in real time. Levin said if the pilot tried to present Gem history in five minutes, the audience and protagonist would be equally confused.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Backgrounds ===\nThe production of background art begins after the approved storyboards are received. If the characters visit old locations, the pre-existing backgrounds are modified for authenticity; it is likely locations would change slightly over time. Steven Sugar likes to hide narrative bits in the backgrounds because he believes the key to world-building is \"having a cohesive underlying structure to everything\".<ref name=\":22\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=174}}</ref> Former art director Elle Michalka said the backgrounds' artistic style was inspired by French post-impressionist painter [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity. The art was also inspired by [[Tao Te Ching]], whose work highlights the importance of empty spaces, \"like the space within a vase as being part of the vase that makes it useful\".<ref name=\":22\"/> During the painting phase, the painters see the lines as \"descriptive bones\" and color is used loosely, meaning the color is intentionally slightly off register, highlighting the distinction between color and line.<ref name=\":22\"/> The painters used \"superimposed\" watercolor texture before switching to [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] because the former made the backgrounds \"very chunky\". When painting the backgrounds, they use one primary and several secondary colors; Amanda Winterston and Jasmin Lai found suitable color combinations. After the primary backgrounds are painted, they are sent to the color stylist, who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets, matching and complementing the storyboard and background. The lines of the character or prop are rarely colored. The lines are removed when scenes need light effects. The coloring in early season-one episodes was experimental because the stylist would have difficulty if a storyboard's character and background mixed together or a bright character walked unchanged into a shadow. Mistakes became rare as the crew planned and checked storyboards. The primary backgrounds are made in Burbank; the secondary ones by Korean artists.<ref name=\":23\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=175}}</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\nAfter the crew finishes constructing an episode, the production team sends it to animators in Korea. The animation is produced by [[Sunmin Image Pictures]] and [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. The production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode. Before sending the episode to one of the studios, animation director Nick DeMayo and his team create a plan for the animators after reviewing the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]].<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=197}}</ref> They then add character movements on [[exposure sheet]]s to guide the animators. Mouth assignments for the characters, describing mouth shapes and timing for lip-syncing, follow.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref> The episode is then sent to one of the animation studios. The black-and-white version is sent first, followed about two weeks later by the colored version<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=198}}</ref> The animation is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned and colored digitally. The crew then arranges a \"work print\" meeting to discuss the episode and review it for errors. DeMayo notes any errors, removes them and sends the episode back to the animation studio or to Cartoon Network's post-production department to fix any remaining issues.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=199}}</ref> Minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by the crew.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=202}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=220\n| image1 = Zach Callison January 2015.jpg  |width1=1182|height1=1769 |alt1= Zach Callison smiling, wearing a blue \"85\" numbered shirt\n| image2 = Michaela Dietz at the Florida Supercon 2016 (4) (cropped).jpg  |width2=1791|height2=2602 |alt2= Michaela Dietz, smiling and holding a microphone\n| image3 = Deedee Magno Hall (2010).jpg  |width3=1096|height3=1677 |alt3= A smiling Deedee Magno in a black jacket.\n| image4 = Estelle Swaray (headshot).jpg|width4=197|height4=244 |alt4= Estelle, smiling, in a blue jacket\n| footer = The main voice cast ''(clockwise from top left''): [[Zach Callison]] ([[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]), [[Michaela Dietz]] ([[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]]), [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] ([[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]]) and [[Deedee Magno]] ([[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]]) \n}}\nAmerican actor [[Zach Callison]] voices Steven.

Sound motifs and palettes were also created for locations, objects and abstract concepts.<ref name=\":21\" /> When Sugar or the other writers write a song for an episode, they record a demo that is sent to the composers. The same musical style for a song and the character singing it is used for each song.

This is reflected in the series' outreach to minorities that seldom appear elsewhere in animation and its broader themes; instead of delivering genre-typical, mustache-twirling villains, ''Steven Universe'' \"deals with issues of extraordinary violence and horror, depicts its characters in shades of grey, and subtly plays with matters of philosophy, morality, and interpersonal conflicts, all while refusing to reset any development to a ''status quo''\".<ref name=\"Pop Matters 15 January 2016\" />\n\n====Gender and sexuality====\n[[File:Pearl and Rose embracing in Steven Universe.jpg|thumb|Pearl (left) and Steven's mother, Rose Quartz, embrace in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shot edited out of the British broadcast.

Whitbrook characterized the series as being \"about love\u2014''all'' kinds of love\", including non-traditional forms such as the motherly and friendly bond between Steven and the Gems; and Garnet as the \"physical embodiment of a lesbian relationship\".<ref name=\"io9 16 June 2015\" />\n\nWhen placing the series on the honor list of the 2015 [[James Tiptree Jr. Award|Tiptree Award]], which recognizes works of science fiction or fantasy that explore and expand gender roles, the jury wrote; \"In the context of children's television, this show deals with gender in a much more open and mature way than is typical for the genre, and has some of the best writing of any cartoon&nbsp;...

This, according to Rude, reflects the growing prominence of these themes in children's cartoons; previous depictions were subtextual or minimal, such as the 2011 ''Adventure Time'' episode \"[[What Was Missing]]\", the 2014 series ''[[Clarence (2014 TV series)|Clarence]]'' or (more explicit but unexplored) the 2014 finale of Nickelodeon's ''[[The Legend of Korra]]''.

In her view, queer youth deserve to see themselves in stories as much as other children\u2014and, given pervasive [[heteronormativity]], not allowing them to do so can be harmful.

It is Cartoon Network's first animated series to be created solely by a woman. It is the [[coming-of-age story]] of a young boy, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]] (voiced by [[Zach Callison]]), who lives with the Crystal Gems\u2014magical, humanoid aliens named [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] ([[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]), [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] ([[Michaela Dietz]]), and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] ([[Deedee Magno Hall]])\u2014in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem, has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. Its pilot was first shown on May 21, 2013, and the series premiered on November 4, 2013. Its fifth and final season concluded in January 2019. The TV film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'' was released on September 2, 2019, and an epilogue [[Limited series (television)|limited series]], ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', premiered on December 7, 2019 and ended on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who is an artist for the series. She developed ''Steven Universe'' while she was a writer and storyboard artist on ''[[Adventure Time]]'', which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is storyboard-driven; when episodes are being produced the show's storyboard artists are responsible for writing the dialogue and creating the action. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released. \n\nThe series has developed a broad fan base and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] themes and [[science fantasy]] worldbuilding.

The Gems are ageless alien warriors who project female humanoid forms from magical gemstones at the core of their being. The Crystal Gems comprise Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven\u2014a young, half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, the Crystal Gems' former leader Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to understand his gradually expanding range of powers, he spends his days with his father Greg, his best friend Connie, his magical pet lion, other residents of Beach City, and the Gems. He explores the abilities inherited from his mother, which include fusion\u2014the ability of Gems to merge their bodies and abilities to form new, more powerful personalities.\n\nThe series's first season gradually reveals that the Crystal Gems are remnants of a great interstellar empire. During their missions they visit ruins that were once important to Gem culture but have been derelict for millennia. The Gems are cut off from the Gem homeworld, and Steven learns that many of the monsters and artifacts they encounter are Gems who were corrupted by a Gem weapon of mass destruction and can no longer maintain rational, humanoid form. By the end of the first season, Steven learns that, millennia ago, the Gem empire intended to sterilize the Earth to incubate new Gems, but Rose Quartz led her supporters, the Crystal Gems, in a violent and apparently successful rebellion against this genocidal plan. The discovery and release of Lapis Lazuli, a Gem trapped on Earth for millennia, puts the Crystal Gems at risk from the Gem empire once more, leading to the arrival of hostile envoys Peridot and Jasper.\n\nIn the second season, Peridot allies with and eventually joins the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a Gem \"geo-weapon\" buried in the planet. During the third season, Lapis Lazuli decides to live on Earth with Peridot; Jasper is defeated and captured; and Steven learns that his mother assassinated one of the Gem empire's matriarchs, Pink Diamond. In the fourth season, as Steven wrestles with his conflicted feelings about his mother's actions, the Gem empire leaders Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond begin to turn their full attention to Earth. In the fifth and final season, Steven learns that in fact his mother ''was'' Pink Diamond, who faked her death to assume the identity of Rose Quartz; he uses this revelation to persuade the other Diamonds to try to take responsibility for and fix the damage they have caused.\n\n==Conception==\n[[File:Rebecca Sugar Speaking at New York Comic Con 2014 - Peter Dzubay (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Rebecca Sugar, a smiling, bespectacled young woman|Rebecca Sugar (creator of ''Steven Universe'') is the first woman to create a show for Cartoon Network.]]\nIn 2011, after former Cartoon Network vice-president of comedy animation Curtis Lelash asked the staff for ideas for a new series, Rebecca Sugar\u2014an artist working for the network's series ''[[Adventure Time]]''\u2014described her initial ideas for what would become ''Steven Universe'', and the project was chosen for development. While developing her show, Sugar continued working on ''Adventure Time''.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=19}}</ref> The series evolved from a short story written by Sugar entitled \"Ballad of Margo and Dread\", about a sensitive child helping teenagers with problems they cannot verbalize.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=14}}</ref>\n\nCartoon Network executives commissioned the show after the crew's art presentation and Sugar became the first woman to create a show independently for the network.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=25}}</ref> Before a production team had been appointed, Sugar tried to alter elements of the show's plot and developed the character's identity so her crew would have the freedom she did when she worked for ''Adventure Time''.<ref name=\":3\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=43}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\nWhen Sugar's show was commissioned, she resigned from her role as a storyboard artist on ''Adventure Time'' to focus on her own series.<ref name=\":3\" /> Sugar focused the pilot short on the main characters and their personalities to demonstrate the series' humor. The pilot is a [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] episode that does not involve major events because the series' world was still in development.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sugar and her production team focused the plot on interaction between the Crystal Gems and Steven.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=24\u201325}}</ref> Sugar strove to make her pilot distinctive in terms of its artistic and aesthetic detail but the time limit imposed upon her by Cartoon Network hampered her.

Her brother had no problem with it and trusted Sugar to use his name wisely.<ref name=\":4\" /> In an interview with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' Sugar discussed developing the background of the show's protagonist, saying she wanted to base the character's viewpoint on her brother growing up \"where you're so comfortable in your life because you get all the attention, but you also want to rise up and not be the little brother\".<ref name=\"Ito 2013-07-26\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|title=Rising Animators Spring Into Motion|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=July 26, 2013|work=New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803055430/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|archivedate=August 3, 2013|url-status=live|author2=Jeremy Egner|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhen the original pilot was presented to Cartoon Network executives, they told the crew the series would air in 2013.<ref name=\":8\" /> Cartoon Network released the original pilot in May 2013. Sugar and her team panicked because the series was going to be very different from the pilot episode. The pilot was popular when it was released, engendering forum discussions in which people expressed their hopes of seeing it on the air soon. Those who knew Rebecca Sugar from ''Adventure Time'' were also interested. Positive reaction to the show reassured its crew.<ref name=\":9\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77}}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the show's commissioning by Cartoon Network, Sugar began assembling a production crew.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jackie Buscarino was engaged as a producer in September 2012 and was tasked with hiring people and supervising the show's crew.<ref name=\":5\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=48}}</ref> During this period of development, Sugar and her team were moved to a building behind the main Cartoon Network studio and based on the same floor as the crew of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' CGI special. Some artists who had worked on the special, such as colorist Tiffany Ford and art directors Kevin Dart, Ellie Michalka and Jasmin Lai, were later invited to join the ''Steven Universe'' team.<ref name=\":6\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=49}}</ref> Cartoon Network also provided Sugar with a list of suggested writers; when she saw Ben Levin and Matt Burnett (former writers for ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'') on the list she immediately asked them to join her team because she was familiar with their work.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> Freelance artist Danny Hynes, whom the former supervising director Ian Jones-Quartey knew from his own project ''[[OK K.O.!

The drawings play a major role in forming episode ideas; Sugar looks at these designs and occasionally makes changes to key poses. Sugar likes to review and re-draw scenes and characters to add extra pathos and emotion to storyboards.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=207}}</ref> Each episode's storyboards are created by two artists, each of whom writes half of the dialogue and draws panels similar to comic strips. This process can be quite complex; the storyboard artists must create the [[cinematography]] and focus on [[scenic design]] in a way similar to film production. After the panels are made, the thumbnail-storyboard artists draw mannerisms and dialogue based on their own experiences; Sugar draws \"quintessential\" scenes from her memories of hanging out with her brother after school.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=118}}</ref> The storyboard artists then discuss their work with the rest of the crew and make any necessary changes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=119}}</ref> After the team discussion, the storyboard artists draw a revised board\u2014based on the thumbnail board\u2014on a full-size panel with notes.

They discuss episode pacing and vary each season's texture by balancing \"lighter\" and \"heavier\" story arcs.<ref name=\":17\" /> Changes in major-character appearances\u2014such as Yellow Diamond\u2014in a storyline can be difficult for the writers.<ref name=\":15\" /> According to Ben Levin, writing a season of ''Steven Universe'' is like a \"jigsaw puzzle\" because the writing team must assemble a number of plot ideas, which are discarded if they do not benefit character growth. After further discussion and questions about the writing, an idea becomes an episode. After discussing a season's proposed episodes the \"puzzle\" is complete, and they begin writing a major story arc or a season finale. Burnett said writing a season is like an algebraic equation \"where one side is the season finale, and the x's and y's are the episodes we need for that solution to make sense\"; he cited \"Ocean Gem\", \"[[Steven the Sword Fighter]]\", \"Monster Buddies\", \"An Indirect Kiss\" and \"Serious Steven\" as examples. Those episodes led to the season-one finale as a minor story arc.<ref name=\":17\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=106}}</ref> To develop new ideas for episodes, the writers play writing games. In one, a scenario with characters is drawn and passed to another writer. The second writer adds a few sentences before giving it to a third, until the drawing has a three-act story. Episodes such as \"Island Adventure\", \"Future Boy Zoltron\" and \"Onion Friend\" were written this way.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> The writers also play drawing games, which design new Gem characters and technological ideas. Burnett said he and Levin use fewer ideas from the storyboarders than they previously did; storyboarders change fewer things than they did before because the episodes have a \"stronger continuity\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAccording to Levin, he and Burnett try to balance the focus between the main characters\u2014with Steven in the center\u2014and the theme of episodes in their writing. The balance indicates Steven has the same interests on his human side as he does on his Gem side. Levin said the Gem mythology and drama would have been less interesting if Steven was not as well-developed in the first few episodes. Grateful to work on a show which is unafraid to be \"sincere and vulnerable\", he said if every episode was emotional the series would become formulaic; happy episodes balance out emotional ones.<ref name=\":17\" /> Levin said he and Burnett have found ways to integrate Steven's powers into the plot. The character's powers and home-world technology are revealed at a \"measured (very slow) pace\", satisfying the viewer and keeping the series clear of superhero territory.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nBefore significant plotlines air, the writers reveal information relevant to a \"climactic\" episode for the audience. According to storyboard artist Hilary Florido, much of the series' action and magic are narrative climaxes, demonstrating the characters' discoveries, difficulties and views. Florido said if a character's evolution is not directly related to the plot, there is no drama.<ref name=\":15\" /> The crew is discouraged from breaking perspective involving episode development as they want the audience to know the protagonist's point of view. Although the writers could hint at future events, they prefer to focus on plot and develop Steven in real time. Levin said if the pilot tried to present Gem history in five minutes, the audience and protagonist would be equally confused.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Backgrounds ===\nThe production of background art begins after the approved storyboards are received. If the characters visit old locations, the pre-existing backgrounds are modified for authenticity; it is likely locations would change slightly over time. Steven Sugar likes to hide narrative bits in the backgrounds because he believes the key to world-building is \"having a cohesive underlying structure to everything\".<ref name=\":22\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=174}}</ref> Former art director Elle Michalka said the backgrounds' artistic style was inspired by French post-impressionist painter [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity. The art was also inspired by [[Tao Te Ching]], whose work highlights the importance of empty spaces, \"like the space within a vase as being part of the vase that makes it useful\".<ref name=\":22\"/> During the painting phase, the painters see the lines as \"descriptive bones\" and color is used loosely, meaning the color is intentionally slightly off register, highlighting the distinction between color and line.<ref name=\":22\"/> The painters used \"superimposed\" watercolor texture before switching to [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] because the former made the backgrounds \"very chunky\". When painting the backgrounds, they use one primary and several secondary colors; Amanda Winterston and Jasmin Lai found suitable color combinations. After the primary backgrounds are painted, they are sent to the color stylist, who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets, matching and complementing the storyboard and background. The lines of the character or prop are rarely colored. The lines are removed when scenes need light effects. The coloring in early season-one episodes was experimental because the stylist would have difficulty if a storyboard's character and background mixed together or a bright character walked unchanged into a shadow. Mistakes became rare as the crew planned and checked storyboards. The primary backgrounds are made in Burbank; the secondary ones by Korean artists.<ref name=\":23\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=175}}</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\nAfter the crew finishes constructing an episode, the production team sends it to animators in Korea. The animation is produced by [[Sunmin Image Pictures]] and [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. The production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode. Before sending the episode to one of the studios, animation director Nick DeMayo and his team create a plan for the animators after reviewing the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]].<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=197}}</ref> They then add character movements on [[exposure sheet]]s to guide the animators. Mouth assignments for the characters, describing mouth shapes and timing for lip-syncing, follow.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref> The episode is then sent to one of the animation studios. The black-and-white version is sent first, followed about two weeks later by the colored version<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=198}}</ref> The animation is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned and colored digitally. The crew then arranges a \"work print\" meeting to discuss the episode and review it for errors. DeMayo notes any errors, removes them and sends the episode back to the animation studio or to Cartoon Network's post-production department to fix any remaining issues.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=199}}</ref> Minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by the crew.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=202}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=220\n| image1 = Zach Callison January 2015.jpg  |width1=1182|height1=1769 |alt1= Zach Callison smiling, wearing a blue \"85\" numbered shirt\n| image2 = Michaela Dietz at the Florida Supercon 2016 (4) (cropped).jpg  |width2=1791|height2=2602 |alt2= Michaela Dietz, smiling and holding a microphone\n| image3 = Deedee Magno Hall (2010).jpg  |width3=1096|height3=1677 |alt3= A smiling Deedee Magno in a black jacket.\n| image4 = Estelle Swaray (headshot).jpg|width4=197|height4=244 |alt4= Estelle, smiling, in a blue jacket\n| footer = The main voice cast ''(clockwise from top left''): [[Zach Callison]] ([[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]), [[Michaela Dietz]] ([[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]]), [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] ([[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]]) and [[Deedee Magno]] ([[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]]) \n}}\nAmerican actor [[Zach Callison]] voices Steven.

When a recording session begins, Sugar explains the storyboards and describes the sequences, character intention and the relationship between them; Osborne does the recording.

The same musical style for a song and the character singing it is used for each song. Over time, the songs have become increasingly complex and production has become more difficult because the show's original musical style no longer fits perfectly with the newer lyrical themes. An example is \"Here Comes a Thought\", sung by Estelle and [[AJ Michalka]] (who voices Stevonnie).

Club 11 November 2013\" /> Thurm wrote that a notable emotional difference between ''Steven Universe'', and ''Adventure Time'' and ''[[Regular Show]]'', is that the latter two series deal with their protagonists' transitions to adulthood whereas during its first season, ''Steven Universe'' was content to be \"enamored with the simplicity of childhood\".<ref name=\"A.V. Club 9 April 2014\" /> Steven slowly grows from being an obnoxious, tag-along child to an accepted member of the Crystal Gems in his own right by the end of the first season; a change brought about by increased insight and experience rather than age.<ref name=\"A.V. Club 12 March 2015\" /> Joe Cain noted in ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' that unlike heroes from antiquity ([[Hercules]]) and modern fiction ([[Luke Skywalker]]), Steven is defined by his mother's legacy rather than his father's; the preponderance of mother figures in the series underscores their rarity in other fiction.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cain|first1=Joseph|title=Superheroes, Steven Universe, and the Maternal Narrative|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-maternal-narrative/|work=The Mary Sue|date=May 13, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514112356/http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-maternal-narrative/|archivedate=May 14, 2016|df=}}</ref> According to Kat Smalley of [[PopMatters]], the Gems' alien nature, which prevents them from fully understanding the world they protect, is handled with \"remarkable depth and intellectual rigor\", even as they deal with human issues such as \"[[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]], and self-loathing\" remaining from the long-past war for Earth.<ref name=\"Pop Matters 15 January 2016\">{{Cite news |url=https://popmatters.com/feature/steven-universe-cartoon-networks-avant-garde-animation/ |title='Steven Universe': Cartoon Network's Avant-Garde Animation |last=Smalley |first=Kat |date=January 15, 2016 |work=[[Pop Matters]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906004121/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/steven-universe-cartoon-networks-avant-garde-animation/ |archive-date=September 6, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSmalley characterized ''Steven Universe'' as part of a growing trend of cartoons that appeal to adults and children alike; which includes ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' (2005), its sequel ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'' (2012), ''Adventure Time'' (2010) and ''Regular Show'' (2010). This is reflected in the series' outreach to minorities that seldom appear elsewhere in animation and its broader themes; instead of delivering genre-typical, mustache-twirling villains, ''Steven Universe'' \"deals with issues of extraordinary violence and horror, depicts its characters in shades of grey, and subtly plays with matters of philosophy, morality, and interpersonal conflicts, all while refusing to reset any development to a ''status quo''\".<ref name=\"Pop Matters 15 January 2016\" />\n\n====Gender and sexuality====\n[[File:Pearl and Rose embracing in Steven Universe.jpg|thumb|Pearl (left) and Steven's mother, Rose Quartz, embrace in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shot edited out of the British broadcast.

Club'', who noted that \"the show's superheroes are all women\".<ref name=\"A.V. Club 4 November 2015\" /> As a self-aware pastiche of \"[[magical girl]]\" anime, the series subverts the genre's premises by having Steven embody the loving femininity of the typical magical-girl protagonist without ridicule or losing his masculine side. Whitbrook characterized the series as being \"about love\u2014''all'' kinds of love\", including non-traditional forms such as the motherly and friendly bond between Steven and the Gems; and Garnet as the \"physical embodiment of a lesbian relationship\".<ref name=\"io9 16 June 2015\" />\n\nWhen placing the series on the honor list of the 2015 [[James Tiptree Jr. Award|Tiptree Award]], which recognizes works of science fiction or fantasy that explore and expand gender roles, the jury wrote; \"In the context of children's television, this show deals with gender in a much more open and mature way than is typical for the genre, and has some of the best writing of any cartoon&nbsp;... In addition to showing men and women who do not necessarily conform to standard American gender ideals, the show also gives us an agender/non-binary character and a thoughtful exploration of growing up\".<ref name=\"Tiptree 2016\" />\n\n[[Autostraddle]]'s Mey Rude wrote that ''Steven Universe'' was the most-recent animated series for a younger audience with significant [[queer]] themes, such as the  [[Androgyny|androgynous]] fusion [[Stevonnie]] and the romantic relationship between the Gems Ruby and Sapphire, whose fusion is the main character Garnet. This, according to Rude, reflects the growing prominence of these themes in children's cartoons; previous depictions were subtextual or minimal, such as the 2011 ''Adventure Time'' episode \"[[What Was Missing]]\", the 2014 series ''[[Clarence (2014 TV series)|Clarence]]'' or (more explicit but unexplored) the 2014 finale of Nickelodeon's ''[[The Legend of Korra]]''.
