Crabtree effect in yeast ===\nApproximately 100 million years ago (mya), within the yeast lineage there was a [[whole genome duplication]] (WGD).<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite

It was believed that the WGD was a mechanism for the development of Crabtree effect in these species due to the duplication of [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH) encoding genes and hexose transporters.<ref name=\":15\" />  However, recent evidence has shown that aerobic fermentation originated before the WGD and evolved as a multi-step process, potentially aided by the WGD.<ref name=\":15\" />  The origin of aerobic fermentation, or the first step, in ''Saccharomyces'' crabtree-positive yeasts likely occurred in the interval between the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions, horizontal transfer of anaerobic DHODase (encoded by URA1 with bacteria), and the loss of respiratory chain Complex I.<ref name=\":1\" />  A more pronounced Crabtree effect, the second step, likely occurred near the time of the WGD event.<ref name=\":1\" />  Later evolutionary events that aided in the evolution of aerobic fermentation are better understood and outlined in the Genomic basis of the crabtree effect section.\n\n=== Driving forces ===\nIt is believed that a major driving force in the origin of aerobic fermentation was its simultaneous origin with modern fruit (~125 mya).<ref name=\":15\" />  These fruit provided an abundance of simple sugar food source for microbial communities, including both yeast and bacteria.<ref name=\":15\" />  Bacteria, at that time, were able to produce biomass at a faster rate than the yeast.<ref name=\":15\" />  Producing a toxic compound, like ethanol, can slow the growth of bacteria, allowing the yeast to be more competitive.<ref name=\":15\" />  However, the yeast still had to use a portion of the sugar it consumes to produce ethanol.<ref name=\":15\" />  Crabtree-positive yeasts also have increased glycolytic flow, or increased uptake of glucose and conversion to pyruvate, which compensates for using a portion of the glucose to produce ethanol rather than biomass.<ref name=\":1\" />  Therefore, it is believed that the original driving force was to kill competitors.<ref name=\":3\" />  This is supported by research that determined the kinetic behavior of the ancestral ADH protein, which was found to be optimized to make ethanol, rather than consume it.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nFurther evolutionary events in the development of aerobic fermentation likely increased the efficiency of this lifestyle, including increased tolerance to ethanol and the repression of the respiratory pathway.<ref name=\":3\" />  In high sugar environments, ''S. cerevisiae'' outcompetes and dominants all other yeast species, except its closest relative ''[[Saccharomyces paradoxus]]''.<ref name=\":16\" /> The ability of ''S. cerevisiae'' to dominate in high sugar environments evolved more recently than aerobic fermentation and is dependent on the type of high-sugar environment.<ref name=\":16\" />  Other yeasts' growth is dependent on the pH and nutrients of the high-sugar environment.<ref

===\nThe genomic basis of the crabtree effect is still being investigated, and its evolution likely involved multiple successive molecular steps that increased the efficiency of the lifestyle.\n\n=== Expansion of hexose transporter genes ===\n[[Glucose transporter|Hexose transporters]] (HXT) are a group of proteins that are largely responsible for the uptake of glucose in yeast.  In ''S. cerevisiae'', 20 ''HXT'' genes have been identified and 17 encode for glucose transporters (''HXT1-HXT17''), ''GAL2'' encodes for a galactose transporter, and ''SNF3'' and ''RGT2'' encode for glucose sensors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boles|first=E.|last2=Hollenberg|first2=C.

''Sch. pombe'' is a Crabtree-positive yeast, which developed aerobic fermentation independently from ''Saccharomyces'' lineage, and detects glucose via the cAMP-signaling pathway.<ref name=\":14\" />  The number of transporter genes vary significantly between yeast species and has continually increased during the evolution of the ''S. cerevisiae'' lineage.  Most of the transporter genes have been generated by tandem duplication, rather than from the WGD.  ''Sch. pombe'' also has a high number of transporter genes compared to its close relatives.<ref name=\":9\" />  Glucose uptake is believed to be a major rate-limiting step in glycolysis and replacing ''S. cerevisiae''<nowiki/>'s ''HXT1-17'' genes with a single chimera ''HXT'' gene results in decreased ethanol production or fully respiratory metabolism.<ref name=\":10\" />  Thus, having an efficient glucose uptake system appears to be essential to ability of aerobic fermentation.<ref name=\":14\" />  There is a significant positive correlation between the number of hexose transporter genes and the efficiency of ethanol production.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== CNV in glycolysis genes ===\n[[File:Ethanol Fermentation english.png|thumb|A scheme of transformation of glucose to alcohol by alcoholic fermentation.]]\nAfter a WGD, one of the duplicated gene pair is often lost through fractionation; less than 10% of WGD gene pairs have remained in ''S. cerevisiae'' genome.<ref name=\":10\" />  A little over half of WGD gene pairs in the [[glycolysis]] reaction pathway were retained in post-WGD species, significantly higher than the overall retention rate.<ref name=\":10\" />  This has been associated with an increased ability to metabolize glucose into pyruvate, or higher rate of glycolysis.<ref name=\":13\" />  After glycolysis, pyruvate can either be further broken down by [[pyruvate decarboxylase]] (Pdc) or [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] (Pdh).  The kinetics of the enzymes are such that when pyruvate concentrations are high, due to a high rate of glycolysis, there is increased flux through Pdc and thus the fermentation pathway.<ref name=\":10\" />  The WGD is believed to have played a beneficial role in the evolution of the Crabtree effect in post-WGD species partially due to this increase in copy number of glycolysis genes.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== CNV in fermentation genes ===\nThe fermentation reaction only involves two steps.  Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde by Pdc and then acetaldehyde is converted to ethanol by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (Adh).  There is no significant increase in the number of ''Pdc'' genes in Crabtree-positive compared to Crabtree-negative species and no correlation between number of ''Pdc'' genes and efficiency of fermentation.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Genetics of Yeast Carbon Metabolism|last=Lin|first=Zhenguo|last2=Li|first2=Wen-Hsiung|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642550126|editor-last=Pi\u0161kur|editor-first=Jure|pages=97\u2013120|language=en|editor-last2=Compagno|editor-first2=Concetta|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-55013-3_5}}</ref>  There are five ''Adh'' genes in ''S. cerevisiae''.<ref name=\":14\" />  Adh1 is the major enzyme responsible for catalyzing the fermentation step from acetaldehyde to ethanol.<ref name=\":4\" />  Adh2 catalyzes the reverse reaction, consuming ethanol and converting it to acetaldehyde.<ref name=\":4\" />  The ancestral, or original, Adh had a similar function as Adh1 and after a duplication in this gene, Adh2 evolved a lower K<sub>M</sub> for ethanol.<ref name=\":4\" />  Adh2 is believed to have increased yeast species' tolerance for ethanol and allowed Crabtree-positive species to consume the ethanol they produced after depleting sugars.<ref name=\":4\" />  However, Adh2 and consumption of ethanol is not essential for aerobic fermentation.<ref name=\":4\" />  ''Sch. pombe'' and other Crabtree positive species do not have the ''ADH2''  gene and consumes ethanol very poorly.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Differential expression ===\nIn Crabtree-negative species, respiration related genes are highly expressed in the presence of oxygen.  However, when ''S. cerevisiae'' is grown on glucose in aerobic conditions, respiration-related gene expression is repressed.  Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins expression is only induced under environmental stress conditions, specifically low glucose availability.<ref name=\":14\" />  Genes involving mitochondrial energy generation and phosphorylation oxidation, which are involved in respiration, have the largest expression difference between aerobic fermentative yeast species and respiratory species.<ref name=\":14\" />  In a comparative analysis between ''Sch. pombe'' and ''S. cerevisiae'', both of which evolved aerobic fermentation independently, the expression pattern of these two fermentative yeasts were more similar to each other than a respiratory yeast, ''C. albicans''.  However, ''S. cerevisiae'' is evolutionarily closer to ''C. albicans''.<ref name=\":5\" />  Regulatory rewiring was likely important in the evolution of aerobic fermentation in both lineages.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Domestication and aerobic fermentation ===\n[[File:Wine Grapes with dusting that contains yeast.jpg|thumb|A close up picture of ripening wine grapes.

Introgression and HGT is common in ''Saccharomyces'' domesticated strains.<ref name=\":12\" />  Many commercial wine strains have significant portions of their DNA derived from HGT of non-''Saccharomyces'' species.  HGT and introgression are less common in nature than is seen during domestication pressures.<ref name=\":12\" />  For example, the important industrial yeast strain ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'', is an interspecies hybrid of ''S. cerevisiae'' and the cold tolerant ''[[Saccharomyces eubayanus|S. eubayanus]].''<ref name=\":17\"/>  This hybrid is commonly used in lager-brewing, which requires slow, low temperature fermentation.<ref name=\":17\"/>\n\n== Tumor cells ==\nOne of the hallmarks of cancer is altered metabolism or deregulating cellular energetics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hanahan|first=Douglas|date=4 March 2011|title=Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation|journal=Cell|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013|pmid=21376230|volume=144|issue=5|pages=646\u2013674|doi-access=free}}</ref>  Cancers cells often have reprogrammed their glucose metabolism to perform lactic acid fermentation, in the presence of oxygen, rather than send the pyruvate made through glycolysis to the mitochondria.

It has been hypothesized that acetaldehyde is a pollen factor that causes [[cytoplasmic male sterility]].

It was believed that the WGD was a mechanism for the development of Crabtree effect in these species due to the duplication of [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH) encoding genes and hexose transporters.<ref name=\":15\" />  However, recent evidence has shown that aerobic fermentation originated before the WGD and evolved as a multi-step process, potentially aided by the WGD.<ref name=\":15\" />  The origin of aerobic fermentation, or the first step, in ''Saccharomyces'' crabtree-positive yeasts likely occurred in the interval between the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions, horizontal transfer of anaerobic DHODase (encoded by URA1 with bacteria), and the loss of respiratory chain Complex I.<ref name=\":1\" />  A more pronounced Crabtree effect, the second step, likely occurred near the time of the WGD event.<ref name=\":1\" />  Later evolutionary events that aided in the evolution of aerobic fermentation are better understood and outlined in the Genomic basis of the crabtree effect section.\n\n=== Driving forces ===\nIt is believed that a major driving force in the origin of aerobic fermentation was its simultaneous origin with modern fruit (~125 mya).<ref name=\":15\" />  These fruit provided an abundance of simple sugar food source for microbial communities, including both yeast and bacteria.<ref name=\":15\" />  Bacteria, at that time, were able to produce biomass at a faster rate than the yeast.<ref name=\":15\" />  Producing a toxic compound, like ethanol, can slow the growth of bacteria, allowing the yeast to be more competitive.<ref name=\":15\" />  However, the yeast still had to use a portion of the sugar it consumes to produce ethanol.<ref name=\":15\" />  Crabtree-positive yeasts also have increased glycolytic flow, or increased uptake of glucose and conversion to pyruvate, which compensates for using a portion of the glucose to produce ethanol rather than biomass.<ref name=\":1\" />  Therefore, it is believed that the original driving force was to kill competitors.<ref name=\":3\" />  This is supported by research that determined the kinetic behavior of the ancestral ADH protein, which was found to be optimized to make ethanol, rather than consume it.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nFurther evolutionary events in the development of aerobic fermentation likely increased the efficiency of this

In ''S. cerevisiae'', 20 ''HXT'' genes have been identified and 17 encode for glucose transporters (''HXT1-HXT17''), ''GAL2'' encodes for a galactose transporter, and ''SNF3'' and ''RGT2'' encode for glucose sensors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boles|first=E.|last2=Hollenberg|first2=C.

Most of the transporter genes have been generated by tandem duplication, rather than from the WGD.

However, when ''S. cerevisiae'' is grown on glucose in aerobic conditions, respiration-related gene expression is repressed.  Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins expression is only induced under environmental stress conditions, specifically low glucose availability.<ref name=\":14\" />  Genes involving mitochondrial energy generation and phosphorylation oxidation, which are involved in respiration, have the largest expression difference between aerobic fermentative yeast species and respiratory species.<ref name=\":14\" />  In a comparative analysis between ''Sch. pombe'' and ''S. cerevisiae'', both of which evolved aerobic fermentation independently, the expression pattern of these two fermentative yeasts were more similar to each other than a respiratory yeast, ''C. albicans''.

It has been hypothesized that acetaldehyde is a pollen factor that causes [[cytoplasmic male sterility]].  Cytoplasmic male sterility is a trait observed in maize, tobacco and other plants in which there is an inability to produce viable pollen.

Seeking to eliminate any threat to valuable British merchant convoys passing through the [[Malacca Straits]], Rear-Admiral [[Edward Pellew|Sir Edward Pellew]] determined in early 1806 that the Dutch naval forces based at Java, which included several [[ships of the line]] and three [[frigate]]s, had to be defeated to ensure British dominance in the region. Lacking the forces to effect an invasion of the Dutch colony, Pellew instead sought to isolate and [[blockade]] the Dutch squadron based at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in preparation for raids specifically targeting the Dutch ships with his main force.\n\nAlthough his plans were delayed by inadequate resources and the [[Vellore Mutiny]] in [[British India|India]], Pellew sent the frigate HMS Greyhound to the [[Java Sea]] in July 1806. ''Greyhound'' intercepted and defeated a Dutch convoy off the coast of [[Sulawesi]] on 25 July and three months later the frigate HMS Caroline managed to capture the Dutch frigate Maria Riggersbergen at the entrance to Batavia harbour. Following these successes, Pellew was able to bring his main force to bear on the island and in November 1806 launched a major raid on Batavia, destroying the remaining frigate and a number of minor warships from the Dutch squadron. The Dutch ships of the line had escaped prior to Pellew's attack to the harbour of [[Gresik|Griessie]] near [[Surabaya]], and although they were old and in a poor state of repair Pellew was forced to lead a second operation to Java in October 1807, capturing the port and eliminating the last Dutch naval forces in the east.\n\nThe victory gave Britain dominance over its European rivals in the eastern Pacific and western Indian Ocean, allowing free passage of British trade through the region and allowing British forces to focus on the one remaining threat to their merchant convoys in the Indian Ocean: the French islands of [[\u00cele Bonaparte]] and [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]).\n\n==Background==\nAt the start of 1806, control of the Indian Ocean in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] was disputed. The [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its client state the [[Kingdom of Holland]] held significant naval bases in the region, from which their warships could operate against British interests. The French islands of [[\u00cele Bonaparte]] and [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] dominated the central Indian Ocean, their position allowing raiders to cruise British trade routes and attack isolated convoys, while the Dutch colonies at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] controlled the points of entry to the ocean from east and west with their own naval squadrons.<ref name=\"RLA183\">Adkins, p. 183</ref><ref name=\"RG93\">Gardiner, p. 93</ref> The British, whose bases in India gave them control of the Northern Indian Ocean, were able to obtain supplies and reinforcements from Europe more easily than their enemies, as the Royal Navy was already dominant in European waters, but British forces in the region were still insufficient to make a significant impact on the French and Dutch territories.<ref name=\"RG59\">Gardiner, p. 59</ref> Control of the Indian Ocean was essential for the British war effort, because the British economy relied heavily on trade with the holdings of the [[Honourable East India Company]] in India and with other ports in the east, particularly in China.<ref name=\"RLA342\">Adkins, p. 342</ref>\n\nIn 1803 at the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, [[Linois' expedition to the Indian Ocean|a French squadron]] under Rear-Admiral [[Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois|Charles Linois]] was already operating in the Indian Ocean against British commerce, initially based at Isle de France.<ref name= \"WJ3:212\">James, Vol. 3, p. 212</ref> Linois's principal target was the China Fleet, a large annual convoy of valuable [[East Indiamen]] merchant ships and smaller \"country ships\" that sailed from [[Guangzhou|Canton]] early in the year and crossed the Indian Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, then passing northwards to Europe. In 1804, this convoy was worth over \u00a38&nbsp;million and included 29 ships which\u2014due to the sudden news of the outbreak of war\u2014were entirely unprotected by the Royal Navy during the first leg of its journey across the [[South China Sea]].<ref name=\"RW194\">Woodman, p. 194</ref> Although Linois was not aware of the weakness of the convoy's defences, he knew of its importance and value and determined to intercept it, using [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] on the island of [[Java]] as his main base. Ultimately Linois failed to defeat the convoy, withdrawing after some initial skirmishing at the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], but the importance of Batavia as a base against British shipping was confirmed.<ref name=\"WLC338\">Clowes, p. 338</ref>\n\nThe British commander in the Indian Ocean, Rear-Admiral [[Peter Rainier, junior|Peter Rainier]], was preoccupied with protecting merchant shipping off India during 1804 and 1805 to be able to risk an expedition to the [[Java Sea]]. His successor, Rear-Admiral [[Edward Pellew|Sir Edward Pellew]] was distracted by the continued operations of Linois's squadron and attacks from frigates based at Isle de France to take any action against the Dutch before the beginning of the monsoon season at the end of 1805, at which point the threat posed by [[hurricanes]] prevented any major seabourne operations. However, by early 1806, the departure of Linois into the Atlantic Ocean allowed Pellew and his squadron in [[Madras]] to consider offensive operations against enemy harbours.<ref name=\"RG81\"/> In addition to the threat from cruising French squadrons, the Dutch maintained their own force on Java, under Rear-Admiral Hartsinck at Batavia. This squadron\u2014which consisted of four ships of the line, three frigates and a number of smaller warships\u2014was principally tasked with anti-piracy operations, but their presence so close to the Malacca Straits was a source of concern to the British command in India.<ref name=\"RG81\"/>\nControl of the Indian Ocean was essential for the British war effort, because the British economy relied heavily on trade with the holdings of the Honourable East India Company in India and with other ports in the east, particularly in China.[4]\n\n==Campaign==\n===Frigate reconnaissance===\n{{For|more details on this topic|Action of 26 July 1806|Action of 18 October 1806}}\n\nPellew's efforts to launch a major deployment in 1806\u2014initially planned to be against Isle de France in conjunction with Rear-Admiral [[Thomas Troubridge|Sir Thomas Troubridge]] before the target was changed to Java\u2014were delayed by the diversion of his [[Royal Marines]] to put down the [[Vellore Mutiny]].<ref name=\"RG81\">Gardiner, p. 81</ref> Nevertheless, Pellew despatched several frigates to the [[Java Sea]] to reconnoitre the region, attack Dutch shipping and report on the state of the Dutch squadron maintained at Batavia. The first ships despatched were the 32-gun frigate HMS Greyhound under Captain Edward Elphinstone and the 18-gun [[brig|brig-sloop]] HMS Harrier under Commander [[Sir Edward Troubridge, 2nd Baronet|Edward Troubridge]], son of Admiral Troubridge.<ref name=\"LG3\">{{London Gazette|issue=16016|page=422|date=4 April 1807}}</ref> Elphinstone initially cruised through the [[Molucca Islands]] in June and July with some success, and on 25 July he discovered four Dutch ships passing through the [[Selayar Strait]]. Cautious of the larger force, Elphinstone observed the Dutch ships during the night and on the morning of 26 July identified the ships as a frigate, a corvette and two merchant ships, including a large [[East Indiaman]]. In response to the British ships, the Dutch commander N. L. Aalbers formed his convoy into a [[line of battle]], hoping to dissuade Elphinstone from pressing home his attack.<ref name= \"WJ251\">James, Vol. 4, p. 251</ref> The British were not deterred and ''Greyhound'' engaged the Dutch frigate ''Pallas'' directly while ''Harrier'' passed between the frigate and the merchant ship next in line, [[raking fire|raking]] them both. Within 40 minutes, ''Pallas'' had surrendered and ''Harrier'' then successfully chased down and captured the two merchant ships while the corvette fled to the [[Sulawesi]] coast, evading pursuit.<ref name= \"WLC386\">Clowes, p. 386.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of Elphinstone's success, a second frigate entered Dutch waters, HMS Caroline under Captain Peter Rainier (nephew of Admiral Rainier) cruising the Java Sea during October. There Rainer discovered that the Dutch [[ships of the line]] had sailed eastward from Batavia,<ref name=\"LG2\">{{London Gazette|issue=16139|page=568|date=23 April 1808}}</ref> except Schrikverwekker, which had been wrecked in the [[Thousand Islands (Indonesia)|Thousand Islands]] on 18 May with the loss of two men.<ref name=\"G213\">Grocott, p. 213</ref> He also learned that the Dutch frigate {{Ship|Dutch frigate|Phoenix||2}} was undergoing repairs at an exposed anchorage on Onrust Island close to Batavia harbour. Sailing to investigate, ''Caroline'' arrived off the port on 18 October, but encountered two Dutch brigs that raised the alarm, allowing ''Phoenix'' to escape into the main harbour.<ref name=\"WLC392\"/> Undeterred, Rainier sailed into Batavia [[roadstead]] and there discovered a number of small warships and the frigate Maria Riggersbergen. The smaller ships drove themselves on shore rather than fight the larger British vessel, but Captain Claas Jager on ''Maria Riggersbergen'' engaged ''Caroline''. In a battle lasting 30 minutes, the Dutch ship was defeated and captured, Rainier sending the prisoners on shore and removing the frigate, which was later renamed HMS ''Java''.<ref name=\"WJ267\">James, Vol. 4, p. 267</ref>\n\n===Attack on Batavia===\n{{details|Raid on Batavia (1806)}}\n\nEncouraged by the success of his frigates in the Java Sea, Pellew mustered a significant force in the early autumn of 1806, including four ships of the line, two frigates and a brig with which to eliminate the remaining Dutch squadron.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=16044|page=893|date=4 July 1807}}</ref> Reaching the [[Sunda Strait]] on 23 November, Pellew passed by the port of [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] and on 27 November reached Batavia, splitting his forces so that the lighter vessels sailed close to shore and the ships of the line remained in deeper water outside the channel entering the harbour. A corvette was captured, and the rest of the Dutch squadron was taken by surprise, mistaking Pellew's force for a French squadron.<ref name=\"WLC392\">Clowes, p. 392</ref> By the time their mistake was revealed, the harbour was already blocked and so Captain Vander Sande drove ''Phoenix'' ashore, followed by six other warships and 22 merchant ships.<ref name=\"WJ268\">James, Vol. 4, p. 268</ref>\n\nDetermined to eliminate the Dutch ships, Admiral Pellew gave orders that the squadron's boats gather next to the frigate {{HMS|Terpsichore|1785|6}} commanded by his son Captain [[Fleetwood Pellew]]. Boarding parties of sailors and [[Royal Marines]] were then despatched to the stranded Dutch vessels, under the distant cover of the frigates and coming under attack by Dutch batteries from the shoreline.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> Boarding ''Phoenix'', it was discovered that Vander Sande had scuttled his ship, rendering ''Phoenix'' useless. Taking over the wrecked ship's guns, Captain Pellew opened fire on the other grounded ships, as his boats approached and boarded them in turn, the entire operation conducted with the loss of just one man killed and four wounded.<ref name= \"WLC393\">Clowes, p. 393</ref> Once taken, the ships that could not be refloated were burnt, Captain Pellew waiting until the rest of the Dutch ships were destroyed before setting fire to the wreck of ''Phoenix'' and returning to his ship. In total, one frigate, seven smaller warships and 20 merchant ships were destroyed, while one small warship and two merchant craft were captured.<ref name=\"LG1-2\">{{London Gazette|issue=16044|page=894|date=4 July 1807}}</ref> With his objective complete, Admiral Pellew ordered his ships to disperse and return to friendly ports for the winter.<ref name=\"RG82\">Gardiner, p. 82</ref>\n\n===Griessie===\n{{details|Raid on Griessie}}\n\nWhen the winter hurricane season ended in the spring of 1807, Admiral Pellew found his squadron dispersed on a variety of operations from the [[Red Sea]] to the South China Sea.<ref name=\"RG82\"/> Without the forces required for an extended operation against the remainder of the Dutch squadron, Pellew was forced to limit his operations in the Java Sea to frigate reconnaissance, sending HMS ''Caroline'' and [[French frigate Psych\u00e9 (1804)|''Psyche'']] (under Fleetwood Pellew) to ascertain the exact location of the Dutch ships of the line.<ref name=\"RH81\">Henderson, p. 81</ref> On 29 August, the frigates reached Panka at the easternmost point of Java and the following day captured a merchant ship from Batavia which revealed that the Dutch ships of the line were anchored at [[Gresik|Griessie]] near [[Surabaya]] and had deteriorated beyond repair. With their mission complete, the frigates separated to raid Dutch shipping, ''Psyche'' sailing west along the coast until Pellew reached the port of [[Semarang]].<ref name=\"WJ357\">James, Vol. 4, p. 357</ref>\n\nObserving two ships at anchor in Semarang roads, Pellew sent in his ship's boats on the morning of 31 August under the command of Lieutenant Kersteman. Despite heavy fire from batteries on shore, Kersteman successfully towed the vessels out without suffering any casualties, capturing an 8-gun [[schooner]] and a merchant brig.<ref name=\"LG3\"/> While the boats were engaged at Semarang, Pellew sighted three vessels cruising off the mouth of the harbour and hastily set fire to the prizes and reclaimed his boats, setting off in pursuit. At 15:30, with ''Psyche'' rapidly overtaking the Dutch ships, their captains deliberately drove the vessels ashore approximately {{convert|9|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} west of Semarang. ''Psyche'' closed with the grounded ships and exchanged fire with them at long range, the shallow coastal water preventing a close range engagement. At 16:30, just as Pellew was hoisting out his boats in preparation for a boarding action, one of the ships surrendered. Within minutes, the others followed, firing final broadsides and [[striking the flag|hauling down their colours]].<ref name=\"WLC239\">Clowes, p. 239</ref> The surrendered ships were boarded and refloated, their identities established as the 24-gun [[corvette]] Scipio, the armed merchant ship ''Resolutie'' and the 12-gun Dutch East India Company ship ''Ceres''. Dutch casualties are unknown but the commander of the convoy\u2014Captain Carriage\u2014was killed in the brief engagement, while ''Psyche'' survived the action without a man killed or wounded. All of the prisoners were landed at Semarang under terms of parole, as many of Pellew's men were away from the ship in prizes and men could not be spared to watch the Dutch prisoners.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=16137|page=537|date=16 April 1808}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1807, responsibility for the blockade of the French Indian Ocean bases passed from Pellew at Madras to Rear-Admiral [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. This enabled Pellew to concentrate on the Dutch East Indies and temporarily relocate his base to [[Malacca Town|Malacca]] on the [[Malay Peninsula]].<ref name=\"RG82\"/> Following the reports of his scouting frigates, Pellew sailed from Malacca with a squadron of ships on 20 November, intending to destroy the remaining Dutch vessels on Java. Arriving at the [[Madura Strait]] on 5 December, Pellew sent a small boat party to Griessie with a demand that the Dutch authorities surrender the ships. However, Captain Cowell\u2014the American-born Dutch naval commander\u2014refused the demand and arrested the boat party, notifying Pellew of his actions and preparing his defences. The following day, Pellew sailed his squadron into the Straits, exchanging fire with a gun battery at Sambelangan on [[Madura Island]].<ref name=\"WLC240\">Clowes, p. 240</ref>\n\nAs Pellew's squadron neared Griessie, a message arrived from the Dutch civilian governor at Sourabaya, reversing Cowell's orders and offering a full surrender. Pellew accepted the message and on 7 December his ships entered Griessie. However, during the time it had taken to exchange messages, Cowell had ordered that all shipping in Griessie harbour be destroyed to prevent the British gaining control of it.<ref name=\"WJ358\">James, Vol. 4, p. 358</ref> The ships were scuttled in shallow water, leaving only wrecked hulls for the British to claim. Pellew ordered the hulls burned, and British landing parties investigated the town, burning and destroying all military supplies and cannon they found. Another party landed at Sambelangan and demolished the battery there. Pellew withdrew on 11 December, his ambition of destroying the Dutch naval presence in the East Indies complete.<ref name=\"RG83\">Gardiner, p. 83</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe success of the campaign against the Dutch squadron in the East Indies allowed British forces in the Indian Ocean to focus exclusively on the French islands of \u00cele Bonaparte and Isle de France, which proved very difficult to subdue during the ensuing [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811]].<ref name=\"RG95\">Gardiner, p. 95</ref> Freedom of movement for British forces in the East Indies proved invaluable however: on 27 January 1807, Peter Rainier in ''Caroline'' had seized a Spanish ship ''San Raphael'' carrying over half a million [[Spanish dollar]]s and an exceptionally valuable cargo,<ref name=\"LG6\">{{London Gazette|issue=16106|page=38|date=5 January 1808}}</ref> and the ability of British commerce raiders to act against French, Spanish and Dutch merchant shipping in the region was assured. When Pellew's successor Rear-Admiral [[William O'Bryen Drury]] attempted to eliminate the Dutch East Indies islands in a series of large scale invasions during 1810, the [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|Spice Islands were captured]] and in 1811 [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java was seized]]. British naval movements were completely unopposed, allowing a rapid and successful conclusion to the war in the Pacific.<ref name=\"RG110\">Gardiner, p. 110</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last = Adkins | first = Roy & Lesley | year = 2006 | chapter = | title = The War for All the Oceans | publisher=Abacus | isbn = 0-349-11916-3  }}\n* {{cite book | last = Clowes | first = William Laird | authorlink = William Laird Clowes | year = 1997 |origyear=1900 | chapter = | title = The Royal Navy, A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, Volume V | publisher=Chatham Publishing | isbn = 1-86176-014-0 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Grocott | first = Terence | year = 2002 |origyear=1997 | chapter = | title = Shipwrecks of the Revolutionary & Napoleonic Era | publisher=Caxton Editions | isbn = 1-84067-164-5 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Henderson CBE | first = James | year = 1994 | origyear = 1970 | chapter =  | title = The Frigates | publisher = Leo Cooper | isbn = 0-85052-432-6 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/frigatesaccounto0000hend }}\n* {{cite book | last = James | first = William | authorlink = William James (naval historian) | year = 2002 |origyear=1827 | chapter = | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 3, 1800\u20131805 | publisher=Conway Maritime Press | isbn = 0-85177-907-7 }}\n* {{cite book | last = James | first = William | authorlink = William James (naval historian) | year = 2002 |origyear=1827 | chapter = | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 4, 1805\u20131807 | publisher=Conway Maritime Press | isbn = 0-85177-908-5 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Woodman | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Woodman | year = 2001 | chapter = | title = The Sea Warriors | publisher=Constable Publishers | isbn =  1-84119-183-3 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Woodman | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Woodman | year = 1998 | title = The victory of seapower | publisher=Chatham Publishing }}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Java, campaign of 1806-1807}}\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1806]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1807]]\n[[Category:Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:19th-century history of the Royal Navy]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Java campaign of 1806\u20131807\n|partof=the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\n|image=Capture of Maria Riggersbergen.jpg\n|image_size=300px\n|caption=''Capture of the Maria Riggersbergen, Octr. 18th 1806''<br />[[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1817\n|date=June 1806 \u2013 December 1807\n|place=[[Java]], [[Dutch East Indies]]\n|result=British victory\n|combatant1=[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|22px|link=]] [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]\n|combatant2=[[File:Flag of the Netherlands.svg|22px|link=]] [[Kingdom of Holland]]\n|commander1=Rear-Admiral [[Edward Pellew|Sir Edward Pellew]]\n|commander2=Rear-Admiral Hartsinck\n|campaignbox={{Campaignbox Java campaign of 1806-1807}}\n{{Campaignbox Napoleonic Wars}}\n}}\nThe '''Java campaign of 1806\u20131807''' was a minor campaign during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by British [[Royal Navy]] forces against a naval squadron of the [[Kingdom of Holland]], a client state of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], based on the island of [[Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]].

Ultimately Linois failed to defeat the convoy, withdrawing after some initial skirmishing at the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], but the importance of Batavia as a base against British shipping was confirmed.<ref name=\"WLC338\">Clowes, p. 338</ref>\n\nThe British commander in the Indian Ocean, Rear-Admiral [[Peter Rainier, junior|Peter Rainier]], was preoccupied with protecting merchant shipping off India during 1804 and 1805 to be able to risk an expedition to the [[Java Sea]]. His successor, Rear-Admiral [[Edward Pellew|Sir Edward Pellew]] was distracted by the continued operations of Linois's squadron and attacks from frigates based at Isle de France to take any action against the Dutch before the beginning of the monsoon season at the end of 1805, at which point the threat posed by [[hurricanes]] prevented any major seabourne operations. However, by early 1806, the departure of Linois into the Atlantic Ocean allowed Pellew and his squadron in [[Madras]] to consider offensive operations against enemy harbours.<ref name=\"RG81\"/> In addition to the threat from cruising French squadrons, the Dutch maintained their own force on Java, under Rear-Admiral Hartsinck at Batavia. This squadron\u2014which consisted of four ships of the line, three frigates and a number of smaller warships\u2014was principally tasked with anti-piracy operations, but their presence so close to the Malacca Straits was a source of concern to the British command in India.<ref name=\"RG81\"/>\nControl of the Indian Ocean was essential for the British war effort, because the British economy relied heavily on trade with the holdings of the Honourable East India Company in India and with other ports in the east, particularly in China.[4]\n\n==Campaign==\n===Frigate reconnaissance===\n{{For|more details on this topic|Action of 26 July 1806|Action of 18 October 1806}}\n\nPellew's efforts to launch a major deployment in 1806\u2014initially planned to be against Isle de France in conjunction with Rear-Admiral [[Thomas Troubridge|Sir Thomas Troubridge]] before the target was changed to Java\u2014were delayed by the diversion of his [[Royal Marines]] to put down the [[Vellore Mutiny]].<ref name=\"RG81\">Gardiner, p. 81</ref> Nevertheless, Pellew despatched several frigates to the [[Java Sea]] to reconnoitre the region, attack Dutch shipping and report on the state of the Dutch squadron maintained at Batavia. The first ships despatched were the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Greyhound|1783|6}} under Captain Edward Elphinstone and the 18-gun [[brig|brig-sloop]] {{HMS|Harrier|1804|6}} under Commander [[Sir Edward Troubridge, 2nd Baronet|Edward Troubridge]], son of Admiral Troubridge.<ref name=\"LG3\">{{London Gazette|issue=16016|page=422|date=4 April 1807}}</ref> Elphinstone initially cruised through the [[Molucca Islands]] in June and July with some success, and on 25 July he discovered four Dutch ships passing through the [[Selayar Strait]]. Cautious of the larger force, Elphinstone observed the Dutch ships during the night and on the morning of 26 July identified the ships as a frigate, a corvette and two merchant ships, including a large [[East Indiaman]]. In response to the British ships, the Dutch commander N. L. Aalbers formed his convoy into a [[line of battle]], hoping to dissuade Elphinstone from pressing home his attack.<ref name= \"WJ251\">James, Vol. 4, p. 251</ref> The British were not deterred and ''Greyhound'' engaged the Dutch frigate [[HMS Celebes (1806)|''Pallas'']] directly while ''Harrier'' passed between the frigate and the merchant ship next in line, [[raking fire|raking]] them both. Within 40 minutes, ''Pallas'' had surrendered and ''Harrier'' then successfully chased down and captured the two merchant ships while the corvette fled to the [[Sulawesi]] coast, evading pursuit.<ref name= \"WLC386\">Clowes, p. 386.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of Elphinstone's success, a second frigate entered Dutch waters, {{HMS|Caroline|1795|6}} under Captain Peter Rainier (nephew of Admiral Rainier) cruising the Java Sea during October. There Rainer discovered that the Dutch [[ships of the line]] had sailed eastward from Batavia,<ref name=\"LG2\">{{London Gazette|issue=16139|page=568|date=23 April 1808}}</ref> except {{Ship|Dutch ship|Schrikverwekker||2}}, which had been wrecked in the [[Thousand Islands (Indonesia)|Thousand Islands]] on 18 May with the loss of two men.<ref name=\"G213\">Grocott, p. 213</ref> He also learned that the Dutch frigate {{Ship|Dutch frigate|Phoenix||2}} was undergoing repairs at an exposed anchorage on Onrust Island close to Batavia harbour. Sailing to investigate, ''Caroline'' arrived off the port on 18 October, but encountered two Dutch brigs that raised the alarm, allowing ''Phoenix'' to escape into the main harbour.<ref name=\"WLC392\"/> Undeterred, Rainier sailed into Batavia [[roadstead]] and there discovered a number of small warships and the frigate {{Ship|Dutch frigate|Maria Riggersbergen||2}}. The smaller ships drove themselves on shore rather than fight the larger British vessel, but Captain Claas Jager on ''Maria Riggersbergen'' engaged ''Caroline''. In a battle lasting 30 minutes, the Dutch ship was defeated and captured, Rainier sending the prisoners on shore and removing the frigate, which was later renamed HMS ''Java''.<ref name=\"WJ267\">James, Vol. 4, p. 267</ref>\n\n===Attack on Batavia===\n{{details|Raid on Batavia (1806)}}\n\nEncouraged by the success of his frigates in the Java Sea, Pellew mustered a significant force in the early autumn of 1806, including four ships of the line, two frigates and a brig with which to eliminate the remaining Dutch squadron.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=16044|page=893|date=4 July 1807}}</ref> Reaching the [[Sunda Strait]] on 23 November, Pellew passed by the port of [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] and on 27 November reached Batavia, splitting his forces so that the lighter vessels sailed close to shore and the ships of the line remained in deeper water outside the channel entering the harbour. A corvette was captured, and the rest of the Dutch squadron was taken by surprise, mistaking Pellew's force for a French squadron.<ref name=\"WLC392\">Clowes, p. 392</ref> By the time their mistake was revealed, the harbour was already blocked and so Captain Vander Sande drove ''Phoenix'' ashore, followed by six other warships and 22 merchant ships.<ref name=\"WJ268\">James, Vol. 4, p. 268</ref>\n\nDetermined to eliminate the Dutch ships, Admiral Pellew gave orders that the squadron's boats gather next to the frigate {{HMS|Terpsichore|1785|6}} commanded by his son Captain [[Fleetwood Pellew]]. Boarding parties of sailors and [[Royal Marines]] were then despatched to the stranded Dutch vessels, under the distant cover of the frigates and coming under attack by Dutch batteries from the shoreline.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> Boarding ''Phoenix'', it was discovered that Vander Sande had scuttled his ship, rendering ''Phoenix'' useless. Taking over the wrecked ship's guns, Captain Pellew opened fire on the other grounded ships, as his boats approached and boarded them in turn, the entire operation conducted with the loss of just one man killed and four wounded.<ref name= \"WLC393\">Clowes, p. 393</ref> Once taken, the ships that could not be refloated were burnt, Captain Pellew waiting until the rest of the Dutch ships were destroyed before setting fire to the wreck of ''Phoenix'' and returning to his ship. In total, one frigate, seven smaller warships and 20 merchant ships were destroyed, while one small warship and two merchant craft were captured.<ref name=\"LG1-2\">{{London Gazette|issue=16044|page=894|date=4 July 1807}}</ref> With his objective complete, Admiral Pellew ordered his ships to disperse and return to friendly ports for the winter.<ref name=\"RG82\">Gardiner, p. 82</ref>\n\n===Griessie===\n{{details|Raid on Griessie}}\n\nWhen the winter hurricane season ended in the spring of 1807, Admiral Pellew found his squadron dispersed on a variety of operations from the [[Red Sea]] to the South China Sea.<ref name=\"RG82\"/> Without the forces required for an extended operation against the remainder of the Dutch squadron, Pellew was forced to limit his operations in the Java Sea to frigate reconnaissance, sending HMS ''Caroline'' and [[French frigate Psych\u00e9 (1804)|''Psyche'']] (under Fleetwood Pellew) to ascertain the exact location of the Dutch ships of the line.<ref name=\"RH81\">Henderson, p. 81</ref> On 29 August, the frigates reached Panka at the easternmost point of Java and the following day captured a merchant ship from Batavia which revealed that the Dutch ships of the line were anchored at [[Gresik|Griessie]] near [[Surabaya]] and had deteriorated beyond repair. With their mission complete, the frigates separated to raid Dutch shipping, ''Psyche'' sailing west along the coast until Pellew reached the port of [[Semarang]].<ref name=\"WJ357\">James, Vol. 4, p. 357</ref>\n\nObserving two ships at anchor in Semarang roads, Pellew sent in his ship's boats on the morning of 31 August under the command of Lieutenant Kersteman. Despite heavy fire from batteries on shore, Kersteman successfully towed the vessels out without suffering any casualties, capturing an 8-gun [[schooner]] and a merchant brig.<ref name=\"LG3\"/> While the boats were engaged at Semarang, Pellew sighted three vessels cruising off the mouth of the harbour and hastily set fire to the prizes and reclaimed his boats, setting off in pursuit. At 15:30, with ''Psyche'' rapidly overtaking the Dutch ships, their captains deliberately drove the vessels ashore approximately {{convert|9|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} west of Semarang. ''Psyche'' closed with the grounded ships and exchanged fire with them at long range, the shallow coastal water preventing a close range engagement. At 16:30, just as Pellew was hoisting out his boats in preparation for a boarding action, one of the ships surrendered. Within minutes, the others followed, firing final broadsides and [[striking the flag|hauling down their colours]].<ref name=\"WLC239\">Clowes, p. 239</ref> The surrendered ships were boarded and refloated, their identities established as the 24-gun [[corvette]] {{Ship|Dutch corvette|Scipio||2}}, the armed merchant ship ''Resolutie'' and the 12-gun Dutch East India Company ship ''Ceres''. Dutch casualties are unknown but the commander of the convoy\u2014Captain Carriage\u2014was killed in the brief engagement, while ''Psyche'' survived the action without a man killed or wounded. All of the prisoners were landed at Semarang under terms of parole, as many of Pellew's men were away from the ship in prizes and men could not be spared to watch the Dutch prisoners.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=16137|page=537|date=16 April 1808}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1807, responsibility for the blockade of the French Indian Ocean bases passed from Pellew at Madras to Rear-Admiral [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. This enabled Pellew to concentrate on the Dutch East Indies and temporarily relocate his base to [[Malacca Town|Malacca]] on the [[Malay Peninsula]].<ref name=\"RG82\"/> Following the reports of his scouting frigates, Pellew sailed from Malacca with a squadron of ships on 20 November, intending to destroy the remaining Dutch vessels on Java. Arriving at the [[Madura Strait]] on 5 December, Pellew sent a small boat party to Griessie with a demand that the Dutch authorities surrender the ships. However, Captain Cowell\u2014the American-born Dutch naval commander\u2014refused the demand and arrested the boat party, notifying Pellew of his actions and preparing his defences. The following day, Pellew sailed his squadron into the Straits, exchanging fire with a gun battery at Sambelangan on [[Madura Island]].<ref name=\"WLC240\">Clowes, p. 240</ref>\n\nAs Pellew's squadron neared Griessie, a message arrived from the Dutch civilian governor at Sourabaya, reversing Cowell's orders and offering a full surrender. Pellew accepted the message and on 7 December his ships entered Griessie. However, during the time it had taken to exchange messages, Cowell had ordered that all shipping in Griessie harbour be destroyed to prevent the British gaining control of it.<ref name=\"WJ358\">James, Vol. 4, p. 358</ref> The ships were scuttled in shallow water, leaving only wrecked hulls for the British to claim. Pellew ordered the hulls burned, and British landing parties investigated the town, burning and destroying all military supplies and cannon they found. Another party landed at Sambelangan and demolished the battery there. Pellew withdrew on 11 December, his ambition of destroying the Dutch naval presence in the East Indies complete.<ref name=\"RG83\">Gardiner, p. 83</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe success of the campaign against the Dutch squadron in the East Indies allowed British forces in the Indian Ocean to focus exclusively on the French islands of \u00cele Bonaparte and Isle de France, which proved very difficult to subdue during the ensuing [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811]].<ref name=\"RG95\">Gardiner, p. 95</ref> Freedom of movement for British forces in the East Indies proved invaluable however: on 27 January 1807, Peter Rainier in ''Caroline'' had seized a Spanish ship ''San Raphael'' carrying over half a million [[Spanish dollar]]s and an exceptionally valuable cargo,<ref name=\"LG6\">{{London Gazette|issue=16106|page=38|date=5 January 1808}}</ref> and the ability of British commerce raiders to act against French, Spanish and Dutch merchant shipping in the region was assured. When Pellew's successor Rear-Admiral [[William O'Bryen Drury]] attempted to eliminate the Dutch East Indies islands in a series of large scale invasions during 1810, the [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|Spice Islands were captured]] and in 1811 [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java was seized]]. British naval movements were completely unopposed, allowing a rapid and successful conclusion to the war in the Pacific.<ref name=\"RG110\">Gardiner, p. 110</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last = Adkins | first = Roy & Lesley | year = 2006 | chapter = | title = The War for All the Oceans | publisher=Abacus | isbn = 0-349-11916-3  }}\n* {{cite book | last = Clowes | first = William Laird | authorlink = William Laird Clowes | year = 1997 |origyear=1900 | chapter = | title = The Royal Navy, A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, Volume V | publisher=Chatham Publishing | isbn = 1-86176-014-0 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Grocott | first = Terence | year = 2002 |origyear=1997 | chapter = | title = Shipwrecks of the Revolutionary & Napoleonic Era | publisher=Caxton Editions | isbn = 1-84067-164-5 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Henderson CBE | first = James | year = 1994 | origyear = 1970 | chapter =  | title = The Frigates | publisher = Leo Cooper | isbn = 0-85052-432-6 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/frigatesaccounto0000hend }}\n* {{cite book | last = James | first = William | authorlink = William James (naval historian) | year = 2002 |origyear=1827 | chapter = | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 3, 1800\u20131805 | publisher=Conway Maritime Press | isbn = 0-85177-907-7 }}\n* {{cite book | last = James | first = William | authorlink = William James (naval historian) | year = 2002 |origyear=1827 | chapter = | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 4, 1805\u20131807 | publisher=Conway Maritime Press | isbn = 0-85177-908-5 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Woodman | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Woodman | year = 2001 | chapter = | title = The Sea Warriors | publisher=Constable Publishers | isbn =  1-84119-183-3 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Woodman | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Woodman | year = 1998 | title = The victory of seapower | publisher=Chatham Publishing }}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Java, campaign of 1806-1807}}\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1806]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1807]]\n[[Category:Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:19th-century history of the Royal Navy]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "Infobox changes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_campaign_of_1806%E2%80%9307"}

The screenplay was written by Nicole Taylor.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 8 September 2018 and was released on 12 April 2019, by [[Entertainment One]] in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film received positive reviews, with Buckley earning a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] nomination for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\n\nRose-Lynn Harlan, an aspiring country singer and single mother of two from [[Glasgow]], is released after a year in prison for attempted drug smuggling after throwing a package of [[heroin]] over the wall into [[HM Prison Cornton Vale]] despite claiming that she did not know what was in the package. She learns that she has lost her longstanding job in the house band at Glasgow's Grand Ole Opry, as the manager refuses to employ a convicted criminal. Rose-Lynn's mother, Marion, who has been caring for Rose-Lynn's young children, encourages her to give up her music dream to focus on more practical careers and taking care of her family.\n\nRose-Lynn takes a cleaning job for Susannah's large house. Susannah's children overhear Rose-Lynn singing while she is cleaning and inform their mother, who confides that she is also a country music fan. Rose-Lynn asks Susannah for money to travel to [[Nashville]] and try to make it as a musician, but Susannah declines. However, she does get in contact with [[BBC Radio]] presenter, [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]], and sends him a recording of Rose-Lynn's singing; he offers to meet with her if she will come to London. Rose-Lynn appears before a judge to ask him to lift her [[probation|probationary]] 7pm to 7am curfew so she can travel, and he agrees. She travels by train to London and sits in on a live performance by the visiting [[Ashley McBryde]]. Harris encourages her to keep performing and figure out what she has to say so she can start writing her own songs.\n\nSusannah offers Rose-Lynn a performing gig at her upcoming house party, where she intends to ask her guests to contribute to Rose-Lynn's Nashville fund in lieu of gifts. Rose-Lynn asks Marion to watch the children in the week leading up to the party so she can rehearse, but Marion declines to cancel her holiday plans, so she is forced to shuttle her kids around to various friends who agree to watch them. The day before the performance, Susannah's husband pulls Rose-Lynn aside and says he knows about her conviction, threatening to tell his wife unless Rose-Lynn agrees to stay away from his children after her performance.\n\nRose-Lynn's son breaks his arm while playing unattended at home, and the doctors at the hospital say they cannot put a cast on until after Rose-Lynn's planned performance. Marion arrives to help and Rose-Lynn begs her to stay and watch her son so she can get to the party; Marion agrees but criticises her for neglecting her family. Rose-Lynn rushes to the party to perform, but breaks down and rushes off stage. She confesses to Susannah that she concealed her criminal record and that she had children, then leaves the party.\n\nRose-Lynn returns home and dedicates herself to her kids. Some time later, Marion presents her with a large sum of money she has saved, enough for her to travel to Nashville, having seen that Rose-Lynn has calmed down. Rose-Lynn tries to reject the money, but Marion expresses her regret about failing to accomplish her goals due to having kids. Rose-Lynn travels to Nashville and discovers how difficult it is to find gigs and get noticed.

She learns that she has lost her longstanding job in the house band at Glasgow's Grand Ole Opry, as the manager refuses to employ a convicted criminal. Rose-Lynn's mother, Marion, who has been caring for Rose-Lynn's young children, encourages her to give up her music dream to focus on more practical careers and taking care of her family.\n\nRose-Lynn takes a cleaning job for Susannah's large house. Susannah's children overhear Rose-Lynn singing while she is cleaning and inform their mother, who confides that she is also a country music fan. Rose-Lynn asks Susannah for money to travel to [[Nashville]] and try to make it as a musician, but Susannah declines. However, she does get in contact with [[BBC Radio]] presenter, [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]], and sends him a recording of Rose-Lynn's singing; he offers to meet with her if she will come to London. Rose-Lynn appears before a judge to ask him to lift her [[probation|probationary]] 7pm to 7am curfew so she can travel, and he agrees. She travels by train to London and sits in on a live performance by the visiting [[Ashley McBryde]]. Harris encourages her to keep performing and figure out what she has to say so she can start writing her own songs.\n\nSusannah offers Rose-Lynn a performing gig at her upcoming house party, where she intends to ask her guests to contribute to Rose-Lynn's Nashville fund in lieu of gifts. Rose-Lynn asks Marion to watch the children in the week leading up to the party so she can rehearse, but Marion declines to cancel her holiday plans, so she is forced to shuttle her kids around to various friends who agree to watch them. The day before the performance, Susannah's husband pulls Rose-Lynn aside and says he knows about her conviction, threatening to tell his wife unless Rose-Lynn agrees to stay away from his children after her performance.\n\nRose-Lynn's son breaks his arm while playing unattended at home, and the doctors at the hospital say they cannot put a cast on until after Rose-Lynn's planned performance. Marion arrives to help and Rose-Lynn begs her to stay and watch her son so she can get to the party; Marion agrees but criticises her for neglecting her family. Rose-Lynn rushes to the party to perform, but breaks down and rushes off stage. She confesses to Susannah that she concealed her criminal record and that she had children, then leaves the party.\n\nRose-Lynn returns home and dedicates herself to her kids. Some time later, Marion presents her with a large sum of money she has saved, enough for her to travel to Nashville, having seen that Rose-Lynn has calmed down. Rose-Lynn tries to reject the money, but Marion expresses her regret about failing to accomplish her goals due to having kids. Rose-Lynn travels to Nashville and discovers how difficult it is to find gigs and get noticed. She sneaks on stage at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] during a backstage tour and sings an impromptu song to the empty building. A security guard approaches her afterward and offers to introduce her to a record producer, but Rose-Lynn decides to return to Glasgow, having realised that her future lies in her home town.\n\nOne year later, Rose-Lynn performs an original song at [[Celtic Connections]] titled \u201cGlasgow (No Place Like Home)\u201d and receives raucous applause.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jessie Buckley]] as Rose-Lynn Harlan\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Marion\n* [[Sophie Okonedo]] as Susannah \n* [[Jamie Sives]] as Sam\n* [[Craig Parkinson]] as Alan\n* James Harkness as Elliot\n* [[Janey Godley]] as Barmaid\n* Daisy Littlefeld as Wynonna\n* Adam Mitchell as Lyle\n* Ryan Kerr as Rory \n* Nicole Kerr as Nell\n}}\nThe film also features cameo appearances from [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Ashley McBryde]] and [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hallam |first1=Neil |title=Wild Rose Film Review - February 2019 |url=https://sixshootercountry.com/2019/02/25/wild-rose-movie-review/ |website=Six Shooter Country |accessdate=19 April 2019 |date=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Jessie Buckley, Tom Harper, and Nicole Taylor on Collider Video.jpg|right|thumb|(L-R) Nicole Taylor, Tom Harper, and Jessie Buckley discuss the film in 2018]]\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 8 September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tiff.net/tiff/wild-rose/|title=Wild Rose|website=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> Shortly after, [[Neon (distributor)|NEON]] acquired [[film distribution|distribution]] rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/markets-festivals/toronto-neon-nabs-wild-rose-1202934253/|title=Toronto: Neon Nabs \u2018Wild Rose\u2019|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=9 September 2018|accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> It  screened at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] on 15 October 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=wildrose&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=|title=Wild Rose|website=[[BFI Film Festival]]|accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> and   at [[South by Southwest]] in March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/olivia-wilde-seth-rogen-matthew-mcconaughey-added-sxsw-film-fest-lineup-1176656|title=SXSW: Olivia Wilde, Seth Rogen, Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey to Premiere New Work|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Gregg|last=Kilday|date=January 16, 2019|accessdate=January 30, 2019}}</ref> It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 April 2019, by [[Entertainment One]] and in the United States on 21 June 2019 by [[Neon (distributor)|NEON]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.firstshowing.net/2019/first-uk-trailer-for-country-singer-film-wild-rose-starring-jessie-buckley/|title=UK Trailer for Country Singer Film 'Wild Rose' Starring Jessie Buckley|website=First Showing|first=Alex|last=Billington|date=January 23, 2019|accessdate=January 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2019/04/01/the-wild-rose-trailer-wants-to-pull-your-heartstrings|title=The WILD ROSE Trailer Wants To Pull Your Heartstrings|website=birthmoviesdeath.com|first=Evan|last=Saathoff|date=1 April 2019|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Wild Rose (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Jessie Buckley]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = April 12, 2019\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Soundtrack]]|[[country music|Country]]}}\n| length     = \n| label      = \n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Wild Rose (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Country Girl (Primal Scream song)|Country Girl]]\n}}\n}}\nThe soundtrack features both original songs written exclusively for the film and covers of songs by established country artists such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Wynonna Judd]], [[Chris Stapleton]], [[Hank Snow]], folk artists [[John Prine]] and [[Patty Griffin]] as well as indie rock band [[Primal Scream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2019/02/22/wild-rose-soundtrack-details/|title=\u2018Wild Rose\u2019 Soundtrack Details - Film Music Reporter|publisher=}}</ref> All songs are performed by singer [[Jessie Buckley]] with the exception of tracks 17, 18 and 19 (which are performed by The Bluegrass Smugglers) and track 20 (which is performed by Hillary Klug).

Based on the 1844 novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re|Alexandre Dumas]], the story concerns  a man who is unjustly imprisoned for 20 years for innocently delivering a letter entrusted to him. When he finally escapes, he seeks revenge against the greedy men who conspired to put him in prison.<ref name=\"WVrev\">''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; October 2, 1934, p. 37.</ref><ref name=\"HRrev\">''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; September 8, 1934, p. 143.</ref>\n\nThis is the first sound film adaptation of Dumas' novel\u2014five silent films preceded it.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The-Count-of-Monte-Cristo-Donat-Landi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Donat]] and [[Elissa Landi]] in ''The Count of Monte Cristo'']]\nIn 1815, a French merchant ship stops at the island of [[Elba]]. A letter from the exiled [[Napoleon]] is given to the ship's captain to deliver to a man in [[Marseille]]. Before he dies of a sickness, the captain entrusts the task to his first officer, [[Edmond Dant\u00e8s]] (Donat). However, the city magistrate, Raymond de Villefort, Jr. (Calhern), is tipped off by an informer, the second officer, Danglars ([[Raymond Walburn]]), and has both men arrested after the exchange.\n\nDant\u00e8s' friend Fernand Mondego ([[Sidney Blackmer]]) accompanies him to the jail. However, he, Danglars, and de Villefort all stand to gain from keeping Dant\u00e8s imprisoned: Mondego is in love with Dant\u00e8s' fianc\u00e9e, Mercedes (Landi); Danglars wants to be promoted captain in Dant\u00e8s' place; and the man who accepted the letter turns out to be de Villefort's father ([[Lawrence Grant]]). De Villefort consigns Dant\u00e8s without trial to a notorious prison, the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'If]], on the false testimony of Danglars.\n\nWhen [[Hundred Days|Napoleon returns to France]], giving Dant\u00e8s' friends hope for his release, de Villefort signs a false statement that he was killed trying to escape, which Mondego shows to Mercedes. Deceived, she gives in to her mother's deathbed wish and marries Mondego.\n\nEight years of [[solitary confinement]] follow for Dant\u00e8s. Then one day, the aged [[Abb\u00e9]] Faria ([[O. P. Heggie]]), a fellow prisoner, breaks into his cell through a tunnel he has been digging. The two join forces; Faria calculates it will take five more years to finish. In the meantime, he starts educating Dant\u00e8s.\n\nHowever, as they near their goal, a cave-in fatally injures the old man. Before he dies, he bequeaths a vast hidden treasure to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Faria's enemies had [[torture]]d and imprisoned him in an unsuccessful attempt to extract its location). The body is sewn into a [[shroud]], but while the undertaker is away, Dant\u00e8s substitutes himself for the corpse undetected. He is cast into the sea. He frees himself and is picked up by a smuggling ship.\n\nDant\u00e8s later follows Faria's directions and finds the treasure on the uninhabited island of Monte Cristo. With a fortune at his command, he sets in motion his plans for revenge. To begin, he arranges to have Albert (Mercedes and Mondego's son) kidnapped and held for ransom. Dant\u00e8s \"rescues\" the younger man in order to gain entry into [[Paris]] society, using his purchased title of Count of Monte Cristo.\n\nFirst to be brought to justice is Mondego. While the French ambassador to [[Albania]], Mondego gained renown for his bravery in an unsuccessful defense of [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]]. Dant\u00e8s arranges a ball to \"honor\" his enemy, then arranges to have him exposed publicly as the one who betrayed Ali Pasha to his death at the hands of the Turks. Unaware of the count's role in his disgrace, Mondego goes to him for advice. Dant\u00e8s reveals his identity and they engage in a duel; Dant\u00e8s wins, but spares Mondego, who returns home and commits suicide.\n\nNext is Danglars, now the most influential banker in Paris. Dant\u00e8s uses his services to buy and sell shares, sharing tips he receives from his informants. When these turn out to be infallibly profitable, Danglars bribes a man to send him copies of messages to Dant\u00e8s. Greed leads him to invest all of his money on the next report, just as Dant\u00e8s had planned. When the tip proves to be false, Danglars is bankrupted. Dant\u00e8s reveals his true identity to Danglars, who is left penniless and insane.\n\nHowever, there are unexpected complications that threaten Dant\u00e8s' carefully conceived plans. Albert Mondego learns of his involvement in his father's downfall and challenges him to a duel. Mercedes, who had recognized her former lover upon their first meeting, begs him not to kill her son. He agrees. Albert deliberately changes his aim because his mother has told him who Monte Cristo really is, and the duel ends without injury.\n\nDe Villefort has risen to the high office of State Attorney. Dant\u00e8s sends him information about his true identity and activities, which leads to his arrest and trial. At first, Dant\u00e8s refuses to testify, in order to shield de Villefort's daughter Valentine ([[Irene Hervey]]), who is in love with Albert. However, when she learns of it, she urges him to defend himself. Dant\u00e8s does so, providing evidence of de Villefort's longstanding corruption.\n\nAt last, with all of his enemies destroyed, Dant\u00e8s is reunited with Mercedes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Robert Donat]] as Edmond Dantes / The Count of Monte Cristo\n*[[Elissa Landi]] as Mercedes de Rosas\n*[[Louis Calhern]] as Raymond de Villefort Jr.\n*[[Sidney Blackmer]] as Fernand Mondego, Count de Mondego\n*[[Raymond Walburn]] as Baron Danglars\n*[[O.

Prominent characters from the novel such as Bertuccio, Caderousse, Franz D'\u00c9pinay, Andrea Cavalcanti, Louise d\u2019Armilly, Eug\u00e9nie Danglars, Maximilian Morrel, Edouard de Villefort and Heloise de Villefort are all omitted. Haydee's role is reduced to two brief appearances, and her romantic involvement with Monte Cristo is not referred to.\n\nIn the novel, Dantes and Mercedes did not rekindle their relationship. Danglars and Fernand betrayed Dantes anonymously via a letter rather than in person, and Dantes only discovered their betrayal once in prison. Mercedes was the daughter of a fisherman, not from a wealthy family as suggested in the film, and there was no indication that her mother was opposed to the Dantes marriage. Monte Cristo and Fernand did not engage in a sword fight. Monte Cristo was not put on trial, as he is in the movie's finale. It was Villefort rather than Danglars who went insane.\n\n==Reception, sequels and remakes==\nThe film was very popular \u2014 Philip Dunne said it \"provided Eddie Small with a fortune almost as great as the Treasure of Spada\".<ref name=\"dunne\"/> A sequel, ''[[The Son of Monte Cristo]]'', was announced almost immediately, but took several years to be made.<ref>Robert Donat, Jack Oakie and Other Stars to Glisten on R.-K.-O.

According to Dunne there were only seven words of Dumas in the final dialogue: \"the world is mine!\" spoken by Edmund Dantes when he gets his treasure, and \"one, two, three\" when he disposes of his enemies.<ref name=\"dunne\">Philip Dunne, ''Take Two: A Life in Movies and Politics'', ''Limelight'', 1992 p 32</ref> \n\nDunne added, \"I told the director, Rowland Lee, I'd never read the novel. He said he'd act it out for me and he did such a good job I've never read it. In fact, I used all his dialogue, I just wrote it down.... But I got my first credit.\"<ref name=\"golden\">Philip Dunne looks back at movies' golden age: [SA2 Edition]Jim Bawden Toronto Star 27 Jan 1990: G8. </ref>\n\nFilming started in May 1934.<ref name=\"offer\" />\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nThe film changes some major details of the story. Prominent characters from the novel such as Bertuccio, Caderousse, Franz D'\u00c9pinay, Andrea Cavalcanti, Louise d\u2019Armilly, Eug\u00e9nie Danglars, Maximilian Morrel, Edouard de Villefort and Heloise de Villefort are all omitted. Haydee's role is reduced to two brief appearances, and her romantic involvement with Monte Cristo is not referred to.\n\nIn the novel, Dantes and Mercedes did not rekindle their relationship. Danglars and Fernand betrayed Dantes anonymously via a letter rather than in person, and Dantes only discovered their betrayal once in prison. Mercedes was the daughter of a fisherman, not from a wealthy family as suggested in the film, and there was no indication that her mother was opposed to the Dantes marriage. Monte Cristo and Fernand did not engage in a sword fight. Monte Cristo was not put on trial, as he is in the movie's finale. It was Villefort rather than Danglars who went insane.\n\n==Reception, sequels and remakes==\nThe film was very popular \u2014 Philip Dunne said it \"provided Eddie Small with a fortune almost as great as the Treasure of Spada\".<ref name=\"dunne\"/> A sequel, ''[[The Son of Monte Cristo]]'', was announced almost immediately, but took several years to be made.<ref>Robert Donat, Jack Oakie and Other Stars to Glisten on R.-K.-O.
