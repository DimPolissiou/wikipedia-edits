It is considered one of the project's greatest albums, as well as a long-standing [[Industrial music|industrial]] [[drone music|drone]] record best known for its [[Aleatoric music|chance]] method of composition.\n\n==Background and recording==\nThe album was recorded by Steven Stapleton and his wife Diana Rogerson, credited as Calhoun Phelan in the album's liner notes, in May 1988. No instruments per se were used on the record; the only sound source was a number of [[effects unit]]s which he had set up to operate in a [[feedback loop]]. There was no original input signal being processed, simply the feedback hum generated by plugging the original chain of pedals back into itself. However, when Stapleton went near the pedals he found the sound changed in accordance with his proximity to the various pedals and units. \n\nStapleton told author [[David Keenan]] (in the book ''England's Hidden Reverse'') that he had then essentially created the album's compositions by gently moving his fingers above the various units to create the slow, subtle changes in sound, tone and timbre; in later years he has put the album down to an electrical fault of some sort in the studio it was recorded in. This was acknowledged on a later reissue with the credit \"''our thanks to Electricity for making this recording possible''\". He remains proud of the album, describing it to Keenan as \"fucking brilliant\". The album title refers to Stapleton and Rogerson's daughter Lilith who was born that year; Lilith would go on to contribute both artwork and vocals to releases by NWW and [[Current 93]].\n\n==Release history==\nDespite being a limited edition three-record set in an embossed box, which made it a more expensive album to package, the album was one of the most successful NWW releases of Stapleton's career, and reissues since its original release have continued to sell; Stapleton also told Keenan that the sales of the album funded his and his family's move to Cooloorta in [[County Clare]], [[Ireland]] in 1989. Originally issued on the short-lived Idle Hole label (founded by Stapleton and Rogerson with a government [[Enterprise Allowance Scheme]] grant), a small overrun of the third disc was issued separately as ''Soliloquy For Lilith Parts 5 & 6''. The album was reissued as a double CD on United Dairies via [[World Serpent Distribution|World Serpent]] in 1993 and then again in 2003, this time as a 3 disc set mirroring the box packaging of the original with the third disc containing two remixes of the original material by Stapleton and Colin Potter. When World Serpent Distribution went out of business in 2004, the 3-CD set was reissued by United Jnana (a hook-up between Stapleton's label United Dairies and Mark Logan's label Jnana Records), this present edition being identical in all but catalogue number from its predecessor.\n\nThe album's original six selections follow a strict convention: each is between 17 and 18 minutes in length. Later editions featured two bonus selections. Of these, the first (VII) was a remix of the original album's third selection, with additional effects and using the latter as a backing track, each running for the same length. The later bonus track runs for over 20 minutes.\n\nReleases of the album commonly feature depictions of the [[Burney Relief]] in the album artwork;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nurse-With-Wound-Soliloquy-For-Lilith/release/429811|title=Soliloquy for Lilith (1)|work=Discogs.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nurse-With-Wound-Soliloquy-For-Lilith/release/7223050|title=Soliloquy for Lilith (2)|work=Discogs.com}}</ref> the significance of this is that the central figure depicted has been identified with [[Lilith]].<ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/658/the-queen-of-the-night/ |title=The Queen of the Night |author=Joshua J.

It was released on December 17, 2009 for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[WebOS]] and is one of the games containing the [[Gameloft Live]] online gaming service. It was later released on the [[PlayStation Network]] for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 3]] on December 21, 2010, just five days after the release of ''[[N.O.V.A. 2]]''. ''N.O.V.A Legacy'', a remaster of the original N.O.V.A. developed by Gameloft Madrid, was also released for Android on the [[Google Play|Google Play Store]] in 2017 and on [[App Store (iOS)]] in 2018.\n\nThe game's hostiles (known as \"Xenos\") are similar to those in the ''[[Metroid]]'' series as well as the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''N.O.V.A.'' is primarily a first-person shooter, with one on-rails driving segment. Throughout the game's twelve levels, players fight alien enemies known as Xenos. The game takes major cues from sci-fi console shooters, such as the ''Halo'' and ''Metroid'' series. The player can use eight weapons that resemble futuristic versions of weapons found in one of Gameloft's previous works, ''[[Modern Combat: Sandstorm]]''.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nPlayers can use multiplayer in ''N.O.V.A.'' in the following ways:\n\n* Local [[Wi-Fi]]\n* Local [[Bluetooth]]\n* Online (via [[Gameloft Live]])\n\n== Plot ==\nAt an indeterminate point in the future, [[Earth]] is rendered uninhabitable by humans and animals by unknown means. Therefore, humans built satellites in space, known as the Near Orbitals. The race responsible for this event, later named in the sequel as Volterites, waged a war of genocide upon learning of mankind's threat as a growing power. The Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance was formed as a resistance group to defend mankind from further alien aggression.\n\nThe protagonist of this story is Captain Kal Wardin, a retired soldier who is returned to active duty to investigate a missing transport. He is supported by Yelena, a newly created artificial intelligence, and later a starship AI known as Prometheus. He battles against a new alien race known as the Xenos, who begin to attack military facilities of NOVA across the unnamed planet that most of the story occurs on. After multiple occasions of Kal not following orders, the leaders of NOVA delete Yelena and attempt to kill Kal with a hit team, but Kal escapes through a portal to the Xenos Homeworld to end the invasion.\n\nUpon reaching the planet, Kal learns that the Xenos are actually caretakers of an omniscient race of aliens known as the Judgers, whose leader, the Controller, deemed the human race as a threat when the sister ship of the transport vessel entered a portal and crashed into the world below. Kal defeats the controller and confronts the Judgers, who judge him based on the player's actions. Yelena is restored to life, Prometheus becomes the guardian of mankind and the Judgers' messenger between the two races, and the NOVA leaders are erased from existence for their actions to save themselves rather than the rest of their race.\n\nIf Kal doesn't commit to save others, he is haunted for those he would not save, but impresses the Judgers to let him and the rest of humanity live for showing the courage to save others. He is given the title of \"Hero of Sagittarius\" for his heroics but retires soon after.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Reception===\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = iOS: 94/100<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/nova---near-orbit-vanguard-alliance |title=N.O.V.A. - Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance for iPhone/iPad Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref><br />iOS (''HD''): 65/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/nova---near-orbit-vanguard-alliance-hd |title=N.O.V.A. - Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance HD for iPhone/iPad Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=12 December 2018}}</ref><br />PSP: 48/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/psp/nova---near-orbit-vanguard-alliance |title=N.O.V.A. - Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance for PSP Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=12 December 2018}}</ref>\n| IGN = 9.0/10<ref name=\"ign-review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/12/17/nova-review |title=N.O.V.A.

Yelena is restored to life, Prometheus becomes the guardian of mankind and the Judgers' messenger between the two races, and the NOVA leaders are erased from existence for their actions to save themselves rather than the rest of their race.\n\nIf Kal doesn't commit to save others, he is haunted for those he would not save, but impresses the Judgers to let him and the rest of humanity live for showing the courage to save others. He is given the title of \"Hero of Sagittarius\" for his heroics but retires soon after.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Reception===\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = iOS: 94/100<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/nova---near-orbit-vanguard-alliance |title=N.O.V.A. - Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance for iPhone/iPad Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref><br />iOS (''HD''): 65/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/nova---near-orbit-vanguard-alliance-hd |title=N.O.V.A. - Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance HD for iPhone/iPad Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=12 December 2018}}</ref><br />PSP: 48/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/psp/nova---near-orbit-vanguard-alliance |title=N.O.V.A. - Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance for PSP Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=12 December 2018}}</ref>\n| IGN = 9.0/10<ref name=\"ign-review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/12/17/nova-review |title=N.O.V.A.

They were first recruited during the [[American Civil War]], and by the end of that war in April 1865, the 175 USCT regiments constituted about one-tenth of the manpower of the [[Union Army]]. About 20% of USCT soldiers died, a rate about 35% higher than that for white Union troops. Despite heavy casualties, many fought with distinction, 15 USCT soldiers receiving the [[List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients|Medal of Honor]] and numerous others receiving other honors.\n\nThe USCT regiments were precursors to the [[Buffalo Soldier]] regiments in the American [[Old West]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War}}\n\n===The Confiscation Act===\n[[File:DutchGapb.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|USCT soldiers at an abandoned farmhouse in [[Dutch Gap]], Virginia, 1864]]\n\nThe [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]]<ref>Rodriguez, Junius P.

It freed slaves whose owners were in rebellion against the United States, and the [[Militia Act of 1862]] empowered the President to use former slaves in any capacity in the army. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was concerned with public opinion in the four [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] that remained in the Union, as they had numerous slaveholders, as well as with northern Democrats who supported the war but were less supportive of abolition than many northern Republicans. Lincoln opposed early efforts to recruit [[African-American ]] soldiers, although he accepted the Army using them as paid workers. Native Americans also played a significant role in the colored regiments of the [[American Civil War]].\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Company K of the 1st Michigan Sharpshooters.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Company K of the [[1st United States Volunteer Sharpshooter Regiment|1st Michigan Sharpshooters resting]].]] -->\nIn September 1862, Lincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]], announcing that all slaves in rebellious states would be free as of January 1.

Their service bolstered the Union war effort at a critical time. By war's end, the men of the USCT made up nearly one-tenth of all Union troops. \n\nThe USCT suffered 2,751 combat casualties during the war, and 68,178 losses from all causes.

In 1863 a former slave, [[William Henry Singleton]], helped recruit 1,000 former slaves in [[New Bern, North Carolina]] for the [[First North Carolina Colored Volunteers]]. He became a sergeant in the 35th USCT. Freedmen from the [[Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony]], established in 1863 on the island, also formed part of the Free North Carolina Colored Volunteers (FNCCV) and subsequently the 35th.<ref name=\"CCM\">[http://www.carolinacountry.com/storypages/ourstories/freedmen/freedmen.html \"The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony\"]; ''Carolina Country Magazine'', date?, accessed November 10, 2010</ref> Nearly all of the volunteer regiments were converted into USCT units.\n\nIn 1922 Singleton published his memoir (in a [[slave narrative]]) of his journey from slavery to freedom and becoming a Union soldier. Glad to participate in reunions, years later at the age of 95, he marched in a [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR) event in 1938.\n\n===State volunteers===\nFour regiments were considered Regular units, rather than auxiliaries. Their veteran status allowed them to get valuable federal government jobs after the war, from which African Americans had usually been excluded in earlier years. However, the men received no formal recognition for combat honors and awards until the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThese units were:\n* [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry]]\n* [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|54th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[29th Connecticut Infantry Regiment (Colored)|29th Connecticut (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[30th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[31st Infantry Regiment, United States Colored Troops|31st Infantry Regiment (Colored)]]\n\n===Corps d'Afrique===\n[[File:Gordon, scourged back, in uniform, 1863.png|thumb|250px|Escaped slave, [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]] (or \"Whipped Peter\"), in USCT uniform]]\n\nThe Corps d'Afrique, one of many [[List of Louisiana Union Civil War units|Louisiana Union Civil War units]], was formed in [[New Orleans]] after the city was taken and occupied by Union forces. It was formed in part from the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|Louisiana Native Guards]]. The Native Guards were former militia units raised in New Orleans, who were property-owning [[free people of color]] (''gens du couleur libres'').<ref>This group of [[mixed-race]] people were descended generally from male native-born Spanish and French colonists (called ''Criolla'' or ''Cr\u00e9ole'') and African slave women, or free African-American women. After the United States made the [[Louisiana Purchase]] (1803), many Americans moved to Louisiana. They ignored the status of the free people of color, grouping them with the mass of blacks, then mostly slaves. (Today the people of color descended from this group are generally referred to as [[Louisiana Creole]]s.)</ref>\n\nFree [[mixed-race]] people had developed as a third class in New Orleans since the colonial years. During the Civil War, many of the free men of color wanted to prove their bravery and loyalty to the Confederacy like other Southern property owners, but the Confederates did not allow them to serve and [[Right to keep and bear arms|confiscated the arms]] of those in the militia. The Confederates believed that enlisting black soldiers would hurt agriculture, as most African Americans were enslaved workers.\n\nFor later units of the Corps d'Afrique, the Union recruited [[freedmen]] from the refugee camps. Liberated from nearby plantations, they and their families had no means to earn a living and no place to go. Local commanders, starved for replacements, started equipping volunteer units with cast-off uniforms and obsolete or captured firearms. The men were treated and paid as auxiliaries, performing guard or picket duties to free up white soldiers for maneuver units. In exchange their families were fed, clothed and housed for free at the Army camps; often schools were set up for them and their children.\n\nDespite class differences between free people of color and freedmen, the troops of the Corps d'Afrique served with distinction, including at the [[Battle of Port Hudson]] and throughout the South. Its units included:\n* 4 Regiments of Louisiana Native Guards (renamed the 1st\u20134th Corps d'Afrique Infantry, later renamed as the 73rd\u201376th US Colored Infantry on April 4, 1864).\n* 1st and 2nd Brigade Marching Bands, Corps d'Afrique (later made into Nos. 1 and 2 Bands, USCT).\n* 1st Regiment of Cavalry (1st Corps d'Afrique Cavalry, later made into the 4th US Colored Cavalry).\n* 22 Regiments of Infantry (1st\u201320th, 22nd, and 26th Corps d'Afrique Infantry, later converted into the 77th\u201379th, 80th\u201383rd, 84th\u201388th, and 89th\u201393rd US Colored Infantry on April 4, 1864).\n* 5 Regiments of Engineers (1st\u20135th Corps d'Afrique Engineers, later converted into the 95th\u201399th US Colored Infantry regiments on April 4, 1864) whose work building [[Bailey's Dam]] saved the Union navy's [[Mississippi River Squadron]].\n* 1 Regiment of Heavy Artillery (later converted into the 10th US Colored (Heavy) Artillery on May 21, 1864).\n\n===Right Wing, XVI Corps (1864)===\nColored troops served as laborers in the 16th Army Corps' [[Quartermaster|Quartermaster's Department]] and [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer Corps]].\n* Detachment, Quartermaster's Department.\n* [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer Corps,]] 1st Division ([[Joseph A.

African Americans, mostly escaped slaves, had been recruited into the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (African Descent)|1st Kansas Colored Volunteers.]] They accompanied white troops to Missouri to break up Confederate [[guerrilla]] activities based at Hog Island near Butler, Missouri.

The most famous USCT action took place at the [[Battle of the Crater]] during the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Regiments of USCT suffered heavy casualties attempting to break through [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] lines. Other notable engagements include [[Fort Wagner]], one of their first major tests, and the [[Battle of Nashville]].<ref name=\"cornish173\"/>\n\nUSCT soldiers were among the first Union forces to enter [[Richmond, Virginia]], after its fall in April 1865.

Following the war, USCT regiments served among the occupation troops in former Confederate states.\n\nU.S. Army General [[Ulysses S.

In 1861 at [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, Butler was the first to declare [[refugee]] slaves as [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] and refused to return them to slaveholders. This became a policy throughout the [[Union Army]]; it started when a few slaves escaped to Butler's lines in 1861. Their owner, a Confederate colonel, came to Butler under a flag of truce and demanded that they be returned to him under the [[Fugitive slave laws#1850 Fugitive Slave Act|Fugitive Slave Act]] of 1850. Butler informed him that since Virginia claimed to have left the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], the Fugitive Slave Law no longer applied, declaring the slaves to be contraband of war.\n\n[[List of African-American Medal of Honor recipients|Sixteen African-American USCT soldiers]] earned the [[Medal of Honor]], the nation's highest award, for service in the war:<ref>{{cite book|last=Schubert|first=Frank N.|title=Black Valor: Buffalo Soldiers and the Medal of Honor, 1870-1898|pp=[https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/2 2-4]|publisher=Scholarly Resources Inc.|date=1997|isbn=9780842025867|url=https://archive.org/details/blackvalorbuffal00schu/page/2}}</ref>\n* Sergeant [[William Harvey Carney]] of the [[54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions at the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner|Battle of Fort Wagner]] in July 1863. During the advance, Carney was wounded but still went on. When the color-bearer was shot, Carney grabbed the flagstaff and planted it in the parapet, while the rest of his regiment stormed the fortification. When his regiment was forced to retreat, he was wounded two more times while he carried the colors back to Union lines. He did not relinquish it until he handed it to another soldier of the 54th. Carney received his medal 37 years after the battle.\n* Fourteen African-American soldiers, including Sergeant Major [[Christian Fleetwood]] and Sergeant [[Alfred B.

During the war years, the men had difficulty gaining deserved official recognition for achievement and valor. Often recommendations for decorations were filed away and ignored. Another problem was that the government would mail the award certificate and medal to the recipient, who had to pay the postage due (whether he were white or black).

In 1863 a former slave, [[William Henry Singleton]], helped recruit 1,000 former slaves in [[New Bern, North Carolina]] for the [[First North Carolina Colored Volunteers]]. He became a sergeant in the 35th USCT. Freedmen from the [[Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony]], established in 1863 on the island, also formed part of the Free North Carolina Colored Volunteers (FNCCV) and subsequently the 35th.<ref name=\"CCM\">[http://www.carolinacountry.com/storypages/ourstories/freedmen/freedmen.html \"The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony\"]; ''Carolina Country Magazine'', date?, accessed November 10, 2010</ref> Nearly all of the volunteer regiments were converted into USCT units.\n\nIn 1922 Singleton published his memoir (in a [[slave narrative]]) of his journey from slavery to freedom and becoming a Union soldier. Glad to participate in reunions, years later at the age of 95, he marched in a [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR) event in 1938.\n\n===State volunteers===\nFour regiments were considered Regular units, rather than auxiliaries. Their veteran status allowed them to get valuable federal government jobs after the war, from which African Americans had usually been excluded in earlier years. However, the men received no formal recognition for combat honors and awards until the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThese units were:\n* [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry]]\n* [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|54th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[29th Connecticut Infantry Regiment (Colored)|29th Connecticut (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[30th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[31st Infantry Regiment, United States Colored Troops|31st Infantry Regiment (Colored)]]\n\n===Corps d'Afrique===\n[[File:Gordon, scourged back, in uniform, 1863.png|thumb|250px|Escaped slave, [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]] (or \"Whipped Peter\"), in USCT uniform]]\n\nThe Corps d'Afrique, one of many [[List of Louisiana Union Civil War units|Louisiana Union Civil War units]], was formed in [[New Orleans]] after the city was taken and occupied by Union forces. It was formed in part from the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|Louisiana Native Guards]]. The Native Guards were former militia units raised in New Orleans, who were property-owning [[free people of color]] (''gens du couleur libres'').<ref>This group of [[mixed-race]] people were descended generally from male native-born Spanish and French colonists (called ''Criolla'' or ''Cr\u00e9ole'') and African slave women, or free African-American women. After the United States made the [[Louisiana Purchase]] (1803), many Americans moved to Louisiana. They ignored the status of the free people of color, grouping them with the mass of blacks, then mostly slaves. (Today the people of color descended from this group are generally referred to as [[Louisiana Creole]]s.)</ref>\n\nFree [[mixed-race]] people had developed as a third class in New Orleans since the colonial years. During the Civil War, many of the free men of color wanted to prove their bravery and loyalty to the Confederacy like other Southern property owners, but the Confederates did not allow them to serve and [[Right to keep and bear arms|confiscated the arms]] of those in the militia. The Confederates believed that enlisting black soldiers would hurt agriculture, as most African Americans were enslaved workers.\n\nFor later units of the Corps d'Afrique, the Union recruited [[freedmen]] from the refugee camps. Liberated from nearby plantations, they and their families had no means to earn a living and no place to go. Local commanders, starved for replacements, started equipping volunteer units with cast-off uniforms and obsolete or captured firearms. The men were treated and paid as auxiliaries, performing guard or picket duties to free up white soldiers for maneuver units. In exchange their families were fed, clothed and housed for free at the Army camps; often schools were set up for them and their children.\n\nDespite class differences between free people of color and freedmen, the troops of the Corps d'Afrique served with distinction, including at the [[Battle of Port Hudson]] and throughout the South. Its units included:\n* 4 Regiments of Louisiana Native Guards (renamed the 1st\u20134th Corps d'Afrique Infantry, later renamed as the 73rd\u201376th US Colored Infantry on April 4, 1864).\n* 1st and 2nd Brigade Marching Bands, Corps d'Afrique (later made into Nos. 1 and 2 Bands, USCT).\n* 1st Regiment of Cavalry (1st Corps d'Afrique Cavalry, later made into the 4th US Colored Cavalry).\n* 22 Regiments of Infantry (1st\u201320th, 22nd, and 26th Corps d'Afrique Infantry, later converted into the 77th\u201379th, 80th\u201383rd, 84th\u201388th, and 89th\u201393rd US Colored Infantry on April 4, 1864).\n* 5 Regiments of Engineers (1st\u20135th Corps d'Afrique Engineers, later converted into the 95th\u201399th US Colored Infantry regiments on April 4, 1864) whose work building [[Bailey's Dam]] saved the Union navy's [[Mississippi River Squadron]].\n* 1 Regiment of Heavy Artillery (later converted into the 10th US Colored (Heavy) Artillery on May 21, 1864).\n\n===Right Wing, XVI Corps (1864)===\nColored troops served as laborers in the 16th Army Corps' [[Quartermaster|Quartermaster's Department]] and [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer Corps]].\n* Detachment, Quartermaster's Department.\n* [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer Corps,]] 1st Division ([[Joseph A.

African Americans, mostly escaped slaves, had been recruited into the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (African Descent)|1st Kansas Colored Volunteers.]] They accompanied white troops to Missouri to break up Confederate [[guerrilla]] activities based at Hog Island near Butler, Missouri.

The most famous USCT action took place at the [[Battle of the Crater]] during the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Regiments of USCT suffered heavy casualties attempting to break through [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] lines. Other notable engagements include [[Fort Wagner]], one of their first major tests, and the [[Battle of Nashville]].<ref name=\"cornish173\"/>\n\nUSCT soldiers were among the first Union forces to enter [[Richmond, Virginia]], after its fall in April 1865. The 41st USCT regiment was among those present at the surrender of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]]. Following the war, USCT regiments served among the occupation troops in former Confederate states.\n\nU.S. Army General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] praised the competent performance and bearing of the USCT, saying at Vicksburg that:\n\n{{quote|Negro troops are easier to preserve discipline among than our white troops ...

While all women have been disadvantaged, black women have dealt with additional struggles due to [[apartheid]]. Legal systems have played a large part in the systematic oppression of South African women. In addition, South Africa struggles with extremely high rates of rape and [[sexual violence]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Discrimination and race ===\n\n==== Black women ====\nBefore the most recent Bill of Rights was adopted, the struggle of the women of South Africa started as early as 1913, when black women began to protest against having to carry identification passes (white women did not have to carry the passes). In 1918, [[Charlotte Maxeke]] started the first formal women's organization, called the Bantu Women's League. Charlotte Maxeke was the first black woman to receive a degree from Wilberforce University. [[Nontsizi Mgqwetho]] also contributed to the advancement of women's rights in the 1920s with her writings and poetry mirroring the critiques presented by Maxeke. Both women contributed to the black press. They argued the need to rupture the idea of black women's publicness. The domestic setting was seen as the women's realm and outside of the house was seen as the man's realm.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Banda|first=Fareda|date=2006|title=Women, Law and Human Rights in Southern Africa|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|volume=32|issue=1|pages=13\u201327|issn=0305-7070|jstor=25065064|doi=10.1080/03057070500493720|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1061e4a743d5fd2ed5996192b56399286cc59213}}</ref> However, the contributions of black women were not seen as intellectual insights. With Maxeke's political and educational experience and class position, and Mgqwetho's closeness to the press, they were able to make their opinions public, which would have been very difficult at this time. They were speaking in a society where all blacks were not considered worthy to be citizens. On top of that, they also fought the [[South African Native National Congress|SANNC]]- the party for black men which excluded black women members.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Masola|first=Athambile|date=January 2019|title=The Politics of the 1920s Black Press: Charlotte Maxeke and Nontsizi Mgqwetho's Critique of Congres|url=|journal=International Journal of African Renaissance Studies- Multi-, Inter-, and Transdisciplinarity|volume=13, 2018|pages=59\u201376|via=Taylor and Francis Online}}</ref>\n[[File:A young Charlotte Maxeke.jpg|thumb|Charlotte Maxeke, leader of the Bantu's Women League]]\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s there were many mass protests, demonstrations and resistance campaigns in which women participated. Before 1943 the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) was an organization founded by men and only admitted men. The struggles of women from 1913-1943 showed that women were affected by colonialism as well. In 1943, the ANC opened its doors for women to join. In 1948, the [[African National Congress Women's League|ANC Women's League]] (ANCWL) was formed and [[Ida Mntwana]] became the first female president of the League. In 1952, many South African black women took part in the [[Defiance Campaign]], which involved purposefully breaking apartheid laws.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Booysen-Wolthers|first=Annelize|last2=Fourie|first2=Frederick C.

There, the Freedom Charter was created and allowed women to express their needs and incorporate their requests. However, in 1955 the pass laws were presented again. Demonstrations were held in protest of these laws. On August 9, 1956, thousands of women marched to the Union Buildings in protest. The march was planned by the [[Federation of South African Women]]. On this day, South African women celebrated the first [[National Women's Day (South Africa)|South African Women's Freedom day]].<ref>{{Cite document|title=What is Women's Month?|last=|first=|date=2015|id = {{ProQuest|1778788820}}}}</ref> The holiday was organized by the ANC to commemorate the protests that began on August 9, 1913, against the identification passes that black people had to carry. The ANC was banned in 1960 and halted the progress and demonstrations women were having. Other regional organizations were formed, since many women went into exile and those who remained were unable to organize anything. Once the ANC was unbanned in 1990, the ANCWL brought all the organizations together to form the National Women's Coalition in 1991. The Women's charter was completed in 1994 and the concerns were incorporated into the new Bill of Rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/anc-womens-league-ancwl|title=ANC Women's League (ANCWL) {{!}} South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\n==== Bill of Rights ====\nIt was not until the introduction of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] in 1996 that all women in South Africa were formally recognized as equal citizens. In this Constitution, there was a special paragraph for women, titled \u2018Equality\u2019. In this Bill of Rights, sections 9, 10, 11, 12 specifically refer to women as equals and the basis of how to be treated. Section 9(3) prohibits any form of discrimination with relation to gender, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy, ethnicity or culture. This is followed by sections 10 and 11 which give the right to be treated equally and the right to life. One of the most significant sections is 12, which states the right \u2018to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources.\u2019 As domestic violence has been an issue for all women, this establishes that within the domain of a home or family they are under public policy as well.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Kristina|date=2004|title=Women's Human Rights & the Feminisation of Poverty in South Africa|journal=Review of African Political Economy|volume=31|issue=100|pages=247\u2013261|issn=0305-6244|jstor=4006890|doi=10.1080/0305624042000262275}}</ref>\n\n== Rights of girls in South Africa ==\nNowadays 96% of South African children aged 7\u201313 receive a primary education. However, there was a time when it was unusual to be able to go to school there. Many children struggled to receive an education. The government schools struggle with many challenges including a poor quality of education, low teacher morale, the impact of [[HIV and AIDS]], poor infrastructure, water shortages, food insecurity, poor public health, and few techniques for inclusive education, particularly for children with disabilities. Girls and young women still report high levels of [[sexual abuse]], intimidation, exploitation and murder in their schools. It has been reported that children aged 10\u201314 are most commonly raped and their school teachers are the most common child rapist. Many girls are forced to leave schools either for pregnancies or as a result of the harassment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jewkes|first=Rachel|last2=Levin|first2=Jonathan|last3=Mbananga|first3=Nolwazi|last4=Bradshaw|first4=Debbie|date=2002-01-26|title=Rape of girls in South Africa|journal=The Lancet|volume=359|issue=9303|pages=319\u2013320|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07530-X|pmid=11830201|issn=0140-6736}}</ref> Due to the treatment of young girls in the educational system, women are limited to their social and economic potential.<ref name=\":0\" /> This also causes the increase of the spread of HIV to younger girls and has resulted in unsafe sexual practices later in life. Girls are socialized to become home keepers and child-bearers, so they place less value on their educational. When girls perform well in subjects such as math or science, they are not encouraged and they mostly do not have the confidence to pursue careers that rely on these skills. Many schools are not child or girl friendly. Some are situated far from homes, exposing girls to danger when they walk to and from school. Nearly a million children under the age of 15 have been orphaned as a result of the [[HIV/AIDS epidemic]]. Girls often drop out of school to look after sick family members and younger siblings.\n\nIn 2003, the South African Minister of Education set up the Girls\u2019 Education Movement (GEM). GEM is an African movement, supported by [[UNICEF]], where children and young people in schools and communities in South Africa work to bring positive changes in the lives of African girls and boys. GEM aims to:\n\n* Give girls equal access to education\n* Improve the quality of education, especially in disadvantaged schools\n* Make the school program and school books gender responsive\n* Create schools that are safe and secure for children, especially girls\n* Work with boys as strategic partners\n* Decrease gender-based violence\n* Abolish harmful cultural \n* practices such as early marriage. GEM has had a lot of success in this area and has also helped many schools, making life for a large number of girls a lot better. There are a lot of other organizations that try to get more fair rights for the girls in South Africa.\n\n== During the wars ==\nThe [[Boer Wars]] were two wars fought during 1880\u20131881 and 1899\u20131902 by the [[British Empire]] against two independent Boer republics, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic. ( \u2018Boer\u2019 is the Dutch and African word for farmer.) Boer women, children and men that were not fit enough to work for the British were put together in concentration camps during the Boer War 2. The first two of these camps were established to house the families of cities who had surrendered voluntarily, but very soon, families that were a burden for the British were driven forcibly into camps that were established all over the country, the camps first stayed refugee camps but they later became concentration camps. The horrible conditions in these camps caused the death of 4,177 women, 22,074 children under sixteen and 1,676 men, mainly those too old to be on commando. The white and the black people were put in different camps.\n\n14,154 deaths were officially recorded in the black section of these camps. It is estimated that 25,000 to 34,000 deaths occurred in the Boer camps, with 81% being death of children. These statistics, however, do not include the number of deaths which happened en route to the camps and during the capturing. The initial investigation of these camps started because of the white child mortality. The role of children was very important during this war and the race and class affected the experience of each child. Children were often separated from their families and exposed to harsh conditions and diseases. Their health going into the camps was already deteriorating and significantly declined upon arrival. The conditions were inhumane and families and children were crammed together. Such trauma also involved the separation with parents and not recognizing the faces when they came to return their children home. Black children also were forced to work in Boer camps. Children did earn a little money for work as it was considered contribution to their families. In Bloemfontein, the [[National Women's Monument|National Women's Monument]] was built in memorial of the conflict and dedicated to the women and children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duff|first=Se|date=2014|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=7|issue=3|pages=355\u2013376|doi=10.1353/hcy.2014.0049|title=\"Capture the children\": Writing Children into the South African War, 1899-1902}}</ref>\n\nAll women and children were put in concentration camps right away, they were treated very badly. The white camps had it much better than the black camps. [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Field-Marshal Lord Roberts]] had another motive to put Blacks into camps, namely to make them work, either to grow crops for the troops or to dig trenches, be wagon drivers or work as miners. They did not receive food, hardly any medical support or shelter and were expected to grow their own crops. The strong-bodied who could work, could exchange labour for food or buy a meal for a cheap price. On January 22, 1901, the Boschhoek concentration camp for Blacks had about 1,700 black hold a protest meeting. They state that when they were brought into the camps, they had been promised that they will be paid for all their stock taken by the British. They are also unhappy because \"... they receive no food while the Boers who are the cause of the war are fed for free in the refugee camps\u2026\u201d While the war lasted, more and more concentration camps were set up for women and children, and more and more deaths were recorded.\n\n== What has been done for the women in South Africa ==\nMany things have been done for women in South Africa. Take for example the commemoration of the Women's March that is held every year. But even things as the Bill of Rights have had great impact on the women in South Africa. Though many things have been done for the women in South Africa, they still are treated lesser than men but also lesser than white women. Even as this has not improved, these things have had a positive effect on how women are treated around that area. In this way think about how little girls can now have an education without having to be afraid of going to school. But not only the direct causes, also think about projects in which things against AIDS are done. By helping to do things against this disease, organizations are making sure that the children \u2013 girls and boys \u2013 get a chance to actually try to get a normal life. Because some of them are born with this disease. Here are many organizations that work on women's issues. During the negotiations, an organization called the Women's National Coalition worked very hard throughout the country collecting women's views on the country they would like to see. This culminated in women from different political parties becoming part of the political negotiations in South Africa. It also led to the development of the National Gender Policy Framework and the establishment of the (initially) Office of the Status of Women, now the Women's Ministry and the Commission for Gender Equality. The big organization that was formed in 2006 to accommodate women from all political organs and walks of life is the Progressive Women's Movement of South Africa (PWMSA).<ref>http://www.anc.org.za/content/progressive-womens-movement-south-africa-base-document</ref>\n\nOne of the small organizations is Woman's Net, a feminist organization that especially tries to fight for the equality of women in South Africa. Women also organize themselves in political parties, business organizations, academic institutions, trade union and other structures. Another huge issue in South Africa is the trafficking of women and pseudo-cultural practices that allow child marriages. These arranged marriages have destroyed the lives of many girls. This has changed in 2016 with the amendment of the trafficking legislation to include criminalization of the \"ukuthwala\" practice which had been bastardised over time. There are many pieces of legislation that have been introduced to promote the protection of women in the rural settings and those married through traditional customs; to protect women from domestic violence, to protect women from rape and ensure their rights in political, social and economic settings. The challenges remain the publicization of these and the education of all the citizens about the constitution and the progressive legislation.<ref>http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/womens-rights-and-representation</ref>\n\n=== Current events ===\nThere continue to be many efforts made for women to gain more rights and fighting against the violence that persists in society. In September 2019, women took to the streets for three days fighting against the national crisis of violence against women and children. Although President Cyril Ramaphosa assured the women that the laws would be reviewed, they were not satisfied. Some women have asked for the death penalty to be established for those who use violence against women and children. The fight continues to persist in South African society as women continue to be mistreated and violated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/south-africa-faces-national-crisis-of-violence-against-women-says-president|title=South Africa in a crisis of violence against women, says president|last=Francke|first=Robin-Lee|date=2019-09-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-15|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[LGBT rights in South Africa|LGBT Rights in South Africa]]\n*[[Apartheid]]\n*[[Human rights in South Africa|Human Rights in South Africa]]\n*[[Feminism in South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/womens-rights\n*http://www.womensnet.org.za/\n* [[Child marriage#Africa]]\n*http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/341/index.html\n* [[Boer Wars]] \n*http://library.unesco-iicba.org/English/Girls%20Education/All%20Articles/General/Girls%20Education%20Movement%20South%20Africa%20Unicef.pdf \n*http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/black-concentration-camps-during-anglo-boer-war-2-1900-1902\n\n[[Category:Women's rights in South Africa]]\n[[Category:History of women's rights|South Africa]]\n[[Category:History of South Africa by topic|Women's rights]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|{{external links|date=April 2018}}\n{{advert|date=June 2014}}\n{{essay-like|date=June 2014}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2014}}\n{{Orphan|date=August 2014}}\n{{Underlinked|date=October 2014}}}}\n{{Use South African English|date=August 2018}}\n\nFor much of [[South Africa]]'s history, women have been treated as second class citizens.

The struggles of women from 1913-1943 showed that women were affected by colonialism as well. In 1943, the ANC opened its doors for women to join. In 1948, the [[African National Congress Women's League|ANC Women's League]] (ANCWL) was formed and [[Ida Mntwana]] became the first female president of the League. In 1952, many South African black women took part in the [[Defiance Campaign]], which involved purposefully breaking apartheid laws.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Booysen-Wolthers|first=Annelize|last2=Fourie|first2=Frederick C.

There, the Freedom Charter was created and allowed women to express their needs and incorporate their requests. However, in 1955 the pass laws were presented again. Demonstrations were held in protest of these laws. On August 9, 1956, thousands of women marched to the Union Buildings in protest. The march was planned by the [[Federation of South African Women]]. On this day, South African women celebrated the first [[National Women's Day (South Africa)|South African Women's Freedom day]].<ref>{{Cite document|title=What is Women's Month?|last=|first=|date=2015|id = {{ProQuest|1778788820}}}}</ref> The holiday was organized by the ANC to commemorate the protests that began on August 9, 1913, against the identification passes that black people had to carry. The ANC was banned in 1960 and halted the progress and demonstrations women were having. Other regional organizations were formed, since many women went into exile and those who remained were unable to organize anything. Once the ANC was unbanned in 1990, the ANCWL brought all the organizations together to form the National Women\u2019s Coalition in 1991. The Women\u2019s charter was completed in 1994 and the concerns were incorporated into the new Bill of Rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/anc-womens-league-ancwl|title=ANC Women's League (ANCWL) {{!}} South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\n==== Bill of Rights ====\nIt was not until the introduction of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] in 1996 that all women in South Africa were formally recognized as equal citizens. In this Constitution, there was a special paragraph for women, titled \u2018Equality\u2019. In this Bill of Rights, sections 9, 10, 11, 12 specifically refer to women as equals and the basis of how to be treated. Section 9(3) prohibits any form of discrimination with relation to gender, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy, ethnicity or culture. This is followed by sections 10 and 11 which give the right to be treated equally and the right to life. One of the most significant sections is 12, which states the right \u2018to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources.\u2019 As domestic violence has been an issue for all women, this establishes that within the domain of a home or family they are under public policy as well.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Kristina|date=2004|title=Women's Human Rights & the Feminisation of Poverty in South Africa|journal=Review of African Political Economy|volume=31|issue=100|pages=247\u2013261|issn=0305-6244|jstor=4006890|doi=10.1080/0305624042000262275}}</ref>\n\n== Rights of girls in South Africa ==\nNowadays 96% of South African children aged 7\u201313 receive a primary education. However, there was a time when it was unusual to be able to go to school there. Many children struggled to receive an education. The government schools struggle with many challenges including a poor quality of education, low teacher morale, the impact of [[HIV and AIDS]], poor infrastructure, water shortages, food insecurity, poor public health, and few techniques for inclusive education, particularly for children with disabilities. Girls and young women still report high levels of [[sexual abuse]], intimidation, exploitation and murder in their schools. It has been reported that children aged 10\u201314 are most commonly raped and their school teachers are the most common child rapist. Many girls are forced to leave schools either for pregnancies or as a result of the harassment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jewkes|first=Rachel|last2=Levin|first2=Jonathan|last3=Mbananga|first3=Nolwazi|last4=Bradshaw|first4=Debbie|date=2002-01-26|title=Rape of girls in South Africa|journal=The Lancet|volume=359|issue=9303|pages=319\u2013320|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07530-X|pmid=11830201|issn=0140-6736}}</ref> Due to the treatment of young girls in the educational system, women are limited to their social and economic potential.<ref name=\":0\" /> This also causes the increase of the spread of HIV to younger girls and has resulted in unsafe sexual practices later in life. Girls are socialized to become home keepers and child-bearers, so they place less value on their educational. When girls perform well in subjects such as math or science, they are not encouraged and they mostly do not have the confidence to pursue careers that rely on these skills. Many schools are not child or girl friendly. Some are situated far from homes, exposing girls to danger when they walk to and from school. Nearly a million children under the age of 15 have been orphaned as a result of the [[HIV/AIDS epidemic]]. Girls often drop out of school to look after sick family members and younger siblings.\n\nIn 2003, the South African Minister of Education set up the Girls\u2019 Education Movement (GEM). GEM is an African movement, supported by [[UNICEF]], where children and young people in schools and communities in South Africa work to bring positive changes in the lives of African girls and boys. GEM aims to:\n\n* Give girls equal access to education\n* Improve the quality of education, especially in disadvantaged schools\n* Make the school program and school books gender responsive\n* Create schools that are safe and secure for children, especially girls\n* Work with boys as strategic partners\n* Decrease gender-based violence\n* Abolish harmful cultural \n* practices such as early marriage. GEM has had a lot of success in this area and has also helped many schools, making life for a large number of girls a lot better. There are a lot of other organizations that try to get more fair rights for the girls in South Africa.\n\n== During the wars ==\nThe [[Boer Wars]] were two wars fought during 1880\u20131881 and 1899\u20131902 by the [[British Empire]] against two independent Boer republics, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic. ( \u2018Boer\u2019 is the Dutch and African word for farmer.) Boer women, children and men that were not fit enough to work for the British were put together in concentration camps during the Boer War 2. The first two of these camps were established to house the families of cities who had surrendered voluntarily, but very soon, families that were a burden for the British were driven forcibly into camps that were established all over the country, the camps first stayed refugee camps but they later became concentration camps. The horrible conditions in these camps caused the death of 4,177 women, 22,074 children under sixteen and 1,676 men, mainly those too old to be on commando. The white and the black people were put in different camps.\n\n14,154 deaths were officially recorded in the black section of these camps. It is estimated that 25,000 to 34,000 deaths occurred in the Boer camps, with 81% being death of children. These statistics, however, do not include the number of deaths which happened en route to the camps and during the capturing. The initial investigation of these camps started because of the white child mortality. The role of children was very important during this war and the race and class affected the experience of each child. Children were often separated from their families and exposed to harsh conditions and diseases. Their health going into the camps was already deteriorating and significantly declined upon arrival. The conditions were inhumane and families and children were crammed together. Such trauma also involved the separation with parents and not recognizing the faces when they came to return their children home. Black children also were forced to work in Boer camps. Children did earn a little money for work as it was considered contribution to their families. In Bloemfontein, the [[National Women's Monument|National Women\u2019s Monument]] was built in memorial of the conflict and dedicated to the women and children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duff|first=Se|date=2014|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=7|issue=3|pages=355\u2013376|doi=10.1353/hcy.2014.0049|title=\"Capture the children\": Writing Children into the South African War, 1899-1902}}</ref>\n\nAll women and children were put in concentration camps right away, they were treated very badly. The white camps had it much better than the black camps. [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Field-Marshal Lord Roberts]] had another motive to put Blacks into camps, namely to make them work, either to grow crops for the troops or to dig trenches, be wagon drivers or work as miners. They did not receive food, hardly any medical support or shelter and were expected to grow their own crops. The strong-bodied who could work, could exchange labour for food or buy a meal for a cheap price. On January 22, 1901, the Boschhoek concentration camp for Blacks had about 1,700 black hold a protest meeting. They state that when they were brought into the camps, they had been promised that they will be paid for all their stock taken by the British. They are also unhappy because \"... they receive no food while the Boers who are the cause of the war are fed for free in the refugee camps\u2026\u201d While the war lasted, more and more concentration camps were set up for women and children, and more and more deaths were recorded.\n\n== What has been done for the women in South Africa ==\nMany things have been done for women in South Africa. Take for example the commemoration of the Women's March that is held every year. But even things as the Bill of Rights have had great impact on the women in South Africa. Though many things have been done for the women in South Africa, they still are treated lesser than men but also lesser than white women. Even as this has not improved, these things have had a positive effect on how women are treated around that area. In this way think about how little girls can now have an education without having to be afraid of going to school. But not only the direct causes, also think about projects in which things against AIDS are done. By helping to do things against this disease, organizations are making sure that the children \u2013 girls and boys \u2013 get a chance to actually try to get a normal life. Because some of them are born with this disease. Here are many organizations that work on women's issues. During the negotiations, an organization called the Women's National Coalition worked very hard throughout the country collecting women's views on the country they would like to see. This culminated in women from different political parties becoming part of the political negotiations in South Africa. It also led to the development of the National Gender Policy Framework and the establishment of the (initially) Office of the Status of Women, now the Women's Ministry and the Commission for Gender Equality. The big organization that was formed in 2006 to accommodate women from all political organs and walks of life is the Progressive Women's Movement of South Africa (PWMSA).<ref>http://www.anc.org.za/content/progressive-womens-movement-south-africa-base-document</ref>\n\nOne of the small organizations is Woman's Net, a feminist organization that especially tries to fight for the equality of women in South Africa. Women also organize themselves in political parties, business organizations, academic institutions, trade union and other structures. Another huge issue in South Africa is the trafficking of women and pseudo-cultural practices that allow child marriages. These arranged marriages have destroyed the lives of many girls. This has changed in 2016 with the amendment of the trafficking legislation to include criminalization of the \"ukuthwala\" practice which had been bastardised over time. There are many pieces of legislation that have been introduced to promote the protection of women in the rural settings and those married through traditional customs; to protect women from domestic violence, to protect women from rape and ensure their rights in political, social and economic settings. The challenges remain the publicization of these and the education of all the citizens about the constitution and the progressive legislation.<ref>http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/womens-rights-and-representation</ref>\n\n=== Current events ===\nThere continue to be many efforts made for women to gain more rights and fighting against the violence that persists in society. In September 2019, women took to the streets for three days fighting against the national crisis of violence against women and children. Although President Cyril Ramaphosa assured the women that the laws would be reviewed, they were not satisfied. Some women have asked for the death penalty to be established for those who use violence against women and children. The fight continues to persist in South African society as women continue to be mistreated and violated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/south-africa-faces-national-crisis-of-violence-against-women-says-president|title=South Africa in a crisis of violence against women, says president|last=Francke|first=Robin-Lee|date=2019-09-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-15|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[LGBT rights in South Africa|LGBT Rights in South Africa]]\n*[[Apartheid]]\n*[[Human rights in South Africa|Human Rights in South Africa]]\n*[[Feminism in South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/womens-rights\n*http://www.womensnet.org.za/\n* [[Child marriage#Africa]]\n*http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/341/index.html\n* [[Boer Wars]] \n*http://library.unesco-iicba.org/English/Girls%20Education/All%20Articles/General/Girls%20Education%20Movement%20South%20Africa%20Unicef.pdf \n*http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/black-concentration-camps-during-anglo-boer-war-2-1900-1902\n\n[[Category:Women's rights in South Africa]]\n[[Category:History of women's rights|South Africa]]\n[[Category:History of South Africa by topic|Women's rights]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (8)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_women%27s_rights_in_South_Africa"}

(film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' and ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'' (both 1969); for the latter film, [[Goldie Hawn]] received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Matthau played three roles in the film version of Simon's ''[[Plaza Suite (film)|Plaza Suite]]'' (1971) and was in the cast of its followup ''[[California Suite]]'' (1978).<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb name|0000527}}</ref>\n\nMatthau starred in three crime dramas in the mid-1970s, as a detective investigating a mass murder on a bus in ''[[The Laughing Policeman (film)|The Laughing Policeman]]'' (1973), as a bank robber on the run from the Mafia and the law in ''[[Charley Varrick]]'' (also 1973) and as a New York transit cop in the action-adventure ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]]'' (1974). A change of pace about misfits on a [[Little League]] baseball team turned-out to be a solid hit when Matthau starred as coach Morris Buttermaker in the comedy ''[[The Bad News Bears]]'' (1976). Matthau portrayed Herbert Tucker in ''[[I Ought to Be in Pictures (film)|I Ought to Be in Pictures]]'' (1982), with [[Ann-Margret]] and [[Dinah Manoff]].<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s Matthau served on the advisory board of the [[National Student Film Institute]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=National Student Film Institute/L.A: The Sixteenth Annual Los Angeles Student Film Festival|date=June 10, 1994|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|pages=10\u201311|ref=Program}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=Los Angeles Student Film Institute: 13th Annual Student Film Festival|date=June 7, 1991|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|page=3|ref=Program}}</ref>\n\nIn a change of pace, Matthau played [[Albert Einstein]] in the film ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'' (1994), starring [[Tim Robbins]] and [[Meg Ryan]].  Matthau narrated the ''[[Dr. Seuss|Doctor Seuss]] Video Classics: [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' (1992) and played the role of Mr. Wilson in the film ''[[Dennis the Menace (film)|Dennis the Menace]]'' (1993).<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nHis partnership with Jack Lemmon became one of the most successful pairings in Hollywood. They became lifelong friends after making ''The Fortune Cookie'' and would make a total of 10 movies together\u201411 counting ''[[Kotch]]'', in which Lemmon has a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] as a sleeping bus passenger. Apart from their many comedies, the two appeared (although they did not share any scenes) in the [[Oliver Stone]] drama, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991). Matthau and Lemmon reunited for the comedy ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'' (1993), co-starring [[Ann-Margret]], and its sequel, ''[[Grumpier Old Men]]'' (1995), also co-starring [[Sophia Loren]]. This led to further pairings late in their careers, ''[[Out to Sea]]'' (1997) and a Simon-scripted sequel to their much earlier success, ''[[The Odd Couple II]]'' (1998).\n\n''[[Hanging Up]]'' (2000), directed by [[Diane Keaton]], was Matthau's final appearance onscreen.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages===\nMatthau was married twice; first to Grace Geraldine Johnson from 1948 to 1958, and then to [[Carol Grace|Carol Marcus]] from 1959 until his death in 2000. He had two children, Jenny and David, by his first wife, and a son, [[Charles Matthau|Charlie Matthau]], with his second wife. Matthau also helped raise his stepchildren, [[Aram Saroyan]] and [[Lucy Saroyan]].<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\n===Health problems===\nA heavy smoker, Matthau had a heart attack in 1966, the first of at least three in his lifetime. In 1976, ten years after his first heart attack, he underwent heart bypass surgery. After working in freezing Minnesota weather for ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'' (1993), he was hospitalized for double pneumonia. In December 1995 he had a colon tumor removed;  He was also hospitalized in May 1999 for more than two months, owing again to pneumonia.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Walter Matthau grave at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Brentwood, California.JPG|thumb|Matthau's gravesite]]\nIn addition to colon cancer, Matthau had [[Coronary artery disease|atherosclerotic heart disease]] during the last years of his life. In the late evening of June 30, 2000, he had a heart attack at his home and was taken by ambulance to the St. John's Health Center in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] where he died a few hours later at 1:42&nbsp;a.m. on July 1, 2000.

Matthau's wife [[Carol Grace|Carol Marcus]] died in 2003, and her body was interred in the same grave as her husband.\n\n==Tribute==\n[[Jack Lemmon]] along with others of Matthau's friends and relations appeared on ''[[Larry King]] Live'' in an hour of tribute and remembrance; many of those same people appeared on the show one year later, paying tribute to Lemmon himself who died the following year (and whose body was also buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park).\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n===[[Tony Award]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Nominee/work\n!Award\n!Result\n|-\n|1959\n| ''[[Once More, with Feeling!]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play|Best Featured Actor in a Play]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1962\n| ''[[L'Idiote|A Shot in the Dark]]'' \n|{{won}}\n|-\n|1965\n| ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]''\n| [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play|Best Actor in a Play]]\n|{{won}}\n|}\n\n===[[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Nominee/work\n!Award\n!Result\n|-\n|1966\n| ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]''\n| [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|1971\n| ''[[Kotch]]'' \n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1975\n| ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1975 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]''\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n===[[Golden Globe Award]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Nominee/work\n!Award\n!Result\n|-\n|1966\n| ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]''\n|rowspan=\"8\"| [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1968\n| ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'' \n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1971\n| ''[[Kotch]]''\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1972\n| ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]''\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1974\n| ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]''\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1975\n| ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1975 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]''\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|1980\n| ''[[Hopscotch (film)|Hopscotch]]''\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1981\n| ''[[First Monday in October (film)|First Monday in October]]''\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n===Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Nominee/work\n!Award\n!Result\n|-\n|1966\n| ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]''\n| Best Supporting Actor\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|1971\n| ''[[Kotch]]'' \n| Best Actor\n|{{won}}\n|}\n\n===[[Laurel Awards]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Nominee/work\n!Award\n!Result\n|-\n|1966\n| ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]''\n| Top Male Supporting Performance\n|{{won}}\n|}\n\n===[[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Nominee/work\n!Award\n!Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1969\n| ''[[The Secret Life of an American Wife]]''\n|rowspan=\"6\"| [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Film Actor in a Leading Role]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n| ''[[Hello, Dolly!

He was with the same [[453rd Operations Group|453rd Bombardment Group]] as [[James Stewart]]. While based in [[England]] at [[RAF Old Buckenham]], in [[Norfolk]] he flew missions across to continental Europe during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].

He often joked that his best early review came in a play where he posed as a derelict. One reviewer said, \"The others just looked like actors in make-up, Walter Matthau really looks like a [[skid row]] bum!\" Matthau was a respected [[theatre|stage]] actor for years in such fare as ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' and ''[[L'Idiote|A Shot in the Dark]]''. He won the 1962 [[Tony Award]] for Best Featured Actor in a play.<ref name=\"ibdb\"/>\n\n[[File:Walter Matthau in Charade 2.jpg|thumb|left|Matthau in ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', 1963]]\nMatthau appeared in the pilot of ''[[Mister Peepers]]'' (1952) with [[Wally Cox]]. For reasons unknown he used the name Leonard Elliot. His role was of the gym teacher Mr. Wall. He made his [[film|motion picture]] debut as a whip-wielding bad guy in ''[[The Kentuckian (1955 film)|The Kentuckian]]'' (1955) opposite [[Burt Lancaster]]. He played a villain in ''[[King Creole]]'' (1958), in which he gets beaten up by [[Elvis Presley]]. Around the same time, he made ''[[Ride a Crooked Trail]]'' with [[Audie Murphy]], and ''[[Onionhead]]'' (both 1958) starring [[Andy Griffith]]; the latter was a flop. Matthau had a featured role opposite Griffith in the well received drama ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957), directed by [[Elia Kazan]]. Matthau also directed a low-budget movie called ''The Gangster Story'' (1960) and was a sympathetic sheriff in ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]'' (1962), which starred [[Kirk Douglas]]. He appeared opposite [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963).<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nAppearances on [[television]] were common too, including two on ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', four installments of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents|Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', as well as an episode of ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' (\"A Tumble from a Tall White House\", 1963). He appeared eight times between 1962 and 1964 on ''[[The DuPont Show of the Week]]'' and as Franklin Gaer in an episode of ''[[Dr. Kildare (TV series)|Dr. Kildare]]'' (\"Man Is a Rock\", 1964).

He was cast in a number of stark dramas, such as ''[[Fail Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'' (1964), in which he portrayed Pentagon adviser Dr. Groeteschele, who urges an all-out nuclear attack on the [[Soviet Union]] in response to an accidental transmission of an attack signal to U.S. Air Force bombers.

(film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' and ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'' (both 1969); for the latter film, [[Goldie Hawn]] received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Matthau played three roles in the film version of Simon's ''[[Plaza Suite (film)|Plaza Suite]]'' (1971) and was in the cast of its followup ''[[California Suite]]'' (1978).<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb name|0000527}}</ref>\n\nMatthau starred in three crime dramas in the mid-1970s, as a detective investigating a mass murder on a bus in ''[[The Laughing Policeman (film)|The Laughing Policeman]]'' (1973), as a bank robber on the run from the Mafia and the law in ''[[Charley Varrick]]'' (also 1973) and as a New York transit cop in the action-adventure ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]]'' (1974). A change of pace about misfits on a [[Little League]] baseball team turned-out to be a solid hit when Matthau starred as coach Morris Buttermaker in the comedy ''[[The Bad News Bears]]'' (1976). Matthau portrayed Herbert Tucker in ''[[I Ought to Be in Pictures (film)|I Ought to Be in Pictures]]'' (1982), with [[Ann-Margret]] and [[Dinah Manoff]].<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s Matthau served on the advisory board of the [[National Student Film Institute]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=National Student Film Institute/L.A: The Sixteenth Annual Los Angeles Student Film Festival|date=June 10, 1994|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|pages=10\u201311|ref=Program}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=Los Angeles Student Film Institute: 13th Annual Student Film Festival|date=June 7, 1991|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|page=3|ref=Program}}</ref>\n\nIn a change of pace, Matthau played [[Albert Einstein]] in the film ''[[I.Q.

Matthau narrated the ''[[Dr. Seuss|Doctor Seuss]] Video Classics: [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' (1992) and played the role of Mr. Wilson in the film ''[[Dennis the Menace (film)|Dennis the Menace]]'' (1993).<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nHis partnership with Jack Lemmon became one of the most successful pairings in Hollywood. They became lifelong friends after making ''The Fortune Cookie'' and would make a total of 10 movies together\u201411 counting ''[[Kotch]]'', in which Lemmon has a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] as a sleeping bus passenger. Apart from their many comedies, the two appeared (although they did not share any scenes) in the [[Oliver Stone]] drama, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991). Matthau and Lemmon reunited for the comedy ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'' (1993), co-starring [[Ann-Margret]], and its sequel, ''[[Grumpier Old Men]]'' (1995), also co-starring [[Sophia Loren]]. This led to further pairings late in their careers, ''[[Out to Sea]]'' (1997) and a Simon-scripted sequel to their much earlier success, ''[[The Odd Couple II]]'' (1998).\n\n''[[Hanging Up]]'' (2000), directed by [[Diane Keaton]], was Matthau's final appearance onscreen.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages===\nMatthau was married twice; first to Grace Geraldine Johnson from 1948 to 1958, and then to [[Carol Grace|Carol Marcus]] from 1959 until his death in 2000.
