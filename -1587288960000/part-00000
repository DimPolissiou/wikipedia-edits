The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]] who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as touring bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965\u20131971), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967\u20131982), [[Billy Preston]] (1971\u20131981), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978\u20131981), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982\u2013present).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).

They still continue to release albums to brisk sales and critical acclaim; their most recent album ''[[Blue & Lonesome (Rolling Stones album)|Blue & Lonesome]]'' was released in December 2016 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the US and won a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album]].

Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments such as the [[sitar]] and [[slide guitar]] in their early days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-rolling-stones-songs/|title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Songs|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en-US|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725181034/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-rolling-stones-songs/|archivedate=25 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/|title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Multi-Instrumentalist Songs|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en-US|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710161316/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/|archivedate=10 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gn24CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=Brian+Jones+non-traditional+instruments+such+as+the+sitar+and+slide+guitar+in+their+early+days#v=onepage&q=Brian%20Jones%20non-traditional%20instruments%20such%20as%20the%20sitar%20and%20slide%20guitar%20in%20their%20early%20days&f=false|title=Massive Pissed Love: Nonfiction 2001\u20132014|last=Hell|first=Richard|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Soft Skull Press|isbn=9781619026742|pages=23|language=en}}</ref> The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording [[cover song]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/time-is-on-my-side-mt0004159585|title=Time Is on My Side \u2013 The Rolling Stones : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|website=AllMusic|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904024728/http://www.allmusic.com/song/time-is-on-my-side-mt0004159585|archivedate=4 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nJagger and Richards had a shared admiration of [[Jimmy Reed]], Muddy Waters,<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite journal|last=Hellmann|first=John M.|date=1973|title='I'm a Monkey': The Influence of the Black American Blues Argot on the Rolling Stones|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=86|issue=342|pages=367\u2013373|doi=10.2307/539360|jstor=539360}}</ref> and [[Howlin' Wolf]].<ref name=\":18\" /> [[Little Walter]] influenced Brian Jones.

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]] who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as touring bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965\u20131971), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967\u20131982), [[Billy Preston]] (1971\u20131981), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978\u20131981), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982\u2013present).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).

During the 1980s, the band infighting curtailed their output and they only released two more underperforming albums and did not tour for the rest of the decade. Their fortunes changed at the end of the decade, when they released ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989), promoted by a large stadium and arena tour, the [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]]. Since the 1990s, new material has been less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction on the live circuit. By 2007, the band had four of the top five [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time: [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (1994\u20131995), [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] (1997\u20131998), [[Licks Tour]] (2002\u20132003) and [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|A Bigger Bang]] (2005\u20132007).{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=141}} Musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] attributes the endurance of the Rolling Stones to their being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|date=27 December 1981|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|title=The Year of the Rolling Stones|newspaper=New York Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701174542/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|archivedate=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them fourth on the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\" list and their [[List of best-selling music artists|estimated record sales]] is 200&nbsp;million. They have [[The Rolling Stones discography|released]] 30 studio albums, 23 live albums and numerous compilations. ''Let It Bleed'' (1969) marked the first of five consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio and live albums in the UK. ''Sticky Fingers'' (1971) was the first of eight consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio albums in the US. In 2008, the band ranked 10th on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary.

It is located about 25&nbsp;km from state capital, [[Ipoh]] and 20&nbsp;km from royal town of [[Kuala Kangsar]]. Sungai Siput falls under the management of the [[Kuala Kangsar Municipal Council]].\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest settlement in Sungai Siput was situated at Pelang, about 2 kilometres from the current town. The settlement was populated by villagers of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] origins who had earlier settled in Sayong Kuala Kangsar Perak. The settlers were from the family of Malik and the son Tuyub, which family tomb is still visible from the roadside situated in the estate in front of the Rimba Panjang new village. One the descendants was the late Imam Jusuh, one of the first imams of the Alghufraniah Sungai Siput Mosque and the town councillor. Sister Enson was a well-known traditional healer. One of the surviving siblings is Associate Professor Suhaimi Bin Saidin, a lecturer at [[Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah]] in [[Kuala Kangsar]]. With the arrival of British planters and tin miners in the early 1850s the focus of activity moved to the present Sungai Siput town.\n\n[[File:Chin Peng wanted by Malaya.jpg|thumb|]]\nSungai Siput is notable for the incident that triggered the start of the [[Malayan Emergency]]. The Malayan colonial administration declared a [[state of emergency]] on 16 June 1948 after members of the [[Communist Party of Malaya]] killed three European plantation managers at a plantation office twenty miles east of Sungai Siput town. The CPM was subsequently banned in July. Many [[Singapore]]an historians and [[anti-communist]]s allege that [[Chin Peng]] ordered the killings. Chin Peng claims he had no prior knowledge. In fact, he says he was so unprepared for the start of hostility that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and lost touch with the party for a couple of days.<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 215-222.</ref>\n\nLi Weilun, an [[Esperanto]] professor at the [[Beijing Language and Culture University]], was born in Sungai Siput in 1936.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espero.com.cn/2013-07/19/content_29470963.htm |title=Esperanto kaj la vivo en la Pekina Lingva Universitato |last=Fiocchi |first=Pietro |date= 2013-07-19 |website=El Popola \u0108inio |publisher= |access-date= 2017-12-19 |quote=Nia samideano naski\u011dis en 1936 en Malajzio, en la urbo Sungai Sipud. }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| Ethnic groups in Sungai Siput , 2010 census\n|-\n!

It is located about 25&nbsp;km from state capital, [[Ipoh]] and 20&nbsp;km from royal town of [[Kuala Kangsar]]. Sungai Siput falls under the management of the [[Kuala Kangsar Municipal Council]].\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest settlement in Sungai Siput was situated at Pelang, about 2 kilometres from the current town. The settlement was populated by villagers of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] origins who had earlier settled in Sayong Kuala Kangsar Perak. The settlers were from the family of Malik and the son Tuyub, which family tomb is still visible from the roadside situated in the estate in front of the Rimba Panjang new village. One the descendants was the late Imam Jusuh, one of the first imams of the Alghufraniah Sungai Siput Mosque and the town councillor. Sister Enson was a well-known traditional healer. One of the surviving siblings is Associate Professor Suhaimi Bin Saidin, a lecturer at [[Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah]] in [[Kuala Kangsar]]. With the arrival of British planters and tin miners in the early 1850s the focus of activity moved to the present Sungai Siput town.\n\n[[File:Chin Peng wanted by Malaya.jpg|thumb|]]\nSungai Siput is notable for the incident that triggered the start of the [[Malayan Emergency]]. The Malayan colonial administration declared a [[state of emergency]] on 16 June 1948 after members of the [[Communist Party of Malaya]] killed three European plantation managers at a plantation office twenty miles east of Sungai Siput town. The CPM was subsequently banned in July. Many [[Singapore]]an historians and [[anti-communist]]s allege that [[Chin Peng]] ordered the killings. Chin Peng claims he had no prior knowledge. In fact, he says he was so unprepared for the start of hostility that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and lost touch with the party for a couple of days.<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 215-222.</ref>\n\nLi Weilun, an [[Esperanto]] professor at the [[Beijing Language and Culture University]], was born in Sungai Siput in 1936.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espero.com.cn/2013-07/19/content_29470963.htm |title=Esperanto kaj la vivo en la Pekina Lingva Universitato |last=Fiocchi |first=Pietro |date= 2013-07-19 |website=El Popola \u0108inio |publisher= |access-date= 2017-12-19 |quote=Nia samideano naski\u011dis en 1936 en Malajzio, en la urbo Sungai Sipud. }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| Ethnic groups in Sungai Siput , 2010 census\n|-\n!
