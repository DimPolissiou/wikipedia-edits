Britonia was represented by the diocese referred to as ''Britonensis ecclesia'' (Britton church) in sources from the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\nThe bishop has a (main) [[cathedral]] (from Latin \"cathedra\" meaning episcopal seat), a [[Minor Basilica|minor basilica]] and [[World Heritage Site]] (Catedral Bas\u00edlica de la Virgen de la Asunci\u00f3n, dedicated to the [[Assumption of Mary]]) in [[Mondo\u00f1edo]], administrative [[Province of Lugo]], and a [[co-cathedral]] Concatedral de San Juli\u00e1n in [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]], administrative [[Province of A Coru\u00f1a]], as well as a former cathedral which is a minor basilica, Basilica de San Mart\u00edn de Mondo\u00f1edo in [[Foz]], Lugo province.\n\n== History ==\n* 866: Established as '''Diocese of San Marti\u00f1o de Mondo\u00f1edo''' on Galician territories split off from the [[Diocese of Oviedo]] and Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Lugo]]\n* Renamed in 1114 as '''Diocese of San Marti\u00f1o de Mondo\u00f1edo\u2013Dume''', having gained territory from the suppressed [[Diocese of Dume]] (in [[Portugal]])\n* Renamed in 1219 as '''Diocese of Mondo\u00f1edo''' / Mindonien(sis) (Latin), having lost territory to Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Braga]] (Portugal)\n* On 17 October 1954 it gained territory from [[Diocese of Oviedo]], lost territory to Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela]], and exchanged territory with [[Diocese of Lugo]]\n* Renamed on 9 March 1959 as '''Diocese of Mondo\u00f1edo\u2013Ferrol''' / Mindonien(sis)\u2013Ferrolen(sis) (Latin)\n\nSome authorities have sought to fix the date of the foundation of this diocese (under its primitive name of Britonia) earlier than the second half of the 6th century, but the later date seems the more probable when we consider that, at the [[Second Council of Braga]] (572), Mailoc, Bishop of Britonia, was ranked lowest because of the more recent origin of his see. It seems to have been founded by the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suevian]] king, Theodomir, converted to Catholicism by St [[Martin of Dumio]], and to have included in its jurisdiction the churches of the Britones (a territory coinciding with that of Mondo\u00f1edo) and some of those of the [[Asturias]]. In the beginning it was a [[suffragan]] of [[Lugo]], until the Goths placed Lugo under the jurisdiction of [[Braga]]. After Mailoc no mention is found of the bishops of Britonia for a long time, doubtless because the great distance from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] made it impossible for them to assist at the councils. In 633 Metopius, Bishop of Britonia, assisted at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]], presided over by St [[Isidore of Seville]]. Sonna, his successor, was one of the bishops who signed at the [[Seventh Council of Toledo]] (646) and sent a representative to the [[Eighth Council of Toledo]] (16 December 653). When Britonia was invaded and destroyed by the [[Saracens]], the bishop and priests took refuge in Asturias. In 899, during the reign of [[Alfonso III of Asturias]], Theodesimus, Bishop of Britonia, assisted with other prelates at the consecration of the church of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. It may also be noted that, in the repartition of the parishes, the church of San Pedro de Nova was assigned as the residence of the bishops of Britonia and Orense, when they should come to assist at the councils of Oviedo. By that time, however, the See of Britonia had been translated to the town of Mondumetum and the church of St. Martin of Dumio, or Mondo\u00f1edo. The diocese has since been most generally known by this name, although the episcopal residence has again changed. After the time of St. Martin it was transferred to Villamayor de Brea, from which it derived the name of Villabriensis, and afterwards to Ribadeo, but it was nevertheless known as Mindoniense, as a document of the year 1199 bears witness. At first, its patron was St. Martin of Tours, but St. Martin of Dumio was afterwards chosen patron.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10477a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Mondonedo|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe diocese of '''Valabria''', corresponding to the diocese that had its seat at Villamayor de Brea, is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 1004</ref>\n\n== Leadership ==\n\n===Bishops of Britonia (Breto\u00f1a)===\n*[[Mailoc]] ([[Second Council of Braga]], 572)\n*[[Metopius]] ([[Fourth Council of Toledo]], 633)\n*[[Sonna of Britonia|Sonna]] ([[Seventh Council of Toledo]], 646)\n*[[Susa of Britonia|Susa]] ([[Eighth Council of Toledo]], 653)\n*[[Bela of Britonia|Bela]] ([[Third Council of Braga]], 675)\n\n===Bishops of Dumio (Dumium, San Marti\u00f1o)===\n*[[Savaric I (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Savaric I]] (866\u2013877)\n*[[Rudesind I]] (877\u2013907)\n*[[Savaric II (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Savaric II]] (907\u2013924)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\">Manuel Carriedo Tejedo, \"Cronolog\u00eda de los obispos mindonienses del siglo X\", ''El legado cultural de la iglesia mindoniense : Ferrol, 16, 17, 18 de setembro, 1999 : I Congreso do Patrimonio da Diocesis de Mondo\u00f1edo'', pp. 235\u2013253</ref>\n*[[Rudesind II]] (925\u2013950)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Arias N\u00fanez|Arias I N\u00fanez]] (950\u2013955)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*Rudesind II (again) (955\u2013958)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*Arias I N\u00fanez (again) (959\u2013962)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Rodrigo (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Rodrigo]] (965\u2013972)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Teodomiro (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Teodomiro]] (972\u2013977)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Arias Pel\u00e1ez|Arias II Pel\u00e1ez]] (977\u2013984)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Armentario]] (984\u20131011)\n*[[Suario I (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Suario I]] (1015\u20131022)\n*[[Nu\u00f1o I (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Nu\u00f1o I]] (1025\u20131027)\n*[[Adulfo (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Adulfo]] (\u00bf\u2013?)\n*[[Albito]] (1040?)\n*[[Suario II (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Suario II]] (1058\u20131071)\n*[[Saint Gonzalo]] (1071\u20131112)\n*[[Nu\u00f1o Alfonso]] (1112\u20131136)\n\n===Bishops of Vilamaior===\n*Pelayo I (1136\u20131154)\n*Pedro I (1155\u20131167)\n*Jo\u00e1n P\u00e9rez (1170\u20131173)\n*Rabinato (1177\u20131199)\n\n===Bishop of Ribadeo===\n*[[Pelayo de Cebeyra]] (Pelayo II) (1199\u20131218)\n\n===Bishops of Mondo\u00f1edo===\n*[[Mart\u00edn Duniense]] (1219\u20131248)\n*Jo\u00e1n II de Sebasti\u00e1ns (1248\u20131261)\n*Nu\u00f1o II P\u00e9rez (1261\u20131286)\n*\u00c1lvaro G\u00f3mez (1286\u20131297)\n*Rodrigo V\u00e1zquez (1298\u20131318)\n*Gonzalo Osorio (1319\u20131326)\n*Jo\u00e1n III (1327\u20131329)\n*\u00c1lvaro P\u00e9rez de Biezma (1326\u201313431)\n*Vasco (1343\u20131346)\n*Alfonso S\u00e1nchez (1347\u20131366)\n*Francisco I (1367\u20131393)\n*Lope de Mendoza (1393\u20131399)\n*\u00c1lvaro de Isorna (1400\u201314151)\n*Gil Soutelo (1415\u20131425)\n*Gil Rodr\u00edguez de Muros (1429\u20131432)\n*Pedro Henr\u00edquez (1426\u20131445)\n*Pedro Arias Vaamonde (1446\u20131448)\n*Alfonso de Segura (1449\u20131455)\n*[[Alfonso V\u00e1zquez de Acu\u00f1a]] (1455\u20131457, appointed [[Bishop of Ja\u00e9n]])<ref name=CathHierAlfVazAcu>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bvazda.html \"Bishop Alfonso V\u00e1zquez de Acu\u00f1a\"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''.

Britonia was represented by the diocese referred to as ''Britonensis ecclesia'' (Britton church) in sources from the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\nThe bishop has a (main) [[cathedral]] (from Latin \"cathedra\" meaning episcopal seat), a [[Minor Basilica|minor basilica]] and [[World Heritage Site]] (Catedral Bas\u00edlica de la Virgen de la Asunci\u00f3n, dedicated to the [[Assumption of Mary]]) in [[Mondo\u00f1edo]], administrative [[Province of Lugo]], and a [[co-cathedral]] Concatedral de San Juli\u00e1n in [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]], administrative [[Province of A Coru\u00f1a]], as well as a former cathedral which is a minor basilica, Basilica de San Mart\u00edn de Mondo\u00f1edo in [[Foz]], Lugo province.  \n\n== History ==\n* 866: Established as '''Diocese of San Marti\u00f1o de Mondo\u00f1edo''' on Galician territories split off from the [[Diocese of Oviedo]] and Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Lugo]]\n* Renamed in 1114 as '''Diocese of San Marti\u00f1o de Mondo\u00f1edo\u2013Dume''', having gained territory from the suppressed [[Diocese of Dume]] (in [[Portugal]])\n* Renamed in 1219 as '''Diocese of Mondo\u00f1edo''' / Mindonien(sis) (Latin), having lost territory to Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Braga]] (Portugal)\n* On 17 October 1954 it gained territory from [[Diocese of Oviedo]], lost territory to Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela]], and exchanged territory with [[Diocese of Lugo]]\n* Renamed on 9 March 1959 as '''Diocese of Mondo\u00f1edo\u2013Ferrol''' / Mindonien(sis)\u2013Ferrolen(sis) (Latin)\n\nSome authorities have sought to fix the date of the foundation of this diocese (under its primitive name of Britonia) earlier than the second half of the 6th century, but the later date seems the more probable when we consider that, at the [[Second Council of Braga]] (572), Mailoc, Bishop of Britonia, was ranked lowest because of the more recent origin of his see. It seems to have been founded by the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suevian]] king, Theodomir, converted to Catholicism by St [[Martin of Dumio]], and to have included in its jurisdiction the churches of the Britones (a territory coinciding with that of Mondo\u00f1edo) and some of those of the [[Asturias]]. In the beginning it was a [[suffragan]] of [[Lugo]], until the Goths placed Lugo under the jurisdiction of [[Braga]]. After Mailoc no mention is found of the bishops of Britonia for a long time, doubtless because the great distance from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] made it impossible for them to assist at the councils. In 633 Metopius, Bishop of Britonia, assisted at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]], presided over by St [[Isidore of Seville]]. Sonna, his successor, was one of the bishops who signed at the [[Seventh Council of Toledo]] (646) and sent a representative to the [[Eighth Council of Toledo]] (16 December 653). When Britonia was invaded and destroyed by the [[Saracens]], the bishop and priests took refuge in Asturias. In 899, during the reign of [[Alfonso III of Asturias]], Theodesimus, Bishop of Britonia, assisted with other prelates at the consecration of the church of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. It may also be noted that, in the repartition of the parishes, the church of San Pedro de Nova was assigned as the residence of the bishops of Britonia and Orense, when they should come to assist at the councils of Oviedo. By that time, however, the See of Britonia had been translated to the town of Mondumetum and the church of St. Martin of Dumio, or Mondo\u00f1edo. The diocese has since been most generally known by this name, although the episcopal residence has again changed. After the time of St. Martin it was transferred to Villamayor de Brea, from which it derived the name of Villabriensis, and afterwards to Ribadeo, but it was nevertheless known as Mindoniense, as a document of the year 1199 bears witness. At first, its patron was St. Martin of Tours, but St. Martin of Dumio was afterwards chosen patron.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10477a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Mondonedo|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe diocese of '''Valabria''', corresponding to the diocese that had its seat at Villamayor de Brea, is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 1004</ref>\n\n== Leadership ==\n\n===Bishops of Britonia (Breto\u00f1a)===\n*[[Mailoc]] ([[Second Council of Braga]], 572)\n*[[Metopius]] ([[Fourth Council of Toledo]], 633)\n*[[Sonna of Britonia|Sonna]] ([[Seventh Council of Toledo]], 646)\n*[[Susa of Britonia|Susa]] ([[Eighth Council of Toledo]], 653)\n*[[Bela of Britonia|Bela]] ([[Third Council of Braga]], 675)\n\n===Bishops of Dumio (Dumium, San Marti\u00f1o)===\n*[[Savaric I (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Savaric I]] (866\u2013877)\n*[[Rudesind I]] (877\u2013907)\n*[[Savaric II (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Savaric II]] (907\u2013924)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\">Manuel Carriedo Tejedo, \"Cronolog\u00eda de los obispos mindonienses del siglo X\", ''El legado cultural de la iglesia mindoniense : Ferrol, 16, 17, 18 de setembro, 1999 : I Congreso do Patrimonio da Diocesis de Mondo\u00f1edo'', pp. 235\u2013253</ref>\n*[[Rudesind II]] (925\u2013950)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Arias N\u00fanez|Arias I N\u00fanez]] (950\u2013955)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*Rudesind II (again) (955\u2013958)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*Arias I N\u00fanez (again) (959\u2013962)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Rodrigo (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Rodrigo]] (965\u2013972)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Teodomiro (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Teodomiro]] (972\u2013977)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Arias Pel\u00e1ez|Arias II Pel\u00e1ez]] (977\u2013984)<ref name=\"Carriedo Tejedo\" />\n*[[Armentario]] (984\u20131011)\n*[[Suario I (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Suario I]] (1015\u20131022)\n*[[Nu\u00f1o I (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Nu\u00f1o I]] (1025\u20131027)\n*[[Adulfo (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Adulfo]] (\u00bf\u2013?)\n*[[Albito]] (1040?)\n*[[Suario II (Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo)|Suario II]] (1058\u20131071)\n*[[Saint Gonzalo]] (1071\u20131112)\n*[[Nu\u00f1o Alfonso]] (1112\u20131136)\n\n===Bishops of Vilamaior===\n*Pelayo I (1136\u20131154)\n*Pedro I (1155\u20131167)\n*Jo\u00e1n P\u00e9rez (1170\u20131173)\n*Rabinato (1177\u20131199)\n\n===Bishop of Ribadeo===\n*[[Pelayo de Cebeyra]] (Pelayo II) (1199\u20131218)\n\n===Bishops of Mondo\u00f1edo===\n*[[Mart\u00edn Duniense]] (1219\u20131248)\n*Jo\u00e1n II de Sebasti\u00e1ns (1248\u20131261)\n*Nu\u00f1o II P\u00e9rez (1261\u20131286)\n*\u00c1lvaro G\u00f3mez (1286\u20131297)\n*Rodrigo V\u00e1zquez (1298\u20131318)\n*Gonzalo Osorio (1319\u20131326)\n*Jo\u00e1n III (1327\u20131329)\n*\u00c1lvaro P\u00e9rez de Biezma (1326\u201313431)\n*Vasco (1343\u20131346)\n*Alfonso S\u00e1nchez (1347\u20131366)\n*Francisco I (1367\u20131393)\n*Lope de Mendoza (1393\u20131399)\n*\u00c1lvaro de Isorna (1400\u201314151)\n*Gil Soutelo (1415\u20131425)\n*Gil Rodr\u00edguez de Muros (1429\u20131432)\n*Pedro Henr\u00edquez (1426\u20131445)\n*Pedro Arias Vaamonde (1446\u20131448)\n*Alfonso de Segura (1449\u20131455)\n*[[Alfonso V\u00e1zquez de Acu\u00f1a]] (1455\u20131457, appointed [[Bishop of Ja\u00e9n]])<ref name=CathHierAlfVazAcu>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bvazda.html \"Bishop Alfonso V\u00e1zquez de Acu\u00f1a\"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''.

Permafrost is formed from ice holding all different sorts of soil, sand, and rock combination together (NASA ClimateKids).\n\n==History==\n\"In contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north America prior to [[World War II]], a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in Russian. Beginning in 1942, [[Siemon William Muller]] delved into the relevant Russian literature held by the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[United States Geological Survey Library|U.S. Geological Survey Library]] so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943\",<ref name=Arctic>{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=H.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.\n\nBy definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.Thawing is the process of ice, snow, or another frozen substance becoming liquid or soft as a result of warming up whereas melting is when a substance becomes liquefied by heat. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.\n\nAs a consequence, precipitation has increased, which in turn results in the weakening and eventual collapse of buildings in areas such as Norilsk in northern Russia, which lies upon the permafrost.<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\" style=\"font-size:100%; line-height:130%\">\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 009.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 010.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 001.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 015.jpg|Permafrost and ice in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2012\nFile:Permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay Canada near Greenland.jpg|Permafrost thaw ponds on peatland in [[Hudson Bay]], Canada in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Permafrost and Peatland Evolution in the Northern Hudson Bay Lowland, Manitoba|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3332|authors=Larry D.

Permafrost does not have to be the first layer that is on the ground. It can be an inch to over miles deep into the Earth\u2019s surface. Some of the most common permafrost locations are located in the Northern Hemisphere. 85% of Alaska, Greenland Canada and Siberia is sitting on top of a layer of permafrost, that is almost a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be located in the Southern Hemisphere, just on mountain tops. Permafrost frequently occurs in ground ice, but it also can be presented in non-porous bedrock. Permafrost is formed from ice holding all different sorts of soil, sand, and rock combination together (NASA ClimateKids).\n\n==History==\n\"In contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north America prior to [[World War II]], a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in Russian.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.\n\nBy definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.Thawing is the process of ice, snow, or another frozen substance becoming liquid or soft as a result of warming up whereas melting is when a substance becomes liquefied by heat. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.\n\nAs a consequence, precipitation has increased, which in turn results in the weakening and eventual collapse of buildings in areas such as Norilsk in northern Russia, which lies upon the permafrost.<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\" style=\"font-size:100%; line-height:130%\">\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 009.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 010.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 001.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 015.jpg|Permafrost and ice in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2012\nFile:Permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay Canada near Greenland.jpg|Permafrost thaw ponds on peatland in [[Hudson Bay]], Canada in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Permafrost and Peatland Evolution in the Northern Hudson Bay Lowland, Manitoba|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3332|authors=Larry D.

Therefore, subsea permafrost exists in conditions that lead to its diminishment.

It convenes International Permafrost Conferences, undertakes special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinates international field programmes and networks. Among other issues addressed by the IPA are: Problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost, e.g. the preservation of organisms frozen ''in situ''.\n\n===Construction on permafrost===\nBuilding on permafrost is difficult because the heat of the building (or [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]) can thaw the permafrost and destabilize the structure.

These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with [[latitude]]. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale [[atmospheric circulation]]s: the Hadley Cell, the Ferrel Cell, the Polar Cell, and the [[jet stream]].  Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow.  Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year.  On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F to 100&nbsp;\u00b0F) annually.  Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's [[orbit]] can affect the amount and distribution of [[solar energy]] received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]].\n\nSurface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.  Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant.  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location.  The Earth's weather system is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]]; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.  Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.\n\nStudying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.  A famous landmark in the [[Solar System]], [[Jupiter]]'s [[Great Red Spot]], is an [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.  However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies.  A [[stellar corona|star's corona]] is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System.  The movement of mass ejected from the [[Sun]] is known as the [[solar wind]].\n\n==Causes==\n[[Image:Stormclouds.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Stratocumulus cloud|Cumulus mediocris]] cloud surrounded by [[stratocumulus]]]]\nOn [[Earth]], the common [[List of meteorological phenomena|weather phenomena]] include wind, [[cloud]], rain, snow, [[fog]] and [[dust storm]]s.

These differences can occur due to the [[sun]] angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics.

Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy [[rain]], [[snow]] and the [[wind chill]], forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead to survive through them.\n\nTropical weather forecasting is different from that at higher latitudes. The sun shines more directly on the tropics than on higher latitudes (at least in the average over a year), which makes the tropics warm (Stevens 2011). And, the vertical direction (up, as one stands on the Earth's surface) is perpendicular to the Earth's axis of rotation at the equator, while the axis of rotation and the vertical are the same at the pole; this causes the Earth's rotation to influence the atmospheric circulation more strongly at high latitudes than low. Because of these two factors, clouds and rain storms in the tropics can occur more spontaneously compared to those at higher latitudes, where they are more tightly controlled by larger-scale forces in the atmosphere. Because of these differences, clouds and rain are more difficult to forecast in the tropics than at higher latitudes. On the other hand, temperature is easily forecast in the tropics, because it doesn't change much.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/tropical-weather-84224797/|title=Tropical Weather {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref>\n\n==Modification==\nThe aspiration to [[Weather modification|control the weather]] is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military [[Operation Popeye]], an attempt to disrupt [[Military supply chain management|supply lines]] by lengthening the North Vietnamese [[monsoon]].

These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with [[latitude]]. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale [[atmospheric circulation]]s: the Hadley Cell, the Ferrel Cell, the Polar Cell, and the [[jet stream]].  Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow.  Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year.  On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F to 100&nbsp;\u00b0F) annually.  Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's [[orbit]] can affect the amount and distribution of [[solar energy]] received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]].\n\nSurface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.  Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant.  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location.  The Earth's weather system is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]]; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.  Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.\n\nStudying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.  A famous landmark in the [[Solar System]], [[Jupiter]]'s [[Great Red Spot]], is an [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.  However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies.  A [[stellar corona|star's corona]] is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System.  The movement of mass ejected from the [[Sun]] is known as the [[solar wind]].\n\n==Causes==\n[[Image:Stormclouds.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Stratocumulus cloud|Cumulus mediocris]] cloud surrounded by [[stratocumulus]]]]\nOn [[Earth]], the common [[List of meteorological phenomena|weather phenomena]] include wind, [[cloud]], rain, snow, [[fog]] and [[dust storm]]s.

Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy [[rain]], [[snow]] and the [[wind chill]], forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead to survive through them.\n\nTropical weather forecasting is different from that at higher latitudes. The sun shines more directly on the tropics than on higher latitudes (at least in the average over a year), which makes the tropics warm (Stevens 2011). And, the vertical direction (up, as one stands on the Earth's surface) is perpendicular to the Earth's axis of rotation at the equator, while the axis of rotation and the vertical are the same at the pole; this causes the Earth's rotation to influence the atmospheric circulation more strongly at high latitudes than low. Because of these two factors, clouds and rain storms in the tropics can occur more spontaneously compared to those at higher latitudes, where they are more tightly controlled by larger-scale forces in the atmosphere. Because of these differences, clouds and rain are more difficult to forecast in the tropics than at higher latitudes. On the other hand, temperature is easily forecast in the tropics, because it doesn't change much.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/tropical-weather-84224797/|title=Tropical Weather {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref>\n\n==Modification==\nThe aspiration to [[Weather modification|control the weather]] is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military [[Operation Popeye]], an attempt to disrupt [[Military supply chain management|supply lines]] by lengthening the North Vietnamese [[monsoon]].

Her design process involved appropriating an original advertising graphic to suit her idea; for example, she would tear, rip, or crumble the image, then re-photograph it. She often used grocery store signage, texts from scripture, newspaper clippings, song lyrics, and writings from literary greats such as [[Gertrude Stein]], [[E. E. Cummings]], and [[Albert Camus]] as the textual focal point of her work.<ref>Axell, Evelyne, and Angela Stief. \"Sister Corita.\" Power up - Female Pop Art: Evelyne Axell, Sister Corita, Christa Dichgans, Rosalyn Drexler, Jann Haworth, Dorothy Iannone, Kiki Kogelnik, Marisol, Niki De Saint Phalle; Kunsthalle Wien, 5.

Corita Kent, inspired by the works of [[Andy Warhol]], began using [[popular culture]] as raw material for her work in 1962.<ref name=\":3\" /> Her screen prints often incorporated the archetypical product of brands of American [[consumerism]] alongside spiritual texts. Her design process involved appropriating an original advertising graphic to suit her idea; for example, she would tear, rip, or crumble the image, then re-photograph it. She often used grocery store signage, texts from scripture, newspaper clippings, song lyrics, and writings from literary greats such as [[Gertrude Stein]], [[E. E. Cummings]], and [[Albert Camus]] as the textual focal point of her work.<ref>Axell, Evelyne, and Angela Stief. \"Sister Corita.\" Power up - Female Pop Art: Evelyne Axell, Sister Corita, Christa Dichgans, Rosalyn Drexler, Jann Haworth, Dorothy Iannone, Kiki Kogelnik, Marisol, Niki De Saint Phalle; Kunsthalle Wien, 5.

Hanna promptly deleted the 2011 tweet and tweeted an apology, saying at the age of 20 she thought it was funny and that she's \"sorry to anyone who was hurt by this, i think it's gross, too\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/GabbieHanna/status/1211458432844222464?s=19|title=Gabbie Hanna adresses pedophilia joke|last=Gabbie Hanna|first=@gabbiehanna|date=December 29, 2019|website=[[Twitter]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref> Hanna later added on her podcast that multiple old tweets that people were digging up against her were [[Bo Burnham]] quotes and at the time, certain jokes were considered comical that would not be in the present day.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_PIAZe4XU|title=Our Thoughts on NikkieTutorials Coming Out|work=Box of Thoughts Podcast|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====2020: Bianca Devins====\nOn January 23rd 2020, Hanna uploaded a video titled 'Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl' in which she is shown performing a Google search for \"what is an egirl\" and, after clicking on the second link titled \"E-girl definition: What is an e-girl? - Vox\", information about the [[Murder of Bianca Devins]] was brielfy displayed from one paragraph of the Vox article.  Hanna performed the Google search to research how she needed to dress and apply makeup to transform herself into a TikTok e-girl.  In the video Hanna didn't acknowledge or attempt to remove the information about the murder, instead focusing on the image accompanying the article, which was an e-girl themed photo of Bianca. She received backlash from viewers, some of whom left comments on the video accusing her of \"using a murder victim as an aesthetic\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMjvWz7CgDg|language=en|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> On February 13, 2020, Hanna posted a video in which she read the apology that she sent to Bianca's mother. Hanna explained that as she scrolled and skimmed through the e-girl article looking for inspiration photos for her 'Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl' YouTube video, she stopped at a photo of Bianca and completely missed the body of text next to photo. Hanna said she would never have included the image in her video if she had known its context within the article.  Hanna also read and showed the messages from the conversation she had with Bianca's mother following the apology.  Bianca's mother said she appreciated Hanna's apology and the fact that she reached out to her personally.  Hanna said that she wanted to speak with the mother and ask for her permission before making a public apology, and when asked Bianca's mother replied, \"It's up to you.  Sometimes letting it settle down is better.  But if you want to be public about it you can.  I really wasn't offended by the video.\"  When Hanna asked her feelings about mentioning that they spoke and that there is an upcoming memorial gala, she replied, \"Absolutely. Like I said, it didn't offend me. You can tell people I said that.\"  This YouTube video, titled \"For Bianca.\", includes a link to the Bianca Michelle Devins Memorial Scholarship Fund, and Hanna stated that the ad revenue from this video contributes to that fund.<ref>{{Citation|title=For Bianca.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX-g_MZdW9c|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n===Film, television and web series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Film / Show / Web\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2014\n| ''[[Access Hollywood]]''\n| Herself\n| 1 episode\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2014\u201315\n| ''[[Thomas Sanders (entertainer)|Sanders Shorts]]''\n| Friend, girlfriend\n| 2 episodes\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\" |2015\n| ''Anxt''\n| Herself\n| Full series\n|-\n| ''Teens Wanna Know''\n| Herself\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| ''Dance Showdown''\n| Herself\n| Dancer; won the competition\n|-\n| ''Occupy Alice''\n| Melissa Krass\n| Short film\n|-\n| ''Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures''\n| Snow Pea\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| ''Janoskians: Untold and Untrue''\n| Herself\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 2016\n| ''[[Laid in America]]''\n| Lindsey\n|\n|-\n| ''Dance Showdown''\n| Herself\n| Judge (6 episodes)\n|-\n| AwesomenessTV's ''Betch!''\n| Laura\n| 1 episode\n|-\n|[[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] advertisement\n| Herself\n|Commercial\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\" | 2017\n| ''[[Escape the Night]]''\n| The Vaudevillian\n| 7 episodes (season 2)\n|-\n| ''Fantasies''\n| Herself\n| Guest star (1 episode)\n|-\n| ''[[MTV Video Music Awards]]''\n| Herself\n| Backstage host\n|-\n| Smosh's ''You Posted That?''\n| Herself\n| Contestant (1 episode)\n|-\n| Romeo Lacoste's ''Tattoo Roulette''\n| Herself\n| Special assistant to the host (1 episode)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2017\u201318\n| [[MTV|MTV's]] ''[[Total Request Live]]''\n| Herself\n| Rotating co-host\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 2018\n| ''[[Escape the Night]]''\n| The Vaudevillian\n| Season 3 season finale (flashback clip)\n|-\n| [[Shane Dawson|Shane Dawson's]] ''The Truth About TanaCon''\n| Herself\n| Miniseries.

Hanna promptly deleted the 2011 tweet and tweeted an apology, saying at the age of 20 she thought it was funny and that she's \"sorry to anyone who was hurt by this, i think it's gross, too\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/GabbieHanna/status/1211458432844222464?s=19|title=Gabbie Hanna adresses pedophilia joke|last=Gabbie Hanna|first=@gabbiehanna|date=December 29, 2019|website=[[Twitter]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref> Hanna later added on her podcast that multiple old tweets that people were digging up against her were [[Bo Burnham]] quotes and at the time, certain jokes were considered comical that would not be in the present day.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_PIAZe4XU|title=Our Thoughts on NikkieTutorials Coming Out|work=Box of Thoughts Podcast|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====2020: Bianca Devins====\nOn January 23rd 2020, Hanna uploaded a video titled 'Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl' in which she is shown performing a Google search for \"what is an egirl\" and, after clicking on the second link titled \"E-girl definition: What is an e-girl? - Vox\", information about the [[Murder of Bianca Devins]] was brielfy displayed from one paragraph of the Vox article.  Hanna performed the Google search to research how she needed to dress and apply makeup to transform herself into a TikTok e-girl.  In the video Hanna didn't acknowledge or attempt to remove the information about the murder, instead focusing on the image accompanying the article, which was an e-girl themed photo of Bianca. She received backlash from viewers, some of whom left comments on the video accusing her of \"using a murder victim as an aesthetic\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMjvWz7CgDg|language=en|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> On February 13, 2020, Hanna posted a video in which she read the apology that she sent to Bianca's mother. Hanna explained that as she scrolled and skimmed through the e-girl article looking for inspiration photos for her 'Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl' YouTube video, she stopped at a photo of Bianca and completely missed the body of text next to photo. Hanna said she would never have included the image in her video if she had known its context within the article.  Hanna also read and showed the messages from the conversation she had with Bianca's mother following the apology.  Bianca's mother said she appreciated Hanna's apology and the fact that she reached out to her personally.  Hanna said that she wanted to speak with the mother and ask for her permission before making a public apology, and when asked Bianca's mother replied, \"It's up to you.  Sometimes letting it settle down is better.  But if you want to be public about it you can.  I really wasn't offended by the video.\"  When Hanna asked her feelings about mentioning that they spoke and that there is an upcoming memorial gala, she replied, \"Absolutely. Like I said, it didn't offend me. You can tell people I said that.\"  This YouTube video, titled \"For Bianca.\", includes a link to the Bianca Michelle Devins Memorial Scholarship Fund, and Hanna stated that the ad revenue from this video contributes to that fund.<ref>{{Citation|title=For Bianca.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX-g_MZdW9c|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n===Film, television and web series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Film / Show / Web\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2014\n| ''[[Access Hollywood]]''\n| Herself\n| 1 episode\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2014\u201315\n| ''[[Thomas Sanders (entertainer)|Sanders Shorts]]''\n| Friend, girlfriend\n| 2 episodes\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\" |2015\n| ''Anxt''\n| Herself\n| Full series\n|-\n| ''Teens Wanna Know''\n| Herself\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| ''Dance Showdown''\n| Herself\n| Dancer; won the competition\n|-\n| ''Occupy Alice''\n| Melissa Krass\n| Short film\n|-\n| ''Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures''\n| Snow Pea\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| ''Janoskians: Untold and Untrue''\n| Herself\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 2016\n| ''[[Laid in America]]''\n| Lindsey\n|\n|-\n| ''Dance Showdown''\n| Herself\n| Judge (6 episodes)\n|-\n| AwesomenessTV's ''Betch!''\n| Laura\n| 1 episode\n|-\n|[[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] advertisement\n| Herself\n|Commercial\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\" | 2017\n| ''[[Escape the Night]]''\n| The Vaudevillian\n| 7 episodes (season 2)\n|-\n| ''Fantasies''\n| Herself\n| Guest star (1 episode)\n|-\n| ''[[MTV Video Music Awards]]''\n| Herself\n| Backstage host\n|-\n| Smosh's ''You Posted That?''\n| Herself\n| Contestant (1 episode)\n|-\n| Romeo Lacoste's ''Tattoo Roulette''\n| Herself\n| Special assistant to the host (1 episode)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2017\u201318\n| [[MTV|MTV's]] ''[[Total Request Live]]''\n| Herself\n| Rotating co-host\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 2018\n| ''[[Escape the Night]]''\n| The Vaudevillian\n| Season 3 season finale (flashback clip)\n|-\n| [[Shane Dawson|Shane Dawson's]] ''The Truth About TanaCon''\n| Herself\n| Miniseries.

At last, it is soaked in molasses and then in fried-rice powder.\n*N\u00e0 Gi\u00e0ng kh\u1ea3u sli: the glutinous cake with peanuts made in N\u00e0 Gi\u00e0ng, Ph\u00f9 Ng\u1ecdc commune, H\u00e0 Qu\u1ea3ng district, [[Cao B\u1eb1ng Province]].\n*P\u1ebbng h\u00f3: glutinous rice cake with pork and mung bean.\n*Co\u00f3ng ph\u00f9\n*P\u1ebbng kh\u1ea1 (God's cake) for New Year festival.\n*Kh\u1ea3u nua n\u00e0ng t\u00f4: glutinous rice with grub for New Rice Festival on the moonday of 8th lunar month.\n*P\u1ebbng ph\u1ea1: for L\u1ed3ng T\u1ed3ng Festival.\n*\u00c1p chao\n*P\u1ebbng ch\u00ec\n*Kh\u1ea3u slec\n*P\u1ebbng khua (smiling cake)\n*Co\u00f3c m\u00f2\n*\u1eecng s\u1ec7ch ph\u00e0n\n*\u0110\u0103m \u0111eng\n*Kh\u1ea3u lang\n*P\u1ebbng to\u00f3c: for New Year Festival\n*P\u1ebbng cao\n*M\u00e1c l\u1ecbch: [[Castanea mollissima|Tr\u00f9ng Kh\u00e1nh chestnut]]\n*Ch\u00e9 kh\u00f4m: Cao B\u1eb1ng bitter tea: ''[[Ilex kaushue]]'' (synonym: ''Ilex kudingcha'')\n*Khau r\u1ea3: ''[[Ampelopsis cantoniensis]]''\n\n=== Herbs ===\n\n*M\u00e1c m\u1eadt: ''[[Clausena excavata]]''\n\n== Music ==\n*[[T\u00ednh then]]: is a [[string instrument]] with two or three strings.\n\n== Tay-ized Vietnamese among the Tay ==\nA part of the modern-day Tay population encompasses Tay-ized Vietnamese who live mainly in what is now [[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Province|Lang Son]]. These Tay-ized Vietnamese have their origins traced back to the Vietnamese living further south in the deltas of the Ca, Ma, and Red Rivers, e.g. [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province|Nghe An]], [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province|Nam Dinh]], etc. dispatched to the Sino-Annamese border by Annamese imperial governments to serve as governmental officials and local leaders (''phi\u00ean th\u1ea7n th\u1ed5 ty'').<ref name=\"asd\">Nguy\u1ec5n Quang Huynh (2011), ''Th\u1ed5 ty L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n trong l\u1ecbch s\u1eed'', V\u0103n h\u00f3a d\u00e2n t\u1ed9c publisher, p. 10.</ref> These people were then forbidden to return to their home areas.<ref name=\"asd\" /> Eventually they got assimilated into the indigenous Tay surrounding population. Their common surnames include ''Vi'', ''Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh'', ''Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u1eafc'', ''Nguy\u1ec5n C\u00f4ng'', ''Ho\u00e0ng \u0110\u1ee9c'', ''Ho\u00e0ng \u0110\u00ecnh'', etc. This practice started in the 15th century and ended in the early 20th century.
