Feldman]], and [[Adam Schroeder]], and written by Niccol. The film stars [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank, adopted and raised by a corporation inside a [[simulated reality|simulated]] television show revolving around his life, until he discovers it and decides to escape.  Additional roles are performed by [[Laura Linney]], [[Noah Emmerich]], [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Holland Taylor]], [[Ed Harris]], and [[Brian Delate]].\n\n''The Truman Show'' was originally a [[spec script]] by Niccol, inspired by an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' called \"[[Special Service]]\".<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904060604576574592522839126 | title=Films Inspired by Rod Serling's \"The Twilight Zone\" \u2013 Snapshot | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=September 23, 2011 | accessdate=July 14, 2012 | author=Steinberg, Don}}</ref> Unlike the finished product, it was more of a [[science-fiction]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in [[New York City]]. [[Scott Rudin]] purchased the script, and set up production at [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Brian De Palma]] was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million\u2014$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at [[Seaside, Florida]], a master-[[planned community]] located in the [[Florida Panhandle]].\n\nThe film was a financial success, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the [[71st Academy Awards]], [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], [[52nd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[The Saturn Award]]s. ''The Truman Show'' has been analyzed as a [[thesis]] on [[Christianity]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[simulated reality]], [[existentialism]], and [[reality television]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTruman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of ''The Truman Show'', a [[reality television]] program broadcast live around the clock worldwide. He has spent his entire life in the seaside town of Seahaven Island, which in reality is an enormous set near [[Hollywood]], equipped with state of the art technology to simulate day and night and weather conditions, as well as 5000 cameras to record Truman's every move. The producers discourage Truman from leaving Seahaven by instilling him with [[aquaphobia]] through the \"death\" of his TV father in a boating \"accident\", and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling. All of Seahaven's other residents are actors. Christof, the show's creator and executive producer, seeks to capture Truman'skadjcapsicjSPCJA'SPOJCAPSOJCPAOSJAS;M;S real emotion and human behaviour and give audiences a relatable everyman.\n\nDespite Christof's control, he could not predict all of Truman\u2019s actions. During his college years, Truman was intended to fall in love with and marry co-student Meryl, but fell for Sylvia, an [[Extra (acting)|extra]]. Sylvia said to me and you him that his reality is fake before being removed from the show, where Truman is told she moved to [[Fiji]] with her father. While Truman went on to marry Meryl, he continues to think about Sylvia. He uses scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret, and seeks travel to Fiji. Outside of the show, Sylvia has become part of a \"Free Truman\" campaign that demands the end of the show and Truman's freedom and accuses Christof of making his life worse, which Christof denies.\n\nAs the show goes on, Truman starts noticing unusual events: a spotlight falling out of the sky, a radio frequency that precisely describes his movements, and rain that falls only on him. Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back onto the set, but other actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure him, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress; during an argument with Truman, she [[breaking character|breaks character]] and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof re-introduces Truman's father to the show properly, under the guise of having [[amnesia|lost his memory]] after the boating accident. This helps the show regain the ratings lead with audiences and Truman seems to return to his routines, except he begins sleeping in his basement.\n\nOne evening, the production staff discovers that the sleeping Truman is completely out of their sight. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, finding that he has left a snowman dummy and a tape recorder playing snoring sounds in his place, and has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, revealing that Truman is gone, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history, while a citywide search for Truman is launched. Audiences around the world, including the media, are drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat, after an attempt to fetch Truman fails. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but, while Christof\u2019s bosses and assistants demand that he ends the show, Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.\n\nTruman continues to sail until, to his despair, his boat strikes the wall of the dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is I am the most indereble persom in the world man\n\"no more truth\" in the real world and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: \"In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night,\" (previously his catch-phrase), takes a bow, and exits. The viewers cheer Truman on, while Sylvia races to greet him. A defeated Christof's supervisors end the program for the last time and the viewers check their television guides to see what else is on television.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank: Chosen out of six unwanted pregnancies to be the first child legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has a job in the insurance business and a wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. [[Robin Williams]] was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' because Carrey's performance reminded him of [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name=\"pro\" /> Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in comedic roles.<ref>{{cite news | author = Weinraub, Bernard | title = Director Tries a Fantasy As He Questions Reality | work = The New York Times | date = May 21, 1998 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E0D71539F932A15756C0A96E958260 | accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do ''The Truman Show'' for $12 million.<ref name=\"12mil\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/new-truman-villain-harris-1117435072/|title=New ''Truman'' villain: Harris|date=April 7, 1997|work=Variety|author=Busch, Anita M.|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref> Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's [[improvisation]]al skills, and the two became more interactive.<ref name=\"pro\" /> The scene in which Truman declares \"this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy\" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.<ref name=\"part2\" />\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Hannah Gill acting as Meryl Burbank, Truman's wife, a nurse at the local hospital. Since the show relies on [[product placement]] for revenue, Meryl regularly shows off various items she has recently \"purchased\", one of the many oddities that makes Truman question his life. Her role is to act the part of Truman's wife and ultimately to have a child by him, despite her reluctance to accomplish either. Linney heavily studied [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears catalogs]] from the 1950s to develop her character's poses.<ref name=\"part1\" />\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Christof: The creator of ''The Truman Show''. Christof remains dedicated to the program at all costs, often overseeing and directing its course in person (rather than through aides), but at the climax, he speaks to Truman over a loudspeaker, revealing the nature of Truman's situation. [[Dennis Hopper]] was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 (during filming) over \"creative differences\". Harris was a last-minute replacement.<ref name=\"12mil\" /> Hopper later stated he was fired after two days because Weir and producer [[Scott Rudin]] had made a deal that if they didn't both approve of Hopper's performance, they would replace him.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/at-home-with-dennis-hopper | title=Farewell then Dennis Hopper}}</ref> A number of other actors had turned down the role after Hopper's departure.<ref name=\"part2\" /> Harris considered making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.<ref name=\"pro\" />\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Louis Coltrane playing Marlon, Truman's best friend since early childhood. Marlon is a [[vending machine]] operator for the company Goodies, who promises Truman he would never lie to him, despite the latest events in Truman's life. Emmerich has said, \"My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious drug addiction for many years. Been in and out of rehab.\"<ref name=\"pro\" /> Very little of this is shown in the finished film, but several deleted scenes depict Louis actively expressing guilt over Truman's situation, and in one sequence he spots Truman during his escape and purposely says nothing. His name is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgam]] of two jazz musicians, [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[John Coltrane]], and in one scene he plays trumpet.\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia was hired to play a background extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but was thrown out of the show before she could do so. She then becomes a protester against ''The Truman Show'', urging Christof to release its lead.\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Alanis Montclair playing Angela Burbank, Truman's mother: Christof orders that she attempt to persuade Truman to have children.\n* [[Brian Delate]] as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his character on the show was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and as he tries to get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Simeon (control room director). Though second-in-command at the lunar room, he is conflicted when ordered to attempt to kill Truman via storm.\n* [[Peter Krause]] as Laurence (Truman's boss): At Truman's office, Laurence often interrupts Truman when he talks about his dreams of moving to [[Fiji]].\n\n==Production==\n[[Andrew Niccol]] completed a one-page [[film treatment]] titled ''The Malcolm Show'' in May 1991.<ref>{{cite news | author = Benedict Carver | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117477740 | title = 'Truman' suit retort | work = Variety | date = June 22, 1998 | accessdate = May 15, 2009}}</ref> The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in New York City.<ref name=\"part1\">{{Cite video |title=How's It Going to End?

It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7.\" Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later on in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star,<ref name=\"part1\" /> but because of commitments with ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' and ''[[Liar Liar]]'', he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year.<ref name=\"pro\" /> Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role.<ref name=\"part1\" /> Niccol rewrote the script twelve times,<ref name=\"pro\" /> while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.<ref name=\"part1\" />\n\nWeir scouted locations in Eastern Florida but was dissatisfied with the landscapes. [[Sound stage]]s at Universal Studios were reserved for the story's setting of Seahaven before Weir's wife introduced him to [[Seaside, Florida]], a \"master-planned community\" located in the Florida Panhandle. Pre-production offices were immediately opened in Seaside, where the majority of filming took place.

He feels trapped into a familial and social world to which he tries to conform while being unable to entirely identify with it, believing that he has no other choice (other than through the fantasy of fleeing to a far-way island). Eventually, Truman gains sufficient awareness of his condition to \"leave home\"{{mdash}}developing a more mature and authentic identity as an adult, leaving his child-self behind and becoming a ''True''-man.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00030.x |title=The Truman Show: How's it going to end? |year=2008 |last1=Brearley |first1=Michael |last2=Sabbadini |first2=Andrea |journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=433\u201340 |pmid=18405297}}</ref>}}\n\n===Similarity to ''Utopia''===\nParallels can be drawn from [[Thomas More]]'s 1516 book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', in which More describes an island with only one entrance and only one exit. Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to ''The Truman Show'' because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's ''Utopia'' and real-life groups such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]].<ref name=\"Robert\" /> It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban \"[[picket fence]]\" appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the \"[[American Dream]]\" of the 1950s. The \"American Dream\" concept in Truman's world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant.<ref name=\"Robert\">Beuka, Robert.

Feldman]], and [[Adam Schroeder]], and written by Niccol. The film stars [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank, adopted and raised by a corporation inside a [[simulated reality|simulated]] television show revolving around his life, until he discovers it and decides to escape.  Additional roles are performed by [[Laura Linney]], [[Noah Emmerich]], [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Holland Taylor]], [[Ed Harris]], and [[Brian Delate]].\n\n''The Truman Show'' was originally a [[spec script]] by Niccol, inspired by an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' called \"[[Special Service]]\".<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904060604576574592522839126 | title=Films Inspired by Rod Serling's \"The Twilight Zone\" \u2013 Snapshot | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=September 23, 2011 | accessdate=July 14, 2012 | author=Steinberg, Don}}</ref> Unlike the finished product, it was more of a [[science-fiction]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in [[New York City]]. [[Scott Rudin]] purchased the script, and set up production at [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Brian De Palma]] was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million\u2014$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at [[Seaside, Florida]], a master-[[planned community]] located in the [[Florida Panhandle]].\n\nThe film was a financial success, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the [[71st Academy Awards]], [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], [[52nd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[The Saturn Award]]s. ''The Truman Show'' has been analyzed as a [[thesis]] on [[Christianity]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[simulated reality]], [[existentialism]], and [[reality television]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTruman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of ''The Truman Show'', a [[reality television]] program broadcast live around the clock worldwide. He has spent his entire life in the seaside town of Seahaven Island, which in reality is an enormous set near [[Hollywood]], equipped with state of the art technology to simulate day and night and weather conditions, as well as 5000 cameras to record Truman's every move. The producers discourage Truman from leaving Seahaven by instilling him with [[aquaphobia]] through the \"death\" of his TV father in a boating \"accident\", and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling. All of Seahaven's other residents are actors. Christof, the show's creator and executive producer, seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behaviour and give audiences a relatable everyman.\n\nDespite Christof's control, he could not predict all of Truman\u2019s actions. During his college years, Truman was intended to fall in love with and marry co-student Meryl, but fell for Sylvia, an [[Extra (acting)|extra]]. Sylvia warned him that his reality is fake before being removed from the show, where Truman is told she moved to [[Fiji]] with her father. While Truman went on to marry Meryl, he continues to think about Sylvia. He uses scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret, and seeks travel to Fiji. Outside of the show, Sylvia has become part of a \"Free Truman\" campaign that demands the end of the show and Truman's freedom and accuses Christof of making his life worse, which Christof denies.\n\nAs the show goes on, Truman starts noticing unusual events: a spotlight falling out of the sky, a radio frequency that precisely describes his movements, and rain that falls only on him. Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back onto the set, but other actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure him, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress; during an argument with Truman, she [[breaking character|breaks character]] and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof re-introduces Truman's father to the show properly, under the guise of having [[amnesia|lost his memory]] after the boating accident. This helps the show regain the ratings lead with audiences and Truman seems to return to his routines, except he begins sleeping in his basement.\n\nOne evening, the production staff discovers that the sleeping Truman is completely out of their sight. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, finding that he has left a snowman dummy and a tape recorder playing snoring sounds in his place, and has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, revealing that Truman is gone, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history, while a citywide search for Truman is launched. Audiences around the world, including the media, are drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat, after an attempt to fetch Truman fails. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but, while Christof\u2019s bosses and assistants demand that he ends the show, Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.\n\nTruman continues to sail until, to his despair, his boat strikes the wall of the dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is \"no more truth\" in the real world and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: \"In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night,\" (previously his catch-phrase), takes a bow, and exits. The viewers cheer Truman on, while Sylvia races to greet him. A defeated Christof's supervisors end the program for the last time and the viewers check their television guides to see what else is on television.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank: Chosen out of six unwanted pregnancies to be the first child legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has a job in the insurance business and a wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. [[Robin Williams]] was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' because Carrey's performance reminded him of [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name=\"pro\" /> Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in comedic roles.<ref>{{cite news | author = Weinraub, Bernard | title = Director Tries a Fantasy As He Questions Reality | work = The New York Times | date = May 21, 1998 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E0D71539F932A15756C0A96E958260 | accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do ''The Truman Show'' for $12 million.<ref name=\"12mil\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/new-truman-villain-harris-1117435072/|title=New ''Truman'' villain: Harris|date=April 7, 1997|work=Variety|author=Busch, Anita M.|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref> Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's [[improvisation]]al skills, and the two became more interactive.<ref name=\"pro\" /> The scene in which Truman declares \"this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy\" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.<ref name=\"part2\" />\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Hannah Gill acting as Meryl Burbank, Truman's wife, a nurse at the local hospital. Since the show relies on [[product placement]] for revenue, Meryl regularly shows off various items she has recently \"purchased\", one of the many oddities that makes Truman question his life. Her role is to act the part of Truman's wife and ultimately to have a child by him, despite her reluctance to accomplish either. Linney heavily studied [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears catalogs]] from the 1950s to develop her character's poses.<ref name=\"part1\" />\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Christof: The creator of ''The Truman Show''. Christof remains dedicated to the program at all costs, often overseeing and directing its course in person (rather than through aides), but at the climax, he speaks to Truman over a loudspeaker, revealing the nature of Truman's situation. [[Dennis Hopper]] was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 (during filming) over \"creative differences\". Harris was a last-minute replacement.<ref name=\"12mil\" /> Hopper later stated he was fired after two days because Weir and producer [[Scott Rudin]] had made a deal that if they didn't both approve of Hopper's performance, they would replace him.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/at-home-with-dennis-hopper | title=Farewell then Dennis Hopper}}</ref> A number of other actors had turned down the role after Hopper's departure.<ref name=\"part2\" /> Harris considered making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.<ref name=\"pro\" />\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Louis Coltrane playing Marlon, Truman's best friend since early childhood. Marlon is a [[vending machine]] operator for the company Goodies, who promises Truman he would never lie to him, despite the latest events in Truman's life. Emmerich has said, \"My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious drug addiction for many years. Been in and out of rehab.\"<ref name=\"pro\" /> Very little of this is shown in the finished film, but several deleted scenes depict Louis actively expressing guilt over Truman's situation, and in one sequence he spots Truman during his escape and purposely says nothing. His name is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgam]] of two jazz musicians, [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[John Coltrane]], and in one scene he plays trumpet.\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia was hired to play a background extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but was thrown out of the show before she could do so. She then becomes a protester against ''The Truman Show'', urging Christof to release its lead.\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Alanis Montclair playing Angela Burbank, Truman's mother: Christof orders that she attempt to persuade Truman to have children.\n* [[Brian Delate]] as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his character on the show was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and as he tries to get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Simeon (control room director). Though second-in-command at the lunar room, he is conflicted when ordered to attempt to kill Truman via storm.\n* [[Peter Krause]] as Laurence (Truman's boss): At Truman's office, Laurence often interrupts Truman when he talks about his dreams of moving to [[Fiji]].\n\n==Production==\n[[Andrew Niccol]] completed a one-page [[film treatment]] titled ''The Malcolm Show'' in May 1991.<ref>{{cite news | author = Benedict Carver | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117477740 | title = 'Truman' suit retort | work = Variety | date = June 22, 1998 | accessdate = May 15, 2009}}</ref> The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in New York City.<ref name=\"part1\">{{Cite video |title=How's It Going to End?

It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7.\" Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later on in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star,<ref name=\"part1\" /> but because of commitments with ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' and ''[[Liar Liar]]'', he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year.<ref name=\"pro\" /> Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role.<ref name=\"part1\" /> Niccol rewrote the script twelve times,<ref name=\"pro\" /> while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.<ref name=\"part1\" />\n\nWeir scouted locations in Eastern Florida but was dissatisfied with the landscapes. [[Sound stage]]s at Universal Studios were reserved for the story's setting of Seahaven before Weir's wife introduced him to [[Seaside, Florida]], a \"master-planned community\" located in the Florida Panhandle. Pre-production offices were immediately opened in Seaside, where the majority of filming took place.

He feels trapped into a familial and social world to which he tries to conform while being unable to entirely identify with it, believing that he has no other choice (other than through the fantasy of fleeing to a far-way island). Eventually, Truman gains sufficient awareness of his condition to \"leave home\"{{mdash}}developing a more mature and authentic identity as an adult, leaving his child-self behind and becoming a ''True''-man.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00030.x |title=The Truman Show: How's it going to end? |year=2008 |last1=Brearley |first1=Michael |last2=Sabbadini |first2=Andrea |journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=433\u201340 |pmid=18405297}}</ref>}}\n\n===Similarity to ''Utopia''===\nParallels can be drawn from [[Thomas More]]'s 1516 book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', in which More describes an island with only one entrance and only one exit. Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to ''The Truman Show'' because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's ''Utopia'' and real-life groups such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]].<ref name=\"Robert\" /> It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban \"[[picket fence]]\" appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the \"[[American Dream]]\" of the 1950s. The \"American Dream\" concept in Truman's world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant.<ref name=\"Robert\">Beuka, Robert.

{"title_page": "Lois Gottlieb", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2017}}\n'''Lois Davidson Gottlieb''' (born November 13, 1926) is an American [[architect]] best known for residential designs. She was born in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. Gottlieb's professional career spans more than 50 years. She practiced architecture in and outside the U.S. as a prolific residential designer. Most of her domestic designs can be found in California, Washington, Idaho and Virginia. Gottlieb's works have been featured in various publications, exhibits, and the documentary video made about her work on 'The Gottlieb House' in Fairfax Station, Virginia.  Lois Davidson was an apprentice to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a part of the [[Taliesin West|Taliesin Fellowship in Scottsdale, Arizona,]] and Wright's winter home and the western counterpart to [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin East]] in Spring Green, Wisconsin, 1948-1949. \n\n== Education ==\nGottlieb attended [[Stanford University]], where she studied pre-architecture, a combination of art and engineering before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from1944 to 1947. \n\nIn the last quarter of her senior year, Gottlieb was about to graduate from Stanford University and did not know what to do with herself. she visited Frank Lloyd Wright's Hanna House [1936] near the university campus for one of the classes she took. As she would later recall, \"I was stunned and enchanted. lt was as though l had never heard music before and here was confronted with the visual equivalent of a Beethoven symphony.\" Driven by the appreciation for, and a desire to learn more about the design philosophy of Wright's architecture, Gottlieb applied and later accepted as an apprentice to the Taliesin Fellowship. She began a two-year journey of work and study with Wright in 1948; she was to discover that architecture could be \"a way of life\". Gottlieb was one of the few women who have been apprenticed to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a Taliesin fellow. During her time at Taliesin, she worked on the Pratt house in Michigan, and the Walker house in Carmel, California.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gottlieb, Lois Davidson.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47063813|title=A way of life : an apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright|date=2001|publisher=Images Pub.

Her first solo project was the design of the Val-Goeschen house, a one-room unit with 576 square feet, in Inverness, CA. She went on to design other residences in Marin County as part of the design team Duncombe-Davidson based in Sausalito, CA. This partnership spanned the years 1951 to 1956.

She also gave guest lectures at various universities around the world, including one at Virginia Tech in 1996.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Architecture ==\nAt Taliesin, Gottlieb recalled, \"if you wanted something, you made it.\" As a result she was \"creative about using new methods and materials, such as Trex decking made from melted trash bags and sawdust, and block made from recycled plastic bottles as forms for concrete walls, camouflaged with brick veneer.\" [Women & Creativity 36]  One of her final architectural projects was the design and construction of an 11,000 sq. ft. home and office complex for her son and his wife and family, Mark & Sharon Gottlieb. It was built in Fairfax Station, VA, of recycled materials (such as laminated wood and ice block). This was chronicled and produced with Eva Soltes in the documentary film \u201cBuilding a Dream: A Family Affair\u201d.

She practiced architecture in and outside the U.S. as a prolific residential designer. Most of her domestic designs can be found in California, Washington, Idaho and Virginia. Gottlieb's works have been featured in various publications, exhibits, and the documentary video made about her work on 'The Gottlieb House' in Fairfax Station, Virginia.  Lois Davidson was an apprentice to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a part of the [[Taliesin West|Taliesin Fellowship in Scottsdale, Arizona,]] and Wright's winter home and the western counterpart to [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin East]] in Spring Green, Wisconsin, 1948-1949. \n\n== Education ==\nGottlieb attended [[Stanford University]], where she studied pre-architecture, a combination of art and engineering before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from1944 to 1947. \n\nIn the last quarter of her senior year, Gottlieb was about to graduate from Stanford University and did not know what to do with herself. she visited Frank Lloyd Wright's Hanna House [1936] near the university campus for one of the classes she took. As she would later recall, \"I was stunned and enchanted. lt was as though l had never heard music before and here was confronted with the visual equivalent of a Beethoven symphony.\"\n\nDriven by the appreciation for and a desire to learn more design philosophy of Wright's architecture, Gottlieb applied and later accepted as an apprentice to the Taliesin Fellowship. She began a two-year journey of work and study with Wright in 1948; she was to discover that architecture could be \"a way of life\". Gottlieb was also one of the few women who have been apprenticed to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a Taliesin fellow. During her time at Taliesin, she worked on the Pratt house in Michigan, and the Walker house in Carmel, California.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gottlieb, Lois Davidson.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47063813|title=A way of life : an apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright|date=2001|publisher=Images Pub.

Her first solo project was the design of the Val-Goeschen house, a one-room unit with 576 square feet, in Inverness, CA. She went on to design other residences in Marin County as part of the design team Duncombe-Davidson based in Sausalito, CA. This partnership spanned the years 1951 to 1956. From 1956 to 2002, Gottlieb worked as a freelance residential designer on over 100 projects in the Bay Area and in Riverside, CA, as well as in Washington, Idaho, and Virginia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=vt/viblbv00125.xml|title=A Guide to the Lois Davidson Gottlieb Architectural Collection, 1945-2003 Gottlieb, Lois Davidson, Architectural Collection Ms1997-003|website=ead.lib.virginia.edu|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nGottlieb served as a lecturer at the College of the Holy Names in Oakland, CA from 1960 to 1964, at Alameda State College in Hayward, CA from 1962 to 1964, and at the University of California Extension in Riverside, CA from 1966 to 1972. She also gave guest lectures at various universities around the world, including one at Virginia Tech in 1996.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Architecture ==\nAt Taliesin, Gottlieb recalled, \"if you wanted something, you made it.\" As a result she was \"creative about using new methods and materials, such as Trex decking made from melted trash bags and sawdust, and block made from recycled plastic bottles as forms for concrete walls, camouflaged with brick veneer.\" [Women & Creativity 36]  One of her final architectural projects was the design and construction of an 11,000 sq. ft. home and office complex for her son and his wife and family, Mark & Sharon Gottlieb. It was built in Fairfax Station, VA, of recycled materials (such as laminated wood and ice block). This was chronicled and produced with Eva Soltes in the documentary film \u201cBuilding a Dream: A Family Affair\u201d.
