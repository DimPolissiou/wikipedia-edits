It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2177.html Field Listing - Median age], [[The World Factbook]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Data last updated on April 2, 2009.</ref>\n\nCurrently, the median age ranges from a low of about 15 in [[Demographics of Niger|Niger]] to 40 or more in several [[Europe]]an countries, [[Demographics of Canada|Canada]], and [[Demographics of Japan|Japan]].<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#2177]</ref> The median age for women tends to be much greater than that of men in some of the [[ex-Soviet republics]], while in the [[Global South]] the difference is far smaller or is reversed.\n\n== Countries ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+ CIA World Factbook 2018 est.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/343rank.html CIA The World Factbook/ Median Age 2018].

that is, half the people are younger than this age and half are older.

Data last updated on April 2, 2009.</ref>\n\nCurrently, the median age ranges from a low of about 15 in [[Demographics of Niger|Niger]] to 40 or more in several [[Europe]]an countries, [[Demographics of Canada|Canada]] and [[Demographics of Japan|Japan]].<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#2177]</ref> The median age for women tends to be much greater than that of men in some of the [[ex-Soviet republics]], while in the [[Global South]] the difference is far smaller or is reversed.\n\n== Countries ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+ CIA World Factbook 2018 est.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/343rank.html CIA The World Factbook/ Median Age 2018].

The Marmara further connects to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean]] seas via the [[Dardanelles]]. Thus, the Bosporus allows maritime connections from the Black Sea all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean via Gibraltar, and the Indian Ocean through the [[Suez Canal]], making it a crucial international waterway, in particular for the passage of goods coming in from [[Russia]].\n\n=== Formation ===\n{{Main|Black Sea deluge hypothesis}}\n\nThe exact cause and date of the formation of the Bosporus remain the subject of debate among geologists. One recent hypothesis, dubbed the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]], which was launched by a study of the same name in 1997 by two scientists from [[Columbia University]], postulates that the Bosporus was flooded around 5600 BC (revised to 6800 BC in 2003) when the rising waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] breached through to the [[Black Sea]], which at the time, according to the hypothesis, was a low-lying body of fresh water.\n\nMany geologists,{{who|date=May 2018}} however, claim that the strait is much older, even if relatively young on a geologic timescale.\n\nFrom the perspective of [[ancient Greek mythology]], it was said that colossal floating rocks known as the [[Symplegades]], or Clashing Rocks, once occupied the hilltops on both sides of the Bosporus, and destroyed any ship that attempted passage of the channel by rolling down the strait's hills and violently crushing all vessels between them. The Symplegades were defeated when the lyrical hero [[Jason]] obtained successful passage, whereupon the rocks became fixed, and Greek access to the Black Sea was opened.\n\n=== Present morphology ===\nThe limits of the Bosporus are defined as the connecting line between the lighthouses of [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] in the north, and between the [[Ah\u0131rkap\u0131 Feneri]] and the [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y \u0130nciburnu Feneri]] in the south. Between these limits, the strait is {{convert|31|km|nmi|abbr=on}} long, with a width of {{convert|3329|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the northern entrance and {{convert|2826|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is {{convert|3420|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Umuryeri and B\u00fcy\u00fckdere Liman\u0131, and minimum width {{convert|700|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between [[Kandilli, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[A\u015fiyan]].\n\nThe depth of the Bosporus varies from {{convert|13|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} in midstream with an average of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest location is between Kandilli and [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] with {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The shallowest locations are off Kad\u0131k\u00f6y \u0130nciburnu on the northward route with {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and off A\u015fiyan Point on the southward route with {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"d\" />\n\nThe smallest section is on a sill located in front of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]].

Sections of the shore have been reinforced with concrete or rubble and sections of the strait prone to [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] are periodically dredged.\n\nThe 2010 team of scientists, led by the [[University of Leeds]], used a robotic \"yellow submarine\" to observe detailed flows within an \"undersea river\", scientifically referred to as a [[submarine channel]],<ref name=\"leeds.ac.uk\"/> for the first time. Submarine channels are similar to land rivers, but they are formed by density currents\u2014underwater flow mixtures of sand, mud and water that are denser than sea water and so sink and flow along the bottom. These channels are the main transport pathway for sediments to the deep sea where they form sedimentary deposits. These deposits ultimately hold not only untapped reserves of gas and oil, they also house important secrets\u2014from clues on past climate change to the ways in which mountains were formed.<ref name=\"leeds.ac.uk\"/>\n\nThe team studied the detailed flow within these channels and findings included:\n\n{{quote|The channel complex and the density flow provide the ideal natural laboratory for investigating and detailing the structure of the flow field through the channel. Our initial findings show that the flow in these channels is quite different to the flow in river channels on land. Specifically, as flow moves around a bend it spirals in the opposite direction in the deep sea compared to the spiral found in river channels on land. This is important in understanding the sedimentology and layers of sediment deposited by these systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurity.org/earth-environment/robotic-sub-records-flow-of-undersea-river/|title=Robotic sub records flow of undersea river \u2013 Futurity|date=2 August 2010|publisher=}}</ref>}}\n\nThe central tenet of the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]] is that as the ocean rose {{convert|72.5|m}} at the end of the last Ice Age when the massive ice sheets melted, the sealed Bosporus was overtopped in a spectacular flood that increased the then fresh water Black Sea Lake 50%, and drove people from the shores for many months. This was supported by findings of undersea explorer [[Robert Ballard]], who discovered settlements along the old shoreline; scientists dated the [[flood]] to 7500 BP or 5500 BC from fresh-salt water microflora. The peoples driven out by the constantly rising water, which must have been terrifying and inexplicable, spread to all corners of the Western world carrying the story of the Great Flood, which is how it probably entered most religions.  As the waters surged, they scoured a network of sea-floor channels less resistant to denser suspended solids in liquid, which remains a very active layer today.\n\nThe first images of these submarine channels were obtained in 1999, showing them to be of great size<ref>Di Iorio, D., and Y\u00fcce, H.

The models the team will produce will have broad applications, including inputting into the design of seafloor engineering by oil and gas companies.\n\nThe project was led by Jeff Peakall and Daniel Parsons at the [[University of Leeds]], in collaboration with the [[University of Southampton]], Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the [[Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University|Institute of Marine Sciences]]. The survey was run and coordinated from the Institute of Marine Sciences research ship, the [[RV K. Piri Reis|R/V ''Koca Piri Reis'']].\n\n== History ==\nAs part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosporus has always been of great importance from a commercial and military point of view, and remains strategically important today. It is a major sea access route for numerous countries, including [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Control over it has been an objective of a number of conflicts in modern history, notably the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)]], as well as of the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the [[Dardanelles]] during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].\n\n=== Ancient Greek, Persian, Roman and Byzantine eras (pre-1453) ===\n[[File:Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer Cristoforo Buondelmonte.jpg|thumb|250px| Map of Constantinople (modern-day [[Istanbul]]), designed in 1422 by [[Florence|Florentine]] cartographer [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]]. This is the oldest surviving map of the city, and the only surviving map which predates the [[Fall of Constantinople|Turkish conquest]] of 1453. The Bosporus is visible along the right hand side of the map, wrapping vertically around the historic city.]]\n\nThe strategic importance of the Bosporus dates back millennia. In the 5th century BC the Greek city-state of [[Athens]], which depended on grain imports from the Black Sea ports of [[Scythia]], maintained critical alliances with cities which controlled the straits, such as the [[Megara|Megarian]] colony [[Byzantium]].\n\nPersian King [[Darius I]] the Great ({{reign | 522 BC | 486 BC}}), in an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horsemen who roamed across the north of the [[Black Sea]], crossed the Bosporus, then marched towards the [[River Danube]].

The final 53-day campaign, which resulted in Ottoman victory, constituted an important turn in world history. Together with [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first voyage to the Americas in 1492, the 1453 conquest of Constantinople is commonly noted as among [[Middle Ages#Terminology and periodisation|the events that brought an end to the Middle Ages]] and marked the transition to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].\n\nThe event also marked the end of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]\u2014the final remnants of the [[Roman Empire]]\u2014and the transfer of the control of the Bosporus into Ottoman hands, who made Constantinople their new capital, and from where they expanded their empire in the centuries that followed.\n\nAt its peak between the 16th and 18th centuries, the Ottoman Empire had used the strategic importance of the Bosporus to expand their regional ambitions and to wrest control of the entire [[Black Sea]] area, which they regarded as an \"Ottoman lake\", on which Russian warships were prohibited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_koprulu_era.html |title=Turkey \u2013 K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Era |publisher=Workmall.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, several international treaties have governed vessels using the waters.

Turkey eventually rejected the terms of that treaty, and subsequently Turkey remilitarised the straits area. The reversion was formalised under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] of 20 July 1936. That convention, which is still in force, treats the straits as an international shipping lane save that Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non\u2013Black Sea states.\n\nTurkey was neutral in the [[Second World War]] until February 1945, and the straits were closed to the warships of belligerent nations during this time, although some German [[auxiliaries|auxiliary vessels]] were permitted to transit.

Between its northern limits at [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] and its southern ones at [[Ah\u0131rkap\u0131 Feneri]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y \u0130nciburnu Feneri]], there are numerous dangerous points for large-scale maritime traffic that require sharp turns and management of visual obstructions. Famously, the stretch between [[Kandilli, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[A\u015fiyan]] requires a 45-degree course alteration in a location where the currents can reach {{convert|7|to|8|kn|m/s|abbr=out}}. To the south, at [[Yenik\u00f6y, Istanbul|Yenik\u00f6y]], the necessary course alteration is 80 degrees.

Both the public ferries and the seabuses also provide commuter services between the Bosphorus and the [[Prince Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]].\n\nThere are also tourist rides available in various places along the coasts of the Bosphorus. The prices vary according to the type of the ride, and some feature loud popular music for the duration of the trip.\n\n== Architecture of Bosphorus ==\nThe architectural style of the Bosphorus began to be shaped by simple houses in the fishing villages established on the coast during the Byzantine period.\n\nThe mansions, which were placed on the shores during the Ottoman period, became one of the most outstanding examples of Bosphorus architecture and have been identified with the Bosphorus for years. The number of mansions built on the two sides of the Bosphorus for centuries and has reached today is about 360.\n\nToday, the majority of them still preserves their old forms, are among the most expensive real estate both in Turkey and Istanbul.\n\nMany palace buildings has also built in the Bosphorus, which was one of the most popular places of the palace people during the Ottoman period. [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]], [[\u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace|Beylerbeyi Saray\u0131]], [[K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksu Palace|K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksu Kasr\u0131]], [[Beykoz kasr\u0131|Beykoz Kasr\u0131]] ve [[Adile Sultan Palace|Adile Sultan Kasr\u0131]] are some of most striking structures used by sultans and his relatives from time to time. Historical buildings such as [[Galatasaray University]], Egyptian Consulate and [[Sak\u0131p Sabanc\u0131 Museum]] are among the most famous architectural examples of the Bosphorus.\n\nIn the Ottoman era there was a tradition of building mosques and pier squares as well as pier buildings in the important districts of the Bosphorus. Be\u015fikta\u015f Pier, Ortak\u00f6y Square, [[Ortak\u00f6y Mosque]], [[Bebek Mosque]], [[Beylerbeyi Mosque]] and [[\u015eemsi Pasha Mosque|\u015eemsipa\u015fa Mosque]] are some of traces from that tradition.\n\n== Image gallery ==\n{{Cleanup gallery|date=May 2018}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Istanbul panorama and skyline.jpg|View of the European side of Istanbul from the southern entrance to the Bosphorus.\nFile:Modern Istanbul skyline at sunset.jpg|View of the European side of Istanbul from the Bosphorus.\nFile:Bosphorus view Topkapi Istanbul 2007.jpg|View of the entrance to the Bosphorus from the [[Sea of Marmara]], as seen from the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]].\nFile:Istanbul Bogazici Ulus view 3690-3699.jpg|Panoramic view of the Bosphorus as seen from Ulus on the European side, with the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] (1988) at left and the [[Bosphorus Bridge]] (1973) at right.\nFile:\u0130stanbul.jpg|[[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] (1988) and the Bosphorus strait.\nFile:Istanbul img 4925.jpg|[[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Topkapi B15-10.jpg|View from [[Topkapi Palace]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Bosphorus.jpg|View of the Bosphorus from the Marmara Hotel, [[Taksim Square]].\nFile:2007 0919 Bosporus Rumelihisar\u0131.jpg|The [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumelian Castle]] on the Bosphorus, with both [[suspension bridge]]s which span the strait.\nFile:Ahmet Rasim Pa\u015fa Yal\u0131s\u0131 (A'ija Hotel) on the Bosphorus, Turkey 001.jpg|620 historic [[yal\u0131|waterfront houses]] stretch along the coasts of the Bosphorus, such as the [[yal\u0131]] of Ahmet Rasim Pasha.\nFile:Ya\u011fc\u0131 Hac\u0131 \u015eefik Bey Yal\u0131s\u0131 on the Bosphorus in Istanbul, Turkey 001.jpg|[[Yal\u0131]] of Hac\u0131 \u015eefik Bey on the Bosphorus.\nFile:36, Bosforo-ko yali gehiago ferrytik.jpg|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era [[Yal\u0131|waterfront houses]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Bosphorus yali bergie.jpg|Afif Pasha Mansion on the Bosphorus was designed by [[Alexander Vallaury]].\nFile:Arnavutkoy-SA400006.jpg|The quarters of [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]], [[Arnavutk\u00f6y]] and [[Yenik\u00f6y, Istanbul|Yenik\u00f6y]] on the Bosphorus are famous for their fish restaurants.\nFile:Yal\u0131 in Kanl\u0131ca on the Bosphorus, Turkey 001.jpg|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era [[yal\u0131|waterfront houses (''yal\u0131'')]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Ya\u011fl\u0131k\u00e7\u0131 Hac\u0131 Re\u015fit Bey and Prenses Rukiye Yal\u0131s\u0131 on the Bosphorus, Istanbul, Turkey 001.jpg|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era [[yal\u0131|waterfront houses (''yal\u0131'')]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Elbiseci Ahmet Bey Yal\u0131s\u0131 and Esre Umur Yal\u0131s\u0131 in Kanl\u0131ca on the Bosphorus, Turkey 001.jpg|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era [[yal\u0131|waterfront houses (''yal\u0131'')]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Boat on Bosphorus.JPG|Boat on Bosphorus as seen from Sultanahmet street.\nFile:Istanbulbosphorusfrombridge.jpg|A view of the Bosporus strait, with the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] visible in the background.\nFile:Cruise ship and Seabus in Istanbul.jpg|A [[cruise ship]] (left) and [[\u0130DO|Seabus]] (right) navigating through the Bosporus, with the [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] visible at the right end of the frame.\nFile:Istanbul Levent skyline.jpg|Skyline of [[Levent]] as seen from the [[Khedive Palace]] gardens on the Asian coast of the Bosporus.

The Marmara further connects to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean]] seas via the [[Dardanelles]]. Thus, the Bosporus allows maritime connections from the Black Sea all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean via Gibraltar, and the Indian Ocean through the [[Suez Canal]], making it a crucial international waterway, in particular for the passage of goods coming in from [[Russia]].\n\n=== Formation ===\n{{Main|Black Sea deluge hypothesis}}\n\nThe exact cause and date of the formation of the Bosporus remain the subject of debate among geologists. One recent hypothesis, dubbed the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]], which was launched by a study of the same name in 1997 by two scientists from [[Columbia University]], postulates that the Bosporus was flooded around 5600 BC (revised to 6800 BC in 2003) when the rising waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] breached through to the [[Black Sea]], which at the time, according to the hypothesis, was a low-lying body of fresh water.\n\nMany geologists,{{who|date=May 2018}} however, claim that the strait is much older, even if relatively young on a geologic timescale.\n\nFrom the perspective of [[ancient Greek mythology]], it was said that colossal floating rocks known as the [[Symplegades]], or Clashing Rocks, once occupied the hilltops on both sides of the Bosporus, and destroyed any ship that attempted passage of the channel by rolling down the strait's hills and violently crushing all vessels between them. The Symplegades were defeated when the lyrical hero [[Jason]] obtained successful passage, whereupon the rocks became fixed, and Greek access to the Black Sea was opened.\n\n=== Present morphology ===\nThe limits of the Bosporus are defined as the connecting line between the lighthouses of [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] in the north, and between the [[Ah\u0131rkap\u0131 Feneri]] and the [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y \u0130nciburnu Feneri]] in the south. Between these limits, the strait is {{convert|31|km|nmi|abbr=on}} long, with a width of {{convert|3329|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the northern entrance and {{convert|2826|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is {{convert|3420|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Umuryeri and B\u00fcy\u00fckdere Liman\u0131, and minimum width {{convert|700|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between [[Kandilli, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[A\u015fiyan]].\n\nThe depth of the Bosporus varies from {{convert|13|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} in midstream with an average of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest location is between Kandilli and [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] with {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The shallowest locations are off Kad\u0131k\u00f6y \u0130nciburnu on the northward route with {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and off A\u015fiyan Point on the southward route with {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"d\" />\n\nThe smallest section is on a sill located in front of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]].

Sections of the shore have been reinforced with concrete or rubble and sections of the strait prone to [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] are periodically dredged.\n\nThe 2010 team of scientists, led by the [[University of Leeds]], used a robotic \"yellow submarine\" to observe detailed flows within an \"undersea river\", scientifically referred to as a [[submarine channel]],<ref name=\"leeds.ac.uk\"/> for the first time. Submarine channels are similar to land rivers, but they are formed by density currents\u2014underwater flow mixtures of sand, mud and water that are denser than sea water and so sink and flow along the bottom. These channels are the main transport pathway for sediments to the deep sea where they form sedimentary deposits. These deposits ultimately hold not only untapped reserves of gas and oil, they also house important secrets\u2014from clues on past climate change to the ways in which mountains were formed.<ref name=\"leeds.ac.uk\"/>\n\nThe team studied the detailed flow within these channels and findings included:\n\n{{quote|The channel complex and the density flow provide the ideal natural laboratory for investigating and detailing the structure of the flow field through the channel. Our initial findings show that the flow in these channels is quite different to the flow in river channels on land.

This is important in understanding the sedimentology and layers of sediment deposited by these systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurity.org/earth-environment/robotic-sub-records-flow-of-undersea-river/|title=Robotic sub records flow of undersea river \u2013 Futurity|date=2 August 2010|publisher=}}</ref>}}\n\nThe central tenet of the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]] is that as the ocean rose {{convert|72.5|m}} at the end of the last Ice Age when the massive ice sheets melted, the sealed Bosporus was overtopped in a spectacular flood that increased the then fresh water Black Sea Lake 50%, and drove people from the shores for many months. This was supported by findings of undersea explorer [[Robert Ballard]], who discovered settlements along the old shoreline; scientists dated the [[flood]] to 7500 BP or 5500 BC from fresh-salt water microflora. The peoples driven out by the constantly rising water, which must have been terrifying and inexplicable, spread to all corners of the Western world carrying the story of the Great Flood, which is how it probably entered most religions.  As the waters surged, they scoured a network of sea-floor channels less resistant to denser suspended solids in liquid, which remains a very active layer today.\n\nThe first images of these submarine channels were obtained in 1999, showing them to be of great size<ref>Di Iorio, D., and Y\u00fcce, H.

The models the team will produce will have broad applications, including inputting into the design of seafloor engineering by oil and gas companies.\n\nThe project was led by Jeff Peakall and Daniel Parsons at the [[University of Leeds]], in collaboration with the [[University of Southampton]], Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the [[Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University|Institute of Marine Sciences]].

Piri Reis|R/V ''Koca Piri Reis'']].\n\n== History ==\nAs part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosporus has always been of great importance from a commercial and military point of view, and remains strategically important today. It is a major sea access route for numerous countries, including [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Control over it has been an objective of a number of conflicts in modern history, notably the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)]], as well as of the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the [[Dardanelles]] during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].\n\n=== Ancient Greek, Persian, Roman and Byzantine eras (pre-1453) ===\n[[File:Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer Cristoforo Buondelmonte.jpg|thumb|250px| Map of Constantinople (modern-day [[Istanbul]]), designed in 1422 by [[Florence|Florentine]] cartographer [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]].

The Bosporus is visible along the right hand side of the map, wrapping vertically around the historic city.]]\n\nThe strategic importance of the Bosporus dates back millennia. In the 5th century BC the Greek city-state of [[Athens]], which depended on grain imports from the Black Sea ports of [[Scythia]], maintained critical alliances with cities which controlled the straits, such as the [[Megara|Megarian]] colony [[Byzantium]].\n\nPersian King [[Darius I]] the Great ({{reign | 522 BC | 486 BC}}), in an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horsemen who roamed across the north of the [[Black Sea]], crossed the Bosporus, then marched towards the [[River Danube]].

Sovereignty over the straits is also an important issue for the riparian countries besides [[Turkey]].\n\nAlthough it is only one of the natural borders separating the [[Europe]]an and [[Asia]]n mainland, the most known is the Bosphorus. Since it is a favorable region in terms of climate and geographical conditions, it has a great role in being a settlement area for ages. The city of [[Istanbul]], divided by the Bosphorus, is one of the few intercontinental cities in the world.\n\nEven if Turkey has no right to receive tolls from ships passing through the strait Turkey's military has broad powers in accordance with [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits|Montreux Convention]]. Today, the Bosphorus Command is located on the shores of the Bosphorus and the military ships connected to the Command are anchoring in the Bosphorus waters.\n\nLocated on a peninsula at the intersection of the Black Sea, the Bosphorus and the Marmara Sea, Istanbul has been one of the most protected and hardest cities for centuries.\n\n== Sightseeing ==\n{{See also|Yal\u0131|Ferries in Istanbul|\u0130DO}}\n\nThe Bosphorus has 620 [[yal\u0131|waterfront houses (''yal\u0131'')]] built during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period along the strait's European and Asian shorelines. Ottoman palaces such as the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]], [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace]], [[\u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace]], [[Feriye Palaces]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace]], [[K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksu Palace]], [[Ihlamur Palace]], [[Hatice Sultan Palace]], [[Adile Sultan Palace]] and [[Khedive Palace]] are within its view.

At central piers shorter, regular ride in one of the public ferries cross.\n\nPrivate ferries operate between [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar]] and [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]] or [[Kabata\u015f, Istanbul|Kabata\u015f]] in the city.  The few well-known geographic hazards are multiplied by ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city, particularly for the largest ships.<ref name=\"d\">{{cite web|url=http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc |publisher=Denizcilik |title=T\u00fcrk Bo\u011fazlar\u0131 ve Marmara Denizi'nin Co\u011frafi Konumu-\u0130stanbul Bo\u011faz\u0131 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2010-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008023403/http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe catamaran [[\u0130DO|seabuses]] offer high-speed commuter services between the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus, but they stop at fewer [[port]]s and [[pier]]s in comparison to the public ferries. Both the public ferries and the seabuses also provide commuter services between the Bosphorus and the [[Prince Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]].\n\nThere are also tourist rides available in various places along the coasts of the Bosphorus. The prices vary according to the type of the ride, and some feature loud popular music for the duration of the trip.\n\n== Architecture of Bosphorus ==\nThe architectural style of the Bosphorus began to be shaped by simple houses in the fishing villages established on the coast during the Byzantine period.\n\nThe mansions, which were placed on the shores during the Ottoman period, became one of the most outstanding examples of Bosphorus architecture and have been identified with the Bosphorus for years. The number of mansions built on the two sides of the Bosphorus for centuries and has reached today is about 360.\n\nToday, the majority of them still preserves their old forms, are among the most expensive real estate both in Turkey and Istanbul.\n\nMany palace buildings has also built in the Bosphorus, which was one of the most popular places of the palace people during the Ottoman period. [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]], [[\u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace|Beylerbeyi Saray\u0131]], [[K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksu Palace|K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksu Kasr\u0131]], [[Beykoz kasr\u0131|Beykoz Kasr\u0131]] ve [[Adile Sultan Palace|Adile Sultan Kasr\u0131]] are some of most striking structures used by sultans and his relatives from time to time. Historical buildings such as [[Galatasaray University]], Egyptian Consulate and [[Sak\u0131p Sabanc\u0131 Museum]] are among the most famous architectural examples of the Bosphorus.\n\nIn the Ottoman era there was a tradition of building mosques and pier squares as well as pier buildings in the important districts of the Bosphorus. Be\u015fikta\u015f Pier, Ortak\u00f6y Square, [[Ortak\u00f6y Mosque]], [[Bebek Mosque]], [[Beylerbeyi Mosque]] and [[\u015eemsi Pasha Mosque|\u015eemsipa\u015fa Mosque]] are some of traces from that tradition.\n\n== Image gallery ==\n{{Cleanup gallery|date=May 2018}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Istanbul panorama and skyline.jpg|View of the European side of Istanbul from the southern entrance to the Bosphorus.\nFile:Modern Istanbul skyline at sunset.jpg|View of the European side of Istanbul from the Bosphorus.\nFile:Bosphorus view Topkapi Istanbul 2007.jpg|View of the entrance to the Bosphorus from the [[Sea of Marmara]], as seen from the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]].\nFile:Istanbul Bogazici Ulus view 3690-3699.jpg|Panoramic view of the Bosphorus as seen from Ulus on the European side, with the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] (1988) at left and the [[Bosphorus Bridge]] (1973) at right.\nFile:\u0130stanbul.jpg|[[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] (1988) and the Bosphorus strait.\nFile:Istanbul img 4925.jpg|[[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Topkapi B15-10.jpg|View from [[Topkapi Palace]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Bosphorus.jpg|View of the Bosphorus from the Marmara Hotel, [[Taksim Square]].\nFile:2007 0919 Bosporus Rumelihisar\u0131.jpg|The [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumelian Castle]] on the Bosphorus, with both [[suspension bridge]]s which span the strait.\nFile:Ahmet Rasim Pa\u015fa Yal\u0131s\u0131 (A'ija Hotel) on the Bosphorus, Turkey 001.jpg|620 historic [[yal\u0131|waterfront houses]] stretch along the coasts of the Bosphorus, such as the [[yal\u0131]] of Ahmet Rasim Pasha.\nFile:Ya\u011fc\u0131 Hac\u0131 \u015eefik Bey Yal\u0131s\u0131 on the Bosphorus in Istanbul, Turkey 001.jpg|[[Yal\u0131]] of Hac\u0131 \u015eefik Bey on the Bosphorus.\nFile:36, Bosforo-ko yali gehiago ferrytik.jpg|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era [[Yal\u0131|waterfront houses]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Bosphorus yali bergie.jpg|Afif Pasha Mansion on the Bosphorus was designed by [[Alexander Vallaury]].\nFile:Arnavutkoy-SA400006.jpg|The quarters of [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]], [[Arnavutk\u00f6y]] and [[Yenik\u00f6y, Istanbul|Yenik\u00f6y]] on the Bosphorus are famous for their fish restaurants.\nFile:Yal\u0131 in Kanl\u0131ca on the Bosphorus, Turkey 001.jpg|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era [[yal\u0131|waterfront houses (''yal\u0131'')]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Ya\u011fl\u0131k\u00e7\u0131 Hac\u0131 Re\u015fit Bey and Prenses Rukiye Yal\u0131s\u0131 on the Bosphorus, Istanbul, Turkey 001.jpg|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era [[yal\u0131|waterfront houses (''yal\u0131'')]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Elbiseci Ahmet Bey Yal\u0131s\u0131 and Esre Umur Yal\u0131s\u0131 in Kanl\u0131ca on the Bosphorus, Turkey 001.jpg|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era [[yal\u0131|waterfront houses (''yal\u0131'')]] on the Bosphorus.\nFile:Boat on Bosphorus.JPG|Boat on Bosphorus as seen from Sultanahmet street.\nFile:Istanbulbosphorusfrombridge.jpg|A view of the Bosporus strait, with the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] visible in the background.\nFile:Cruise ship and Seabus in Istanbul.jpg|A [[cruise ship]] (left) and [[\u0130DO|Seabus]] (right) navigating through the Bosporus, with the [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] visible at the right end of the frame.\nFile:Istanbul Levent skyline.jpg|Skyline of [[Levent]] as seen from the [[Khedive Palace]] gardens on the Asian coast of the Bosporus.
