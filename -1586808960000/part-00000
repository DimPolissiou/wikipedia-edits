After Blight's resignation in 1994 (following Geelong's Grand Final defeat to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]]), Ayres was appointed senior coach for the 1995 AFL season. In his first year, the Cats lost to Carlton in the Grand Final (their fourth Grand Final defeat in seven seasons) by 61 points. In 1999, at the end of a disappointing season (Geelong finished 11th) and following the Geelong board's refusal to offer him a contract extension beyond the 2000 AFL season, Ayres quit as Geelong coach to take the coaching position at [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] where Malcolm Blight had, again, just resigned.\n\nAyres coached Adelaide from 2000 until 2004. When told he would not continue as coach for the 2005 season, Ayres quit midseason. Though he had been given the opportunity to stay for the rest of season 2004, he told the Adelaide board that if he could not coach the following year, he would leave immediately. He then walked out of the club's office without shaking hands or responding to media enquiries.{{cn|date=August 2018}} He left Adelaide with a 55\u201352 win-loss ratio. He was replaced by [[Neil Craig]], who coached for the remainder of season 2004 and was eventually employed full-time.\n\nIn 2006 he returned to coaching as [[assistant coach]] at the [[Essendon Football Club]], alongside veteran [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]]. When [[Matthew Knights]] was appointed as senior coach of Essendon at the end of the 2007 season, Knights vowed to modernise the club's support staff, Ayres subsequently lost his position as assistant coach.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22527600-11088,00.html Herald Sun: Knights cleans out assistants Gary Ayres, Dean Wallis]</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Ayres was appointed senior coach of the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League]]. Ayres has coached at Port Melbourne continuously since then, with his current contract set to expire at the end of 2017, and he is the longest-serving coach in the club's history. Ayres has coached Port Melbourne to two premierships and three minor premierships, which included the club's perfect [[2011 VFL season|2011 season]], in which the club won all 21 of its premiership matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portmelbournefc.com.au/gary-ayres-extends-coaching-contract/|author=Sam Wharton|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=21 March 2016|publisher=Port Melbourne Football Club|title=Gary Ayres Extends Coaching Contract}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 October 2000, Ayres was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for contribution to Australian Football.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gary James Ayres|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=978364&search_type=advanced&showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|accessdate=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Media career===\nIn 2005 Ayres spent the year in the media on [[Fox Footy Channel]].

After Blight's resignation in 1994 (following Geelong's Grand Final defeat to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]]), Ayres was appointed senior coach for the 1995 AFL season. In his first year, the Cats lost to Carlton in the Grand Final (their fourth Grand Final defeat in seven seasons) by 61 points. In 1999, at the end of a disappointing season (Geelong finished 11th) and following the Geelong board's refusal to offer him a contract extension beyond the 2000 AFL season, Ayres quit as Geelong coach to take the coaching position at [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] where Malcolm Blight had, again, just resigned.\n\nAyres coached Adelaide from 2000 until 2004. When told he would not continue as coach for the 2005 season, Ayres quit midseason. Though he had been given the opportunity to stay for the rest of season 2004, he told the Adelaide board that if he could not coach the following year, he would leave immediately. He then walked out of the club's office without shaking hands or responding to media enquiries.{{cn|date=August 2018}} He left Adelaide with a 55\u201352 win-loss ratio. He was replaced by [[Neil Craig]], who coached for the remainder of season 2004 and was eventually employed full-time.\n\nIn 2006 he returned to coaching as [[assistant coach]] at the [[Essendon Football Club]], alongside veteran [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]]. When [[Matthew Knights]] was appointed as senior coach of Essendon at the end of the 2007 season, Knights vowed to modernise the club's support staff, Ayres subsequently lost his position as assistant coach.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22527600-11088,00.html Herald Sun: Knights cleans out assistants Gary Ayres, Dean Wallis]</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Ayres was appointed senior coach of the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League]]. Ayres has coached at Port Melbourne continuously since then, with his current contract set to expire at the end of 2017, and he is the longest-serving coach in the club's history. Ayres has coached Port Melbourne to two premierships and three minor premierships, which included the club's perfect [[2011 VFL season|2011 season]], in which the club won all 21 of its premiership matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portmelbournefc.com.au/gary-ayres-extends-coaching-contract/|author=Sam Wharton|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=21 March 2016|publisher=Port Melbourne Football Club|title=Gary Ayres Extends Coaching Contract}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 October 2000, Ayres was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for contribution to Australian Football.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gary James Ayres|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=978364&search_type=advanced&showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|accessdate=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Media career===\nIn 2005 Ayres spent the year in the media on [[Fox Footy Channel]].

However, ''[[Brent (name)|brent]]'' was the middle English for \"burnt\". The name describes the presumed reason for settlement in the part of the Forest of Essex (later [[Epping Forest]]) that would have covered the area, where a major occupation was charcoal burning.\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough a [[Bronze Age]] axe has been found in Brentwood and there are clear signs of an entrenched encampment in [[Weald Country Park]], it is considered unlikely that there was any significant early settlement of the area. At the time, most of Essex was covered by the [[Epping Forest|Great Forest]]. It is believed that despite the Roman road between [[London]] and [[Colchester]] passing through the town, the [[Saxons]] were the earliest settlers of the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |title=Foundation of the Town |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122133853/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |archivedate=22 January 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe borough was on a crossroads, where the Roman road from [[Colchester]] to London crossed the route the pilgrims took over the [[River Thames]] to Canterbury. A chapel was built in or around 1221, and in 1227 a market charter was granted. Its growth may have been stimulated by the cult of St. Thomas the Martyr, to whom the chapel was dedicated: the 12th-century ruin of [[Thomas Becket]] Chapel was a popular stopping point for pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. The ruin stands in the centre of the high street and the nearby parish church of Brentwood retains the dedication to St. Thomas of Canterbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-thomas.org.uk|title=Anglican Parish of St Thomas of Canterbury|publisher=St-thomas.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> [[Pilgrims Hatch]], or 'Pilgrims' gate', was probably named from pilgrims who crossed through on their way to the chapel. It is likely, however, that Brentwood's development was due chiefly to its main road position, its market, and its convenient location as an administrative centre. Early industries were connected mainly with textile and garment making, brewing, and brickmaking.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63844&strquery=brentwood%20martyr|title=British History Online : Brentwood|publisher=British-history.ac.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, Brentwood was the meeting place for some of the instigators, such as [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. They apparently met regularly in local pubs and inns. The first event of the Peasants' Revolt occurred in Brentwood, when men from Fobbing, Corringham and Stanford were summoned by the commissioner Thomas Bampton to Brentwood to answer as to who had avoided paying the poll tax.  Bampton insisted that the peasants pay what was demanded of them. The peasants refused to pay and a riot ensued as Bampton attempted to arrest the peasants. The peasants moved to kill Bampton, but he managed to escape to London. The rioters then, fearing the repercussions of what they had done, fled into the forest. After the riot the peasants sent word to the rest of the country and initiated the Peasants' Revolt.<ref>Dedman, M., 2012. Peasants were revolting - and they did it right here.

This has not changed; there is an above average number of pubs in the area - possibly due to the army being stationed at [[Warley Barracks]] until 1958. Some of the pubs date back to the 15th and 16th centuries. Brentwood was also significant as a hub for the London postal service, with a major post office since the 18th century.

The congress attracted 235 competitors who included three [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] and five [[International Master]]s. The prize fund is relatively generous in comparison to many other similar congresses, being around \u00a34,000. In 2007 it was the largest chess competition to be held in Essex and was organised by Brentwood Chess Club.\n\n==Sport, parks and open spaces==\nAlthough close to the extremities of [[Greater London]], Brentwood is surrounded by open countryside and woodland.

[[Ted Blake]], a long-term Brentwood resident, was managing director of Nissen UK from its inception until shortly before it closed and became a leading figure worldwide in the development of modern trampolining.

The name describes the presumed reason for settlement in the part of the Forest of Essex (later [[Epping Forest]]) that would have covered the area, where a major occupation was charcoal burning.\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough a [[Bronze Age]] axe has been found in Brentwood and there are clear signs of an entrenched encampment in [[Weald Country Park]], it is considered unlikely that there was any significant early settlement of the area. At the time, most of Essex was covered by the [[Epping Forest|Great Forest]]. It is believed that despite the Roman road between [[London]] and [[Colchester]] passing through the town, the [[Saxons]] were the earliest settlers of the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |title=Foundation of the Town |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122133853/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |archivedate=22 January 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe borough was on a crossroads, where the Roman road from [[Colchester]] to London crossed the route the pilgrims took over the [[River Thames]] to Canterbury. A chapel was built in or around 1221, and in 1227 a market charter was granted. Its growth may have been stimulated by the cult of St. Thomas the Martyr, to whom the chapel was dedicated: the 12th-century ruin of [[Thomas Becket]] Chapel was a popular stopping point for pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. The ruin stands in the centre of the high street and the nearby parish church of Brentwood retains the dedication to St. Thomas of Canterbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-thomas.org.uk|title=Anglican Parish of St Thomas of Canterbury|publisher=St-thomas.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> [[Pilgrims Hatch]], or 'Pilgrims' gate', was probably named from pilgrims who crossed through on their way to the chapel. It is likely, however, that Brentwood's development was due chiefly to its main road position, its market, and its convenient location as an administrative centre. Early industries were connected mainly with textile and garment making, brewing, and brickmaking.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63844&strquery=brentwood%20martyr|title=British History Online : Brentwood|publisher=British-history.ac.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, Brentwood was the meeting place for some of the instigators, such as [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. They apparently met regularly in local pubs and inns. The first event of the Peasants' Revolt occurred in Brentwood, when men from Fobbing, Corringham and Stanford were summoned by the commissioner Thomas Bampton to Brentwood to answer as to who had avoided paying the poll tax.  Bampton insisted that the peasants pay what was demanded of them. The peasants refused to pay and a riot ensued as Bampton attempted to arrest the peasants. The peasants moved to kill Bampton, but he managed to escape to London. The rioters then, fearing the repercussions of what they had done, fled into the forest. After the riot the peasants sent word to the rest of the country and initiated the Peasants' Revolt.<ref>Dedman, M., 2012. Peasants were revolting - and they did it right here.

This has not changed; there is an above average number of pubs in the area - possibly due to the army being stationed at [[Warley Barracks]] until 1958.

A British [[East India Company]] elephant training school was based in Brentwood and this remained an active army base as a depot for the [[Essex Regiment]] until 1959,<ref name=\"History\"/>  when much of the site was redeveloped as the European headquarters for the [[Ford Motor Company]]. A few buildings remain from the Barracks \u2013 the regimental chapel, the gymnasium (now home to Brentwood Trampoline Club) and the officers' mess (now Marillac Hospital).\n\n===Military history===\nThe military has associations with [[Warley, Essex|Warley]] going back over 200 years. It also had strategic importance during the time of the Spanish Armada - it was used as a meeting place for contingents from eight eastern and midland counties (900 horsemen assembled here) to then travel on to Tilbury. The local common was used as a military camp in 1742, and became a permanent feature as [[Warley Barracks]] in 1804.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], over 1,000 bombs were dropped on Brentwood, with 19 flying bombs ([[V-1 flying bomb|V1]]), 32 long-range rockets ([[V2 rocket|V2]]) and many incendiary bombs and parachute mines. 5,038 houses were destroyed, 389 people were injured and 43 died. The 15th- and 16th-century pubs, however, survived.
