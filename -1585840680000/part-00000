{"title_page": "Japanese cemeteries and cenotaphs", "text_new": "{{Grammar|for=grammar|date=February 2020}} \nMany {{nihongo|'''Japanese [[cemeteries]]'''|\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5893\u5730| Nihonjin bochi}} '''and [[cenotaphs]]''' are located outside of [[Japan]] for [[Japanese people]] who died for various reasons outside the nation of their birth. These reasons include historical circumstances such as war. This article also lists [[tomb]]s and [[Burial ground|burial]] places.\n\n== History ==\nDespite a history of isolationism, many Japanese people have travelled and died outside Japan. The oldest known [[Japantown]] featuring a Japanese cemetery is in [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya District|Ayutthaya]], [[Thailand]], established in the 14th to 18th century. The oldest known Japanese national recorded by name and buried outside Japan is early explorer [[Yamada Nagamasa]]. \n\nWars, particularly World War II, account for a large portion of Japanese burial places outside Japan. The cemetery of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in [[Malta]], various burial places of [[Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|Japanese prisoners of war]] in [[Siberia]], and [[Pacific War]] sites including the [[Nanp\u014d Islands]], [[Philippines|the Philippines]], [[New Guinea]], and other [[Pacific Islands]] feature multiple Japanese cemeteries, cenotaphs, and [[Cadaver|remains]] despite soldiers' organizations and/or Japanese government efforts to recover them.\n\nVictims of the United States' internment of its citizens of Japanese ancestry are prevalent in the western United States. \n\n== Location, name of cemetery, cenotaph and tomb ==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Asia ===\n\n==== Bhutan ====\n* [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] - Burial place with the [[pagoda]] of botanist Keiji Nishioka ({{Nihongo2|[[:ja:\u897f\u5ca1\u4eac\u6cbb|\u897f\u5ca1\u4eac\u6cbb]]}})\n\n==== Cambodia ====\n* [[Phnom Penh]] - Cenotaph, Haruyuki Takada ({{Nihongo2|[[:ja:\u9ad8\u7530\u6674\u884c|\u9ad8\u7530 \u6674\u884c]]}}), police, [[Line of duty death]] participate in [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] \u2013 [[Phnom Penh]]\n* [[Siem Reap Province]] - Tomb, [[Taizo Ichinose]]\n* [[Kampong Thom City]], [[Kampong Thom Province]] - ''Atsu Elementary and junior high school'' and monument ''A'' in a garden bearing the name [[Atsuhito Nakata]].

Dr. Mohamed Kamal Hassan, then of the [[National University of Malaysia]] along with a senior academic official who attended the meeting, produced the first working paper on the concept of the university.<ref name=his-uiam />\n\nIIUM was once a private university. As the University's language of instruction was not to be Malay but instead English and Arabic, which was initially prohibited by Malaysian law, IIUM was initially incorporated under the currently-repealed [[Companies Act 1965]]. However, IIUM was officially made a public university on 23 May 1983, in accordance with Section 5A (2) of the [[Universities and University Colleges Act 1971]], when the University received its Establishment Order from the then [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|King]], [[Ahmad Shah of Pahang|Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang]], after an exchange of Diplomatic Notes of Co-sponsorship between the Government of Malaysia, seven other governments and OIC.<ref name=his-uiam />\n\nA batch of 153 students from Malaysia and abroad were enrolled for the first academic session, which started on 8 July 1983. Courses were conducted under the Faculty of Economics, the Faculty of Laws, the Centre for Fundamental Knowledge and the Centre for Languages. The members of this first batch received their degrees and diplomas during the First Convocation held on 10 October 1987. 68 graduates were conferred the degree of [[Bachelor of Economics]], 56 other graduated received the degree of [[Bachelor of Laws]], and 29 Qadhis were conferred Diploma in Law and Administration of Islamic Judiciary.\n\n==Governance==\n\nAs a public university, IIUM has a ceremonial head called the Constitutional Head. He/she presides over convocations and serves as the point of reference for all constitutional issues. Equivalent to the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] in other public universities, he is appointed by the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|King]] on the recommendation of the [[Government of Malaysia|Federal Government]] for a term of seven years. \n\n[[Ahmad Shah of Pahang|Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang]] was the founding Constitutional Head since 1 July 1983. Prior to his demise, he was replaced by her daughter-in-law, the current [[Raja Permaisuri Agong|Queen]], [[Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah|Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah of Johor]]. She was made the Constitutional Head on 12 April 2019 for a five-year term, ending her father-in-law's chancellery in IIUM for 36 years, but the instrument of appointment was only presented to her by the Federal Government on 17 June 2019.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs a federal statutory body, IIUM operates under the supervision of a Board of Governors, a body that directs and supervises all affairs of the University. The Board is chaired by a President who is appointed by the Constitutional Head on the advice of the Federal Government for a five-year term. By tradition, Secretary-General of the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education]] is Deputy Chairman of the Board. Other than the President and a Deputy Chairman, the Board comprises 15 members, including Secretary-General of OIC and diplomatic heads of member states, i.e. [[Bangladesh]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], the [[Maldives]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Turkey]]. Dr. Mohd. Daud Bakar, a renowned Islamic finance expert in Malaysia, sits as the eighth and current President since 1 July 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bhplus.com.my/berita/pendidikan/2019/07/583594/dr-mohd-daud-presiden-baharu-uiam|title=Dr Mohd Daud Presiden baharu UIAM|last=Md Khairudin|first=Mohd Khairul Anam|date=11 July 2019|work=Berita Harian|access-date=11 July 2019|language=ms-my}}</ref>\n\nThe Board of Governors is assisted by a Senate, a body that provides for academic and student affairs of the University, and a Management Committee that oversees day-to-day operation of the University. Both the Senate and the Management Committee is chaired by a Rector who is appointed by the Constitutional Head on the advice of the Federal Government for a three-year term.\n\n=== Leaders since 1983 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!#\n!Name\n!Term start\n!Term end\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |''Constitutional Head''\n|-\n|1\n|[[Ahmad Shah of Pahang|Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang]]\n|1 July 1983\n|11 April 2019\n|-\n|2\n|[[Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah|Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah of Johor]]\n|12 April 2019<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/nasional/2019/06/575157/raja-permaisuri-agong-ketua-perlembagaan-uiam-baharu|title=Raja Permaisuri Agong Ketua Perlembagaan UIAM baharu|last=|first=|date=17 June 2019|work=Berita Harian|access-date=17 June 2019|language=ms-my}}</ref>\n|Present\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |''President''\n|-\n|1\n|[[Hussein Onn|Tun Hussein Onn]]\n|1983\n|1987\n|-\n|2\n|[[Anwar Ibrahim|Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim]]\n|1988\n|1998\n|-\n|3\n|[[Najib Razak|Dato' Sri Mohd.

The idea was shared with the then Minister of Education, Dr. Sulaiman Daud; the then Director-General of Education, Murad Mohamed Nor; and two others. Dr. Mohamed Kamal Hassan, then of the [[National University of Malaysia]] along with a senior academic official who attended the meeting, produced the first working paper on the concept of the university.<ref name=his-uiam />\n\nIIUM was once a private university. As the University's language of instruction was not to be Malay but instead English and Arabic, which was initially prohibited by Malaysian law, IIUM was initially incorporated under the currently-repealed [[Companies Act 1965]]. However, IIUM was officially made a public university on 23 May 1983, in accordance with Section 5A (2) of the [[Universities and University Colleges Act 1971]], when the University received its Establishment Order from the then [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|King]], [[Ahmad Shah of Pahang|Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang]], after an exchange of Diplomatic Notes of Co-sponsorship between the Government of Malaysia, seven other governments and OIC.<ref name=his-uiam />\n\nA batch of 153 students from Malaysia and abroad were enrolled for the first academic session, which started on 8 July 1983. Courses were conducted under the Faculty of Economics, the Faculty of Laws, the Centre for Fundamental Knowledge and the Centre for Languages. The members of this first batch received their degrees and diplomas during the First Convocation held on 10 October 1987. 68 graduates were conferred the degree of [[Bachelor of Economics]], 56 other graduated received the degree of [[Bachelor of Laws]], and 29 Qadhis were conferred Diploma in Law and Administration of Islamic Judiciary.\n\n==Governance==\n\nAs a public university, IIUM has a ceremonial head called the Constitutional Head. He/she presides over convocations and serves as the point of reference for all constitutional issues. Equivalent to the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] in other public universities, he is appointed by the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|King]] on the recommendation of the [[Government of Malaysia|Federal Government]] for a term of seven years. \n\n[[Ahmad Shah of Pahang|Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang]] was the founding Constitutional Head since 1 July 1983. Prior to his demise, he was replaced by her daughter-in-law, the current [[Raja Permaisuri Agong|Queen]], [[Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah|Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah of Johor]]. She was made the Constitutional Head on 12 April 2019 for a five-year term, ending her father-in-law's chancellery in IIUM for 36 years, but the instrument of appointment was only presented to her by the Federal Government on 17 June 2019.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs a federal statutory body, IIUM operates under the supervision of a Board of Governors, a body that directs and supervises all affairs of the University. The Board is chaired by a President who is appointed by the Constitutional Head on the advice of the Federal Government for a five-year term. By tradition, Secretary-General of the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education]] is Deputy Chairman of the Board. Other than the President and a Deputy Chairman, the Board comprises 15 members, including Secretary-General of OIC and diplomatic heads of member states, i.e. [[Bangladesh]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], the [[Maldives]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Turkey]]. Dr. Mohd. Daud Bakar, a renowned Islamic finance expert in Malaysia, sits as the eighth and current President since 1 July 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bhplus.com.my/berita/pendidikan/2019/07/583594/dr-mohd-daud-presiden-baharu-uiam|title=Dr Mohd Daud Presiden baharu UIAM|last=Md Khairudin|first=Mohd Khairul Anam|date=11 July 2019|work=Berita Harian|access-date=11 July 2019|language=ms-my}}</ref>\n\nThe Board of Governors is assisted by a Senate, a body that provides for academic and student affairs of the University, and a Management Committee that oversees day-to-day operation of the University.
