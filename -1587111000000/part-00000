R. Formula]]\n'''C. Rajagopalachari's formula''' (or ''C. R. formula'' or ''Rajaji formula'') was a proposal formulated by [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] to solve the political deadlock between the [[All India Muslim League]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] on the [[independence of India|independence of British India]]. The League's position was that the [[Islam in India|Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] of [[British India]] were of [[Two-Nation Theory|two separate nations]] and hence the Muslims had the right to their own nation. The Congress, which included both Hindu and Muslim members, was opposed to the idea of partitioning India. With the advent of the [[Second World War]] the British administration required both parties to agree so that Indian help could be sought for the war effort.\n\nC. Rajagopalachari, a Congress leader from Madras, devised a proposal for the Congress to offer the League, the predominantly Muslim region that became [[Pakistan]] based on a [[plebiscite]] of all the people in those regions where Muslims were in the majority. Although the formula was opposed, even within the Congress party, [[Gandhi]] used it as the basis of his proposal in talks with [[Jinnah]] in 1944. However, Jinnah rejected the proposal and the talks failed.\n\nStupid\n\n{{Rajaji}}\n{{see also|Indian National Congress|All India Muslim League|Lucknow Pact}}\nThe All India Muslim League was formed in 1906 to \"protect the interests of Muslims\" in British India and to \"represent their needs and aspirations to the Government\".{{sfn|Singh|Brown|Clammer|2008|p=29}} The Indian National Congress, formed in 1885, had demanded [[Swaraj|self-governance in India]].{{sfn|Mishra|1987|pp=73 -75}} In 1916, the League and the Congress entered into a [[Lucknow pact|pact]] in which the League agreed to support the Congress' efforts for home rule in exchange for the Congress' support for a [[Separate Electorate System|two electorate]] system{{sfn|Hardy|1972|pp=187\u2013188}} that would create [[constituencies]] where only Muslims could contest and vote.{{sfn|Dudley-Jenkins|2003|p=160}} In the elections of 1937, Congress emerged as the largest party in seven of the 11 provinces with a clear majority in five ([[Madras Presidency]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Central Provinces and Berar|Central Province]], [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]]).{{sfn|Shakoor|2003|pp=16 \u2013 17}} On the whole, Congress won 716 of the 1161 seats it contested. The League secured 4.8% of the total Muslim votes (winning 25% of the seats allotted for Muslims{{sfn|Kulke|2004|p=314}}) and did not acquire majority in any of the four Muslim predominant provinces ([[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[Sind province (1936-1955)|Sind Province]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier Province]] and [[Bengal Presidency]]).{{sfn|Shakoor|2003|pp=16 \u2013 17}} The League had hoped that its candidates would win the votes over the Congress in Muslim electorates, but was disappointed.{{sfn|Kulke|2004|p=314}} Since Congress had majority in Hindu majority provinces, it refused to share power with the League in those provinces.{{sfn|Kulke, |pp= 314 -315}} The eventual disagreement led to a political tussle between the League and the Congress{{sfn|Shakoor|2003|pp= 186- 189}} climaxing with the League's [[Lahore Resolution]] in March 1940, calling for an independent Muslim nation carved out of British India.{{sfn|Shakoor|2003|pp= 171 \u2013 174}}\n\n==Stupidity ==\n{{see also|Second World War}}\nIn September 1939, [[Lord Linlithgow]], the then [[Viceroy of India]], announced that India was at war with Germany.{{sfn|Wolpert}} The Congress Party resigned its provincial seats in protest, stating that the viceroy's decision had pushed India into a war not of India's making and without consulting its people or representatives.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=230}} Nevertheless, many Congress leaders, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] had expressed moral support to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] cause against the [[Nazis]].{{sfn|Kux|1993|p=6}} Congress demanded that if Britain was fighting to protect democracy through the war, it should also establish democracy in India.{{sfn|Chopra|2003|p= 272}} However, both the Viceroy and the Secretary of State for India ([[Leo Amery]]) openly disliked Indian National Congress and its leaders including Gandhi and Nehru.{{sfn|Kux|1993|p=6}} Moreover, since the British Indian army was dominated by Muslims and [[Sikhs]], the government in London was keen to get both these parties' support rather than appeasing Congress.{{sfn|Wolpert}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}} While Jinnah's Muslim League wanted a Muslim Pakistan, Sikhs feared that if India were divided, Punjab would come under Pakistan and hence put the Sikhs under Muslim rule.{{sfn|Tan|Kudaisya|2002|p= 101}} Eventually the British administration concluded that no progress towards Indian statehood could be made unless Congress and the League reached an agreement.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=230}}\n\nWith Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the US entered the war. Later the Japanese [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|invasion of South East Asia]] in 1941 drew the war much closer to India. Congress maintained that it would support the war efforts of Britain provided India was given its freedom.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|p=31}} While the Congress demanded a unified India and that the issue of a Muslim nation be resolved after independence, the League preferred that separate dominions be created first.{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=121}} Jinnah claimed that he wanted \"Pakistan and that commodity is available not in the Congress market but in the British market\".{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=121}} Although the ruling [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] had taken a harsh stance on the Congress, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and its leaders were sympathetic to its efforts.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|p= 34}} The war saw an increase in support in Britain for efforts to solve the crisis between the Raj, Congress and League. It was realised that the deadlock meant that the vast resources of India was not available to the war.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|pp= 34\u201336}} In addition, America had been sympathetic to India's cause, which if not satisfied by the British administration would have further weakened the Allies.{{sfn|Kux|p=s 6\u201311}} With divided opinion within the British government, [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] was sent to India in March 1942.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|p= 40}} Since Cripps was a well known Congress sympathiser who had earlier advised the Congress leaders to \"stand firm as a rock\" on their demands of freedom, he was seen as the best choice for negotiations.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|p= 41}} [[Cripps' mission]] however failed as the Congress declared that he was assuming different stances in private and public with regard to Indian self-governance.<ref>{{cite web|first=Felix |last=Marrow |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/morrow-felix/1942/09/cripps.htm |title=The Truth About the Cripps Mission}}</ref> Cripps' failure to reach an agreement propelled Congress to mount a [[civil disobedience movement]] called [[Quit India movement]].{{sfn|Chopra|2003|pp= 276\u2013277}} In response to the movement, Gandhi and all senior Congress leaders were arrested in August 1942.{{sfn|Chopra|2003|p= 277}}\n\n==Chakravarti Rajagopalachari's role==\n{{see also|C.

He considered that, in the then likely scenario of Japanese invasion, India would need the support of the British and hence required the Congress and the League to agree on the constitution of India with urgency.{{sfn|Wolpert}} In April 1942, parts of the Madras Presidency were bombed by Japanese warplanes operating from the aircraft carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d|Ry\u016bj\u014d]]''. [[Arthur Hope, 2nd Baron Rankeillour|Arthur Hope]], the [[Governor of Madras]] advised the people to leave Madras and also moved the secretariat inland.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p= 296}} Rajaji considered this an act of the British administration forsaking the people of Madras and brought resolutions in Madras Legislature Party of the All India Congress Committee that the Congress should concede the demand of Pakistan if the League insisted on it.{{sfn|Ramanathan|2008|p=311}} With severe opposition to the resolutions from the Congress leadership, he resigned from the Congress as per Gandhi's advice.{{sfn|Sinha|2002|pp= 61\u201362}} Thus he did not participate in the Quit India movement and was not arrested with the other Congress leaders.{{sfn|Zakaria|2001|p=88}} Hence he was able to devise a proposal to negotiate with the League.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=167}} This proposal, which was called the CR formula by the popular press{{sfn|Tan|Kudaisya|2002|p=108}} was to recognise the demand for Pakistan in principle and to act as a basis for talks between the League and the Congress.{{sfn|Sen|1997|p=311}}\n\n==The proposal==\n[[File:Gandhi Rajagopalachari.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mohandas Gandhi]] and [[C.

In the event of separation, a mutual agreement would be entered into for safeguarding essential matters such as defence, communication and commerce and for other essential services.\n\n:v. The transfer of population, if any would be absolutely on a voluntary basis.\n\n:vi. The terms of the binding will be applicable only in case of full transfer of power by Britain to Government of India.\n\n==Gandhi-Jinnah talks of 1944==\n\nAs the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] saw more victories, the attitude of British administration towards Congress softened.{{sfn|Zakaria|2001|p= 91}} Moreover, America had been pressing Britain to meet India's demand for self-governance.{{sfn|Kux|1993|pp=6\u201334}} Although other Congress leaders were still in prison Gandhi was released on 5 May 1944.{{sfn|Sakaria|p= 92}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}} After his release Gandhi proposed talks with Jinnah on his two-nation theory and negotiating on issue of partition.{{sfn|Zakaria|p= 93}} The CR formula acted as the basis for the negotiations.{{sfn|Chhabra|pp= 167\u2013168}} Gandhi and Jinnah met in September 1944 to ease the deadlock.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=167}} Gandhi offered the CR formula as his proposal to Jinnah.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=168}} Nevertheless, Gandhi-Jinnah talks failed after two weeks of negotiations.{{sfn|Sen|1997|p= 311}}\n\n==Periyar's reaction==\n\n[[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] supported Rajagopalachari's actions and considered his C. R. Formula to be one of the steps towards the formation of [[Dravida Nadu]]. In a meeting held at [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] on 23 June 1947, Periyar said:\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;I am not dependent on my Dravidian comrades alone, for the separation of Tamil Nadu. Many may not like what I am going to say. But I will say what is in my heart. We are going to soon get the cooperation of my friend and comrade, Acharya (Rajagopalachari), for the separation of Dravida Nadu. Not only him, but all Brahmins&nbsp;... are going to support our demand for separation. Some of our comrades may wonder, if one can believe in Rajagopalachari's words; some may say that his affairs are always doubtful. But till today he has kept all the words he had given to me&nbsp;...

This, according to [[Ayesha Jalal]] (a Pakistani-American sociologist and historian), might well have diluted the enthusiasm of the people of these provinces about going partition. Hence Jinnah rejected the initiative, telling his Council that it was intended to 'torpedo' the Lahore resolution; it was the 'grossest travesty', a 'ridiculous proposal', 'offering a shadow and a husk \u2013 a maimed, mutilated and moth-eaten Pakistan, and thus trying to pass off having met out Pakistan scheme and Muslim demand'.{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=121}} \n\nWhile the formula retained most of the essential services, Jinnah wanted a full partition and any relations would be dealt via [[treaty]] alone.<ref name=\"Wavell\u2019s letter to Amery\" /> Although a failure the CR formula was seen as Congress' betrayal of the [[Sikhs]] by [[Akali Dal]] leaders like [[Master Tara Singh]].{{sfn||Tan|Kudaisya|2002|pp= 108\u2013109}} Since the formula meant vivisection of Punjab, if agreed the Sikh community would be divided. Sikhs did not hold a majority in any single district. Splitting Punjab would leave many on both sides of the dividing line.{{sfn||Tan|Kudaisya|2000|p=108}} The proposal had been attacked by other leaders such as [[V. D.

R. Formula]]\n'''C. Rajagopalachari's formula''' (or ''C. R. formula'' or ''Rajaji formula'') was a proposal formulated by [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] to solve the political deadlock between the [[All India Muslim League]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] on the [[independence of India|independence of British India]]. The League's position was that the [[Islam in India|Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] of [[British India]] were of [[Two-Nation Theory|two separate nations]] and hence the Muslims had the right to their own nation. The Congress, which included both Hindu and Muslim members, was opposed to the idea of partitioning India. With the advent of the [[Second World War]] the British administration required both parties to agree so that Indian help could be sought for the war effort.\n\nC. Rajagopalachari, a Congress leader from Madras, devised a proposal for the Congress to offer the League, the predominantly Muslim region that became [[Pakistan]] based on a [[plebiscite]] of all the people in those regions where Muslims were in the majority. Although the formula was opposed, even within the Congress party, [[Gandhi]] used it as the basis of his proposal in talks with [[Jinnah]] in 1944. However, Jinnah rejected the proposal and the talks failed.\n\n==Congress and League==\n{{Rajaji}}\n{{see also|Indian National Congress|All India Muslim League|Lucknow Pact}}\nThe All India Muslim League was formed in 1906 to \"protect the interests of Muslims\" in British India and to \"represent their needs and aspirations to the Government\".{{sfn|Singh|Brown|Clammer|2008|p=29}} The Indian National Congress, formed in 1885, had demanded [[Swaraj|self-governance in India]].{{sfn|Mishra|1987|pp=73 -75}} In 1916, the League and the Congress entered into a [[Lucknow pact|pact]] in which the League agreed to support the Congress' efforts for home rule in exchange for the Congress' support for a [[Separate Electorate System|two electorate]] system{{sfn|Hardy|1972|pp=187\u2013188}} that would create [[constituencies]] where only Muslims could contest and vote.{{sfn|Dudley-Jenkins|2003|p=160}} In the elections of 1937, Congress emerged as the largest party in seven of the 11 provinces with a clear majority in five ([[Madras Presidency]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Central Provinces and Berar|Central Province]], [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]]).{{sfn|Shakoor|2003|pp=16 \u2013 17}} On the whole, Congress won 716 of the 1161 seats it contested. The League secured 4.8% of the total Muslim votes (winning 25% of the seats allotted for Muslims{{sfn|Kulke|2004|p=314}}) and did not acquire majority in any of the four Muslim predominant provinces ([[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[Sind province (1936-1955)|Sind Province]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier Province]] and [[Bengal Presidency]]).{{sfn|Shakoor|2003|pp=16 \u2013 17}} The League had hoped that its candidates would win the votes over the Congress in Muslim electorates, but was disappointed.{{sfn|Kulke|2004|p=314}} Since Congress had majority in Hindu majority provinces, it refused to share power with the League in those provinces.{{sfn|Kulke, |pp= 314 -315}} The eventual disagreement led to a political tussle between the League and the Congress{{sfn|Shakoor|2003|pp= 186- 189}} climaxing with the League's [[Lahore Resolution]] in March 1940, calling for an independent Muslim nation carved out of British India.{{sfn|Shakoor|2003|pp= 171 \u2013 174}}\n\n==Second World War ==\n{{see also|Second World War}}\nIn September 1939, [[Lord Linlithgow]], the then [[Viceroy of India]], announced that India was at war with Germany.{{sfn|Wolpert}} The Congress Party resigned its provincial seats in protest, stating that the viceroy's decision had pushed India into a war not of India's making and without consulting its people or representatives.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=230}} Nevertheless, many Congress leaders, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] had expressed moral support to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] cause against the [[Nazis]].{{sfn|Kux|1993|p=6}} Congress demanded that if Britain was fighting to protect democracy through the war, it should also establish democracy in India.{{sfn|Chopra|2003|p= 272}} However, both the Viceroy and the Secretary of State for India ([[Leo Amery]]) openly disliked Indian National Congress and its leaders including Gandhi and Nehru.{{sfn|Kux|1993|p=6}} Moreover, since the British Indian army was dominated by Muslims and [[Sikhs]], the government in London was keen to get both these parties' support rather than appeasing Congress.{{sfn|Wolpert}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}} While Jinnah's Muslim League wanted a Muslim Pakistan, Sikhs feared that if India were divided, Punjab would come under Pakistan and hence put the Sikhs under Muslim rule.{{sfn|Tan|Kudaisya|2002|p= 101}} Eventually the British administration concluded that no progress towards Indian statehood could be made unless Congress and the League reached an agreement.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=230}}\n\nWith Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the US entered the war. Later the Japanese [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|invasion of South East Asia]] in 1941 drew the war much closer to India. Congress maintained that it would support the war efforts of Britain provided India was given its freedom.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|p=31}} While the Congress demanded a unified India and that the issue of a Muslim nation be resolved after independence, the League preferred that separate dominions be created first.{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=121}} Jinnah claimed that he wanted \"Pakistan and that commodity is available not in the Congress market but in the British market\".{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=121}} Although the ruling [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] had taken a harsh stance on the Congress, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and its leaders were sympathetic to its efforts.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|p= 34}} The war saw an increase in support in Britain for efforts to solve the crisis between the Raj, Congress and League. It was realised that the deadlock meant that the vast resources of India was not available to the war.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|pp= 34\u201336}} In addition, America had been sympathetic to India's cause, which if not satisfied by the British administration would have further weakened the Allies.{{sfn|Kux|p=s 6\u201311}} With divided opinion within the British government, [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] was sent to India in March 1942.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|p= 40}} Since Cripps was a well known Congress sympathiser who had earlier advised the Congress leaders to \"stand firm as a rock\" on their demands of freedom, he was seen as the best choice for negotiations.{{sfn|Mishra|1982|p= 41}} [[Cripps' mission]] however failed as the Congress declared that he was assuming different stances in private and public with regard to Indian self-governance.<ref>{{cite web|first=Felix |last=Marrow |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/morrow-felix/1942/09/cripps.htm |title=The Truth About the Cripps Mission}}</ref> Cripps' failure to reach an agreement propelled Congress to mount a [[civil disobedience movement]] called [[Quit India movement]].{{sfn|Chopra|2003|pp= 276\u2013277}} In response to the movement, Gandhi and all senior Congress leaders were arrested in August 1942.{{sfn|Chopra|2003|p= 277}}\n\n==Chakravarti Rajagopalachari's role==\n{{see also|C. Rajagopalachari}}\n[[File:Rajaji1939.jpg|right|thumb|125px|[[C. Rajagopalachari]] during a rally in 1939]]\n\nChakravarti Rajagopalachari (or Rajaji as he was commonly referred to) was a prominent Congress leader from Madras.{{sfn|Agrawal, |pp= 101\u2013102}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}} He was a well known follower of Gandhi and was sometimes referred to as Gandhi's ''conscience keeper''.{{sfn|Srinivasan, 2009}} Nonetheless, he proposed that if Muslims in India wanted a partition, Congress should not oppose this.{{sfn|Zakaria|2001|p=88}} Thus he was the earliest Congress leader to acknowledge that partition was inevitable. He considered that, in the then likely scenario of Japanese invasion, India would need the support of the British and hence required the Congress and the League to agree on the constitution of India with urgency.{{sfn|Wolpert}} In April 1942, parts of the Madras Presidency were bombed by Japanese warplanes operating from the aircraft carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d|Ry\u016bj\u014d]]''. [[Arthur Hope, 2nd Baron Rankeillour|Arthur Hope]], the [[Governor of Madras]] advised the people to leave Madras and also moved the secretariat inland.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p= 296}} Rajaji considered this an act of the British administration forsaking the people of Madras and brought resolutions in Madras Legislature Party of the All India Congress Committee that the Congress should concede the demand of Pakistan if the League insisted on it.{{sfn|Ramanathan|2008|p=311}} With severe opposition to the resolutions from the Congress leadership, he resigned from the Congress as per Gandhi's advice.{{sfn|Sinha|2002|pp= 61\u201362}} Thus he did not participate in the Quit India movement and was not arrested with the other Congress leaders.{{sfn|Zakaria|2001|p=88}} Hence he was able to devise a proposal to negotiate with the League.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=167}} This proposal, which was called the CR formula by the popular press{{sfn|Tan|Kudaisya|2002|p=108}} was to recognise the demand for Pakistan in principle and to act as a basis for talks between the League and the Congress.{{sfn|Sen|1997|p=311}}\n\n==The proposal==\n[[File:Gandhi Rajagopalachari.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mohandas Gandhi]] and [[C. Rajagopalachari]] during the Gandhi-Jinnah talks at [[Birla House]], [[Bombay]]]]\nThe CR formula entailed{{sfn|Jayapalan|p= 58}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p= 168}}\n\n:i. The League was to endorse the Indian demand for independence and to co-operate with the Congress in formation of Provisional Interim Government for a transitional period.\n\n:ii. At the end of the War, a commission would be appointed to demarcate the districts having a Muslim population in absolute majority and in those areas plebiscite to be conducted on all inhabitants (including the non-Muslims) on basis of adult suffrage.\n\n:iii. All parties would be allowed to express their stance on the partition and their views before the plebiscite.\n\n:iv. In the event of separation, a mutual agreement would be entered into for safeguarding essential matters such as defence, communication and commerce and for other essential services.\n\n:v. The transfer of population, if any would be absolutely on a voluntary basis.\n\n:vi. The terms of the binding will be applicable only in case of full transfer of power by Britain to Government of India.\n\n==Gandhi-Jinnah talks of 1944==\n\nAs the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] saw more victories, the attitude of British administration towards Congress softened.{{sfn|Zakaria|2001|p= 91}} Moreover, America had been pressing Britain to meet India's demand for self-governance.{{sfn|Kux|1993|pp=6\u201334}} Although other Congress leaders were still in prison Gandhi was released on 5 May 1944.{{sfn|Sakaria|p= 92}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}} After his release Gandhi proposed talks with Jinnah on his two-nation theory and negotiating on issue of partition.{{sfn|Zakaria|p= 93}} The CR formula acted as the basis for the negotiations.{{sfn|Chhabra|pp= 167\u2013168}} Gandhi and Jinnah met in September 1944 to ease the deadlock.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=167}} Gandhi offered the CR formula as his proposal to Jinnah.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=168}} Nevertheless, Gandhi-Jinnah talks failed after two weeks of negotiations.{{sfn|Sen|1997|p= 311}}\n\n==Periyar's reaction==\n\n[[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] supported Rajagopalachari's actions and considered his C. R. Formula to be one of the steps towards the formation of [[Dravida Nadu]]. In a meeting held at [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] on 23 June 1947, Periyar said:\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;I am not dependent on my Dravidian comrades alone, for the separation of Tamil Nadu. Many may not like what I am going to say. But I will say what is in my heart. We are going to soon get the cooperation of my friend and comrade, Acharya (Rajagopalachari), for the separation of Dravida Nadu. Not only him, but all Brahmins&nbsp;... are going to support our demand for separation. Some of our comrades may wonder, if one can believe in Rajagopalachari's words; some may say that his affairs are always doubtful. But till today he has kept all the words he had given to me&nbsp;... When comrade Acharya and myself met, he told forcefully&nbsp;...'Whether we get ''swarajya'' or not, the troubles given by [[North Indians]] must be got rid off'{{sfn|More|2004|pp= 161\u2013162}}|sign=|source=}}\n\n==Causes of failure of the proposal==\n[[File:Jinnah Gandhi.jpg|right|thumb|[[Gandhi]] and [[Jinnah]] in [[Bombay]], September 1944]]\nAlthough the formulation supported the principle of Pakistan, it aimed to show that the provinces that Jinnah claimed as Pakistan contained large numbers of non-Muslims.{{sfn||Tan|Kudaisya|2000|p=108}}  Jinnah had claimed provinces then regarded as Muslim majority regions (in the north-west; [[Sind province (1936-1955)|Sind]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]], the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North-West Frontier Province]] and the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], and in the north-east, [[Assam]] and [[Bengal]]).<ref name=\"Wavell\u2019s letter to Amery\">Wavell's letter to Amery</ref> Thus if a plebiscite was placed, Jinnah ran a risk of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn||Tan|Kudaisya|2000|p=108}} Moreover, Jinnah considered that the League represented all Muslims and the adult franchise demanded by the formula was redundant.{{sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=168}}  Furthermore, the decision of Muslims to secede from India, according to the CR formula, would be taken not just by Muslims alone but by a plebiscite of the entire population even in the Muslim majority districts. This, according to [[Ayesha Jalal]] (a Pakistani-American sociologist and historian), might well have diluted the enthusiasm of the people of these provinces about going partition. Hence Jinnah rejected the initiative, telling his Council that it was intended to 'torpedo' the Lahore resolution; it was the 'grossest travesty', a 'ridiculous proposal', 'offering a shadow and a husk \u2013 a maimed, mutilated and moth-eaten Pakistan, and thus trying to pass off having met out Pakistan scheme and Muslim demand'.{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=121}} \n\nWhile the formula retained most of the essential services, Jinnah wanted a full partition and any relations would be dealt via [[treaty]] alone.<ref name=\"Wavell\u2019s letter to Amery\" /> Although a failure the CR formula was seen as Congress' betrayal of the [[Sikhs]] by [[Akali Dal]] leaders like [[Master Tara Singh]].{{sfn||Tan|Kudaisya|2002|pp= 108\u2013109}} Since the formula meant vivisection of Punjab, if agreed the Sikh community would be divided. Sikhs did not hold a majority in any single district. Splitting Punjab would leave many on both sides of the dividing line.{{sfn||Tan|Kudaisya|2000|p=108}} The proposal had been attacked by other leaders such as [[V. D. Sarvarkar]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nazariapak.info/pak-history/pak-movement/glance/gandh-Jinnahalks-1944.asp |title=Gandhi Jinnah Talks |year=1944}}</ref> and [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]] of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] and [[Srinivas Sastri]] of National Liberal Federation.{{sfn|Sen|1997|p=311}} However, Wavell the then viceroy of India who had earlier insisted on the geographic unity of India,{{sfn|Zakaria|2001|p=91}} stated that the talks based on the CR formula failed because Gandhi himself did \"''not really believe''\" in the proposal nor Jinnah was ready to \"''answer awkward questions''\" which would reveal that he had \"''not thought out the implications of Pakistan''\".<ref name=\"Wavell\u2019s letter to Amery\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Chhabra\n  | first = G.

During the [[American Revolution]], a group of Rebels, hiding beneath the future Keyhouse, discover a portal to another dimension, the [[Leng (plateau)|plains of Leng]] filled with demons who can mesmerize anyone that sees them and possess them through touch. However, when the demons attempt to enter the real world, they transformed into \"whispering\" iron which young smith Benjamin Locke forged into a variety of magical keys, including the Omega Key, which seals the entrance to the dimension. The magic of the Keyhouse gradually evolves over the years, including a spell which causes occupants to forget about the keys and the magic of the house when they pass their 18th birthday. In 1988, a group of teenagers, having used the keys extensively in their high school years to their great delight, decide to open the black door with the Omega Key, hoping to trick a demon into entering the real world in order to provide more metal with which to make more keys. Rendell Locke's younger brother follows the group and is mesmerized by the door and when attempting to walk through it, he is stopped by Dodge who accidentally puts his hand through the door, becoming possessed. After plotting and attempting to kill his friends and enslave the others at the behest of the Child of Leng possessing him, Dodge is killed by Rendell.\n\nMany years later, Dodge's spirit re-enters the physical world through the well at Keyhouse, due to actions taken by Dodge prior to his death. Trapped in the well, Dodge's spirit reaches out to a young abused prodigy, Sam Lesser, and convinces him to attack the Lockes and kill Rendell, looking for the Omega Key, as well as the Anywhere Key, which is capable of freeing Dodge from the well. After the gruesome murder of their father, the Locke kids, Tyler, Kinsey, and Bode move with their mother Nina across the country to Keyhouse and begin discovering its secrets. Sam escapes prison and follows the Lockes to Massachusetts. He attacks the family again at Keyhouse, at which time Dodge tricks Bode into bringing him the Anywhere Key. Dodge escapes from the well, kills Sam and returns to Lovecraft in the same body as he had thirty years before.\n\nDodge re-enters high school under the guise of a new student, intimidating his way into the home of one of Kinsey's teachers and Dodge's former friends. Over the next year, Dodge secretly tries to recover the various keys - in particular the Omega Key - from the children, collecting many, though hindered by Tyler and Kinsey. Dodge is eventually discovered but manages to switch bodies and possess Bode before they can kill him. Now free to explore the house as Bode, Dodge finally finds the Omega Key and plans his takeover after-prom party in the caves. He releases several demons and many of the students are killed. Dodge is ultimately undone by Tyler and Dodge's spirit is forced back into the well, though Bode's empty body is cremated before Bode's soul has a chance to return to it. In the epilogue, Tyler returns to the well to finally free Dodge's spirit from the demon, having used a sliver of whispering iron inherited from his father to forge an \"Alpha Key\" capable of undoing possession. Tyler is able to speak with his father one last time, and he restores Bode's physical form.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe narrative of ''Locke & Key'' has a three-act structure, with each act covering two story arcs.

Some of them are extensively featured in the series, while others are featured very briefly. The known keys are:\n\n* '''Age Key''': Can turn the bearer into an older version of themself, possibly other ages.\n* '''Alpha Key''': Removes demons from possessed people's souls when inserted into their chests. It instantly turns a demon to whispering iron, so if it is still inside the host, it is fatal.\n* '''Angel Key''': Inserted into a harness with large feathered wings, it grants a person the power of winged flight.\n* '''Animal Key''': Used on the right door in Keyhouse, it allows the user to travel through the door and transform into an animal. (It is unclear whether they have choice in the matter. It appears that the key assigns the animal, according to some spiritual affinity.) Returning back through the door transforms a person back into a human. This works for human ghosts that have possessed animal bodies. Animals may also transform into humans if they enter through the opposite side of the door.\n* '''Anywhere Key''': Opens a door to anywhere the bearer can visualize in their mind.\n* '''Chain Key''': Controls the Great Lock, which guards the catacombs with entangling chains.\n* '''Echo Key''': Allows entry to the Keyhouse well house and, with the Echo Key in hand, allows a person to return a spirit from the dead to the world of the living. Leaving through the well house door, however, banishes the spirit back to wherever it came from.\n* '''Gender Key''': Unlocks a half-sized door between rooms which changes the sex of a person who enters it.\n* '''Ghost Key''': When used in the right door in Keyhouse, it separates the soul from the body of whoever travels through the door. The body falls dead while their ghost is free to roam the Keyhouse grounds. Ghost souls can inhabit any other bodies nearby, and clash with other ghosts.\n* '''Giant Key''': This physically large key, once inserted into a keyhole-shaped window in Keyhouse, transforms the bearer into a massive giant.\n* '''Grindhouse Key''': Transforms whatever door it opens into a giant mouth that consumes whatever enters it.\n* '''Harlequin Key''': Unlocks the Harlequin Wardrobe and allows objects not normally inside to be seen.\n* '''Head Key''': Inserted into the base of someone's head, it allows one to peer inside the mind of a person, where memories and mental concepts (including \"sanity\" itself) are represented as tiny beings. The memories can be removed, and swapped between people. Books inserted into a head with the Head Key transfer their contents to the bearer of the key, though in such a situation the knowledge of the text is accurate but superficial.\n* '''Hell Key''': The bearer is automatically the Lord of Hell and has absolute control over Hell.\n* '''Hercules Key''': Embedded in a necklace, it grants the bearer considerable strength and bulk.\n* '''Identity Key''': Upon inserting into the base of one's chin, the bearer can change any aspect of their appearance, including clothes, body, or even gender. Also allows a bearer to forcibly change the appearance of others.\n* '''Jester Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse that contains a number of artifacts and keys.\n* '''Keyhouse Key''': A large key which fits into a stone slab and regenerates the Keyhouse after it is destroyed.\n* '''Matchstick Key''': Creates fires when inserted into a door or touched to an object. Can also cause self-immolation/combustion by inserting into a body.\n* '''Mending Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse into which a broken object can be placed (the cabinet can resize itself to the size of the object). Once the object is locked inside the cabinet, it is repaired. While it can heal severely wounded people, it cannot apparently resurrect the dead.\n* '''Moon Key''': Allows the user to reach and open the Moon like a door, which allows the user to pass on to the afterlife peacefully. Inhabitants who cross the door see the living world like a stage they can observe and afterlife like the backstage of a theater.\n* '''Music Box Key''': Inserted into a magical music box, it will cause the box to play a song that compels whomever is listening to obey its lyrics. Whoever turns the key can supply the commands. Commands are carried out so long as the music is playing and the listener can hear it.\n* ''' Omega Key''': Opens the lock on the demonic door. The first key created.\n* '''Owl Key''': Gives the user control of a mechanical owl.\n* '''Philosophoscope Key''': Gives access to a device that allows viewing of various people and places.\n* '''Reali Key''': Allows passage to alternate dimensions.\n* '''Shadow Key''': Allows its wearer to control shadow creatures, and even the shadows of other people. Shadows are capable of interacting with the material world (often violently) but can be rendered immaterial by bright light. Embedded in a crown, the key is a tremendous source of power for the wearer. \n* '''Skin Key''': A key with a gazing mirror on its handle, it can change the race of whoever is using it.\n* '''Small World Key''': Unlocks a dollhouse replica of Keyhouse, allowing the user to see anything in Keyhouse in realtime. Any interaction with the unlocked dollhouse also occurs within the actual house, such as a house spider entering the dollhouse magically emerging as a giant spider within the real house.\n* '''Splody Key''': Causes explosions in any building it is used within.\n* '''Squirrel/Undertree Key''': Controls squirrels.\n* '''Timeshift Key''': Operates a grandfather clock that allows a user to observe (but not interact with) past events. The clock is limited to a specific time period: the earliest date one can visit is January 13, 1775, and the latest is December 31, 1999.\n* '''Teddy Bear Key''': Animates and controls stuffed teddy bears.\n* '''Thorn Key''': Controls plants, including for offensive purposes.\n* '''Unnamed Riffel Key''': A key created by Hans Riffel, the last person to use whispering iron before Tyler. The key is to the front door of Keyhouse Manor and implements the Riffel Rule, where no one who enters the front door of the house as an adult can directly see the power of the keys. People who age into adulthood will also begin to lose their conscious memories of the keys and their magic.\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n===''Welcome to Lovecraft''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Issue''' !!

During the [[American Revolution]], a group of Rebels, hiding beneath the future Keyhouse, discover a portal to another dimension, the [[Leng (plateau)|plains of Leng]] filled with demons who can mesmerize anyone that sees them and possess them through touch. However, when the demons attempt to enter the real world, they transformed into \"whispering\" iron which young smith Benjamin Locke forged into a variety of magical keys, including the Omega Key, which seals the entrance to the dimension. The magic of the Keyhouse gradually evolves over the years, including a spell which causes occupants to forget about the keys and the magic of the house when they pass their 18th birthday. In 1988, a group of teenagers, having used the keys extensively in their high school years to their great delight, decide to open the black door with the Omega Key, hoping to trick a demon into entering the real world in order to provide more metal with which to make more keys. Rendell Locke's younger brother follows the group and is mesmerized by the door and when attempting to walk through it, he is stopped by Dodge who accidentally puts his hand through the door, becoming possessed. After plotting and attempting to kill his friends and enslave the others at the behest of the Child of Leng possessing him, Dodge is killed by Rendell.\n\nMany years later, Dodge's spirit re-enters the physical world through the well at Keyhouse, due to actions taken by Dodge prior to his death. Trapped in the well, Dodge's spirit reaches out to a young abused prodigy, Sam Lesser, and convinces him to attack the Lockes and kill Rendell, looking for the Omega Key, as well as the Anywhere Key, which is capable of freeing Dodge from the well. After the gruesome murder of their father, the Locke kids, Tyler, Kinsey, and Bode move with their mother Nina across the country to Keyhouse and begin discovering its secrets. Sam escapes prison and follows the Lockes to Massachusetts. He attacks the family again at Keyhouse, at which time Dodge tricks Bode into bringing him the Anywhere Key. Dodge escapes from the well, kills Sam and returns to Lovecraft in the same body as he had thirty years before.\n\nDodge re-enters high school under the guise of a new student, intimidating his way into the home of one of Kinsey's teachers and Dodge's former friends. Over the next year, Dodge secretly tries to recover the various keys - in particular the Omega Key - from the children, collecting many, though hindered by Tyler and Kinsey. Dodge is eventually discovered but manages to switch bodies and possess Bode before they can kill him. Now free to explore the house as Bode, Dodge finally finds the Omega Key and plans his takeover after-prom party in the caves. He releases several demons and many of the students are killed. Dodge is ultimately undone by Tyler and Dodge's spirit is forced back into the well, though Bode's empty body is cremated before Bode's soul has a chance to return to it. In the epilogue, Tyler returns to the well to finally free Dodge's spirit from the demon, having used a sliver of whispering iron inherited from his father to forge an \"Alpha Key\" capable of undoing possession. Tyler is able to speak with his father one last time, and he restores Bode's physical form.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe narrative of ''Locke & Key'' has a three-act structure, with each act covering two story arcs.

Some of them are extensively featured in the series, while others are featured very briefly. The known keys are:\n\n* '''Age Key''': Can turn the bearer into an older version of themself, possibly other ages.\n* '''Alpha Key''': Removes demons from possessed people's souls when inserted into their chests. It instantly turns a demon to whispering iron, so if it is still inside the host, it is fatal.\n* '''Angel Key''': Inserted into a harness with large feathered wings, it grants a person the power of winged flight.\n* '''Animal Key''': Used on the right door in Keyhouse, it allows the user to travel through the door and transform into an animal. (It is unclear whether they have choice in the matter. It appears that the key assigns the animal, according to some spiritual affinity.) Returning back through the door transforms a person back into a human. This works for human ghosts that have possessed animal bodies. Animals may also transform into humans if they enter through the opposite side of the door.\n* '''Anywhere Key''': Opens a door to anywhere the bearer can visualize in their mind.\n* '''Chain Key''': Controls the Great Lock, which guards the catacombs with entangling chains.\n* '''Echo Key''': Allows entry to the Keyhouse well house and, with the Echo Key in hand, allows a person to return a spirit from the dead to the world of the living. Leaving through the well house door, however, banishes the spirit back to wherever it came from.\n* '''Gender Key''': Unlocks a half-sized door between rooms which changes the sex of a person who enters it.\n* '''Ghost Key''': When used in the right door in Keyhouse, it separates the soul from the body of whoever travels through the door. The body falls dead while their ghost is free to roam the Keyhouse grounds. Ghost souls can inhabit any other bodies nearby, and clash with other ghosts.\n* '''Giant Key''': This physically large key, once inserted into a keyhole-shaped window in Keyhouse, transforms the bearer into a massive giant.\n* '''Grindhouse Key''': Transforms whatever door it opens into a giant mouth that consumes whatever enters it.\n* '''Harlequin Key''': Unlocks the Harlequin Wardrobe and allows objects not normally inside to be seen.\n* '''Head Key''': Inserted into the base of someone's head, it allows one to peer inside the mind of a person, where memories and mental concepts (including \"sanity\" itself) are represented as tiny beings. The memories can be removed, and swapped between people. Books inserted into a head with the Head Key transfer their contents to the bearer of the key, though in such a situation the knowledge of the text is accurate but superficial.\n* '''Hell Key''': The bearer is automatically the Lord of Hell and has absolute control over Hell.\n* '''Hercules Key''': Embedded in a necklace, it grants the bearer considerable strength and bulk.\n* '''Identity Key''': Upon inserting into the base of one's chin, the bearer can change any aspect of their appearance, including clothes, body, or even gender. Also allows a bearer to forcibly change the appearance of others.\n* '''Jester Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse that contains a number of artifacts and keys.\n* '''Keyhouse Key''': A large key which fits into a stone slab and regenerates the Keyhouse after it is destroyed.\n* '''Matchstick Key''': Creates fires when inserted into a door or touched to an object. Can also cause self-immolation/combustion by inserting into a body.\n* '''Mending Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse into which a broken object can be placed (the cabinet can resize itself to the size of the object). Once the object is locked inside the cabinet, it is repaired. While it can heal severely wounded people, it cannot apparently resurrect the dead.\n* '''Moon Key''': Allows the user to reach and open the Moon like a door, which allows the user to pass on to the afterlife peacefully. Inhabitants who cross the door see the living world like a stage they can observe and afterlife like the backstage of a theater.\n* '''Music Box Key''': Inserted into a magical music box, it will cause the box to play a song that compels whomever is listening to obey its lyrics. Whoever turns the key can supply the commands. Commands are carried out so long as the music is playing and the listener can hear it.\n* ''' Omega Key''': Opens the lock on the demonic door. The first key created.\n* '''Owl Key''': Gives the user control of a mechanical owl.\n* '''Philosophoscope Key''': Gives access to a device that allows viewing of various people and places.\n* '''Reali Key''': Allows passage to alternate dimensions.\n* '''Shadow Key''': Allows its wearer to control shadow creatures, and even the shadows of other people. Shadows are capable of interacting with the material world (often violently) but can be rendered immaterial by bright light. Embedded in a crown, the key is a tremendous source of power for the wearer. \n* '''Skin Key''': A key with a gazing mirror on its handle, it can change the race of whoever is using it.\n* '''Small World Key''': Unlocks a dollhouse replica of Keyhouse, allowing the user to see anything in Keyhouse in realtime. Any interaction with the unlocked dollhouse also occurs within the actual house, such as a house spider entering the dollhouse magically emerging as a giant spider within the real house.\n* '''Splody Key''': Causes explosions in any building it is used within.\n* '''Squirrel/Undertree Key''': Controls squirrels.\n* '''Timeshift Key''': Operates a grandfather clock that allows a user to observe (but not interact with) past events. The clock is limited to a specific time period: the earliest date one can visit is January 13, 1775, and the latest is December 31, 1999.\n* '''Teddy Bear Key''': Animates and controls stuffed teddy bears.\n* '''Thorn Key''': Controls plants, including for offensive purposes.\n* '''Unnamed Riffel Key''': A key created by Hans Riffel, the last person to use whispering iron before Tyler. The key is to the front door of Keyhouse Manor and implements the Riffel Rule, where no one who enters the front door of the house as an adult can directly see the power of the keys. People who age into adulthood will also begin to lose their conscious memories of the keys and their magic.\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n===''Welcome to Lovecraft''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Issue''' !!

Peyer. Peyer and his partners mined the ore body with explosives, sorted the ore by hand, and hauled the ore to [[Embudo, New Mexico|Embudo]] by wagon, where the nearest rail line was located. At that time, the chief use of lithium was in specialty [[glass]]. However, the ore was contaminated with unrecognized [[tantalite]] which caused serious difficulties with its use, and production ceased in 1924.\n\nThat same year, the Embudo Mining Company was organized by J.L. Danziger and began construction of a mill near Embudo. This was completed and mining resumed in 1927. The main ore body was mined out in 1929 and the mine closed again in 1930. About 3,500 tons of ore were produced with a value of about $140,000. This represented a modest profit over the three years of mill operations but a net loss for the entire period of mining. \n\nHigh demand for tantalum in 1942 for wartime production, and reports going back to 1931 of [[microlite]] at the Harding Mine, led Arthur Montgomery to investigate the old workings. He found considerable rich material in the mine dumps and at the east end of the workings, and he obtained a [[lease purchase contract]] on the mine  property. With a team of six local miners, ore was extracted with chisels and sorted by hand. Concentration of the small but rich quantity of highly valuable ore was problematic, but the U.S. Bureau of Mines Testing Laboratory in Rolla, Missouri, used an experimental gravity separation method to process 33.5 tons of ore and extracted 6137 pounds of 77.55% niobium-tantalum oxide. This was the largest unit of U.S. tantalum production ever recorded. However, a small mill built at Rinconada failed to meet its rated capacity of 12 tons per day.\n\nLithium ores were also mined during this period, and by the time mining paused in 1947, the mine had yielded 41 tons of high-grade [[spodumene]], 558 tons of [[lepidolite]] ore, nearly 500 pounds of placer tantalite-columbite containing an average of 43% tantalum oxide, and 22,116 pounds of microlite concentrates containing an average of 68% tantalum oxide and 7% niobium oxide. The operations were profitable enough to allow Montgomery to purchase the property outright.\n\nDuring 1943, the U.S. Bureau of Mines drilled 39 exploratory cores south of the main workings. The cores showed enough content of\nspodumene and tantalum-niobium minerals to be classified as milling-grade ore. This made the Harding the first\nU.S. pegmatite mine to have blocked-out reserves. These are still in place and could conceivably be mined in the future.\n\n[[Beryl]] had been recognized as a minor accessory mineral at the mine from its inception. However, this was so easily confused with the abundant [[albite]] and [[quartz]] of the pegmatite that it was not until 1942 that the U.S. Geological Survey recognized that beryl was abundant at the mine. In 1944 Montgomery found a single block of beryl weighing almost 100 pounds at one of the dumps, then uncovered a lens of beryl at the west end of the workings. This produced 23 tons of ore containing 11% beryllium oxide. However, full-scale beryllium mining did not begin until 1950. Ore production reached a ton per day, in spite of the difficulties of hand sorting the beryl from the nearly indistinguishable feldspar and quartz [[gangue]]. \n\nIn 1950 and 1951, beryl production exceeded 150 tons, making New Mexico the leading beryl-producing state. Production averaged 100 tons per year until 1950, when the death of Montgomery's partner, Flaudio Griego, ended mining operations. Operations were simple, using a crew of four men to mine and hand sort the ore, which was taken out on \"Beryl\", the mine's mule. Production totaled  690 tons of high-grade ore with 11.2% beryllium oxide and 184 tons of lower-grade ore with 5.5% beryllium oxide, as well as small production of lepidolite.<ref name=\"je1976\"/>\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Harding pegmatite intrudes along the boundary between the [[amphibolite]] and [[schist]] facies of the [[Vadito Group]].<ref name=\"je1976\"/> <ref name=\"jdft2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=James V., III |last2=Daniel |first2=Christopher G. |last3=Frei |first3=Dirk |last4=Thrane |first4=Kristine |title=Revised regional correlations and tectonic implications of Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks in northern New Mexico, USA: New findings from detrital zircon studies of the Hondo Group, Vadito Group, and Marque\u00f1as Formation |journal=Geosphere |date=2011 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=974\u2013991 |doi=10.1130/GES00614.1 |url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/geosphere/article-lookup/7/4/974 |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The various outcroppings form a belt about 2500 feet long and 150 to 500 feet wide.

The pegmatite is zoned subhorizontally into the following zones:\n* At the upper contact with the Vadito amphibolite facies: A white border rind, 1 to 2 inches thick, of fine-grained quartz-albite muscovite pegmatite.\n* A continuous layer, typically 1 to 5 feet thick but up to 14 feet thick, of very coarse quartz, albite, and muscovite. This zone also contains [[microcline]], and has abundant accessory [[apatite]], beryl, and tantalite. Beryl is occasionally very coarse and abundant.\n* A continuous layer of massive quartz, typically 2 to 8 feet in thickness, but up to 20 to 35 feet. This zone is also rich in muscovite, microcline, and [[cleavelandite]].\n[[File:Hadring Mine quartz zone.jpg|thumb|Massive quartz zone of the Harding Mine showing adits]]\n* A spectacular quartz and lath-spodumene zone. This zone is typically 6 to 20 feet thick but locally fills the entire interior of the dike to a thickness of 20 to 40 feet. The spodumene occurs as blade-like crystals, sometimes of enormous size, mostly oriented at random but sometimes arranged to form a comb-like structure. Accessory minerals are beryl, apatite, microcline, and tantalum-niobium minerals, especially in the lower part of this zone. There is some [[Pseudomorph|pseudomorphic]] replacement of spodumene by rose muscovite and quartz by cleavelandite.\n[[File:Harding quarz rose muscovite zone.jpg|thumb|Quartz/rose muscovite zone of the Harding zoned pegmatite]]\n* The core of the dike, known as \"spotted rock\", which is relatively fine-grained spodumene, microcline, and quartz, with accompanying finer-grained albite, lithium-bearing muscovite, lepidolite, microlite, and tantalite.

The abundant fine-grained albite is sugary in appearance.\n[[File:Harding aplite.jpg|thumb|Aplite zone at the Harding Mine]]\n\nAdditional accessory minerals, of no economic importance but of interest to mineral collectors, include [[almandine]], [[spessartine]], and [[pyrochlore]].<ref name=\"je1976\"/> \n\n<gallery>\nFile:View Looking East from the Harding Pegmatite Mine near Dixon, New Mexico USA 02.jpg|Massive quartz pegmatite\nFile:Muscovite-157168.jpg|Lithium muscovite\nFile:Piemontite-Zoisite-261789.jpg|Unusual piemontite-zoisite\nFile:Harding Mine Cleavelandite.jpg|Cleavelandite\nFile:Harding Mine apatite.jpg|Apatite\n</gallery>\n\nGeochemical analysis and analysis of fluid inclusions suggests the pegmatite was injected at temperatures near 600\u00b0 C at a depth of 6.0 to 7.5 km (2.0 to 2.5 kbar). The primary zones crystallized under closed-system conditions a temperature of 525\u00b0 to 425\u00b0 C. A separate immiscible CO2-H20 volatile-rich fluid was present in\nthe pegmatite system during crystallization of the\nprimary pegmatite zones. The sugary albite zone\nformed from a residual Na-rich magma as a \nresponse to late-stage pressure release. Saline brines caused\nlepidolite replacement at temperatures near 265\u00b0 C. Finally, small pockets of quartz, feldspar and microlite were crystallized.\n\n==Ownership==\nIn 1974, Arthur Montgomery offered to donate the property to the University of New Mexico. The university leased the property for four years while making numerous improvements, which include a walking tour of the mine. Because the mine property included both patented and unpatented\nclaims, transfer of the title required an act of Congress (Senate Bill 1403). The United States retains the right to mine strategic minerals should it become necessary for the security of the United States.\n\nPersons wishing to visit the mine must contact the Chairman, Department of Geology, University of New Mexico, 87131 to obtain permission (which is almost always granted) and release forms. <ref name=\"bccelr1979\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Geology of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Mines in New Mexico]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox mine\n| name                   = Harding Mine\n| image                  = View Looking East from the Harding Pegmatite Mine near Dixon, New Mexico USA 03.jpg\n| width                  =\n| alt                    = \n| caption                = The Harding Pegmatite mine is a former beryl quarry in New Mexico.\n| pushpin_map            = New Mexico\n| pushpin_label_position =\n| pushpin_label          =\n| pushpin_map_alt        =\n| pushpin_mapsize        = 180\n| pushpin_map_caption    =\n| coordinates            = {{coord|36.1928|N|105.7946|W|region:US-UT_scale:100000|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| place                  = [[Picuris Mountains]]\n| subdivision_type       = State\n| state/province         = New Mexico\n| country                = United States\n| products               = Beryl, lithium, tantalum\n| financial year         =\n| type                   = [[Adit|Adit mine]]\n| amount                 = <!--include units--> \n| opening year           = {{Start date|1906}}\n| active years           = <!-- use only if inactive for a period of time-->\n| closing year           =\n| discovery year         = 1918\n| owner                  = [[University of New Mexico]]\n| official website       = <!-- {{URL|example.com}} -->\n| acquisition year       = 1979<ref name=\"bccelr1979\">{{cite journal |last1=Brookins |first1=Douglas G. |last2=Chakoumakos |first2=Bryan C. |last3=Cook |first3=Clarence W. |last4=Ewing |first4=Rodney C. |last5=Landis |first5=Gary P. |last6=Register |first6=Marcia E. |title=THE HARDING PEGMATITE: SUMMARY OF RECENT RESEARCH |journal=New Mexico Geological Society Field Conference Series |date=1979 |volume=30 |page=127 |url=https://nmgs.nmt.edu/publications/guidebooks/downloads/30/30_p0127_p0133.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n| nrhp                   =\n}}\nThe '''Harding Pegmatite Mine''' is a former [[Adit|adit mine]] that extracted [[lithium]], [[tantalum]], and [[beryllium]] from a [[Precambrian]] [[pegmatite]] [[sill]].

Much of the spodumene and microcline have been extensively corroded and replaced by fine-grained micas.\n[[File:Harding spotted rock.jpg|thumb|\"Spotted rock\" of the Harding pegmatite]]\n\nThese zones are mirrored at the base of the pegmatite, except that the lower zones tend to be poorer in beryl and more [[aplite|aplitic]] than pegmatitic. The abundant fine-grained albite is sugary in appearance.\n[[File:Harding aplite.jpg|thumb|Aplite zone at the Harding Mine]]\n\nAdditional accessory minerals, of no economic importance but of interest to mineral collectors, include [[almandine]], [[spessartine]], and [[pyrochlore]].<ref name=\"je1976\"/> \n\n<gallery>\nFile:View Looking East from the Harding Pegmatite Mine near Dixon, New Mexico USA 02.jpg|Massive quartz pegmatite\nFile:Muscovite-157168.jpg|Lithium muscovite\nFile:Piemontite-Zoisite-261789.jpg|Unusual piemontite-zoisite\nFile:Harding Mine Cleavelandite.jpg|Cleavelandite\nFile:Harding Mine apatite.jpg|Apatite\n</gallery>\n\nGeochemical analysis and analysis of fluid inclusions suggests the pegmatite was injected at temperatures near 600\u00b0 C at a depth of 6.0 to 7.5 km (2.0 to 2.5 kbar). The primary zones crystallized under closed-system conditions a temperature of 525\u00b0 to 425\u00b0 C. A separate immiscible CO2-H20 volatile-rich fluid was present in\nthe pegmatite system during crystallization of the\nprimary pegmatite zones. The sugary albite zone\nformed from a residual Na-rich magma as a \nresponse to late-stage pressure release. Saline brines caused\nlepidolite replacement at temperatures near 265\u00b0 C. Finally, small pockets of quartz, feldspar and microlite were crystallized.\n\n==Ownership==\nIn 1974, Arthur Montgomery offered to donate the property to the University of New Mexico. The university leased the property for four years while making numerous improvements, which include a walking tour of the mine. Because the mine property included both patented and unpatented\nclaims, transfer of the title required an act of Congress (Senate Bill 1403). The United States retains the right to mine strategic minerals should it become necessary for the security of the United States.\n\nPersons wishing to visit the mine must contact the Chairman, Department of Geology, University of New Mexico, 87131 to obtain permission (which is almost always granted) and release forms. <ref name=\"bccelr1979\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Geology of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Mines in New Mexico]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toSill(link changed toSill (geology)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harding_Pegmatite_Mine"}
