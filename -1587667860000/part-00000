It is located in the [[Vale of White Horse]] near the [[River Thames]], across the road from the twelfth-century [[Norman architecture|Norman]] Hall and the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor House]]. The Abbey has been recognised by the [[Historic buildings council|Historic Building Council for England]] (now [[Historic England]]) as a building of outstanding historic and [[architecture|architectural]] interest.<ref name=abbeyarchives>The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay archives.</ref> It is considered to be a \u2018textbook\u2019 example of an English medieval [[manor house]]{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} and has been a [[listed building#Grade I|Grade I-listed]] building since 1952.<ref name=listed />\n\nThe Abbey has its origins in the thirteenth century as a [[clergy house|rectory]] of [[Abingdon Abbey]], a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] up north in [[Abingdon-on-Thames]]. Several construction phases took place during the Middle Ages, carried out by prominent figures like [[Solomon of Rochester]], [[Thomas Beckington]] and [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], but it wasn't until the seventeenth century that the current plan was completed.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}} It was probably during the [[Victorian era]] that the house obtained the name 'The Abbey'.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> From 1495 to 1867, The Abbey was in possession of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]], who leased the estate among others to [[John Fettiplace (politician died 1580)|John Fettiplace]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAfter being inhabited by [[Evelyn St. Croix Fleming]], the estate was bought by [[David Astor]] in 1958, who leased it to the [[Ockenden International|Ockenden Venture]] which offered sanctuary to refugees and displaced children. In the 70s, The Abbey was lent to the exiled Bishop [[Colin Winter]] to house the [[Namibia International Peace Centre]]. In 1978, the [[Astor family]] sold the house and in 1980 it came into possession of The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] led by Dr. [[Fred Blum]] and Bishop [[Stephen Verney]].<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The New Era Centre used The Abbey as a [[retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] and conference centre, and changed its name to '''The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay''' in the 1990s.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> \n\nThe Abbey, Sutton Courtenay is a residential centre in which a [[spiritualism|spiritual]] community offers hospitality to people who are seeking spiritual refreshment, [[personal development|personal growth]] and [[healing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=278687&subid=0|title=The Abbey Sutton Courtenay Limited|website=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> The Abbey also organises public events concerning spirituality, personal development, education, music and the arts.<ref name=abingdon />\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Plan_of_The_Abbey,_Sutton_Courtenay.png|thumb|A plan of the main building (ground floor).]]\nThe Abbey forms a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with an inner [[courtyard]]. It has 28 rooms and a [[great hall]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The building has two storeys and has clay roof tiles on a structure made with stone and timber. Originally, it had a thatched roof. Four ranges are arranged around the central courtyard. The oldest still surviving parts of The Abbey are the north and west ranges, the frames of which were originally from wood, parts of which were later encased in stone in order to stabilise the structure.\n\nNowadays, there is also a guest house which is used for customers, conference guests and visitors. It is adjacent to the main house and it has its own kitchen with a dining area. In total, the guest house has nine rooms, of which five are twin rooms and four single.<ref name=abbeystaying>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/staying-at-the-abbey/|title=Staying at The Abbey|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, The Abbey's main entrance to was through a rear door of the passage separating the service wing from the great hall. Nowadays, the main entrance is on the east side with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arch, a 1980s insertion replacing a narrow door, leading to the courtyard.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}}\n\nNineteenth-century accounts of the site show many inaccuracies.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Edward Blore]] made sketches of the interior of the hall and of the house as seen from the northwest, which served as the basis of the engravings published by [[John Henry Parker]] in 1853.{{sfn|Parker|1853|p=272}} Parker also published a plan, but this was inaccurate in detail.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Peter Spencer Spokes]] and John M.

The wing is largely timber-framed. On the ground floor at the southwest end, the wing seems to incorporate a stone wall of an earlier structure, in which lateral chimney stacks have been built with fire places dating from the nineteenth century. The plastered stone wall on the south side, which is of timber above the first floor, is an underbuilding for an [[overhang (architecture)|overhang]]. The north wall consists of large [[ashlar]] blocks suggesting that that was done between the fifteenth and seventeenth century and it had a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] window. Its timber-framed north wall is also the south wall of the great hall. The [[dormer]] roof between the truss of the great hall and the service wing is done in a thirteenth-century technique. The roof of the service wing itself, however, is post-medieval.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} Today, the service wing houses accommodation and a [[solitary confinement|meditation room]].<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nThe great hall was originally timber-framed and integrated with the contemporary service wing. It was cased in stone between 1320 and 1340 to prevent deforming of the base crucks under [[shear stress]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} The hall has two equal [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and the four two-light windows have been replaced in the twentieth century by three-light Perpendicular windows. The stonework of the northern doorway was largely renewed in the nineteenth century. It has wave-moulded [[jamb]]s, [[voussoir]]s and an [[ogee]]-scroll [[hood mould]]. The original southern doorway was less important and similar in style, but with [[chamfer]]ed jambs. The east wall abuts the north range with a straight joint, while the joint of the north range with the west wall is obscured by plaster. The doorway in the east wall has been rebuilt in brick.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} The west wall of the hall is [[battlement|castellated]] and probably early nineteenth century.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The great hall survives open to the roof, with one cruck truss carrying a [[king post]] which is unique in that a ceiling has never hidden it.<ref name=abbeyhistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/history/|title=The Abbey - 800 Years of History|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref> The workmanship of the timber structure is of exceptional quality. The main timbers are made from very large trees carefully sawn to avoid waney edges.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=231}} All four posts have been made from the same tree. The structure has nineteenth- and twentieth-century renovations.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} It has a wooden floor and can accommodate up to sixty people seated.<ref name=abbeystaying />\n\n=== North range ===\n[[File:Library, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay 01.jpg|thumb|The library.]]\nIn the courtyard between the north and west range is a timber-framed staircase outshut, dating from before the stone casing of the early fourteenth century. The stair is modern and leads to a door on the first floor of the north range. The outshut roof was probably repaired in the seventeenth century with an inserted [[purlin]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe northern range is roofed in six bays. The western three bays were originally also built in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, while the eastern three bays of the northern range have timber work in the roof that indicates a fifteenth-century date.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe finish of the timbers of the three western bays in the north range is of inferior quality to that of the hall. On the ground floor was a [[parlour]] now used as a dining room, located under the two most western bays. The walls of this parlour vary in size. The west wall contains a three-light Perpendicular window, the north wall contains three two-light ones. The present fireplace is modern but there must have been a chimney since the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=234}} East of the parlour, the floor level rises and there is a [[cross passage]]. The door at the north end of the passage became blocked and was reopened only in the 1980s. East to the passage, under the third bay from the west, is a lodged floor. Originally, the bay was divided in a room to the north and a narrow room or corridor to the south.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}} The first floor originally served as a [[great chamber]], the second most important room in a medieval English manor house. This chamber was entered through a door from the staircase outshut. It is dominated by two fourteenth-century two-light [[transom (architecture)|transom]] windows in the west [[gable]] and in the north wall. The reveals of a third window also remain in the north wall.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The present fireplace has [[musician]] [[corbel]]s from the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Wood |1965 |p=XVIIE (plate)}} The roof structure was similar to the open roof of the great hall until probably the seventeenth century, when the room was separated into two rooms, with a corridor on the south side of the eastern room. These rooms now serve as the library and dining room respectively.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\n[[File:Solar, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The [[solar (room)|solar]].]]\nOn the ground floor of the three eastern bays, the third bay from the east was probably open to the roof and is nowadays part of the same room with the third bay from the west (the room east of the parlour). It has a small [[lancet window]] in the northern wall at the base of the chimney. The two eastern most bays formed one room and has a modern partition from a corridor to the south. The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace. There may have been a partition in the middle of the room before the fireplace was built. The solar has a partition to the east behind which was a [[chapel]] and a door from the north to the east range.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}}\n\n=== East range ===\n[[File:Arch, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|East entrance looking into the courtyard.]]\nToday, the east range holds the entrance archway. It was constructed around 1500 and contains three bays. The modern gatehouse, at the northern end of the east range, has a lancet window in its east wall. It has a jettied wooden frame upper part standing on stone walls.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> \n\nSouth of the archway, the wall was timber framed but later partially infilled with brick and rubble as far as the chimney, where it abuts the south range. This timber framed wall is on a different alignment than the gatehouse, probably to unite with the south wall of the southeastern block, which may have been a wall around the building rather than part of a building.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\nThe roof of the southern bay of the east range was black-smokened and may have served as a kitchen or [[brewhouse]] at some time into which a chimney was later inserted.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== South range ===\n[[File:Hearth, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The Hearth, a meeting room in the south range.]]\nThe adjoining southeast corner block appears to have been roofed, probably in the seventeenth century, to connect the east range with the south range. The construction of this block completed the courtyard plan.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} \n\nThe south range extends the service wing and was added during the mid-sixteenth century. The two storey structure consisting of three bays was open to the eaves and was once used for the kitchen.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nNowadays, the southeast corner block contains a meeting room called 'The Hearth', seating up to eighteen people.<ref name=abbeystaying /> The south range now serves as the administration office of The Abbey.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:Avenue1, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The lime tree avenue.]]\n[[File:Courtyard2, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The courtyard garden.]]\nIn 1804, Francis Justice, who was in possession of the estate at the time, was allotted over two acres on the green north of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} As a result of this enlargement of the [[curtilage]], The Abbey now stands in the midst of extensive grounds and is approached by a [[Tilia|lime tree]] [[avenue (landscape)|avenue]] across the enclosure allotment, leading near to the east of the house. Although the avenue across the grounds appears to have existed before the enclosure (some trees are older than 1804) the house stood on the eastern edge of its curtilage until 1798. The old boundary wall survives, only circa two meters beyond the east wall of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} Nowadays, The Abbey consists of six acres of grounds which are of [[archaeology|archaeological]] importance because the remains of ancillary buildings underlie the gardens.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The [[perimeter]] is indicated by old stone walls, wooden fencing and dead hedging.\n\nSome four and a half acres of the land are used as gardens. On the north lawn, there is a [[Platanus|plane tree]] surrounded by [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]]. Here grow [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[beech]], [[bramble]], various [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]], [[Hedera|ivy]], [[oak]], [[Rhododendron|rhododendrons]] and [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]] trees. There are also [[Lauraceae|laurels]], winter-flowering ''[[Viburnum]]'', [[Symphoricarpos|snowberry]], a young [[Prunus serrulata|Japanese cherry]] and [[maple]]. A trunk and several branches from an old [[Fagus sylvatica#Cultivation|copper beech]] serve as a place for [[fungus|fungi]] and [[lichen]]s to grow on. Under the trees, there is a purpose built woodstore. On the west lawn, there is a [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London planetree]]. The south lawn has a [[labyrinth]] in it, where the [[maypole]] is erected. This lawn as young [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and several varieties of [[apple]] and [[plum]] trees. Furthermore, The Abbey has mature [[live oak]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[Prunus subg.

In the eleventh century, [[William the Conquerer]] granted the estate of Sutton to the [[House of Courtenay]], and the village became Sutton Courtenay.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> In 1090, King [[William II of England]] granted the [[All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay|church of Sutton]] and its lands and [[tithe]]s to the monks of Abingdon Abbey.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAbingdon Abbey constructed The Abbey as a [[monastic grange]], used as an administrative centre for the abbey's land and tithe holdings.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> However, the owner of the hide of land, Alwi the priest (whose father owned the land before him according to the [[Domesday Book]]), agreed with the [[abbot]] that he should retain Sutton with reversion first to his son and thereafter to the abbey, on condition of giving in [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton]] chapelry immediately.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=28}} Almost certainly in the late twelfth century, Abingdon Abbey took two thirds of the tithes and the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] the remaining third.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=104-5}} In 1258, following a dispute, the land was formally appropriated to the abbey and a [[clergy house|vicarage]] was ordained.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=106}} As it was close to Abingdon Abbey, it was probably run by the monks themselves rather than being left to a steward.<ref name=berkshirehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html|title=The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2004|work=Royal Berkshire History|author=David Nash Ford}}</ref> In 1278, however, [[Hugh de Courtenay]], Lord of the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor of Sutton]], sued the abbey for [[advowson]].

Many of these men rarely visited Sutton, leaving the running of The Abbey to various underlings. William Steele, rector in 1371, left money to each of his four servants in Sutton. Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory. Colnet was the doctor of King [[Henry V of England]] and was rector until 1420. He left money to the church and poor of Sutton.<ref>[[Berkshire Record Office]], D/EP 7/123.</ref> [[Thomas Beckington]], rector since 1420 and secretary of King [[Henry VI of England]], stayed at Sutton twice in 1442 and perhaps on other occasions.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} The ceiling of the solar is attributed to Beckington.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> In 1442, he was accompanied by [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], who succeeded him as rector when Beckington became [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] in 1443.{{sfn |Fletcher |1990 |p=60-2}} In 1444, Say obtained license to celebrate divine office in the house.

The first one can be attributed to Solomon of Rochester between 1284 and 1290. The second phase was between ca. 1320 and 1340, when among others the casing of the hall in stone was done.

From 1669 onwards, the lease was held by the Justices of Sutton.{{sfn |Dalton |1957 |p=377-8}} In the late eighteenth century, the Justices began to extend the original leasehold curtilage by buying the freehold of adjoining tenements.

It is located in the [[Vale of White Horse]] near the [[River Thames]], across the road from the twelfth-century [[Norman architecture|Norman]] Hall and the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor House]]. The Abbey has been recognised by the [[Historic buildings council|Historic Building Council for England]] (now [[Historic England]]) as a building of outstanding historic and [[architecture|architectural]] interest.<ref name=abbeyarchives>The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay archives.</ref> It is considered to be a \u2018textbook\u2019 example of an English medieval [[manor house]]{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} and has been a [[listed building#Grade I|Grade I-listed]] building since 1952.<ref name=listed />\n\nThe Abbey has its origins in the thirteenth century as a [[clergy house|rectory]] of [[Abingdon Abbey]], a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] up north in [[Abingdon-on-Thames]]. Several construction phases took place during the Middle Ages, carried out by prominent figures like [[Solomon of Rochester]], [[Thomas Beckington]] and [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], but it wasn't until the seventeenth century that the current plan was completed.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}} It was probably during the [[Victorian era]] that the house obtained the name 'The Abbey'.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> From 1495 to 1867, The Abbey was in possession of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]], who leased the estate among others to [[John Fettiplace (politician died 1580)|John Fettiplace]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAfter being inhabited by [[Evelyn St. Croix Fleming]], the estate was bought by [[David Astor]] in 1958, who leased it to the [[Ockenden International|Ockenden Venture]] which offered sanctuary to refugees and displaced children. In the 70s, The Abbey was lent to the exiled Bishop [[Colin Winter]] to house the [[Namibia International Peace Centre]]. In 1978, the [[Astor family]] sold the house and in 1980 it came into possession of The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] led by Dr. [[Fred Blum]] and Bishop [[Stephen Verney]].<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The New Era Centre used The Abbey as a [[retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] and conference centre, and changed its name to '''The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay''' in the 1990s.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> \n\nThe Abbey, Sutton Courtenay is a residential centre in which a [[spiritualism|spiritual]] community offers hospitality to people who are seeking spiritual refreshment, [[personal development|personal growth]] and [[healing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=278687&subid=0|title=The Abbey Sutton Courtenay Limited|website=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> The Abbey also organises public events concerning spirituality, personal development, education, music and the arts.<ref name=abingdon />\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Plan_of_The_Abbey,_Sutton_Courtenay.png|thumb|A plan of the main building (ground floor).]]\nThe Abbey forms a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with an inner [[courtyard]]. It has 28 rooms and a [[great hall]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The building has two storeys and has clay roof tiles on a structure made with stone and timber. Originally, it had a thatched roof. Four ranges are arranged around the central courtyard. The oldest still surviving parts of The Abbey are the north and west ranges, the frames of which were originally from wood, parts of which were later encased in stone in order to stabilise the structure.\n\nNowadays, there is also a guest house which is used for customers, conference guests and visitors. It is adjacent to the main house and it has its own kitchen with a dining area. The guest house has nine rooms in total, five twins and four single rooms.<ref name=abbeystaying>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/staying-at-the-abbey/|title=Staying at The Abbey|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, The Abbey's main entrance to was through a rear door of the passage separating the service wing from the great hall. Nowadays, the main entrance is on the east side with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arch, a 1980s insertion replacing a narrow door, leading to the courtyard.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}}\n\nNineteenth-century accounts of the site show many inaccuracies.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Edward Blore]] made sketches of the interior of the hall and of the house as seen from the northwest, which served as the basis of the engravings published by [[John Henry Parker]] in 1853.{{sfn|Parker|1853|p=272}} Parker also published a plan, but this was inaccurate in detail.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Peter Spencer Spokes]] and John M.

The wing is largely timber-framed. On the ground floor at the southwest end, the wing seems to incorporate a stone wall of an earlier structure, in which lateral chimney stacks have been built with fire places dating from the nineteenth century. The plastered stone wall on the south side, which is of timber above the first floor, is an underbuilding for an [[overhang (architecture)|overhang]]. The north wall consists of large [[ashlar]] blocks suggesting that that was done between the fifteenth and seventeenth century and it had a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] window. Its timber-framed north wall is also the south wall of the great hall. The [[dormer]] roof between the truss of the great hall and the service wing is done in a thirteenth-century technique. The roof of the service wing itself, however, is post-medieval.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} Today, the service wing houses accommodation and a [[solitary confinement|meditation room]].<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nThe great hall was originally timber-framed and integrated with the contemporary service wing. It was cased in stone between 1320 and 1340 to prevent deforming of the base crucks under [[shear stress]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} The hall has two equal [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and the four two-light windows have been replaced in the twentieth century by three-light Perpendicular windows. The stonework of the northern doorway was largely renewed in the nineteenth century. It has wave-moulded [[jamb]]s, [[voussoir]]s and an [[ogee]]-scroll [[hood mould]]. The original southern doorway was less important and similar in style, but with [[chamfer]]ed jambs. The east wall abuts the north range with a straight joint, while the joint of the north range with the west wall is obscured by plaster. The doorway in the east wall has been rebuilt in brick.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} The west wall of the hall is [[battlement|castellated]] and probably early nineteenth century.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The great hall survives open to the roof, with one cruck truss carrying a [[king post]] which is unique in that a ceiling has never hidden it.<ref name=abbeyhistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/history/|title=The Abbey - 800 Years of History|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref> The workmanship of the timber structure is of exceptional quality. The main timbers are made from very large trees carefully sawn to avoid waney edges.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=231}} All four posts have been made from the same tree. The structure has nineteenth- and twentieth-century renovations.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} It has a wooden floor and can accommodate up to sixty people seated.<ref name=abbeystaying />\n\n=== North range ===\n[[File:Library, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay 01.jpg|thumb|The library.]]\nIn the courtyard between the north and west range is a timber-framed staircase outshut, dating from before the stone casing of the early fourteenth century. The stair is modern and leads to a door on the first floor of the north range. The outshut roof was probably repaired in the seventeenth century with an inserted [[purlin]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe northern range is roofed in six bays. The western three bays were originally also built in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, while the eastern three bays of the northern range have timber work in the roof that indicates a fifteenth-century date.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe finish of the timbers of the three western bays in the north range is of inferior quality to that of the hall. On the ground floor was a [[parlour]] now used as a dining room, located under the two most western bays. The walls of this parlour vary in size. The west wall contains a three-light Perpendicular window, the north wall contains three two-light ones. The present fireplace is modern but there must have been a chimney since the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=234}} East of the parlour, the floor level rises and there is a [[cross passage]]. The door at the north end of the passage became blocked and was reopened only in the 1980s. East to the passage, under the third bay from the west, is a lodged floor. Originally, the bay was divided in a room to the north and a narrow room or corridor to the south.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}} The first floor originally served as a [[great chamber]], the second most important room in a medieval English manor house. This chamber was entered through a door from the staircase outshut. It is dominated by two fourteenth-century two-light [[transom (architecture)|transom]] windows in the west [[gable]] and in the north wall. The reveals of a third window also remain in the north wall.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The present fireplace has [[musician]] [[corbel]]s from the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Wood |1965 |p=XVIIE (plate)}} The roof structure was similar to the open roof of the great hall until probably the seventeenth century, when the room was separated into two rooms, with a corridor on the south side of the eastern room. These rooms now serve as the library and dining room respectively.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\n[[File:Solar, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The [[solar (room)|solar]].]]\nOn the ground floor of the three eastern bays, the third bay from the east was probably open to the roof and is nowadays part of the same room with the third bay from the west (the room east of the parlour). It has a small [[lancet window]] in the northern wall at the base of the chimney. The two eastern most bays formed one room and has a modern partition from a corridor to the south. The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace. There may have been a partition in the middle of the room before the fireplace was built. The solar has a partition to the east behind which was a [[chapel]] and a door from the north to the east range.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}}\n\n=== East range ===\n[[File:Arch, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|East entrance looking into the courtyard.]]\nToday, the east range holds the entrance archway. It was constructed around 1500 and contains three bays. The modern gatehouse, at the northern end of the east range, has a lancet window in its east wall. It has a jettied wooden frame upper part standing on stone walls.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> \n\nSouth of the archway, the wall was timber framed but later partially infilled with brick and rubble as far as the chimney, where it abuts the south range. This timber framed wall is on a different alignment than the gatehouse, probably to unite with the south wall of the southeastern block, which may have been a wall around the building rather than part of a building.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\nThe roof of the southern bay of the east range was black-smokened and may have served as a kitchen or [[brewhouse]] at some time into which a chimney was later inserted.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== South range ===\n[[File:Hearth, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The Hearth, a meeting room in the south range.]]\nThe adjoining southeast corner block appears to have been roofed, probably in the seventeenth century, to connect the east range with the south range. The construction of this block completed the courtyard plan.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} \n\nThe south range extends the service wing and was added during the mid-sixteenth century. The two storey structure consisting of three bays was open to the eaves and was once used for the kitchen.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nNowadays, the southeast corner block contains a meeting room called 'The Hearth', seating up to eighteen people.<ref name=abbeystaying /> The south range now serves as the administration office of The Abbey.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:Avenue1, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The lime tree avenue.]]\n[[File:Courtyard2, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The courtyard garden.]]\nIn 1804, Francis Justice, who was in possession of the estate at the time, was allotted over two acres on the green north of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} As a result of this enlargement of the [[curtilage]], The Abbey now stands in the midst of extensive grounds and is approached by a [[Tilia|lime tree]] [[avenue (landscape)|avenue]] across the enclosure allotment, leading near to the east of the house. Although the avenue across the grounds appears to have existed before the enclosure (some trees are older than 1804) the house stood on the eastern edge of its curtilage until 1798. The old boundary wall survives, only circa two meters beyond the east wall of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} Nowadays, The Abbey consists of six acres of grounds which are of [[archaeology|archaeological]] importance because the remains of ancillary buildings underlie the gardens.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The [[perimeter]] is indicated by old stone walls, wooden fencing and dead hedging.\n\nSome four and a half acres of the land are used as gardens. On the north lawn, there is a [[Platanus|plane tree]] surrounded by [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]]. Here grow [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[beech]], [[bramble]], various [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]], [[Hedera|ivy]], [[oak]], [[Rhododendron|rhododendrons]] and [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]] trees. There are also [[Lauraceae|laurels]], winter-flowering ''[[Viburnum]]'', [[Symphoricarpos|snowberry]], a young [[Prunus serrulata|Japanese cherry]] and [[maple]]. A trunk and several branches from an old [[Fagus sylvatica#Cultivation|copper beech]] serve as a place for [[fungus|fungi]] and [[lichen]]s to grow on. Under the trees, there is a purpose built woodstore. On the west lawn, there is a [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London planetree]]. The south lawn has a [[labyrinth]] in it, where the [[maypole]] is erected. This lawn as young [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and several varieties of [[apple]] and [[plum]] trees. Furthermore, The Abbey has mature [[live oak]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[Prunus subg. Padus|bird cherry]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] and a [[Cedrus libani|cedar of Lebanon]]. In 1991, a project was completed which took care for the trees and [[transplanting|transplanted]] various species around the grounds. Adjacent to the grounds, there is a small secluded [[orchard]] where honey is produced from The Abbey's own [[mason bee|mason]] and [[honey bee]]s. The guest house area contains apple, [[Sambucus|elder]], ivy, [[Euonymus|spindle]], [[Viburnum lantana|wayfarer]] and ywe alongside plants like  [[Rosa setigera|climbing roses]], [[fern]]s and [[Salvia officinalis|sage]].<ref name=abbeygrounds>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/grounds/|title=The Abbey Grounds|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=19 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard garden has a [[Ficus|fig tree]], ''[[Magnolia]]'', [[rose]]s and a medieval style flower bed surrounded by a mature ''[[Buxus]]'' hedging. This garden was restored during the 1990s with [[gravel]]led paths and redesigned by B. Vellacot, a local volunteer. Around the main building there are flower beds with plants such as [[catnip]], [[Helichrysum italicum|curry plants]], ''[[Fuchsia]]'', [[Lavandula|lavender]], [[Vinca|periwinkle]], [[rosemary]], sage, [[Brunnera macrophylla|Siberian bugloss]], [[Spiraea|spirea]] and [[Jasminum nudiflorum|winter jasmine]]. Near the kitchen, there is a herb bed underneath a [[Betula pendula|silver birch]]. The walled [[kitchen garden]] has a [[wildflower]] meadow, a cut flower bed, a bed with [[strawberry|strawberries]] and trees including [[damson]], [[Ficus|fig]], [[greengage]], [[Prunus cerasus|morello cherry]], [[olive]], [[pear]], plum and [[quince]]. [[Vegetable]]s grown in the kitchen garden are [[artichoke]], [[carrot]], [[chard]], [[zucchini|courgette]], [[kale]], [[leek]], [[maize]], [[marrow (vegetable)|marrow]], [[potato]] and [[pumpkin]], which are used for consumption.

In the eleventh century, [[William the Conquerer]] granted the estate of Sutton to the [[House of Courtenay]], and the village became Sutton Courtenay.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> In 1090, King [[William II of England]] granted the [[All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay|church of Sutton]] and its lands and [[tithe]]s to the monks of Abingdon Abbey.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAbingdon Abbey constructed The Abbey as a [[monastic grange]], used as an administrative centre for the abbey's land and tithe holdings.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> However, the owner of the hide of land, Alwi the priest (whose father owned the land before him according to the [[Domesday Book]]), agreed with the [[abbot]] that he should retain Sutton with reversion first to his son and thereafter to the abbey, on condition of giving in [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton]] chapelry immediately.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=28}} Almost certainly in the late twelfth century, Abingdon Abbey took two thirds of the tithes and the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] the remaining third.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=104-5}} In 1258, following a dispute, the land was formally appropriated to the abbey and a [[clergy house|vicarage]] was ordained.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=106}} As it was close to Abingdon Abbey, it was probably run by the monks themselves rather than being left to a steward.<ref name=berkshirehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html|title=The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2004|work=Royal Berkshire History|author=David Nash Ford}}</ref> In 1278, however, [[Hugh de Courtenay]], Lord of the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor of Sutton]], sued the abbey for [[advowson]].

Many of these men rarely visited Sutton, leaving the running of The Abbey to various underlings. William Steele, rector in 1371, left money to each of his four servants in Sutton. Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory. Colnet was the doctor of King [[Henry V of England]] and was rector until 1420. He left money to the church and poor of Sutton.<ref>[[Berkshire Record Office]], D/EP 7/123.</ref> [[Thomas Beckington]], rector since 1420 and secretary of King [[Henry VI of England]], stayed at Sutton twice in 1442 and perhaps on other occasions.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} The ceiling of the solar is attributed to Beckington.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> In 1442, he was accompanied by [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], who succeeded him as rector when Beckington became [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] in 1443.{{sfn |Fletcher |1990 |p=60-2}} In 1444, Say obtained license to celebrate divine office in the house. The chapel was presumably new, and not used for long, since no other license is recorded. \n\nThe south and east ranges at The Abbey were completed around the middle of the fifteenth century, just before [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon]], who was involved in the [[Wars of the Roses]], was beheaded in 1461 and had his lands confiscated.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> Reginald Nutt, [[lease|lessee]] in 1472 and chaplain of Sutton, was obliged to repair all thatched roofs and mud walls on the site, the repair of tiled and slated roofs and the provision of timber being the rector's responsibility.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}}\n\nSome works survive from the period of Abingdon Abbey's control of the rectory before 1284.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} Since 1284 there are three medieval phases that can be closely dated. The first one can be attributed to Solomon of Rochester between 1284 and 1290. The second phase was between ca. 1320 and 1340, when among others the casing of the hall in stone was done. The third phase was around 1444, when William Say constructed the chapel screen and a door from the north to the east range on the first floor.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== College of St George ===\n[[File:St. Georges Chapel, Windsor Castle (2).jpg|thumb|[[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]] was in possession of The Abbey for over 350 years.]]\nIn 1481, [[Walter Devereux, 7th Baron Ferrers of Chartley]], granted the advowson to [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]],<ref>Denton Black Book ff. 42 v., 50 sqq.

In 1634 the buildings included 'a very ancient [[clergy house|parsonage house]]', three barns, a woolhouse, a sheephouse, a stable and a cowhouse. From 1669 onwards, the lease was held by the Justices of Sutton.{{sfn |Dalton |1957 |p=377-8}} In the late eighteenth century, the Justices began to extend the original leasehold curtilage by buying the freehold of adjoining tenements. Thomas Justice bought houses flanking the road on the west in 1773 and 1785.

Sourcing funding was difficult, and some potential investors remained unconvinced that the founders high ideals could lead to anything other than a misuse of funds. However, Blum and Verney remained committed to their project, disputing each critical point. Much of the work was carried out in a co-operative form, such as the 'work camp' of 1981, a community of enthusiastic volunteers.

He regained his place for the 2006/2007 season, but won only two matches in ranking events - 3\u20132 over [[Ian Preece]] in the [[2006 Grand Prix (snooker)|2006 Grand Prix]], and 9\u20136 over [[Mark Joyce]] in the [[2006 UK Championship (snooker)|2006 UK Championship]] - and resumed his amateur career thereafter.\n\n===Amateur career (2007\u2013 )===\nSince 2007, Cundy has occasionally entered [[Players Tour Championship]] events, and also the Q-School attempting to win back his place as a professional. He reached the last 64 of the [[2013 Indian Open]], losing 3\u20134 to Li Yan, and the same stage of the 2015 Riga Open, where he lost 2\u20134 to [[Martin O'Donnell]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cundy, Jeff}}\n[[Category:1969 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:English snooker players]]\n", "name_user": "Lee Vilenski", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:cleanup - fix season links usingWP:AWB", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Cundy"}

The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.

The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching.

Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature. Thus Type 304 SS is rarely used in contact with sulfuric acid.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.), or when deposits on the material have created same, and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

It only absorbs a small amount of carbon because of its cubic crystalline structure, which consists of one iron in each corner and a central iron atom; the central atom is what gives it magnetic properties. \n\nGrades with low coercitive field Hc have been developed for electrovalves used in household appliances  and for injection systems in internal combustion engines\n\nAnnealed [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] stainless steels are usually [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Values for some common materials|non-magnetic]].   \n\nSome applications require non-magnetic materials, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Magnetic permeability of some austenitic  stainless steel grades after annealing 2 hours at 1050{{nbsp}}\u00b0C<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fofanov|first=D.|url=|title=Magnetic properties of Stainless Steels: applications, opportunities and new developments|date=29 Nov 2011|work=Stainless steel World Conference|access-date=|last2=Riedner|first2=S.}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse together. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/ReviewofWearandGallingCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9006_.ashx |title=Review of the Wear and Galling Characteristics of Stainless Steels |last=Committee of Stainless Steel Producers.

Additionally, threaded joints may be [[Lubrication|lubricated]] to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Also, [[Nitronic]] 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Standard finishes==\n{{Main|Brushed metal}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

For example, duplex stainless steels are being used in [[Kraft process|digesters]] to convert wood chips into wood pulp. 6% Mo superaustenitics are used in the [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleach plant]] and Type 316 is used extensively in the [[paper machine]].\n\n===Chemical processing and petrochemical===\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in these industries for their corrosion resistance to both aqueous, gaseous and high temperature environments, their mechanical properties at all temperatures from cryogenic to the very high, and occasionally for other special physical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelsforChemicalProcessEquipment_14038_.ashx|title=Stainless Steels for Chemical Process Equipment|last=G.

Stainless steels do not affect the taste of the product, they are easily cleaned and sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination of the food, and they are durable.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in cookware, commercial food processing, commercial kitchens, brewing beer, wine making, and meat processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/FoodAndBeverage/WhyStainless.aspx|title=Food & Beverage Industry|last=Nickel Institute|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nAcidic foods with high salt additions, such as tomato sauce, and highly salted condiments, such as soya sauce may require higher alloyed stainless steels such as 6% Mo superaustenitics to prevent pitting corrosion by chloride.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n;  Automobiles\n{{See also|Braided stainless steel brake lines}}\nThe [[Allegheny Technologies|Allegheny Ludlum Corporation]] worked with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] on various [[concept car]]s with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s to demonstrate the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles,<ref>[[Stanley Malamed|Malamed, Stanley]] (2004). ''Handbook of Local Anesthesia'', 5th Edition.

Conversely, stainless steel is used in fuel cells that do the opposite, react hydrogen with oxygen to produce water and electrical energy.\n\n===Culinary===\n\nStainless steel is often preferred for [[sink|kitchen sinks]] because of its ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, [[acoustic noise]] is controlled by applying [[Sound dampening|resilient undercoating]] to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as [[kitchen appliance|appliances]] and [[Kitchen|backsplashes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Cookware and bakeware]] may be clad in stainless steels, to enhance their cleanability and durability, and to permit their use in [[induction cooking]] (this requires a [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]] grade of stainless steel, such as 432).

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

Technical Development Dept., Nippon Metal Industry, Co., Ltd.</ref>\n* 300 series are chromium-nickel alloys, which achieve their austenitic microstructure almost exclusively by nickel alloying; some very highly alloyed grades include some nitrogen to reduce nickel requirements. 300 series is the largest group and the most widely used. \n** Type 304: The best known grade is Type 304, also known as 18/8 and 18/10 for its composition of 18% chromium and 8%/10% nickel, respectively. \n** Type 316: The second most common austenitic stainless steel is Type 316. The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

They offer a higher toughness and higher corrosion resistance. Grade EN 1.4303 (Casting grade CA6NM) with 13% Cr and 4% Ni is used for most [[Pelton wheel|Pelton]], [[Kaplan turbine|Kaplan]] and [[Francis turbine]]s in [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plant]]<nowiki/>s <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|title=Stainless teel in Micro Hydro turbines|publisher=International Stainless Steel Forum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316010101/http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018}}</ref> because it has good casting properties, a good weldability and a good resistance to [[cavitation]] erosion.\n# Precipitation hardening grades: Grade EN 1.4542 (a.k.a. 17/4PH), the best known grade, combines martensitic hardening and precipitation hardening.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching. At this point, the structure remains austenitic. Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts. Yield stress levels above 1400{{nbsp}}MPa are then reached.\n\n- Austenitic A286<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rolledalloys.com/alloys/stainless-steels/a-286/en/|title=A-286 - Rolled Alloys, Inc.|website=www.rolledalloys.com}} </ref>(ASTM 660 EN 1.4980)  has the following typical analysis Cr 15%, Ni 25%, Ti 2.1%, Mo 1.2%, V 1.3%, and B 0.005%.\n\nThe structure remains austenitic at all temperatures.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves solution treatment and quenching, followed by aging at 715&nbsp;\u00b0C. Aging forms Ni<sub>3</sub>Ti precipitates and increases the yield strength to about 650{{nbsp}}MPa at room temperature. Unlike the above grades, the mechanical properties and creep resistance of this PH steel remain very good at temperatures up to 700&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nA286 is in fact a Fe-based superalloy, used in jet engines and gas turbines, turbo parts, etc.\n\nThe designation \"CRES\" is used in various industries to refer to corrosion-resistant steel.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid.

Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.), or when deposits on the material have created same, and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse together. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/ReviewofWearandGallingCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9006_.ashx |title=Review of the Wear and Galling Characteristics of Stainless Steels |last=Committee of Stainless Steel Producers.

Additionally, threaded joints may be [[Lubrication|lubricated]] to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Also, [[Nitronic]] 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Standard finishes==\n{{Main|Brushed metal}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

For example, duplex stainless steels are being used in [[Kraft process|digesters]] to convert wood chips into wood pulp. 6% Mo superaustenitics are used in the [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleach plant]] and Type 316 is used extensively in the [[paper machine]].\n\n===Chemical processing and petrochemical===\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in these industries for their corrosion resistance to both aqueous, gaseous and high temperature environments, their mechanical properties at all temperatures from cryogenic to the very high, and occasionally for other special physical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelsforChemicalProcessEquipment_14038_.ashx|title=Stainless Steels for Chemical Process Equipment|last=G.

Stainless steels do not affect the taste of the product, they are easily cleaned and sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination of the food, and they are durable.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in cookware, commercial food processing, commercial kitchens, brewing beer, wine making, and meat processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/FoodAndBeverage/WhyStainless.aspx|title=Food & Beverage Industry|last=Nickel Institute|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nAcidic foods with high salt additions, such as tomato sauce, and highly salted condiments, such as soya sauce may require higher alloyed stainless steels such as 6% Mo superaustenitics to prevent pitting corrosion by chloride.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n;  Automobiles\n{{See also|Braided stainless steel brake lines}}\nThe [[Allegheny Technologies|Allegheny Ludlum Corporation]] worked with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] on various [[concept car]]s with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s to demonstrate the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry.

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The interest rate comes in as a way of  bringing expenses  made in different years to their present value (a method widely used by banks and insurance companies) so they can be added and compared fairly\n\n'''Application of LCC in materials selection'''\n\nStainless steel used in projects often results in lower LCC values compared to other materials, because the higher acquisition cost (AC) of stainless steel components are often offset by improvements in operating and maintenance costs, through reduced loss of production (LP) costs, and by the improved resale value of stainless steel components.{{citation needed|date = March 2020}}\n\nThe LCC calculations are usually limited to the project itself. However, there may be other costs that a community wants to consider as well:{{citation needed|date = March 2020}}\n* utilities, such as power plants, water supply & wastewater treatment, hospitals, \u2026 cannot be shut down. Any maintenance will require extra costs associated with continuing service; and \n* Indirect societal costs (with possible political fallout)  may be incurred in some situations such as closing or reducing traffic on bridges, creating queues, delays,  loss of working hours to the people, and increased pollution by idling vehicles.\n\n==Sustainability\u2013recycling and reuse==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

As this is an average, countries that have low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in their electricity production (such as France with nuclear energy) will have lower figures.  Ferritics without Ni will have a lower CO<sub>2</sub> footprint than austenitics with 8% Ni or more.\n\nCarbon footprint must not be the only factor for deciding the choice of materials:\n* over any product life,  maintenance, repairs (when possible) or early end of life (planned obsolescence) can increase the overall footprint way beyond the difference between materials only.  In addition loss of service (typically for bridges) may induce large hidden costs (queues, wasted fuel, loss of man-hours;)\n* how much material is used to provide a given service varies with the performance, particularly the strength level, which allows lighter structures and components.\n\nStainless steel is 100% [[recyclable]].<ref>{{citation |author= Johnson, J., Reck, B.K., Wang, T., Graede, T.E. |title=The energy benefit of stainless steel recycling |year=2008 |journal=Energy Policy\n|volume=36 |pages=181\u2013192 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.08.028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingStainlessSteel.aspx|title=Recycling Stainless Steel|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingofNickelcontainingalloys.aspx|title=Recycling of Nickel-containing Alloys|website=Nickel Instiitute}}</ref> An average stainless steel object is composed of about 60% recycled material of which approximately 40% originates from end-of-life products and about 60% comes from manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110127075255/http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 27 January 2011\n |title      = The Recycling of Stainless Steel (\"Recycled Content\" and \"Input Composition\" slides)\n |accessdate = 19 November 2006\n |year       = 2006\n |format     = Flash\n |publisher  = International Stainless Steel Forum\n}}</ref> What prevents a higher recycling content is the availability of stainless steel scrap, in spite of a very high recycling rate. According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

Gandini drew inspiration and cues from two of his Bertone [[show car]]s from 1967, the [[Lamborghini Marzal]] and the [[Bertone Pirana|Jaguar Pirana]].<ref name=\"ruoteclassiche\">{{cite journal |journal=[[:it:Ruoteclassiche|Ruoteclassiche]] |title=Un dodici per quattro |pages=24\u201331 |date=August 2009 |language=italian |first=Luca |last=Grandini |publisher=[[:it:Editoriale Domus|Editoriale Domus]]}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Espada was a four-seater GT and was initially sold alongside the [[Lamborghini Islero|Islero]] and the mid-engined [[Lamborghini Miura|Miura]]. The Espada and the Islero both replaced the [[Lamborghini 400 GT|400 GT 2+2]] and had similar mechanical underpinnings, with the Espada a more visually daring alternative to the relatively conservative and discrete Islero.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name \"Espada\" ({{IPA-es|es\u02c8pa\u00f0a|pron}}) means \"[[sword]]\", referring to the sword that the [[torero]] uses to kill the [[Spanish Fighting Bull|bull]] in the [[Spanish-style bullfighting|corrida]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring its ten years in production the car underwent some changes, and three different series were produced. These were the S1 (1968\u20131970), the S2 (1970\u20131972) and the S3 (1972\u20131978). Each model featured interior redesigns, minor mechanical improvements and minor exterior changes. 1217 Espadas were made,<ref name=\":0\" /> making it the most numerous and longest-running Lamborghini model until the expansion of [[Lamborghini Countach|Countach]] production in the mid-1980s.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Series I===\nThe Espada was launched at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1968|1968 Geneva Motor Show]], alongside the Islero.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Espada was equipped with a {{convert|3929|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[Lamborghini V12|Lamborghini V12 engine]] derived from that used in the 400 GT 2+2, rated to produce {{convert|325|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the series I cars.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The design of the series I dashboard was inspired by the Marzal concept car, and featured octagonal housings for the main instruments, topped by an additional binnacle for the secondary gauges. Wheels were [[Campagnolo]] [[Alloy wheel|alloy]]s on [[Centerlock wheel|knock-off hubs]], of the same design seen on the Miura. The tail lights were the same units mounted on the first series [[Fiat 124|Fiat 124 Sport Coup\u00e9]].<ref name=\"ruoteclassiche\" /> 186 were made before January 1970.<ref name=\"ruoteclassiche\" />\n\n{{Gallery\n|align=center\n|File:Retro Classics Stuttgart 2010 - Lamborghini Espada.jpg\n |alt1=Espada S1 front view\n  |S1 front view\n|File:Lamborghini Espada interior.jpg\n |alt2= S1 interior\n |S1 interior\n|File:Lamborghini Espada wheels.jpg\n |alt3=Campagnolo magnesium alloy wheels used on S1 and S2 Espadas\n |[[Campagnolo]] magnesium alloy wheels used on S1 and S2 Espadas\n\n}}\n===Series II===\nAt the 1970 [[European Motor Show Brussels|Brussels Motor Show]] Lamborghini unveiled the Espada S2. Outside the only change was the deletion of the grille covering the vertical glass tail panel.\nInside changes were more radical: all-new dashboard, centre console and steering wheel were installed. The instrument binnacle was of a more conventional rectangular shape, with round gauges. A wood-trimmed fascia extended along the entire width of the dashboard. The center armrest was also revised and ventilation for rear seat passengers was improved.<ref name=\":1\" /> Power output increased to {{convert|350|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ruoteclassiche\" /> due to a higher 10.7:1 [[compression ratio]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The brakes were upgraded to vented [[Lucas Industries#Girling|Girling]] discs instead of solid discs.

With this revision, the interior now incorporated a redesigned aluminum-trimmed instrument panel that kept all instruments and most controls (including the radio) within easy reach of the driver. Several exterior changes were also made. Newly designed wheels on five-stud hubs replaced the earlier knock-off wheels. These wheels were also used on some late S2 Espadas.<ref name=\":0\" /> They were fitted with wider [[Pirelli]] Cinturato 215/70WR15 CN12 tyres. The front grille now had a square instead of hexagonal mesh. New tail lights were used, sourced from the [[Alfa Romeo 2000]]. A [[sunroof]] was now available as an option.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe {{convert|350|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} engine was carried over from the S2. Power steering by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] and [[air conditioning]] were now standard. Spring and shock absorber tuning was altered slightly. In 1974, a [[TorqueFlite|Chrysler Torqueflite]] 3 speed [[automatic transmission]] became available as an option.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFrom 1975, large [[Bumper (car)#First standards 1971|impact bumpers]] had to be installed to meet [[United States]] safety requirements. US emissions requirements also led to the factory adding a [[secondary air injection]] pump and special tuning of carburetors and the ignition system.

Four wheel [[disc brake]]s were manufactured by [[Girling Brakes|Girling]]. All calipers had three pistons, with larger calipers used in the front. Solid disks were used at first, with vented discs added for the Series II Espada. The steering box was a worm-and-peg type manufactured by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] and mounted at the top front of the chassis, with very long steering column. Power steering would be offered on the Series III Espadas. Series I and II Espadas were originally fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72), while Series II cars used 215/70VR15 Cinturato CN12 tires.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTwin [[fuel tank]]s held {{convert|93|l|gal|0|abbr=on}} of gasoline.

Cylinder bore was 82 mm, stroke 62 mm. Compression ratio on series I engines was 9.5:1, which increased to 10.7:1 in the series II/II engines. Six [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] 40DCOE side-draft [[carburator|carburetor]]s were equipped, along with a single [[distributor]] for ignition. Wet sump lubrication was used, with an oil capacity of {{Convert|14|L|gal|abbr=}}. The weight of the engine alone was {{Convert|232|kg|lbs|abbr=}}, or {{Convert|293|kg|lbs|abbr=}} including the transmission.

Most Espadas were equipped with a Lamborghini-designed 5-speed [[manual transmission]] with hydraulically operated clutch. The internal components of this transmission were identical to those used in the Miura and Islero, with the transmission casing also shared with the Islero but differing from the Miura, due to that model's transverse mid-engine layout.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nFrom 1974, the Series III Espada could be ordered with a [[TorqueFlite|Chrysler Torqueflite]] 3 speed [[automatic transmission]].

The Espada and the Islero both replaced the [[Lamborghini 400 GT|400 GT 2+2]] and had similar mechanical underpinnings, with the Espada a more visually daring alternative to the relatively conservative and discrete Islero.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name \"Espada\" ({{IPA-es|es\u02c8pa\u00f0a|pron}}) means \"[[sword]]\", referring to the sword that the [[torero]] uses to kill the [[Spanish Fighting Bull|bull]] in the [[Spanish-style bullfighting|corrida]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring its ten years in production the car underwent some changes, and three different series were produced. These were the S1 (1968\u20131970), the S2 (1970\u20131972) and the S3 (1972\u20131978). Each model featured interior redesigns, minor mechanical improvements and minor exterior changes. 1217 Espadas were made,<ref name=\":0\" /> making it the most numerous and longest-running Lamborghini model until the expansion of [[Lamborghini Countach|Countach]] production in the mid-1980s.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Series I===\nThe Espada was launched at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1968|1968 Geneva Motor Show]], alongside the Islero.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Espada was equipped with a {{convert|3929|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[Lamborghini V12|Lamborghini V12 engine]] derived from that used in the 400 GT 2+2, rated to produce {{convert|325|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the series I cars.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The design of the series I dashboard was inspired by the Marzal concept car, and featured octagonal housings for the main instruments, topped by an additional binnacle for the secondary gauges.
