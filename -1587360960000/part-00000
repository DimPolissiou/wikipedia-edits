It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie Groves]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. Nuclear physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]] was the director of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] that designed the actual bombs. The Army component of the project was designated the '''Manhattan District'''; ''[[Manhattan]]'' gradually superseded the official codename, '''Development of Substitute Materials''', for the entire project. Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, [[Tube Alloys]]. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2&nbsp;billion (about ${{format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|2000000000|1945|r=-9}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce [[fissile material]], with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n\nTwo types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war: a relatively simple [[gun-type fission weapon]] and a more complex [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. The [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]] gun-type design proved impractical to use with [[plutonium]], and therefore a simpler gun-type called [[Little Boy]] was developed that used [[uranium-235]], an [[isotope]] that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural [[uranium]]. Chemically identical to the most common isotope, [[uranium-238]], and with almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate the two. Three methods were employed for [[uranium enrichment]]: [[calutron|electromagnetic]], [[gaseous diffusion|gaseous]] and [[thermophoresis|thermal]]. Most of this work was performed at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].\n\nIn parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce [[plutonium]], which was discovered at the [[University of California]] in 1940.<ref name=\"earlyUC\">The University of California was founded on March 23, 1868, and operated in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] before moving to its campus in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] in 1873.  {{Cite web|url=https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/programs-and-initiatives/faculty-resources-advancement/faculty-handbook-sections/brief-history.html|title=A brief history of the University of California {{!}} UCOP|website=www.ucop.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}  {{Cite web|url=https://150.universityofcalifornia.edu/|title=UC 150th Anniversary Timeline|last=California|first=University of|website=UC 150th Anniversary Timeline|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}} In March 1951, the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from [[University of California, Berkeley|its campus at Berkeley]].  {{Cite web|url=https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellors|title=Past Chancellors {{!}} Office of the Chancellor|website=chancellor.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}} See also the Wikipedia article on the [[University of California]].</ref> After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, the [[Chicago Pile-1]], was demonstrated in 1942 at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in the [[University of Chicago]], the Project designed the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at Oak Ridge and the production reactors at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington state]], in which uranium was irradiated and [[nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium, using the [[bismuth phosphate process]]. The [[Fat Man]] plutonium implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.\n\nThe project was also charged with gathering intelligence on the [[German nuclear weapon project]]. Through [[Operation Alsos]], Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet [[atomic spies]] successfully penetrated the program.\n\nThe first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the [[Trinity test]], conducted at New Mexico's [[White Sands Missile Range|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] on 16 July 1945. Little Boy and Fat Man bombs were used a month later in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], respectively. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at [[Bikini Atoll]] as part of [[Operation Crossroads]], developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|national laboratories]], supported medical research into [[radiology]] and laid the foundations for the [[nuclear navy]]. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] in January 1947.\n\n== Origins and timeline ==\n{{see also|Timeline of the Manhattan Project}}The discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Frisch]], made the development of an [[atomic bomb]] a theoretical possibility. There were fears that a [[German atomic bomb project]] would develop one first, especially among scientists who were refugees from [[Nazi Germany]] and other [[fascist]] countries.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=12}} In August 1939, Hungarian-born physicists [[Leo Szilard]] and [[Eugene Wigner]] drafted the [[Einstein\u2013Szilard letter]], which warned of the potential development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\". It urged the United States to take steps to acquire stockpiles of [[uranium ore]] and accelerate the research of [[Enrico Fermi]] and others into [[nuclear chain reaction]]s. They had it signed by [[Albert Einstein]] and delivered to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt called on [[Lyman Briggs]] of the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to head the [[Advisory Committee on Uranium]] to investigate the issues raised by the letter. Briggs held a meeting on 21 October 1939, which was attended by Szil\u00e1rd, Wigner and [[Edward Teller]]. The committee reported back to Roosevelt in November that uranium \"would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=16\u201320}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Navy]] awarded [[Columbia University]] $6,000 in funding, most of which [[Enrico Fermi]] and Szilard  spent on purchasing [[graphite]]. A team of Columbia professors including Fermi, Szilard, [[Eugene T. Booth]] and [[John R.

To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions, Oppenheimer and [[Fermi]] convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California in July 1942 with theoretical physicists [[Hans Bethe]], [[John Van Vleck]], Edward Teller, [[Emil Konopinski]], Robert Serber, [[Stan Frankel]], and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and [[experimental physicist]]s [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]], [[Felix Bloch]], [[Franco Rasetti]], [[John Henry Manley]], and [[Edwin McMillan]]. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42\u201344}}</ref>\n\nThere were still many unknown factors. The properties of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown, as were those of plutonium, an element that had only been discovered in February 1941 by [[Glenn Seaborg]] and his team. The scientists at the (July 1942) Berkeley conference envisioned creating plutonium in nuclear reactors where uranium-238 atoms absorbed neutrons that had been emitted from fissioning uranium-235 atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only tiny quantities of plutonium were available from [[cyclotron]]s at institutions such as [[Washington University in St. Louis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=33\u201335, 183}}.</ref> Even by December 1943, only two [[milligram]]s had been produced.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=41}}.</ref> There were many ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass.

Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the \"super\", now usually referred to as a \"[[hydrogen bomb]]\", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction in [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|p=417}}.</ref> Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe refused each one.

Marshall created a liaison office in Washington, D.C., but established his temporary headquarters on the 18th floor of [[Tower 270|270 Broadway]] in New York, where he could draw on administrative support from the Corps of Engineers' [[North Atlantic Division]]. It was close to the Manhattan office of [[Stone & Webster]], the principal project contractor, and to Columbia University.

Robbins]], and his deputy, Colonel [[Leslie Groves]]. Reybold, Somervell, and Styer decided to call the project \"Development of Substitute Materials\", but Groves felt that this would draw attention. Since engineer districts normally carried the name of the city where they were located, Marshall and Groves agreed to name the Army's component of the project the Manhattan District. This became official on 13 August, when Reybold issued the order creating the new district. Informally, it was known as the Manhattan Engineer District, or MED. Unlike other districts, it had no geographic boundaries, and Marshall had the authority of a division engineer. Development of Substitute Materials remained as the official codename of the project as a whole, but was supplanted over time by \"Manhattan\".<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 41-44\" />\n\nMarshall later conceded that, \"I had never heard of atomic fission but I did know that you could not build much of a plant, much less four of them for $90&nbsp;million.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=652}}.</ref> A single [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] plant that Nichols had recently built in Pennsylvania had cost $128&nbsp;million.<ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=174}}.</ref> Nor were they impressed with estimates to the nearest order of magnitude, which Groves compared with telling a caterer to prepare for between ten and a thousand guests.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=40}}.</ref> A survey team from Stone & Webster had already scouted a site for the production plants. The [[War Production Board]] recommended sites around [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], an isolated area where the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] could supply ample electric power and the rivers could provide cooling water for the reactors. After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near [[Elza, Tennessee]].

Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel [[Lucius D.

The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a [[Nobel Prize]], which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were [[Communism|Communists]], including his brother, [[Frank Oppenheimer]]; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, [[Jean Tatlock]]. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=61\u201363}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|pp=72\u201373}}.</ref>\n\n=== Collaboration with the United Kingdom ===\n{{Main|British contribution to the Manhattan Project}}\nThe British and Americans exchanged nuclear information but did not initially combine their efforts.

The [[Belgian Congo]] and Canada held much of the world's uranium outside Eastern Europe, and the [[Belgian Government in Exile|Belgian government in exile]] was in London.

In order to avoid briefing US Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] on the project, a special account not subject to the usual auditing and controls was used to hold Trust monies. Between 1944 and the time he resigned from the Trust in 1947, Groves deposited a total of $37.5&nbsp;million into the Trust's account.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=90, 299\u2013306}}.</ref>\n\nGroves appreciated the early British atomic research and the British scientists' contributions to the Manhattan Project, but stated that the United States would have succeeded without them.{{r|fakley1983}} He also said that Churchill was \"the best friend the atomic bomb project had [as] he kept Roosevelt's interest up ...

Groves recruited [[DuPont]] in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard [[cost-plus contract|cost plus fixed-fee contract]], but the President of the company, [[Walter S. Carpenter, Jr.]], wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=58\u201359}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hanford workers.jpg|thumb|Hanford workers collect their paychecks at the Western Union office.|alt=A large crowd of sullen looking workmen at a counter where two women are writing.

Matthias reported that [[Hanford Site]] near [[Richland, Washington]], was \"ideal in virtually all respects\". It was isolated and near the [[Columbia River]], which could supply sufficient water to cool the reactors that would produce the plutonium. Groves visited the site in January and established the Hanford Engineer Works (HEW), codenamed \"Site W\".<ref name=\"Jones 1987 108\u2013111\" />\n\nUnder Secretary Patterson gave his approval on 9 February, allocating $5&nbsp;million for the acquisition of {{convert|40000|acre|ha}} of land in the area. The federal government relocated some 1,500 residents of [[White Bluffs, Washington|White Bluffs]] and [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]], and nearby settlements, as well as the [[Wanapum]] and other tribes using the area. A dispute arose with farmers over compensation for crops, which had already been planted before the land was acquired.

Although progress on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict the scope of the project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=452\u2013457}}.</ref> At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state.<ref>{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=16}}.</ref> Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=401}}.</ref> Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=463\u2013464}}.</ref>\n\n=== Canadian sites ===\n{{Main|Montreal Laboratory}}\n\n==== British Columbia ====\n[[Cominco]] had produced electrolytic hydrogen at [[Trail, British Columbia]], since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 that it could produce heavy water. To the existing $10&nbsp;million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75&nbsp;MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon [[catalyst]] for the first three stages while Urey developed a nickel-[[chromium(III) oxide|chromia]] one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8&nbsp;million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's heavy water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. Heavy water from Trail was used for [[Chicago Pile 3]], the first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.<ref name=\"Waltham, pp. 8-9\">{{harvnb|Waltham|2002|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref>\n\n==== Ontario ====\nThe [[Chalk River Laboratories|Chalk River, Ontario]], site was established to rehouse the Allied effort at the [[Montreal Laboratory]] away from an urban area. A new community was built at [[Deep River, Ontario]], to provide residences and facilities for the team members. The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a rail head adjacent to a large military base, [[Camp Petawawa]]. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first director of the new laboratory was [[Hans von Halban]]. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who in turn was succeeded by [[Bennett Lewis]] in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as [[ZEEP]] (zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went critical in September 1945, ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/zeep.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306233719/http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/zeep.cfm |archivedate=6 March 2014 |title=ZEEP \u2013 Canada's First Nuclear Reactor |publisher=Canada Science and Technology Museum}}</ref> A larger 10&nbsp;MW [[NRX]] reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went critical in July 1947.<ref name=\"Waltham, pp. 8-9\" />\n\n==== Northwest Territories ====\nThe [[Eldorado Mine (Northwest Territories)|Eldorado Mine]] at [[Port Radium]] was a source of uranium ore.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=8, 62}}.</ref>\n\n=== Heavy water sites ===\n{{Main|P-9 Project}}\nAlthough DuPont's preferred designs for the nuclear reactors were helium cooled and used graphite as a moderator, DuPont still expressed an interest in using heavy water as a backup, in case the graphite reactor design proved infeasible for some reason. For this purpose, it was estimated that {{convert|3|ST}} of heavy water would be required per month. The ''[[P-9 Project]]'' was the government's code name for the heavy water production program. As the plant at Trail, which was then under construction, could produce {{convert|0.5|ST}} per month, additional capacity was required. Groves therefore authorized DuPont to establish heavy water facilities at the Morgantown Ordnance Works, near [[Morgantown, West Virginia]]; at the [[Newport Chemical Depot|Wabash River Ordnance Works]], near [[Dana, Indiana|Dana]] and [[Newport, Indiana]]; and at the [[Alabama Army Ammunition Plant|Alabama Ordnance Works]], near [[Childersburg, Alabama|Childersburg]] and [[Sylacauga, Alabama]]. Although known as Ordnance Works and paid for under [[Ordnance Department]] contracts, they were built and operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The American plants used a process different from Trail's; heavy water was extracted by distillation, taking advantage of the slightly higher boiling point of heavy water.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=107\u2013108}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=201\u2013202}}.</ref>\n\n== Uranium ==\n=== Ore ===\nThe key raw material for the project was uranium, which was used as fuel for the reactors, as feed that was transformed into plutonium, and, in its enriched form, in the atomic bomb itself. There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940: in Colorado, in northern Canada, in [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimsthal]] in Czechoslovakia, and in the [[Belgian Congo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|p=39}}.</ref> All but Joachimstal were in allied hands. A November 1942 survey determined that sufficient quantities of uranium were available to satisfy the project's requirements.<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|p=92}}.</ref> Nichols arranged with the [[State Department]] for export controls to be placed on [[uranium oxide]] and negotiated for the purchase of {{convert|1200|ST}} of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo that was being stored in a warehouse on [[Staten Island]] and the remaining stocks of mined ore stored in the Congo. He negotiated with [[Eldorado Mining and Refining|Eldorado Gold Mines]] for the purchase of ore from its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario, and its shipment in 100-ton lots. The Canadian government subsequently bought up the company's stock until it acquired a controlling interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=85\u201386}}.</ref>\n\nWhile these purchases assured a sufficient supply to meet wartime needs, the American and British leaders concluded that it was in their countries' interest to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The richest source of ore was the [[Shinkolobwe]] mine in the Belgian Congo, but it was flooded and closed. Nichols unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate its reopening and the sale of the entire future output to the United States with [[Edgar Sengier]], the director of the company that owned the mine, [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=295}}.</ref> The matter was then taken up by the Combined Policy Committee. As 30 percent of Union Mini\u00e8re's stock was controlled by British interests, the British took the lead in negotiations. Sir John Anderson and Ambassador [[John Winant]] hammered out a deal with Sengier and the Belgian government in May 1944 for the mine to be reopened and {{convert|1720|ST}} of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=285\u2013288}}.</ref> To avoid dependence on the British and Canadians for ore, Groves also arranged for the purchase of US Vanadium Corporation's stockpile in [[Uravan, Colorado]]. [[Uranium mining in Colorado]] yielded about {{convert|800|ST}} of ore.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=291\u2013292}}.</ref>\n\n[[Mallinckrodt Incorporated]] in St. Louis, Missouri, took the raw ore and dissolved it in [[nitric acid]] to produce [[uranyl nitrate]]. [[Ether]] was then added in a [[liquid\u2013liquid extraction]] process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form [[uranium trioxide]], which was reduced to highly pure [[uranium dioxide]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ruhoff|Fain|1962|pp=3\u20139}}.</ref> By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] and Metal Hydrides.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=31}}</ref> Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at [[Iowa State College]] in [[Ames, Iowa]], under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This became known as the [[Ames Project]], and its [[Ames process]] became available in 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=87\u201388}}.</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Uranium refining at Ames\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:Ames Process pressure vessel lower.jpg|A \"bomb\" ([[pressure vessel]]) containing uranium halide and [[sacrificial metal]], probably magnesium, being lowered into a furnace\nFile:Ames Process pressure vessel remnant slag after reaction.jpg|After the reaction, the interior of a bomb coated with remnant [[slag]]\nFile:Ames Process uranium biscuit.jpg|A uranium metal \"biscuit\" from the [[redox|reduction]] reaction\n</gallery>\n\n=== Isotope separation ===\nNatural uranium consists of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235, but only the latter is [[fissile]]. The chemically identical uranium-235 has to be physically separated from the more plentiful isotope. Various methods were considered for [[uranium enrichment]], most of which was carried out at Oak Ridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=154\u2013156}}.</ref>\n\nThe most obvious technology, the centrifuge, failed, but electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful and contributed to the project. In February 1943, Groves came up with the idea of using the output of some plants as the input for others.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=157}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Clinton Engineer Works.png|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Oak Ridge hosted several uranium separation technologies.

The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with [[uranium hexafluoride]], the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=30}}.</ref>\n\nScaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with {{convert|1|m|adj=on|sp=us}} rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with {{convert|4|m|adj=on|sp=us}} rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting,<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=64}}.</ref> and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required. Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work on a series of improvements which promised to increase the efficiency of the process. However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=96\u201397}}.</ref> In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee following a recommendation by Conant, Nichols and August C. Klein of Stone & Webster.<ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=64}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough the centrifuge method was abandoned by the Manhattan Project, research into it advanced significantly after the war with the introduction of the [[Zippe-type centrifuge]], which was developed in the Soviet Union by Soviet and captured German engineers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kemp|2012|pp=281\u2013287}}.</ref> It eventually became the preferred method of Uranium isotope separation, being far more economical than the other separation methods used during WWII.<ref>{{harvnb|Kemp|2012|pp=291\u2013297}}.</ref>\n\n==== Electromagnetic separation ====\n{{Main|Y-12 Project}}\nElectromagnetic isotope separation was developed by Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as [[calutron]]s, a hybrid of the standard laboratory [[mass spectrometer]] and the cyclotron magnet. The name was derived from the words ''California'', ''university'' and ''cyclotron''.<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 117-119\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=117\u2013119}}.</ref> In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=164\u2013165}}.</ref> The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient.<ref name=\"Fine & Remington, p. 684\">{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=684}}.</ref> Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 117-119\" />\n\n[[File:Alpha 1 racetrack, Uranium 235 electromagnetic separation plant, Manhattan Project, Y-12 Oak Ridge.jpg|thumb|left|Alpha I racetrack at Y-12|alt=A large oval-shaped structure]]\nMarshall and Nichols discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require {{convert|5000|ST|abbr=off}} of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with [[United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury|Under Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Daniel W. Bell]] and asked for the transfer of 6,000 tons of silver bullion from the [[West Point Bullion Depository]]. \"Young man,\" Bell told him, \"you may think of silver in tons but the Treasury will always think of silver in [[troy ounce]]s!\"<ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=42}}.</ref> Eventually, {{convert|14700|ST|t ozt|abbr=off}} were used.<ref name=\"Jones, p. 133\" />\n\nThe {{convert|1000|ozt|kg|adj=on}} silver bars were cast into cylindrical billets and taken to [[Phelps Dodge]] in Bayway, New Jersey, where they were extruded into strips {{convert|0.625|in}} thick, {{convert|3|in}} wide and {{convert|40|ft}} long. These were wound onto magnetic coils by [[Allis-Chalmers]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After the war, all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver. In the end, only 1/3,600,000th was lost.<ref name=\"Jones, p. 133\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=133}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=153}}.</ref> The last silver was returned in May 1970.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=67}}.</ref>\n\nResponsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant, which came to be called [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]], was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=126\u2013132}}.</ref>\n\nWhen the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because of the power of the magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.<ref name=\"Fine & Remington, p. 684\" /> The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944, the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I was operational in April.

They were then turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education. Nichols compared unit production data, and pointed out to Lawrence that the young \"[[hillbilly]]\" girl operators were outperforming his PhDs. They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost, a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors. The girls were \"trained like soldiers not to reason why\", while \"the scientists could not refrain from time-consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=131}}.</ref>\n\nY-12 initially enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. Much of the rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By August K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=143\u2013148}}.</ref>\n\n==== Gaseous diffusion ====\n{{Main|K-25}}\nThe most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. [[Graham's law]] states that the rate of [[effusion]] of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its [[molecular mass]], so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, [[Karl P. Cohen]], and [[John R. Dunning]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=30\u201332, 96\u201398}}</ref>\n\n[[File:K-25 aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|Oak Ridge K-25 plant|alt=Oblique aerial view of an enormous U-shaped building]]\nIn November 1942 the Military Policy Committee approved the construction of a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=108}}.</ref> On 14 December, [[M. W. Kellogg]] accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed-fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5&nbsp;million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=150\u2013151}}.</ref> The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride would have to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] and the [[Bakelite]] Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=154\u2013157}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=126\u2013127}}.</ref>\n\nKellex's design for K-25 called for a four-story {{convert|0.5|mi|km|adj=on|sp=us}} long U-shaped structure containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately or as part of a single cascade. A survey party began construction by marking out the {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} site in May 1943. Work on the main building began in October 1943, and the six-stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages of the plant, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, [[Union Carbide]] and Carbon, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480&nbsp;million.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=158\u2013165}}.</ref>\n\nThe production plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=167\u2013171}}.</ref>\n\n==== Thermal diffusion ====\n{{Main|S-50 Project}}\nThe thermal diffusion process was based on [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]]'s [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory|theory]], which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this can be used as a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by [[Klaus Clusius]] and Gerhard Dickel in Germany in 1938.<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=161\u2013162}}.</ref> It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=172}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:S50plant.jpg|thumb|The S-50 plant is the dark building to the upper left behind the Oak Ridge powerhouse (with smoke stacks).|alt=A factory with three smoking chimneys on a river bend, viewed from above]]\nThe Naval Research Laboratory continued the research under Philip Abelson's direction, but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944, when [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]], the naval officer in charge of ordnance development at Los Alamos, brought Oppenheimer news of encouraging progress in the Navy's experiments on thermal diffusion. Oppenheimer wrote to Groves suggesting that the output of a thermal diffusion plant could be fed into Y-12. Groves set up a committee consisting of [[Warren K. Lewis]], Eger Murphree and Richard Tolman to investigate the idea, and they estimated that a thermal diffusion plant costing $3.5&nbsp;million could enrich {{convert|50|kg|lb|0}} of uranium per week to nearly 0.9% uranium-235. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=175\u2013177}}.</ref>\n\nGroves contracted with the H. K. Ferguson Company of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], to build the thermal diffusion plant, which was designated S-50. Groves's advisers, Karl Cohen and W. I. Thompson from [[Esso|Standard Oil]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=170\u2013172}}.</ref> estimated that it would take six months to build. Groves gave Ferguson just four. Plans called for the installation of 2,142 {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} diffusion columns arranged in 21 racks. Inside each column were three concentric tubes. Steam, obtained from the nearby K-25 powerhouse at a pressure of {{convert|100|psi}} and temperature of {{convert|545|F|C}}, flowed downward through the innermost {{convert|1.25|in|adj=on}} nickel pipe, while water at {{convert|155|F|C}} flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe. The uranium hexafluoride flowed in the middle copper pipe, and isotope separation of the uranium occurred between the nickel and copper pipes.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=178\u2013179}}.</ref>\n\nWork commenced on 9 July 1944, and S-50 began partial operation in September. Ferguson operated the plant through a subsidiary known as Fercleve. The plant produced just {{convert|10.5|lb}} of 0.852% uranium-235 in October. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 it produced {{convert|12730|lb}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=180\u2013183}}.</ref> By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%.

Intended as a pilot plant for the larger production facilities at Hanford, it included the air-cooled [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]], a chemical separation plant, and support facilities. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot.<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 204-206\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=204\u2013206}}.</ref> The X-10 Graphite Reactor consisted of a huge block of graphite, {{convert|24|ft|m}} long on each side, weighing around {{convert|1500|ST}}, surrounded by {{convert|7|ft|m}} of high-density concrete as a radiation shield.<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 204-206\" />\n\nThe greatest difficulty was encountered with the uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow had to be coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a [[tinning#Hot-dipping|hot dipping process]] without success. Meanwhile, [[Alcoa]] tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure rate of more than 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of [[General Electric]], which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=208\u2013210}}.</ref>\n\nWatched by Fermi and Compton, the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical on 4 November 1943 with about {{convert|30|ST}} of uranium.

They were [[pickling (metal)|pickled]] to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and [[silumin|aluminum-silicon alloy]], canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using [[arc welding]] under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they were subjected to a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful of canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start [[B-Reactor|Reactor B]] on schedule in August 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=222\u2013226}}.</ref>\n\nWork began on Reactor B, the first of six planned 250&nbsp;MW reactors, on 10 October 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=139}}.</ref> The reactor complexes were given letter designations A through F, with B, D and F sites chosen to be developed first, as this maximised the distance between the reactors.

Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the [[control rod]]s to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=304\u2013307}}.</ref><ref name=\"Jones, pp. 220-223\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=220\u2013223}}.</ref>\n\nFermi contacted [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], who identified the cause of the problem as [[neutron poison]]ing from [[xenon-135]], which has a [[half-life]] of 9.2 hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|p=45}}.</ref> Fermi, Woods, [[Donald J.

Working with the minute quantities of plutonium available at the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a [[fluoride selective electrode|lanthanum fluoride process]] for separating uranium and plutonium, which was chosen for the pilot separation plant. A second separation process, the [[bismuth phosphate process]], was subsequently developed by Seaborg and Stanly G. Thomson.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=184\u2013185}}.</ref> This process worked by toggling plutonium between its +4 and +6 [[oxidation state]]s in solutions of bismuth phosphate. In the former state, the plutonium was precipitated; in the latter, it stayed in solution and the other products were precipitated.<ref>{{harvnb|Hanford Cultural and Historic Resources Program|2002|pp=2\u20134.15-2-4.18}}</ref>\n\nGreenewalt favored the bismuth phosphate process due to the corrosive nature of lanthanum fluoride, and it was selected for the Hanford separation plants.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=204\u2013205}}.</ref> Once X-10 began producing plutonium, the pilot separation plant was put to the test. The first batch was processed at 40% efficiency but over the next few months this was raised to 90%.<ref name=\"Jones 1985 209\" />\n\nAt Hanford, top priority was initially given to the installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=214\u2013216}}.</ref>\n\nEarly plans called for the construction of two separation plants in each of the areas known as 200-West and 200-East. This was subsequently reduced to two, the T and U plants, in 200-West and one, the B plant, at 200-East.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=212}}.</ref> Each separation plant consisted of four buildings: a process cell building or \"canyon\" (known as 221), a concentration building (224), a purification building (231) and a magazine store (213). The canyons were each {{convert|800|ft}} long and {{convert|65|ft}} wide. Each consisted of forty {{convert|17.7|by|13|by|20|ft|adj=on}} cells.<ref>{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=11}}.</ref>\n\nWork began on 221-T and 221-U in January 1944, with the former completed in September and the latter in December. The 221-B building followed in March 1945. Because of the high levels of radioactivity involved, all work in the separation plants had to be conducted by remote control using closed-circuit television, something unheard of in 1943. Maintenance was carried out with the aid of an overhead crane and specially designed tools. The 224 buildings were smaller because they had less material to process, and it was less radioactive. The 224-T and 224-U buildings were completed on 8 October 1944, and 224-B followed on 10 February 1945. The purification methods that were eventually used in 231-W were still unknown when construction commenced on 8 April 1944, but the plant was complete and the methods were selected by the end of the year.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=219\u2013222}}.</ref> On 5 February 1945, Matthias hand-delivered the first shipment of 80&nbsp;g of 95%-pure plutonium nitrate to a Los Alamos courier in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Thayer 1996 141\" />\n\n=== Weapon design ===\n{{Main|Project Y}}\n[[File:Thin Man plutonium gun bomb casings.jpg|thumb|A row of Thin Man casings. Fat Man casings are visible in the background.|alt=Long, tube-like casings. In the background are several ovoid casings and a tow truck.]]\nIn 1943, development efforts were directed to a [[gun-type fission weapon]] with plutonium called [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segr\u00e8 discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=226\u2013229}}</ref> Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 that some of the plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=250\u2013252}}.</ref>\n\nThis made reactor plutonium unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a [[predetonation]] that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass with a minimal amount of plutonium reacted (a [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]]). A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=242\u2013244}}</ref>\n\nWork on an alternative method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier under the direction of the physicist [[Seth Neddermeyer]]. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=312\u2013313}}.</ref> Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=129\u2013130}}</ref> In September 1943, [[John von Neumann]], who had experience with [[shaped charge]]s used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=246}}.</ref> He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Implosion Nuclear weapon.svg|thumb|left|An implosion-type nuclear bomb|alt=Diagram showing fast explosive, slow explosive, uranium tamper, plutonium core and neutron initiator]]\nBy July 1944, Oppenheimer had concluded plutonium could not be used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed [[Fat Man]], began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=245\u2013248}}</ref> Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert [[George Kistiakowsky]] and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=311}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=245}}</ref> The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used [[explosive lens]]es to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives.<ref name=\"Hoddeson et al, pp. 294-296\" />\n\nThe design of lenses that detonated with the proper shape and velocity turned out to be slow, difficult and frustrating.<ref name=\"Hoddeson et al, pp. 294-296\">{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=294\u2013296}}</ref> Various explosives were tested before settling on [[composition B]] as the fast explosive and [[baratol]] as the slow explosive.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=299}}</ref> The final design resembled a soccer ball, with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal lenses, each weighing about {{convert|80|lb}}.

A contract for their manufacture was given to [[Raytheon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=301\u2013307}}</ref>\n\nTo study the behavior of converging [[shock wave]]s, Robert Serber devised the [[RaLa Experiment]], which used the short-lived [[radioisotope]] [[lanthanum-140]], a potent source of [[gamma radiation]]. The gamma ray source was placed in the center of a metal sphere surrounded by the explosive lenses, which in turn were inside in an [[ionization chamber]]. This allowed the taking of an X-ray movie of the implosion. The lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=148\u2013154}}</ref> In his history of the Los Alamos project, [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]] wrote: \"RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hawkins|Truslow|Smith|1961|p=203}}.</ref>\n\nWithin the explosives was the {{convert|4.5|inch|adj=on}} thick aluminum pusher, which provided a smooth transition from the relatively low density explosive to the next layer, the {{convert|3|inch|adj=on}} thick tamper of natural uranium. Its main job was to hold the critical mass together as long as possible, but it would also reflect neutrons back into the core. Some part of it might fission as well. To prevent predetonation by an external neutron, the tamper was coated in a thin layer of boron.<ref name=\"Hansen. p.

The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple [[allotropes of plutonium]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=244\u2013245}}.</ref> The brittle \u03b1 phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic \u03b2 phase at higher temperatures.

It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with [[alpha particles]], which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a [[plutonium-gallium alloy]], which stabilized the \u03b4 phase and could be [[hot pressing|hot pressed]] into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.<ref>{{harvnb|Baker|Hecker|Harbur|1983|pp=144\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nThe work proved dangerous.

Measuring {{convert|25|ft|m}} long and {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide, it was fabricated at great expense from {{convert|214|ST}} of iron and steel by [[Babcock & Wilcox]] in Barberton, Ohio.

In the end, Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a fizzled explosion.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=365\u2013367}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones, p. 512\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=512}}.</ref>\n\nA pre-test explosion was conducted on 7 May 1945 to calibrate the instruments.

Manhattan Project security poster.png|thumb|Security poster, warning office workers to close drawers and put documents in safes when not being used]]\nVoluntary censorship of atomic information began before the Manhattan Project. After the start of the European war in 1939 American scientists began avoiding publishing military-related research, and in 1940 scientific journals began asking the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to clear articles. [[William L. Laurence]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who wrote an article on atomic fission in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' of 7 September 1940, later learned that government officials asked librarians nationwide in 1943 to withdraw the issue.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2001|pp=196\u2013198}}.</ref> The Soviets noticed the silence, however. In April 1942 nuclear physicist [[Georgy Flyorov]] wrote to [[Josef Stalin]] on the absence of articles on nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project.<ref>{{harvnb|Holloway|1994|pp=76\u201379}}.</ref>\n\nThe Manhattan Project operated under tight security lest its discovery induce Axis powers, especially Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects or undertake covert operations against the project.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=253\u2013255}}.</ref> The government's [[Office of Censorship]], by contrast, relied on the press to comply with a voluntary code of conduct it published, and the project at first avoided notifying the office. By early 1943 newspapers began publishing reports of large construction in Tennessee and Washington based on public records, and the office began discussing with the project how to maintain secrecy. In June the Office of Censorship asked newspapers and broadcasters to avoid discussing \"atom smashing, atomic energy, atomic fission, atomic splitting, or any of their equivalents. The use for military purposes of radium or radioactive materials, heavy water, high voltage discharge equipment, cyclotrons.\" The office also asked to avoid discussion of \"polonium, uranium, ytterbium, hafnium, protactinium, radium, rhenium, thorium, deuterium\"; only uranium was sensitive, but was listed with other elements to hide its importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2001|pp=198\u2013200}}.</ref><ref name=\"ap19450808\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8CZdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0loNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1159%2C1605869 |title=No News Leaked Out About Bomb |newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World |date=8 August 1945 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=15 April 2012 |page=5}}</ref>\n\n=== Soviet spies ===\n{{Main|Atomic spies}}\nThe prospect of sabotage was always present, and sometimes suspected when there were equipment failures.

This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the [[Urakami]] Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city.

In order to maintain the supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future.

The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty about the future of the laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement.

Groves allocated $72&nbsp;million to them for research activities in fiscal year 1946\u20131947.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=633\u2013637}}.</ref> They would be in the vanguard of the kind of large-scale research that [[Alvin Weinberg]], the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, would call [[Big Science]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|1961|p=161}}.</ref>\n\nThe Naval Research Laboratory had long been interested in the prospect of using nuclear power for warship propulsion, and sought to create its own nuclear project. In May 1946, Nimitz, now [[Chief of Naval Operations]], decided that the Navy should instead work with the Manhattan Project. A group of naval officers were assigned to Oak Ridge, the most senior of whom was Captain [[Hyman G. Rickover]], who became assistant director there. They immersed themselves in the study of nuclear energy, laying the foundations for a [[nuclear navy|nuclear-powered navy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=74\u201376}}.</ref> A similar group of Air Force personnel arrived at Oak Ridge in September 1946 with the aim of developing [[nuclear aircraft]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=72\u201374}}.</ref> Their [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion|Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft]] (NEPA) project ran into formidable technical difficulties, and was ultimately cancelled.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=490\u2013493, 514\u2013515}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of the new reactors to create radioactive isotopes in previously unheard-of quantities sparked a revolution in [[nuclear medicine]] in the immediate postwar years. Starting in mid-1946, Oak Ridge began distributing radioisotopes to hospitals and universities. Most of the orders were for [[iodine-131]] and [[phosphorus-32]], which were used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In addition to medicine, isotopes were also used in biological, industrial and agricultural research.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=252\u2013253}}.</ref>\n\nOn handing over control to the Atomic Energy Commission, Groves bid farewell to the people who had worked on the Manhattan Project:{{quote|Five years ago, the idea of Atomic Power was only a dream. You have made that dream a reality. You have seized upon the most nebulous of ideas and translated them into actualities. You have built cities where none were known before. You have constructed industrial plants of a magnitude and to a precision heretofore deemed impossible. You built the weapon which ended the War and thereby saved countless American lives.

It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie Groves]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. Nuclear physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]] was the director of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] that designed the actual bombs. The Army component of the project was designated the '''Manhattan District'''; ''[[Manhattan]]'' gradually superseded the official codename, '''Development of Substitute Materials''', for the entire project. Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, [[Tube Alloys]]. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2&nbsp;billion (about ${{format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|2000000000|1945|r=-9}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce [[fissile material]], with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n\nTwo types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war: a relatively simple [[gun-type fission weapon]] and a more complex [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. The [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]] gun-type design proved impractical to use with [[plutonium]], and therefore a simpler gun-type called [[Little Boy]] was developed that used [[uranium-235]], an [[isotope]] that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural [[uranium]]. Chemically identical to the most common isotope, [[uranium-238]], and with almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate the two. Three methods were employed for [[uranium enrichment]]: [[calutron|electromagnetic]], [[gaseous diffusion|gaseous]] and [[thermophoresis|thermal]]. Most of this work was performed at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].\n\nIn parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce [[plutonium]], which was discovered at the [[University of California]] in 1940.<ref name=\"earlyUC\">The University of California was founded on March 23, 1868, and operated in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] before moving to its campus in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] in 1873.  {{Cite web|url=https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/programs-and-initiatives/faculty-resources-advancement/faculty-handbook-sections/brief-history.html|title=A brief history of the University of California {{!}} UCOP|website=www.ucop.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}  {{Cite web|url=https://150.universityofcalifornia.edu/|title=UC 150th Anniversary Timeline|last=California|first=University of|website=UC 150th Anniversary Timeline|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}} In March 1951, the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from [[University of California, Berkeley|its campus at Berkeley]].  {{Cite web|url=https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellors|title=Past Chancellors {{!}} Office of the Chancellor|website=chancellor.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}} See also the Wikipedia article on the [[University of California]].</ref> After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, the [[Chicago Pile-1]], was demonstrated in 1942 at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in the [[University of Chicago]], the Project designed the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at Oak Ridge and the production reactors at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington state]], in which uranium was irradiated and [[nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium, using the [[bismuth phosphate process]]. The [[Fat Man]] plutonium implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.\n\nThe project was also charged with gathering intelligence on the [[German nuclear weapon project]]. Through [[Operation Alsos]], Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet [[atomic spies]] successfully penetrated the program.\n\nThe first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the [[Trinity test]], conducted at New Mexico's [[White Sands Missile Range|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] on 16 July 1945. Little Boy and Fat Man bombs were used a month later in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], respectively. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at [[Bikini Atoll]] as part of [[Operation Crossroads]], developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|national laboratories]], supported medical research into [[radiology]] and laid the foundations for the [[nuclear navy]]. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] in January 1947.\n\n== Origins and timeline ==\n{{see also|Timeline of the Manhattan Project}}The discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Frisch]], made the development of an [[atomic bomb]] a theoretical possibility. There were fears that a [[German atomic bomb project]] would develop one first, especially among scientists who were refugees from [[Nazi Germany]] and other [[fascist]] countries.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=12}} In August 1939, Hungarian-born physicists [[Leo Szilard]] and [[Eugene Wigner]] drafted the [[Einstein\u2013Szilard letter]], which warned of the potential development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\". It urged the United States to take steps to acquire stockpiles of [[uranium ore]] and accelerate the research of [[Enrico Fermi]] and others into [[nuclear chain reaction]]s. They had it signed by [[Albert Einstein]] and delivered to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt called on [[Lyman Briggs]] of the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to head the [[Advisory Committee on Uranium]] to investigate the issues raised by the letter. Briggs held a meeting on 21 October 1939, which was attended by Szil\u00e1rd, Wigner and [[Edward Teller]]. The committee reported back to Roosevelt in November that uranium \"would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=16\u201320}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Navy]] awarded [[Columbia University]] $6,000 in funding, most of which [[Enrico Fermi]] and Szilard  spent on purchasing [[graphite]]. A team of Columbia professors including Fermi, Szilard, [[Eugene T. Booth]] and [[John R. Dunning|John Dunning]] created the first nuclear fission reaction in the Americas, verifying the work of Hahn and Strassmann. The same team subsequently built a series of prototype [[nuclear reactor]]s (or \"piles\" as Fermi called them) in [[Pupin Hall]] at Columbia, but were not yet able to achieve a chain reaction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://physics.columbia.edu/home/fermi-columbia|title=Fermi at Columbia {{!}} Department of Physics|website=physics.columbia.edu|access-date=29 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621185402/https://physics.columbia.edu/home/fermi-columbia|archive-date=21 June 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Advisory Committee on Uranium became the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) on Uranium when that organization was formed on 27 June 1940.<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|pp=337\u2013338}}.</ref> Briggs proposed spending $167,000 on research into uranium, particularly the [[uranium-235]] isotope, and [[plutonium]], which was discovered in 1940 at the [[University of California]]<ref name=\"earlyUC\"/><ref name=\"Hewlett&Anderson, pp. 40-41\" /> On 28 June 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807, which created the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16137 |title=Executive Order 8807 Establishing the Office of Scientific Research and Development |date=28 June 1941 |accessdate=28 June 2011}}</ref> with [[Vannevar Bush]] as its director.

He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.{{sfn|Phelps|2010|pp=282\u2013283}}\nAs part of the scientific exchange, the MAUD Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist [[Mark Oliphant]], flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the MAUD Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then set out to find out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited [[Berkeley, California]], where he spoke persuasively to [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to [[James B. Conant]], [[Arthur H. Compton]] and [[George B. Pegram]]. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|pp=372\u2013374}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=43\u201344}}.</ref>\n\nOn 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt approved the atomic program after he convened a meeting with Vannevar Bush and Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]]. To control the program, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself\u2014although he never attended a meeting\u2014Wallace, Bush, Conant, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]], and the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff of the Army]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[George C. Marshall]]. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had more experience with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort with that of the British, and on 11 October he sent a message to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 30-32\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=30\u201332}}.</ref>\n\n== Feasibility ==\n\n=== Proposals ===\n[[File:Lawrence Compton Bush Conant Compton Loomis 83d40m March 1940 meeting UCB.JPG|thumb|March 1940 meeting at Berkeley, California: [[Ernest O.

To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions, Oppenheimer and [[Fermi]] convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California in July 1942 with theoretical physicists [[Hans Bethe]], [[John Van Vleck]], Edward Teller, [[Emil Konopinski]], Robert Serber, [[Stan Frankel]], and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and [[experimental physicist]]s [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]], [[Felix Bloch]], [[Franco Rasetti]], [[John Henry Manley]], and [[Edwin McMillan]]. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42\u201344}}</ref>\n\nThere were still many unknown factors. The properties of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown, as were those of plutonium, an element that had only been discovered in February 1941 by [[Glenn Seaborg]] and his team. The scientists at the (July 1942) Berkeley conference envisioned creating plutonium in nuclear reactors where uranium-238 atoms absorbed neutrons that had been emitted from fissioning uranium-235 atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only tiny quantities of plutonium were available from [[cyclotron]]s at institutions such as [[Washington University in St. Louis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=33\u201335, 183}}.</ref> Even by December 1943, only two [[milligram]]s had been produced.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=41}}.</ref> There were many ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass. The simplest was shooting a \"cylindrical plug\" into a sphere of \"active material\" with a \"tamper\"\u2014dense material that would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Serber|Rhodes|1992|p=21}}.</ref> They also explored designs involving [[spheroid]]s, a primitive form of \"[[implosion nuclear weapon|implosion]]\" suggested by [[Richard C.

Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the \"super\", now usually referred to as a \"[[hydrogen bomb]]\", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction in [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|p=417}}.</ref> Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe refused each one.

Marshall created a liaison office in Washington, D.C., but established his temporary headquarters on the 18th floor of [[Tower 270|270 Broadway]] in New York, where he could draw on administrative support from the Corps of Engineers' [[North Atlantic Division]]. It was close to the Manhattan office of [[Stone & Webster]], the principal project contractor, and to Columbia University.

Robbins]], and his deputy, Colonel [[Leslie Groves]]. Reybold, Somervell, and Styer decided to call the project \"Development of Substitute Materials\", but Groves felt that this would draw attention. Since engineer districts normally carried the name of the city where they were located, Marshall and Groves agreed to name the Army's component of the project the Manhattan District. This became official on 13 August, when Reybold issued the order creating the new district. Informally, it was known as the Manhattan Engineer District, or MED. Unlike other districts, it had no geographic boundaries, and Marshall had the authority of a division engineer. Development of Substitute Materials remained as the official codename of the project as a whole, but was supplanted over time by \"Manhattan\".<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 41-44\" />\n\nMarshall later conceded that, \"I had never heard of atomic fission but I did know that you could not build much of a plant, much less four of them for $90&nbsp;million.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=652}}.</ref> A single [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] plant that Nichols had recently built in Pennsylvania had cost $128&nbsp;million.<ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=174}}.</ref> Nor were they impressed with estimates to the nearest order of magnitude, which Groves compared with telling a caterer to prepare for between ten and a thousand guests.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=40}}.</ref> A survey team from Stone & Webster had already scouted a site for the production plants. The [[War Production Board]] recommended sites around [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], an isolated area where the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] could supply ample electric power and the rivers could provide cooling water for the reactors. After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near [[Elza, Tennessee]].

Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel [[Lucius D.

Purnell]].<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 74-77\" /> Tolman and Conant were later appointed as Groves' scientific advisers.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=44\u201345}}.</ref>\n\nOn 19 September, Groves went to [[Donald M.

Nelson initially balked but quickly caved in when Groves threatened to go to the President.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=22\u201323}}.</ref> Groves promised not to use the AAA rating unless it was necessary. It soon transpired that for the routine requirements of the project the AAA rating was too high but the AA-3 rating was too low. After a long campaign, Groves finally received AA-1 authority on 1 July 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=80\u201382}}.</ref> According to Groves, \"In Washington you became aware of the importance of top priority. Most everything proposed in the Roosevelt administration would have top priority. That would last for about a week or two and then something else would get top priority\".{{sfn|Ermenc|1989|p=238}}\n\nOne of Groves' early problems was to find a director for [[Project Y]], the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a [[Nobel Prize]], which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were [[Communism|Communists]], including his brother, [[Frank Oppenheimer]]; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, [[Jean Tatlock]]. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=61\u201363}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|pp=72\u201373}}.</ref>\n\n=== Collaboration with the United Kingdom ===\n{{Main|British contribution to the Manhattan Project}}\nThe British and Americans exchanged nuclear information but did not initially combine their efforts. Britain rebuffed attempts by Bush and Conant in 1941 to strengthen cooperation with its own project, codenamed [[Tube Alloys]], because it was reluctant to share its technological lead and help the United States develop its own atomic bomb.<ref name=\"Bernstein 1976 206\u2013207\">{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=206\u2013207}}.</ref> An American scientist who brought a personal letter from Roosevelt to Churchill offering to pay for all research and development in an Anglo-American project was poorly treated, and Churchill did not reply to the letter. The United States as a result decided as early as April 1942 that if its offer was rejected, they should proceed alone.<ref name=\"villa1981\">{{harvnb|Villa|1981|pp=144\u2013145}}</ref> The British, who had made significant contributions early in the war, did not have the resources to carry through such a research program while fighting for their survival. As a result, Tube Alloys soon fell behind its American counterpart.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=206\u2013208}}.</ref> and on 30 July 1942, Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], the minister responsible for Tube Alloys, advised Churchill that: \"We must face the fact that&nbsp;... [our] pioneering work&nbsp;... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|p=208}}.</ref> That month Churchill and Roosevelt made an informal, unwritten agreement for atomic collaboration.{{r|stacey1970}}\n\n[[File:Groves and Chadwick 830308.jpg|thumb|left|Groves confers with [[James Chadwick]], the head of the British Mission.|alt=A large man in uniform and a bespectacled thin man in a suit and tie sit at a desk.]]\nThe opportunity for an equal partnership no longer existed, however, as shown in August 1942 when the British unsuccessfully demanded substantial control over the project while paying none of the costs. By 1943 the roles of the two countries had reversed from late 1941;{{r|villa1981}} in January Conant notified the British that they would no longer receive atomic information except in certain areas. While the British were shocked by the abrogation of the Churchill-Roosevelt agreement, head of the Canadian [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] C. J.

The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war\u2014especially not bomb design\u2014even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=209\u2013212}}.</ref> They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the [[European Theatre of World War II|war in Europe]].<ref name=\"fakley1983\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/british/index.shtml |title=The British Mission |author=Fakley, Dennis C. |journal=Los Alamos Science |date=Winter\u2013Spring 1983 |issue=7 |pp=186\u2013189 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nBy March 1943 Conant decided that British help would benefit some areas of the project.

Britain, however, agreed to restrictions on data on the building of large-scale production plants necessary for the bomb.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=216\u2013217}}.</ref> The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement in September 1944 extended this cooperation to the postwar period.<ref>{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|pp=340\u2013342}}.</ref> The Quebec Agreement established the [[Combined Policy Committee]] to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the Combined Policy Committee, Field Marshal Sir [[John Dill]] and Colonel [[John Jestyn Llewellin, 1st Baron Llewellin|J. J. Llewellin]] were the British members, and [[C. D. Howe]] was the Canadian member.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=296}}.</ref> Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir [[Ronald Ian Campbell]], who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], in early 1945. Sir John Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the [[British Defence Staff \u2013 US|British Joint Staff Mission]] and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|p=234}}.</ref>\n\nWhen cooperation resumed after the Quebec agreement, the Americans' progress and expenditures amazed the British.

Chadwick thus pressed for British involvement in the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent and abandon any hopes of a British project during the war.{{r|fakley1983}} With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honored.<ref>{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|pp=242\u2013244}}.</ref> The British Mission that arrived in the United States in December 1943 included [[Niels Bohr]], Otto Frisch, [[Klaus Fuchs]], Rudolf Peierls, and [[Ernest William Titterton|Ernest Titterton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hunner|2004|p=26}}.</ref> More scientists arrived in early 1944. While those assigned to gaseous diffusion left by the fall of 1944, the 35 working with Lawrence at Berkeley were assigned to existing laboratory groups and stayed until the end of the war. The 19 sent to Los Alamos also joined existing groups, primarily related to implosion and bomb assembly, but not the plutonium-related ones.{{r|fakley1983}} Part of the Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. In June 1945, Wilson agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.<ref>{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|p=372}}.</ref>\n\nThe Combined Policy Committee created the [[Combined Development Trust]] in June 1944, with Groves as its chairman, to procure uranium and [[thorium#Occurrence|thorium ores]] on international markets. The [[Belgian Congo]] and Canada held much of the world's uranium outside Eastern Europe, and the [[Belgian Government in Exile|Belgian government in exile]] was in London. Britain agreed to give the United States most of the Belgian ore, as it could not use most of the supply without restricted American research.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=223\u2013224}}.</ref> In 1944, the Trust purchased {{convert|3440000|lb|kg}} of uranium oxide ore from companies operating mines in the Belgian Congo. In order to avoid briefing US Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] on the project, a special account not subject to the usual auditing and controls was used to hold Trust monies. Between 1944 and the time he resigned from the Trust in 1947, Groves deposited a total of $37.5&nbsp;million into the Trust's account.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=90, 299\u2013306}}.</ref>\n\nGroves appreciated the early British atomic research and the British scientists' contributions to the Manhattan Project, but stated that the United States would have succeeded without them.{{r|fakley1983}} He also said that Churchill was \"the best friend the atomic bomb project had [as] he kept Roosevelt's interest up ...

Groves recruited [[DuPont]] in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard [[cost-plus contract|cost plus fixed-fee contract]], but the President of the company, [[Walter S. Carpenter, Jr.]], wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=58\u201359}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hanford workers.jpg|thumb|Hanford workers collect their paychecks at the Western Union office.|alt=A large crowd of sullen looking workmen at a counter where two women are writing.

Matthias reported that [[Hanford Site]] near [[Richland, Washington]], was \"ideal in virtually all respects\". It was isolated and near the [[Columbia River]], which could supply sufficient water to cool the reactors that would produce the plutonium. Groves visited the site in January and established the Hanford Engineer Works (HEW), codenamed \"Site W\".<ref name=\"Jones 1987 108\u2013111\" />\n\nUnder Secretary Patterson gave his approval on 9 February, allocating $5&nbsp;million for the acquisition of {{convert|40000|acre|ha}} of land in the area. The federal government relocated some 1,500 residents of [[White Bluffs, Washington|White Bluffs]] and [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]], and nearby settlements, as well as the [[Wanapum]] and other tribes using the area. A dispute arose with farmers over compensation for crops, which had already been planted before the land was acquired. Where schedules allowed, the Army allowed the crops to be harvested, but this was not always possible.<ref name=\"Jones 1987 108\u2013111\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=108\u2013111}}.</ref> The land acquisition process dragged on and was not completed before the end of the Manhattan Project in December 1946.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=342}}.</ref>\n\nThe dispute did not delay work. Although progress on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict the scope of the project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=452\u2013457}}.</ref> At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state.<ref>{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=16}}.</ref> Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=401}}.</ref> Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=463\u2013464}}.</ref>\n\n=== Canadian sites ===\n{{Main|Montreal Laboratory}}\n\n==== British Columbia ====\n[[Cominco]] had produced electrolytic hydrogen at [[Trail, British Columbia]], since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 that it could produce heavy water. To the existing $10&nbsp;million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75&nbsp;MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon [[catalyst]] for the first three stages while Urey developed a nickel-[[chromium(III) oxide|chromia]] one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8&nbsp;million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's heavy water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. Heavy water from Trail was used for [[Chicago Pile 3]], the first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.<ref name=\"Waltham, pp. 8-9\">{{harvnb|Waltham|2002|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref>\n\n==== Ontario ====\nThe [[Chalk River Laboratories|Chalk River, Ontario]], site was established to rehouse the Allied effort at the [[Montreal Laboratory]] away from an urban area. A new community was built at [[Deep River, Ontario]], to provide residences and facilities for the team members. The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a rail head adjacent to a large military base, [[Camp Petawawa]]. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first director of the new laboratory was [[Hans von Halban]]. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who in turn was succeeded by [[Bennett Lewis]] in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as [[ZEEP]] (zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went critical in September 1945, ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/zeep.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306233719/http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/zeep.cfm |archivedate=6 March 2014 |title=ZEEP \u2013 Canada's First Nuclear Reactor |publisher=Canada Science and Technology Museum}}</ref> A larger 10&nbsp;MW [[NRX]] reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went critical in July 1947.<ref name=\"Waltham, pp. 8-9\" />\n\n==== Northwest Territories ====\nThe [[Eldorado Mine (Northwest Territories)|Eldorado Mine]] at [[Port Radium]] was a source of uranium ore.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=8, 62}}.</ref>\n\n=== Heavy water sites ===\n{{Main|P-9 Project}}\nAlthough DuPont's preferred designs for the nuclear reactors were helium cooled and used graphite as a moderator, DuPont still expressed an interest in using heavy water as a backup, in case the graphite reactor design proved infeasible for some reason. For this purpose, it was estimated that {{convert|3|ST}} of heavy water would be required per month. The ''[[P-9 Project]]'' was the government's code name for the heavy water production program. As the plant at Trail, which was then under construction, could produce {{convert|0.5|ST}} per month, additional capacity was required. Groves therefore authorized DuPont to establish heavy water facilities at the Morgantown Ordnance Works, near [[Morgantown, West Virginia]]; at the [[Newport Chemical Depot|Wabash River Ordnance Works]], near [[Dana, Indiana|Dana]] and [[Newport, Indiana]]; and at the [[Alabama Army Ammunition Plant|Alabama Ordnance Works]], near [[Childersburg, Alabama|Childersburg]] and [[Sylacauga, Alabama]]. Although known as Ordnance Works and paid for under [[Ordnance Department]] contracts, they were built and operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The American plants used a process different from Trail's; heavy water was extracted by distillation, taking advantage of the slightly higher boiling point of heavy water.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=107\u2013108}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=201\u2013202}}.</ref>\n\n== Uranium ==\n=== Ore ===\nThe key raw material for the project was uranium, which was used as fuel for the reactors, as feed that was transformed into plutonium, and, in its enriched form, in the atomic bomb itself. There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940: in Colorado, in northern Canada, in [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimsthal]] in Czechoslovakia, and in the [[Belgian Congo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|p=39}}.</ref> All but Joachimstal were in allied hands. A November 1942 survey determined that sufficient quantities of uranium were available to satisfy the project's requirements.<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|p=92}}.</ref> Nichols arranged with the [[State Department]] for export controls to be placed on [[uranium oxide]] and negotiated for the purchase of {{convert|1200|ST}} of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo that was being stored in a warehouse on [[Staten Island]] and the remaining stocks of mined ore stored in the Congo. He negotiated with [[Eldorado Mining and Refining|Eldorado Gold Mines]] for the purchase of ore from its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario, and its shipment in 100-ton lots. The Canadian government subsequently bought up the company's stock until it acquired a controlling interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=85\u201386}}.</ref>\n\nWhile these purchases assured a sufficient supply to meet wartime needs, the American and British leaders concluded that it was in their countries' interest to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The richest source of ore was the [[Shinkolobwe]] mine in the Belgian Congo, but it was flooded and closed. Nichols unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate its reopening and the sale of the entire future output to the United States with [[Edgar Sengier]], the director of the company that owned the mine, [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=295}}.</ref> The matter was then taken up by the Combined Policy Committee. As 30 percent of Union Mini\u00e8re's stock was controlled by British interests, the British took the lead in negotiations. Sir John Anderson and Ambassador [[John Winant]] hammered out a deal with Sengier and the Belgian government in May 1944 for the mine to be reopened and {{convert|1720|ST}} of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=285\u2013288}}.</ref> To avoid dependence on the British and Canadians for ore, Groves also arranged for the purchase of US Vanadium Corporation's stockpile in [[Uravan, Colorado]]. [[Uranium mining in Colorado]] yielded about {{convert|800|ST}} of ore.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=291\u2013292}}.</ref>\n\n[[Mallinckrodt Incorporated]] in St. Louis, Missouri, took the raw ore and dissolved it in [[nitric acid]] to produce [[uranyl nitrate]]. [[Ether]] was then added in a [[liquid\u2013liquid extraction]] process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form [[uranium trioxide]], which was reduced to highly pure [[uranium dioxide]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ruhoff|Fain|1962|pp=3\u20139}}.</ref> By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] and Metal Hydrides.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=31}}</ref> Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at [[Iowa State College]] in [[Ames, Iowa]], under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This became known as the [[Ames Project]], and its [[Ames process]] became available in 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=87\u201388}}.</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Uranium refining at Ames\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:Ames Process pressure vessel lower.jpg|A \"bomb\" ([[pressure vessel]]) containing uranium halide and [[sacrificial metal]], probably magnesium, being lowered into a furnace\nFile:Ames Process pressure vessel remnant slag after reaction.jpg|After the reaction, the interior of a bomb coated with remnant [[slag]]\nFile:Ames Process uranium biscuit.jpg|A uranium metal \"biscuit\" from the [[redox|reduction]] reaction\n</gallery>\n\n=== Isotope separation ===\nNatural uranium consists of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235, but only the latter is [[fissile]]. The chemically identical uranium-235 has to be physically separated from the more plentiful isotope. Various methods were considered for [[uranium enrichment]], most of which was carried out at Oak Ridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=154\u2013156}}.</ref>\n\nThe most obvious technology, the centrifuge, failed, but electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful and contributed to the project. In February 1943, Groves came up with the idea of using the output of some plants as the input for others.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=157}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Clinton Engineer Works.png|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Oak Ridge hosted several uranium separation technologies.

The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with [[uranium hexafluoride]], the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=30}}.</ref>\n\nScaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with {{convert|1|m|adj=on|sp=us}} rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with {{convert|4|m|adj=on|sp=us}} rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting,<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=64}}.</ref> and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required. Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work on a series of improvements which promised to increase the efficiency of the process. However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=96\u201397}}.</ref> In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee following a recommendation by Conant, Nichols and August C. Klein of Stone & Webster.<ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=64}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough the centrifuge method was abandoned by the Manhattan Project, research into it advanced significantly after the war with the introduction of the [[Zippe-type centrifuge]], which was developed in the Soviet Union by Soviet and captured German engineers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kemp|2012|pp=281\u2013287}}.</ref> It eventually became the preferred method of Uranium isotope separation, being far more economical than the other separation methods used during WWII.<ref>{{harvnb|Kemp|2012|pp=291\u2013297}}.</ref>\n\n==== Electromagnetic separation ====\n{{Main|Y-12 Project}}\nElectromagnetic isotope separation was developed by Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as [[calutron]]s, a hybrid of the standard laboratory [[mass spectrometer]] and the cyclotron magnet. The name was derived from the words ''California'', ''university'' and ''cyclotron''.<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 117-119\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=117\u2013119}}.</ref> In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=164\u2013165}}.</ref> The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient.<ref name=\"Fine & Remington, p. 684\">{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=684}}.</ref> Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 117-119\" />\n\n[[File:Alpha 1 racetrack, Uranium 235 electromagnetic separation plant, Manhattan Project, Y-12 Oak Ridge.jpg|thumb|left|Alpha I racetrack at Y-12|alt=A large oval-shaped structure]]\nMarshall and Nichols discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require {{convert|5000|ST|abbr=off}} of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with [[United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury|Under Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Daniel W. Bell]] and asked for the transfer of 6,000 tons of silver bullion from the [[West Point Bullion Depository]]. \"Young man,\" Bell told him, \"you may think of silver in tons but the Treasury will always think of silver in [[troy ounce]]s!\"<ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=42}}.</ref> Eventually, {{convert|14700|ST|t ozt|abbr=off}} were used.<ref name=\"Jones, p. 133\" />\n\nThe {{convert|1000|ozt|kg|adj=on}} silver bars were cast into cylindrical billets and taken to [[Phelps Dodge]] in Bayway, New Jersey, where they were extruded into strips {{convert|0.625|in}} thick, {{convert|3|in}} wide and {{convert|40|ft}} long. These were wound onto magnetic coils by [[Allis-Chalmers]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After the war, all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver. In the end, only 1/3,600,000th was lost.<ref name=\"Jones, p. 133\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=133}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=153}}.</ref> The last silver was returned in May 1970.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=67}}.</ref>\n\nResponsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant, which came to be called [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]], was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=126\u2013132}}.</ref>\n\nWhen the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because of the power of the magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.<ref name=\"Fine & Remington, p. 684\" /> The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944, the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I was operational in April.

They were then turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education. Nichols compared unit production data, and pointed out to Lawrence that the young \"[[hillbilly]]\" girl operators were outperforming his PhDs. They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost, a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors. The girls were \"trained like soldiers not to reason why\", while \"the scientists could not refrain from time-consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=131}}.</ref>\n\nY-12 initially enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. Much of the rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By August K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=143\u2013148}}.</ref>\n\n==== Gaseous diffusion ====\n{{Main|K-25}}\nThe most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. [[Graham's law]] states that the rate of [[effusion]] of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its [[molecular mass]], so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, [[Karl P. Cohen]], and [[John R. Dunning]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=30\u201332, 96\u201398}}</ref>\n\n[[File:K-25 aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|Oak Ridge K-25 plant|alt=Oblique aerial view of an enormous U-shaped building]]\nIn November 1942 the Military Policy Committee approved the construction of a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=108}}.</ref> On 14 December, [[M. W. Kellogg]] accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed-fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5&nbsp;million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=150\u2013151}}.</ref> The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride would have to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] and the [[Bakelite]] Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=154\u2013157}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=126\u2013127}}.</ref>\n\nKellex's design for K-25 called for a four-story {{convert|0.5|mi|km|adj=on|sp=us}} long U-shaped structure containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately or as part of a single cascade. A survey party began construction by marking out the {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} site in May 1943. Work on the main building began in October 1943, and the six-stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages of the plant, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, [[Union Carbide]] and Carbon, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480&nbsp;million.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=158\u2013165}}.</ref>\n\nThe production plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=167\u2013171}}.</ref>\n\n==== Thermal diffusion ====\n{{Main|S-50 Project}}\nThe thermal diffusion process was based on [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]]'s [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory|theory]], which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this can be used as a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by [[Klaus Clusius]] and Gerhard Dickel in Germany in 1938.<ref>{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=161\u2013162}}.</ref> It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=172}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:S50plant.jpg|thumb|The S-50 plant is the dark building to the upper left behind the Oak Ridge powerhouse (with smoke stacks).|alt=A factory with three smoking chimneys on a river bend, viewed from above]]\nThe Naval Research Laboratory continued the research under Philip Abelson's direction, but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944, when [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]], the naval officer in charge of ordnance development at Los Alamos, brought Oppenheimer news of encouraging progress in the Navy's experiments on thermal diffusion. Oppenheimer wrote to Groves suggesting that the output of a thermal diffusion plant could be fed into Y-12. Groves set up a committee consisting of [[Warren K. Lewis]], Eger Murphree and Richard Tolman to investigate the idea, and they estimated that a thermal diffusion plant costing $3.5&nbsp;million could enrich {{convert|50|kg|lb|0}} of uranium per week to nearly 0.9% uranium-235. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=175\u2013177}}.</ref>\n\nGroves contracted with the H. K. Ferguson Company of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], to build the thermal diffusion plant, which was designated S-50. Groves's advisers, Karl Cohen and W. I. Thompson from [[Esso|Standard Oil]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=170\u2013172}}.</ref> estimated that it would take six months to build. Groves gave Ferguson just four. Plans called for the installation of 2,142 {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} diffusion columns arranged in 21 racks. Inside each column were three concentric tubes. Steam, obtained from the nearby K-25 powerhouse at a pressure of {{convert|100|psi}} and temperature of {{convert|545|F|C}}, flowed downward through the innermost {{convert|1.25|in|adj=on}} nickel pipe, while water at {{convert|155|F|C}} flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe. The uranium hexafluoride flowed in the middle copper pipe, and isotope separation of the uranium occurred between the nickel and copper pipes.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=178\u2013179}}.</ref>\n\nWork commenced on 9 July 1944, and S-50 began partial operation in September. Ferguson operated the plant through a subsidiary known as Fercleve. The plant produced just {{convert|10.5|lb}} of 0.852% uranium-235 in October. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 it produced {{convert|12730|lb}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=180\u2013183}}.</ref> By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12,<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=300\u2013302}}.</ref> which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"Hansen, p. 112\">{{harvnb|Hansen|1995b|p=V-112}}.</ref>\n\n=== Aggregate U-235 production ===\nAbout {{convert|50|kg}} of uranium enriched to 89% uranium-235 was delivered to Los Alamos by July 1945.<ref name=\"Hansen, p. 112\" /> The entire 50&nbsp;kg, along with some 50%-enriched, averaging out to about 85% enriched, were used in [[Little Boy]].<ref name=\"Hansen, p. 112\" />\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Plutonium ==\nThe second line of development pursued by the Manhattan Project used the fissile element plutonium. Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, the best way to obtain large quantities of the element is in a nuclear reactor, in which natural uranium is bombarded by neutrons. The uranium-238 is [[nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into [[uranium-239]], which rapidly decays, first into [[neptunium-239]] and then into [[plutonium-239]].<ref name=\"Smyth, pp. 130-132\" /> Only a small amount of the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from [[fission products]].<ref name=\"Smyth, pp. 130-132\">{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=130\u2013132}}.</ref>\n\n=== X-10 Graphite Reactor ===\n{{Main|X-10 Graphite Reactor}}\n[[File:X10 Reactor Face.jpg|thumb|Workers load uranium slugs into the X-10 Graphite Reactor.|alt=Two workmen on a movable platform similar to that used by window washers, stick a rod into one of many small holes in the wall in front of them.]]\nIn March 1943, DuPont began construction of a plutonium plant on a {{convert|112|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} site at Oak Ridge. Intended as a pilot plant for the larger production facilities at Hanford, it included the air-cooled [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]], a chemical separation plant, and support facilities. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot.<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 204-206\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=204\u2013206}}.</ref> The X-10 Graphite Reactor consisted of a huge block of graphite, {{convert|24|ft|m}} long on each side, weighing around {{convert|1500|ST}}, surrounded by {{convert|7|ft|m}} of high-density concrete as a radiation shield.<ref name=\"Jones, pp. 204-206\" />\n\nThe greatest difficulty was encountered with the uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow had to be coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a [[tinning#Hot-dipping|hot dipping process]] without success. Meanwhile, [[Alcoa]] tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure rate of more than 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of [[General Electric]], which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=208\u2013210}}.</ref>\n\nWatched by Fermi and Compton, the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical on 4 November 1943 with about {{convert|30|ST}} of uranium. A week later the load was increased to {{convert|36|ST}}, raising its power generation to 500&nbsp;kW, and by the end of the month the first 500&nbsp;mg of plutonium was created.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=211}}.</ref> Modifications over time raised the power to 4,000&nbsp;kW in July 1944.

Two large water towers loom above the plant.]]\nAs at Oak Ridge, the most difficulty was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were [[pickling (metal)|pickled]] to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and [[silumin|aluminum-silicon alloy]], canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using [[arc welding]] under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they were subjected to a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful of canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start [[B-Reactor|Reactor B]] on schedule in August 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=222\u2013226}}.</ref>\n\nWork began on Reactor B, the first of six planned 250&nbsp;MW reactors, on 10 October 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=139}}.</ref> The reactor complexes were given letter designations A through F, with B, D and F sites chosen to be developed first, as this maximised the distance between the reactors.

Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the [[control rod]]s to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=304\u2013307}}.</ref><ref name=\"Jones, pp. 220-223\">{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=220\u2013223}}.</ref>\n\nFermi contacted [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], who identified the cause of the problem as [[neutron poison]]ing from [[xenon-135]], which has a [[half-life]] of 9.2 hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|p=45}}.</ref> Fermi, Woods, [[Donald J.

Working with the minute quantities of plutonium available at the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a [[fluoride selective electrode|lanthanum fluoride process]] for separating uranium and plutonium, which was chosen for the pilot separation plant. A second separation process, the [[bismuth phosphate process]], was subsequently developed by Seaborg and Stanly G. Thomson.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=184\u2013185}}.</ref> This process worked by toggling plutonium between its +4 and +6 [[oxidation state]]s in solutions of bismuth phosphate. In the former state, the plutonium was precipitated; in the latter, it stayed in solution and the other products were precipitated.<ref>{{harvnb|Hanford Cultural and Historic Resources Program|2002|pp=2\u20134.15-2-4.18}}</ref>\n\nGreenewalt favored the bismuth phosphate process due to the corrosive nature of lanthanum fluoride, and it was selected for the Hanford separation plants.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=204\u2013205}}.</ref> Once X-10 began producing plutonium, the pilot separation plant was put to the test. The first batch was processed at 40% efficiency but over the next few months this was raised to 90%.<ref name=\"Jones 1985 209\" />\n\nAt Hanford, top priority was initially given to the installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=214\u2013216}}.</ref>\n\nEarly plans called for the construction of two separation plants in each of the areas known as 200-West and 200-East. This was subsequently reduced to two, the T and U plants, in 200-West and one, the B plant, at 200-East.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=212}}.</ref> Each separation plant consisted of four buildings: a process cell building or \"canyon\" (known as 221), a concentration building (224), a purification building (231) and a magazine store (213). The canyons were each {{convert|800|ft}} long and {{convert|65|ft}} wide. Each consisted of forty {{convert|17.7|by|13|by|20|ft|adj=on}} cells.<ref>{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=11}}.</ref>\n\nWork began on 221-T and 221-U in January 1944, with the former completed in September and the latter in December. The 221-B building followed in March 1945. Because of the high levels of radioactivity involved, all work in the separation plants had to be conducted by remote control using closed-circuit television, something unheard of in 1943. Maintenance was carried out with the aid of an overhead crane and specially designed tools. The 224 buildings were smaller because they had less material to process, and it was less radioactive. The 224-T and 224-U buildings were completed on 8 October 1944, and 224-B followed on 10 February 1945. The purification methods that were eventually used in 231-W were still unknown when construction commenced on 8 April 1944, but the plant was complete and the methods were selected by the end of the year.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=219\u2013222}}.</ref> On 5 February 1945, Matthias hand-delivered the first shipment of 80&nbsp;g of 95%-pure plutonium nitrate to a Los Alamos courier in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Thayer 1996 141\" />\n\n=== Weapon design ===\n{{Main|Project Y}}\n[[File:Thin Man plutonium gun bomb casings.jpg|thumb|A row of Thin Man casings. Fat Man casings are visible in the background.|alt=Long, tube-like casings. In the background are several ovoid casings and a tow truck.]]\nIn 1943, development efforts were directed to a [[gun-type fission weapon]] with plutonium called [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segr\u00e8 discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=226\u2013229}}</ref> Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 that some of the plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=250\u2013252}}.</ref>\n\nThis made reactor plutonium unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a [[predetonation]] that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass with a minimal amount of plutonium reacted (a [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]]). A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=242\u2013244}}</ref>\n\nWork on an alternative method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier under the direction of the physicist [[Seth Neddermeyer]]. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=312\u2013313}}.</ref> Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=129\u2013130}}</ref> In September 1943, [[John von Neumann]], who had experience with [[shaped charge]]s used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=246}}.</ref> He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Implosion Nuclear weapon.svg|thumb|left|An implosion-type nuclear bomb|alt=Diagram showing fast explosive, slow explosive, uranium tamper, plutonium core and neutron initiator]]\nBy July 1944, Oppenheimer had concluded plutonium could not be used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed [[Fat Man]], began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=245\u2013248}}</ref> Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert [[George Kistiakowsky]] and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=311}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=245}}</ref> The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used [[explosive lens]]es to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives.<ref name=\"Hoddeson et al, pp. 294-296\" />\n\nThe design of lenses that detonated with the proper shape and velocity turned out to be slow, difficult and frustrating.<ref name=\"Hoddeson et al, pp. 294-296\">{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=294\u2013296}}</ref> Various explosives were tested before settling on [[composition B]] as the fast explosive and [[baratol]] as the slow explosive.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=299}}</ref> The final design resembled a soccer ball, with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal lenses, each weighing about {{convert|80|lb}}.

The gamma ray source was placed in the center of a metal sphere surrounded by the explosive lenses, which in turn were inside in an [[ionization chamber]]. This allowed the taking of an X-ray movie of the implosion.

The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results.

It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with [[alpha particles]], which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a [[plutonium-gallium alloy]], which stabilized the \u03b4 phase and could be [[hot pressing|hot pressed]] into the desired spherical shape.

Manhattan Project security poster.png|thumb|Security poster, warning office workers to close drawers and put documents in safes when not being used]]\nVoluntary censorship of atomic information began before the Manhattan Project. After the start of the European war in 1939 American scientists began avoiding publishing military-related research, and in 1940 scientific journals began asking the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to clear articles. [[William L. Laurence]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who wrote an article on atomic fission in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' of 7 September 1940, later learned that government officials asked librarians nationwide in 1943 to withdraw the issue.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2001|pp=196\u2013198}}.</ref> The Soviets noticed the silence, however. In April 1942 nuclear physicist [[Georgy Flyorov]] wrote to [[Josef Stalin]] on the absence of articles on nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project.<ref>{{harvnb|Holloway|1994|pp=76\u201379}}.</ref>\n\nThe Manhattan Project operated under tight security lest its discovery induce Axis powers, especially Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects or undertake covert operations against the project.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=253\u2013255}}.</ref> The government's [[Office of Censorship]], by contrast, relied on the press to comply with a voluntary code of conduct it published, and the project at first avoided notifying the office. By early 1943 newspapers began publishing reports of large construction in Tennessee and Washington based on public records, and the office began discussing with the project how to maintain secrecy. In June the Office of Censorship asked newspapers and broadcasters to avoid discussing \"atom smashing, atomic energy, atomic fission, atomic splitting, or any of their equivalents. The use for military purposes of radium or radioactive materials, heavy water, high voltage discharge equipment, cyclotrons.\" The office also asked to avoid discussion of \"polonium, uranium, ytterbium, hafnium, protactinium, radium, rhenium, thorium, deuterium\"; only uranium was sensitive, but was listed with other elements to hide its importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2001|pp=198\u2013200}}.</ref><ref name=\"ap19450808\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8CZdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0loNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1159%2C1605869 |title=No News Leaked Out About Bomb |newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World |date=8 August 1945 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=15 April 2012 |page=5}}</ref>\n\n=== Soviet spies ===\n{{Main|Atomic spies}}\nThe prospect of sabotage was always present, and sometimes suspected when there were equipment failures.

This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the [[Urakami]] Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city.

The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable.

Laurence witnessed both the Trinity test<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2001|pp=204\u2013205}}.</ref> and the bombing of Nagasaki and wrote the official press releases prepared for them. He went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon.

Two more were established by Groves soon after the war, the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] at [[Upton, New York]], and the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Groves allocated $72&nbsp;million to them for research activities in fiscal year 1946\u20131947.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=633\u2013637}}.</ref> They would be in the vanguard of the kind of large-scale research that [[Alvin Weinberg]], the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, would call [[Big Science]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|1961|p=161}}.</ref>\n\nThe Naval Research Laboratory had long been interested in the prospect of using nuclear power for warship propulsion, and sought to create its own nuclear project. In May 1946, Nimitz, now [[Chief of Naval Operations]], decided that the Navy should instead work with the Manhattan Project. A group of naval officers were assigned to Oak Ridge, the most senior of whom was Captain [[Hyman G. Rickover]], who became assistant director there. They immersed themselves in the study of nuclear energy, laying the foundations for a [[nuclear navy|nuclear-powered navy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=74\u201376}}.</ref> A similar group of Air Force personnel arrived at Oak Ridge in September 1946 with the aim of developing [[nuclear aircraft]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=72\u201374}}.</ref> Their [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion|Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft]] (NEPA) project ran into formidable technical difficulties, and was ultimately cancelled.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=490\u2013493, 514\u2013515}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of the new reactors to create radioactive isotopes in previously unheard-of quantities sparked a revolution in [[nuclear medicine]] in the immediate postwar years. Starting in mid-1946, Oak Ridge began distributing radioisotopes to hospitals and universities. Most of the orders were for [[iodine-131]] and [[phosphorus-32]], which were used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In addition to medicine, isotopes were also used in biological, industrial and agricultural research.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=252\u2013253}}.</ref>\n\nOn handing over control to the Atomic Energy Commission, Groves bid farewell to the people who had worked on the Manhattan Project:{{quote|Five years ago, the idea of Atomic Power was only a dream. You have made that dream a reality. You have seized upon the most nebulous of ideas and translated them into actualities. You have built cities where none were known before.

Bobadilla continued his good goalscoring form, becoming their first choice striker. Bobadilla finished in second place of the goal scorer list at the end of the season and was shortlisted in the Final 4 players for the Swiss League player of the year for the 2007\u201308 season, which was ultimately won by [[Hakan Yakin]].\n\nBobadilla signed for [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] on 11 June 2009<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.borussia.de/de/borussia_news_detail,185,0,newsid-171562.html | title = Borussia verpflichtet Thorben Marx und Ra\u00fal Bobadilla | date = 12 June 2009 | accessdate = 19 June 2009 | publisher = borussia.de | language = German}}</ref> but returned to Switzerland in 2012 to play for Bern's [[BSC Young Boys]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.transfermarketweb.com/index.php?action=read&idsel=97665 | title = Young Boys sign Bobadilla | date = 21 January 2012 | accessdate = 26 October 2012 | first = Marco | last = Gori}}</ref>\n\n===Basel===\nOn 3 January 2013, FC Basel announced that Bobadilla signed a contract until 2017.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/10044/29390/16/7 | title = FCB engagiert St\u00fcrmer Ra\u00fal Bobadilla | language = German | publisher = FC Basel | date = 3 January 2013 | accessdate = 3 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe made his league debut for Basel on 1 April in the 4\u20130 away win against [[FC Luzern|Luzern]] being substituted in during the 77th minute of the game.

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in over 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned. Producer J Kash was involved during initial writing sessions.<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\"/>\n\nThe lyrics were written in January 2019 with a \"dance-around-the-room attitude\". Kirkpatrick included the use of a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] in the first [[Demo (music)|demo]], based on phrasing in the chorus and inspired by music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]]. He produced the transition from the verse to the [[Drop (music)|drop]] using \"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\" by [[The Weeknd]] as an example.<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\"/> Although the [[bassline]] in \"Don't Start Now\" sounds live, Kirkpatrick created it with [[MIDI]].

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in over 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned.

Kirkpatrick included the use of a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] in the first [[Demo (music)|demo]], based on phrasing in the chorus and inspired by music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]].

Nurse served with the Indian Army. Col. Nurse was one of the small band of naturalists among military officers who devoted their leisure to the study of entomology, and was an enthusiastic collector of Hymenoptera, forming a large and valuable collection which he presented to the Museum a few years ago. The present bequest comprises the remainder of his Indian insects and includes about 1,450 [[Fly|Diptera]] (two winged flies), 1,300 butterflies, 130 dragon-flies and some others; of these the most valuable are the Diptera. The collection is especially rich in species of the family [[Bombyliidae]], most of which are parasitic in the larval state on bees or wasps. Col. Nurse discovered and described fourteen species of this family which were new to science, and [[Type (biology)|types]] of these are in the collection, as well as specimens of a number of other flies which were not previously represented in the Museum. Some interesting butterflies and other insects from Aden are included. \u2013 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], 1934.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 March 1934|title=Recent Acquisitions at the Natural History Museum|url=|journal=Nature|volume=133|pages=323\u2013 323|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Societies==\nNurse was a member of the [[Bombay Natural History Society]] (Managing Committee).

Nurse served with the Indian Army. Col. Nurse was one of the small band of naturalists among military officers who devoted their leisure to the study of entomology, and was an enthusiastic collector of Hymenoptera, forming a large and valuable collection which he presented to the Museum a few years ago. The present bequest comprises the remainder of his Indian insects and includes about 1,450 [[Fly|Diptera]] (two winged flies), 1,300 butterflies, 130 dragon-flies and some others; of these the most valuable are the Diptera. The collection is especially rich in species of the family [[Bombyliidae]], most of which are parasitic in the larval state on bees or wasps. Col. Nurse discovered and described fourteen species of this family which were new to science, and [[Type (biology)|types]] of these are in the collection, as well as specimens of a number of other flies which were not previously represented in the Museum. Some interesting butterflies and other insects from Aden are included. \u2013 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], 1934.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 March 1934|title=Recent Acquisitions at the Natural History Museum|url=|journal=Nature|volume=133|pages=323\u2013 323|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Societies==\nNurse was a member of the [[Bombay Natural History Society]] (Managing Committee).
