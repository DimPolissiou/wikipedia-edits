Since its establishment, the team has played its home matches in the 33,108-capacity [[Wankhede Stadium]] in Mumbai. \n\nIn 2017, the Mumbai Indians became the first franchise to cross the $100 million mark in brand value among the IPL franchises.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/brand-ipl-gets-stronger-valuation-soars-to-5-3-billion/articleshow/60199993.cms?from=mdr%7Ctitle=Brand%20IPL%20gets%20stronger&from=mdr|title=Brand IPL gets stronger, valuation soars to $5.3 billion|last=Laghate|first=Gaurav|date=24 August 2017|work=The Economic Times|access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref> The brand value of Mumbai Indians, in 2019, is estimated to be around \u20b9809 crore (roughly $115 million), the highest among all the IPL franchises for the fourth consecutive year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/ipl-brand-valuation-soars-13-5-to-rs-47500-crore-duff-phelps/articleshow/71197984.cms?from=mdr|title=IPL brand valuation soars 13.5% to Rs 47,500 crore: Duff & Phelps|last=Laghate|first=Gaurav|date=20 September 2019|work=The Economic Times|access-date=22 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nMumbai Indians is the most successful team in the IPL.

The franchise was eventually named \"Mumbai Indians\".\n\n==Team history==\n\n===2008\u20132009: Struggle in the initial seasons===\n\nThe Indian Premier League named four players as [[icon player]]s for their respective city franchises which made the players unavailable to play for any team other than their city team. [[Sachin Tendulkar]] was named Mumbai's icon player. The icon player was also entitled to earn 15% more than the next-best paid player in their team. At first [[2008 Indian Premier League#Player auctions|player auctions]] for the [[2008 Indian Premier League|inaugural IPL season]] conducted in February 2008, the Mumbai franchise bought several star international cricketers such as [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], [[Harbhajan Singh]], [[Shaun Pollock]], [[Lasith Malinga]] and [[Robin Uthappa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=IPL Auction: Players' worth|url=http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2008/feb/20table.htm|publisher=rediff.com|accessdate=4 June 2013}}</ref> The franchise named Sachin Tendulkar as the captain of the team and appointed former India cricketer [[Lalchand Rajput]] as the head coach. However, Tendulkar was injured before the start of the 2008 season due to which Harbhajan Singh took over as the captain in the initial stage of the season. The team got off to a bad start in the season losing their first four games by some comprehensive margins. Their first match was a five-wicket defeat to the [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] on 20 April 2008 at the [[Wankhede Stadium|Wankhede]]. Their stand-in captain, Harbhajan, was suspended from the tournament for reportedly [[Harbhajan Singh#Altercations with Andrew Symonds and Sreesanth|slapping Sreesanth]] during Mumbai's league match against [[Kings XI Punjab]]. After Harbhajan's suspension, Shaun Pollock assumed the leadership duties until Tendulkar's return on 24 May. Under Pollock's captaincy, Mumbai won six out of their next six games which left them needing to win two more out of the remaining four matches to qualify for the semifinals. Mumbai suffered three last-over defeats in the next three games, including two off the last ball, before winning their last league match. They finished fifth in the points table with 7 wins and 7 losses, missing out on a semifinal spot by just one point.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indian Premier League, 2007/08 / Points table|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl/engine/series/313494.html?view=pointstable|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2009 Indian Premier League|2009 season]] was played in South Africa as it coincided with multi-phase [[2009 Indian general election]]s due to which the [[Government of India]] refused to commit the [[Paramilitary forces of India|Indian paramilitary forces]] to provide security for the IPL. Before the start of the season, Mumbai Indians traded [[Robin Uthappa]] for [[Zaheer Khan]] with Royal Challengers Bangalore, and [[Ashish Nehra]] for [[Shikhar Dhawan]] with the [[Delhi Daredevils]]. Shaun Pollock retired after the first season and became the head coach of the team. Lasith Malinga, who missed the previous season due to an injury, returned to the team. At the [[List of 2009 Indian Premier League personnel changes#Auction|player auction]], Mumbai bought South African batsman [[JP Duminy]] to strengthen their batting department. After winning their opening match against the [[Chennai Super Kings]], Mumbai struggled to put up consistent performances during the season. They relied heavily on Duminy and Tendulkar's batting, and Malinga's bowling along with minimal contributions from other players. With only five wins from 14 matches, Mumbai finished on seventh place in the league table.\n\n===2010\u20132012: Rise as a strong team===\n[[File:Lasith Malinga signing.jpg|thumb|[[Lasith Malinga]] is the leading wicket-taker in IPL with 150 wickets since its inception.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lasith Malinga becomes first to reach 150 IPL wickets|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2017-10/lasith-malinga-becomes-first-to-reach-150-ipl-wickets-4644137/|website=The Indian Express|date=7 May 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nAt the [[List of 2010 Indian Premier League personnel changes#auction|2010 players auction]], Mumbai Indians bought Trinidadian all-rounder [[Kieron Pollard]] for $750,000 following a secret tiebreaker. After the auction, they signed up ten uncapped Indian players out whom seven were former [[Indian Cricket League|ICL]] players. Former India cricketer [[Robin Singh (cricketer, born 1963)|Robin Singh]] was named as the head coach of the team as Pollock took up the role of bowling coach. Mumbai had to shift their home venue to [[Brabourne Stadium]] for the season since the Wankhede was undergoing renovation to host some matches of the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]]. Mumbai won seven of their first eight games to take the top spot in the points table. Their success was mainly due to the efforts of Tendulkar, Malinga, Harbhajan, [[Ambati Rayudu]] and [[Saurabh Tiwary]]. They won three of the remaining six league games and finished with 20 points from 14 games at the top of the points table. They beat the Royal Challengers Bangalore by 35 runs in the semifinal, thanks to Pollard's all-round efforts (33* from 13 balls, and 3/17). At the final, they were defeated by the Chennai Super Kings by 22 runs. The Mumbai team management was criticised for the \"strategic errors\" during the final such as sending [[Abhishek Nayar]] and Harbhajan at batting positions 3 and 4 respectively while Duminy and Pollard were sent at 7 and 8. Mumbai skipper Sachin Tendulkar, who scored 618 runs at an average of 47.53 and strike rate of 132.6, won the Orange Cap for scoring most runs in the season. Mumbai qualified for the [[2010 Champions League Twenty20]] where they were eliminated in the group stage with two wins and two defeats in four matches.\n\nIn [[2011 Indian Premier League|2011]], with the addition of two new teams to the IPL, the IPL Governing Council declared that each franchise could retain a maximum of four players of their 2010 squad, and the rest of the international players would be auctioned. Mumbai Indians retained Tendulkar, Harbhajan, Pollard and Malinga for a sum of $4.5 million. This retention left the franchise with the power of spending $4.5 million at the [[List of 2011 Indian Premier League personnel changes#auction|auction]] where they purchased Indian batsman [[Rohit Sharma]] for $2 million, former Australian all-rounder [[Andrew Symonds]] for $850,000, and pacer [[Munaf Patel]] for $700,000. Mumbai won eight of their first ten league games following which they suffered a loss of form that led to three consecutive defeats and a last-ball win in their last league match. They finished third on the points table with 18 points from 14 games and qualified for the Eliminator. The Eliminator was played at the Wankhede where Mumbai faced the [[Kolkata Knight Riders]]. After winning the toss and electing to bowl first, Mumbai restricted Kolkata to 147 in 20 overs and chased down the target for the loss of six wickets with four balls to spare. Munaf Patel won the Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 3/27. With this win, Mumbai qualified for the Qualifying final against Royal Challengers Bangalore, the winner of which would play the Super Kings in the final. Mumbai skipper Tendulkar won the toss once again and put their opposition into bat who set Mumbai a target of 186. Mumbai kept losing wickets at regular intervals from the start of their innings and could score only 142/8, falling short by 43 runs. The top two leading wicket-takers of the season were Mumbai Indians pacers Lasith Malinga and Munaf Patel with 28 and 22 wickets respectively.\n\nMumbai qualified for the [[2011 Champions League Twenty20]] held in India. Before the start of the tournament, six first-choice Indian players in the Mumbai squad including Tendulkar, Sharma and Patel were ruled out of the tournament due to injuries and two more Indian players were ruled out based on medical reports. This left their 14-member squad with only six Indian players, while the tournament allowed a maximum of four overseas players and minimum of seven local players in the playing eleven. An exception was made for the Mumbai Indians which permitted them to field five overseas players during the tournament. Harbhajan was named the stand-in captain in the absence of Tendulkar. Mumbai were placed in Group A alongside Chennai Super Kings, [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales Blues]], [[Cape Cobras]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago national cricket team|Trinidad & Tobago]]. Mumbai had two wins, one defeat and one no result in the group stage which gave them the second place on the group points table with five points. They qualified for the semifinal and Mumbai batsman [[Suryakumar Yadav]] returned to the squad after recovering from his injury. This led to the withdrawal of the concession given by the Champions League for the Mumbai Indians to field five overseas players. Mumbai faced [[Somerset County Cricket Club]] in the semifinal at Chennai. Batting first, Mumbai made 160/5 in 20 overs. Somerset's chase was dented by Malinga who picked four wickets for 20 (all [[bowled]]) to help Mumbai restrict Somerset to 150 and win the match by 10 runs. The final was also played in Chennai where Mumbai met Royal Challengers Bangalore. Mumbai batted first and managed only 139 in 20 overs. Bangalore started strongly in the run-chase putting 38 for the first wicket before Malinga broke the partnership. Harbhajan then picked up the key wickets of [[Chris Gayle]] and [[Virat Kohli]] triggering a batting collapse and eventually Bangalore were bowled out for 108, giving Mumbai a 31-run victory and their first-ever title. Harbahajan was named player of the match and Malinga won the man of the tournament award. Andrew Symonds retired from all forms of cricket in early 2012.\n\nBefore the start of the [[2012 Indian Premier League|2012 season]], the Mumbai Indians traded [[Dinesh Karthik]] from Kings XI Punjab and [[Pragyan Ojha]] from the [[Deccan Chargers]] for undisclosed sums. At the [[List of 2012 Indian Premier League personnel changes#Auction|auction]], the franchise bought five players including [[R. P. Singh]], [[Thisara Perera]] (both for $600,000) and [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]]. Tendulkar stepped down from captaincy hours before the season's first game following which Harbhajan was appointed as the captain. In the first half of the league stage, Mumbai had four wins and four defeats, including three losses at home. Mumbai did not have a fixed opening combination, with Tendulkar missing out four matches due to an injury and other opening batsmen failing to show consistency. Johnson was ruled out of rest of the season in late-April with an injury and [[Dwayne Smith]] was named his replacement in the squad. Mumbai fared better in the second half of the league stage, winning six of their eight matches. They finished third on the points table with 20 points from 16 matches and qualified for the Eliminator against the fourth-placed Chennai Super Kings at Bangalore. Mumbai won the toss and put Chennai in to bat first. After losing two wickets inside the first two overs, Chennai managed to put up 187/5 in 20 overs mainly because of their captain [[MS Dhoni]]'s unbeaten 20-ball 51. Mumbai's chase had started solidly with the score reading 47/0 in the fifth over, before they started losing wickets at regular intervals to end at 149/9 and lose the match by 38 runs. They gained direct qualification to the [[2012 Champions League Twenty20]] in South Africa, along with the three IPL teams that finished at the top that season. Mumbai, placed in Group B, were winless in the tournament with three defeats and one no result.\n\n===2013\u2013 The IPL and CLT20 Double===\n[[File:Rohit Sharma fielding.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rohit Sharma]] became the captain of Mumbai Indians in 2013 and has since led them to four IPL titles.]]\nThe [[2013 IPL]] saw [[Anil Kumble]] being appointed as the chief mentor, after he quit a similar position from [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]]. With a slump in batting form of [[Ricky Ponting]], he was eventually dropped from the playing eleven and Rohit Sharma took lead of the team. Having the experienced advice of the likes of Anil Kumble, Jonty Rhodes and Sachin Tendulkar, the team emerged victorious in IPL 2013.\n\nIn the year 2013 Mumbai Indians started off by losing against the Royal Challengers Bangalore because of the efforts of Chris Gayle and pace bowler [[Vinay Kumar]] but they were able to make a comeback in that match because of Dinesh Karthik due to which Mumbai lost by just one run. In the second match against the [[Chennai Super Kings]] the openers went off cheaply but because of the efforts of Dinesh Karthik and Kieron Pollard Mumbai had put a defendable score on the board. The Mumbai Indians bowlers started off well by dismissing [[Murali Vijay]] cheaply and the match went off till the last over with the Super Kings needing 16 off the last over with MS Dhoni on strike and [[Munaf Patel]] to bowl; Patel dismissed Dhoni on the first ball and Mumbai won the match comfortably by 9 runs. In their third match against the [[Delhi Daredevils]] Mumbai once again lost their openers Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar cheaply and this time it was again Dinesh Karthik who brought the match in Mumbai's grasp, but this time it was not Kieron Pollard, but it was Rohit Sharma with him which helped the Mumbai Indians reach the formidable score of 209/5. At one stage it looked that [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] would snatch the game away from Mumbai but the Mumbai Indians bowlers got rid of David Warner by dismissing him and then the [[Delhi Daredevils]] collapsed due to which Mumbai Indians won comfortably by 44 runs. In the next match against the [[Pune Warriors India]] Mumbai got off to a flying start with a 54-run opening stand between the so-called Pon-dulkar (Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar) and then it was followed by Rohit Sharma due to which Mumbai scored 183/3 and won the match comfortably by 41 runs. In the next match against the [[Rajasthan Royals]] Mumbai were bundled out for just 92 giving the Rajasthan Royals an 83-run victory due to which [[Ricky Ponting]] stepped down as a captain and retired from all forms of cricket. With Rohit Sharma in good batting form, he was made the captain. Under his captaincy the Mumbai Indians improved a lot and won their first IPL title.\n\nThey continued their winning streak in the Champions League. But in the Champions League, too, they had quite slow start which saw them having to win their final match of the league stage against the [[Perth Scorchers]] by a margin; they did it by the combined efforts of [[Nathan Coulter-Nile]], Dwayne Smith and skipper Rohit Sharma. In the final [[Glenn Maxwell]] scored a quick fire 14-ball 37. Mumbai posted 202/6 and won the match comfortably by 33 runs.\n\n<big>'''2014 \u2013 2018'''</big>\n\n[[2014 Indian Premier League|In 2014]] Mumbai didn't start off well losing 5 of their matches in the UAE leg against [[Kolkata Knight Riders]], [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]], [[Chennai Super Kings]] and [[Delhi Daredevils]] by big margins but did well in their 5th match against [[Sunrisers Hyderabad]] but consequently lost the matches against respective opponents.\n\nIn the Indian leg they made a comeback by beating [[Kings XI Punjab]] who were at the top of the table at that time. After that they were inconsistent with their performance. They won against [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] but lost against [[Chennai Super Kings]]. They won against the [[Sunrisers Hyderabad]] and again lost against [[Kolkata Knight Riders]]. But after losing against the [[Kolkata Knight Riders]] they won against [[Kings XI Punjab]] and the [[Delhi Daredevils]] respectively.\n\nIn the match against [[Kings XI Punjab]], [[Lendl Simmons]] scored a hundred due to which they won comfortably by seven wickets.\n\nWith one game left to play they were fifth in the table with 12 points. In the last league-stage match of the season against [[Rajasthan Royals]] who were fourth in the league table with 14 points they needed to win by a big margin so as to leapfrog the opponent into the fourth spot and claim the play-offs spot too. Rajasthan Royals set the target of 190 runs but Mumbai Indians had to reach the target in 14.3 overs in order to improve the net run rate and claim the fourth position in the table but they just managed a tie with the [[Rajasthan Royals]] in 14.3 overs. So the Mumbai Indians needed a boundary off the next ball to push Rajasthan Royals below and claim that fourth spot and [[Aditya Tare]] hit a six to a full toss bowled by [[James Faulkner (cricketer)|James Faulkner]]. Due to that six they reached the play-offs of IPL but lost against the [[Chennai Super Kings]] in the eliminator which ended their IPL 2014 campaign.\n\nThe Mumbai Indians qualified in the qualifier round of the CLT20 2014. Due to injury to their skipper Rohit Sharma, Kieron Pollard was named as their captain.\n\nIn the first match they faced the FBT20 2014 champions [[Lahore Lions]] but they lost against them with Lahore Lions winning by 6 wickets in 18.4 overs. In the second match, they faced the [[Southern Express]], who had a slow start and lost wickets regularly but managed to score 161/6 in 20 overs. The Mumbai Indians started off with an excellent opening partnership of 139 runs in just 14 overs but lost their first wicket on the 4th ball of the 15th over but skipper Kieron Pollard ended things off in blistering way, scoring 20 runs from just 7 balls. But in the last match against the [[Northern Knights]] they just managed 132 runs which the Northern Knights won comfortably 6 wickets with 16 balls to spare. In this way Mumbai's CLT20 2014 campaign ended.\n\nMumbai Indians won their second IPL title [[2015 Indian Premier League|in 2015]] after they defeated Chennai Super Kings by 41 runs. They started the season with 4 IPL defeats mainly due to their bowling. They lost [[Aaron Finch]] and [[Corey Anderson]] due to injury for the rest of the season, which meant [[Lendl Simmons]] got a chance back into the team and with the help of 6 half-centuries, gave the team solid starts throughout the season. He was the top scorer for Mumbai with 540 runs and joint second (with [[Ajinkya Rahane]]) in total for the season behind David Warner. The introduction of another strike bowler [[Mitchell McClenaghan]] in the team provided good support to Lasith Malinga upfront. Mumbai went on to win 9 out of their last 10 Matches to win the title, thanks to solid batting performances from Simmons, Rohit Sharma, [[Ambati Rayudu]] and Kieron Pollard and good bowling from Malinga, McClenaghan and Harbhajan Singh.\n\nIn the [[Vivo IPL 2016]] Auction they bought [[Tim Southee]], [[Nathu Singh (cricketer)|Nathu Singh]], [[Jos Buttler]], [[Jitesh Sharma]], KP Kamath, [[Krunal Pandya]] and [[Deepak Punia]]. They finished the season in the fifth spot in the points table.\n\nIn [[IPL 2017]], the Mumbai Indians finished at the top of the points table, winning 10 out of 14 matches. They went on to win the trophy after beating [[Rising Pune Supergiant]] in a nail-biting finish which is often hailed as the best IPL match and IPL final till date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/indian-premier-league-2017/news/story/ipl-2017-final-rps-vs-mi-mumbai-indians-rohit-sharma-suresh-raina-978450-2017-05-22|title=RPS vs MI: Best Indian Premier League final ever, says Suresh Raina|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref> This was their 3rd IPL title and with it they became the most successful team in the history of IPL.\n\nIn [[IPL 2018]], the Mumbai Indians finished at fifth spot after winning 6 and losing 8 matches.<ref>[[2018 Indian Premier League]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}}\n\n\n<big>'''2019 - Current'''</big>\n\nIn the year 2019, Mumbai Indians and [[Chennai Super Kings]] played in the final of Vivo IPL 2019 where Mumbai defeated Chennai by 1 run to become champions for the record 4th time.

Since its establishment, the team has played its home matches in the 33,108-capacity [[Wankhede Stadium]] in Mumbai. \n\nIn 2017, the Mumbai Indians became the first franchise to cross the $100 million mark in brand value among the IPL franchises.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/brand-ipl-gets-stronger-valuation-soars-to-5-3-billion/articleshow/60199993.cms?from=mdr%7Ctitle=Brand%20IPL%20gets%20stronger&from=mdr|title=Brand IPL gets stronger, valuation soars to $5.3 billion|last=Laghate|first=Gaurav|date=24 August 2017|work=The Economic Times|access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref> The brand value of Mumbai Indians, in 2019, is estimated to be around \u20b9809 crore (roughly $115 million), the highest among all the IPL franchises for the fourth consecutive year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/ipl-brand-valuation-soars-13-5-to-rs-47500-crore-duff-phelps/articleshow/71197984.cms?from=mdr|title=IPL brand valuation soars 13.5% to Rs 47,500 crore: Duff & Phelps|last=Laghate|first=Gaurav|date=20 September 2019|work=The Economic Times|access-date=22 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nMumbai Indians is the most successful team in the IPL. They won the [[2011 Champions League Twenty20]] after beating [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] by 31 runs in the final. The team won the double by winning its first IPL title, in [[2013 Indian Premier League|2013]], by defeating [[Chennai Super Kings]] by 23 runs in the final, and then defeated the [[Rajasthan Royals]] by 33 runs to win its [[2013 Champions League Twenty20|second Champions League Twenty20 title]] later that year.<ref name=\"toi-clt2013win\">{{cite web|title=Mumbai Indians beat Rajasthan Royals to win second CLT20 title|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/series-tournament/clt20/top-stories/Mumbai-Indians-beat-Rajasthan-Royals-to-win-second-CLT20-title/articleshow/23608350.cms|work=Times of India|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/match-report/rampant-mumbai-seal-title-style/63885|title=Rampant Mumbai seal title in style|publisher=Wisden India|date=26 May 2013|access-date=26 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619180856/http://www.wisdenindia.com/match-report/rampant-mumbai-seal-title-style/63885|archive-date=19 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> They won their second IPL title on 24 May 2015 by defeating the Chennai Super Kings by 41 runs in [[2015 Indian Premier League Final|the final]] and became the third team to win more than one IPL title.

In 2019, they repeated the same feat as they won a record breaking fourth IPL title, by beating CSK by just 1 run on 12th May, 2019 in IPL Final.\n\nMumbai Indians are currently captained by [[Rohit Sharma]]. [[Mahela Jayawardene]] was appointed as head coach of Mumbai Indians before the 2017 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/1067010.html|title=Jayawardene appointed Mumbai Indians coach|publisher=Cricinfo|date= 18 November 2016}}</ref> Sharma is the leading run scorer of the team while [[Lasith Malinga]] is the leading [[wicket]] taker of the team and the IPL as well.\n\n==Franchise history==\nThe [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI) announced in September 2007 the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a [[Twenty20]] competition to be started in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Franchises for board's new Twenty20 league|date=13 September 2007|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl/content/story/310819.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. The Mumbai franchise was sold to the [[Reliance Industries Ltd]] (RIL) for $111.9 million, making it the most expensive team to be sold in the league.<ref>{{cite web|title=Big business and Bollywood grab stakes in IPL|date=24 January 2008|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl/content/story/333193.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> RIL, owned by [[Mukesh Ambani]] acquired the rights to the franchise for a period of 10 years. The franchise was eventually named \"Mumbai Indians\".\n\n==Team history==\n\n===2008\u20132009: Struggle in the initial seasons===\n\nThe Indian Premier League named four players as [[icon player]]s for their respective city franchises which made the players unavailable to play for any team other than their city team. [[Sachin Tendulkar]] was named Mumbai's icon player. The icon player was also entitled to earn 15% more than the next-best paid player in their team. At first [[2008 Indian Premier League#Player auctions|player auctions]] for the [[2008 Indian Premier League|inaugural IPL season]] conducted in February 2008, the Mumbai franchise bought several star international cricketers such as [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], [[Harbhajan Singh]], [[Shaun Pollock]], [[Lasith Malinga]] and [[Robin Uthappa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=IPL Auction: Players' worth|url=http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2008/feb/20table.htm|publisher=rediff.com|accessdate=4 June 2013}}</ref> The franchise named Sachin Tendulkar as the captain of the team and appointed former India cricketer [[Lalchand Rajput]] as the head coach. However, Tendulkar was injured before the start of the 2008 season due to which Harbhajan Singh took over as the captain in the initial stage of the season. The team got off to a bad start in the season losing their first four games by some comprehensive margins. Their first match was a five-wicket defeat to the [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] on 20 April 2008 at the [[Wankhede Stadium|Wankhede]]. Their stand-in captain, Harbhajan, was suspended from the tournament for reportedly [[Harbhajan Singh#Altercations with Andrew Symonds and Sreesanth|slapping Sreesanth]] during Mumbai's league match against [[Kings XI Punjab]]. After Harbhajan's suspension, Shaun Pollock assumed the leadership duties until Tendulkar's return on 24 May. Under Pollock's captaincy, Mumbai won six out of their next six games which left them needing to win two more out of the remaining four matches to qualify for the semifinals. Mumbai suffered three last-over defeats in the next three games, including two off the last ball, before winning their last league match. They finished fifth in the points table with 7 wins and 7 losses, missing out on a semifinal spot by just one point.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indian Premier League, 2007/08 / Points table|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl/engine/series/313494.html?view=pointstable|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2009 Indian Premier League|2009 season]] was played in South Africa as it coincided with multi-phase [[2009 Indian general election]]s due to which the [[Government of India]] refused to commit the [[Paramilitary forces of India|Indian paramilitary forces]] to provide security for the IPL. Before the start of the season, Mumbai Indians traded [[Robin Uthappa]] for [[Zaheer Khan]] with Royal Challengers Bangalore, and [[Ashish Nehra]] for [[Shikhar Dhawan]] with the [[Delhi Daredevils]]. Shaun Pollock retired after the first season and became the head coach of the team. Lasith Malinga, who missed the previous season due to an injury, returned to the team. At the [[List of 2009 Indian Premier League personnel changes#Auction|player auction]], Mumbai bought South African batsman [[JP Duminy]] to strengthen their batting department. After winning their opening match against the [[Chennai Super Kings]], Mumbai struggled to put up consistent performances during the season. They relied heavily on Duminy and Tendulkar's batting, and Malinga's bowling along with minimal contributions from other players. With only five wins from 14 matches, Mumbai finished on seventh place in the league table.\n\n===2010\u20132012: Rise as a strong team===\n[[File:Lasith Malinga signing.jpg|thumb|[[Lasith Malinga]] is the leading wicket-taker in IPL with 150 wickets since its inception.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lasith Malinga becomes first to reach 150 IPL wickets|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2017-10/lasith-malinga-becomes-first-to-reach-150-ipl-wickets-4644137/|website=The Indian Express|date=7 May 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nAt the [[List of 2010 Indian Premier League personnel changes#auction|2010 players auction]], Mumbai Indians bought Trinidadian all-rounder [[Kieron Pollard]] for $750,000 following a secret tiebreaker. After the auction, they signed up ten uncapped Indian players out whom seven were former [[Indian Cricket League|ICL]] players. Former India cricketer [[Robin Singh (cricketer, born 1963)|Robin Singh]] was named as the head coach of the team as Pollock took up the role of bowling coach. Mumbai had to shift their home venue to [[Brabourne Stadium]] for the season since the Wankhede was undergoing renovation to host some matches of the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]]. Mumbai won seven of their first eight games to take the top spot in the points table. Their success was mainly due to the efforts of Tendulkar, Malinga, Harbhajan, [[Ambati Rayudu]] and [[Saurabh Tiwary]]. They won three of the remaining six league games and finished with 20 points from 14 games at the top of the points table. They beat the Royal Challengers Bangalore by 35 runs in the semifinal, thanks to Pollard's all-round efforts (33* from 13 balls, and 3/17). At the final, they were defeated by the Chennai Super Kings by 22 runs. The Mumbai team management was criticised for the \"strategic errors\" during the final such as sending [[Abhishek Nayar]] and Harbhajan at batting positions 3 and 4 respectively while Duminy and Pollard were sent at 7 and 8. Mumbai skipper Sachin Tendulkar, who scored 618 runs at an average of 47.53 and strike rate of 132.6, won the Orange Cap for scoring most runs in the season. Mumbai qualified for the [[2010 Champions League Twenty20]] where they were eliminated in the group stage with two wins and two defeats in four matches.\n\nIn [[2011 Indian Premier League|2011]], with the addition of two new teams to the IPL, the IPL Governing Council declared that each franchise could retain a maximum of four players of their 2010 squad, and the rest of the international players would be auctioned. Mumbai Indians retained Tendulkar, Harbhajan, Pollard and Malinga for a sum of $4.5 million. This retention left the franchise with the power of spending $4.5 million at the [[List of 2011 Indian Premier League personnel changes#auction|auction]] where they purchased Indian batsman [[Rohit Sharma]] for $2 million, former Australian all-rounder [[Andrew Symonds]] for $850,000, and pacer [[Munaf Patel]] for $700,000. Mumbai won eight of their first ten league games following which they suffered a loss of form that led to three consecutive defeats and a last-ball win in their last league match. They finished third on the points table with 18 points from 14 games and qualified for the Eliminator. The Eliminator was played at the Wankhede where Mumbai faced the [[Kolkata Knight Riders]]. After winning the toss and electing to bowl first, Mumbai restricted Kolkata to 147 in 20 overs and chased down the target for the loss of six wickets with four balls to spare. Munaf Patel won the Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 3/27. With this win, Mumbai qualified for the Qualifying final against Royal Challengers Bangalore, the winner of which would play the Super Kings in the final. Mumbai skipper Tendulkar won the toss once again and put their opposition into bat who set Mumbai a target of 186. Mumbai kept losing wickets at regular intervals from the start of their innings and could score only 142/8, falling short by 43 runs. The top two leading wicket-takers of the season were Mumbai Indians pacers Lasith Malinga and Munaf Patel with 28 and 22 wickets respectively.\n\nMumbai qualified for the [[2011 Champions League Twenty20]] held in India. Before the start of the tournament, six first-choice Indian players in the Mumbai squad including Tendulkar, Sharma and Patel were ruled out of the tournament due to injuries and two more Indian players were ruled out based on medical reports. This left their 14-member squad with only six Indian players, while the tournament allowed a maximum of four overseas players and minimum of seven local players in the playing eleven. An exception was made for the Mumbai Indians which permitted them to field five overseas players during the tournament. Harbhajan was named the stand-in captain in the absence of Tendulkar. Mumbai were placed in Group A alongside Chennai Super Kings, [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales Blues]], [[Cape Cobras]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago national cricket team|Trinidad & Tobago]]. Mumbai had two wins, one defeat and one no result in the group stage which gave them the second place on the group points table with five points. They qualified for the semifinal and Mumbai batsman [[Suryakumar Yadav]] returned to the squad after recovering from his injury. This led to the withdrawal of the concession given by the Champions League for the Mumbai Indians to field five overseas players. Mumbai faced [[Somerset County Cricket Club]] in the semifinal at Chennai. Batting first, Mumbai made 160/5 in 20 overs. Somerset's chase was dented by Malinga who picked four wickets for 20 (all [[bowled]]) to help Mumbai restrict Somerset to 150 and win the match by 10 runs. The final was also played in Chennai where Mumbai met Royal Challengers Bangalore. Mumbai batted first and managed only 139 in 20 overs. Bangalore started strongly in the run-chase putting 38 for the first wicket before Malinga broke the partnership. Harbhajan then picked up the key wickets of [[Chris Gayle]] and [[Virat Kohli]] triggering a batting collapse and eventually Bangalore were bowled out for 108, giving Mumbai a 31-run victory and their first-ever title. Harbahajan was named player of the match and Malinga won the man of the tournament award. Andrew Symonds retired from all forms of cricket in early 2012.\n\nBefore the start of the [[2012 Indian Premier League|2012 season]], the Mumbai Indians traded [[Dinesh Karthik]] from Kings XI Punjab and [[Pragyan Ojha]] from the [[Deccan Chargers]] for undisclosed sums. At the [[List of 2012 Indian Premier League personnel changes#Auction|auction]], the franchise bought five players including [[R. P. Singh]], [[Thisara Perera]] (both for $600,000) and [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]]. Tendulkar stepped down from captaincy hours before the season's first game following which Harbhajan was appointed as the captain. In the first half of the league stage, Mumbai had four wins and four defeats, including three losses at home. Mumbai did not have a fixed opening combination, with Tendulkar missing out four matches due to an injury and other opening batsmen failing to show consistency. Johnson was ruled out of rest of the season in late-April with an injury and [[Dwayne Smith]] was named his replacement in the squad. Mumbai fared better in the second half of the league stage, winning six of their eight matches. They finished third on the points table with 20 points from 16 matches and qualified for the Eliminator against the fourth-placed Chennai Super Kings at Bangalore. Mumbai won the toss and put Chennai in to bat first. After losing two wickets inside the first two overs, Chennai managed to put up 187/5 in 20 overs mainly because of their captain [[MS Dhoni]]'s unbeaten 20-ball 51. Mumbai's chase had started solidly with the score reading 47/0 in the fifth over, before they started losing wickets at regular intervals to end at 149/9 and lose the match by 38 runs. They gained direct qualification to the [[2012 Champions League Twenty20]] in South Africa, along with the three IPL teams that finished at the top that season. Mumbai, placed in Group B, were winless in the tournament with three defeats and one no result.\n\n===2013\u2013 The IPL and CLT20 Double===\n[[File:Rohit Sharma fielding.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rohit Sharma]] became the captain of Mumbai Indians in 2013 and has since led them to four IPL titles.]]\nThe [[2013 IPL]] saw [[Anil Kumble]] being appointed as the chief mentor, after he quit a similar position from [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]]. With a slump in batting form of [[Ricky Ponting]], he was eventually dropped from the playing eleven and Rohit Sharma took lead of the team. Having the experienced advice of the likes of Anil Kumble, Jonty Rhodes and Sachin Tendulkar, the team emerged victorious in IPL 2013.\n\nIn the year 2013 Mumbai Indians started off by losing against the Royal Challengers Bangalore because of the efforts of Chris Gayle and pace bowler [[Vinay Kumar]] but they were able to make a comeback in that match because of Dinesh Karthik due to which Mumbai lost by just one run. In the second match against the [[Chennai Super Kings]] the openers went off cheaply but because of the efforts of Dinesh Karthik and Kieron Pollard Mumbai had put a defendable score on the board. The Mumbai Indians bowlers started off well by dismissing [[Murali Vijay]] cheaply and the match went off till the last over with the Super Kings needing 16 off the last over with MS Dhoni on strike and [[Munaf Patel]] to bowl; Patel dismissed Dhoni on the first ball and Mumbai won the match comfortably by 9 runs. In their third match against the [[Delhi Daredevils]] Mumbai once again lost their openers Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar cheaply and this time it was again Dinesh Karthik who brought the match in Mumbai's grasp, but this time it was not Kieron Pollard, but it was Rohit Sharma with him which helped the Mumbai Indians reach the formidable score of 209/5. At one stage it looked that [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] would snatch the game away from Mumbai but the Mumbai Indians bowlers got rid of David Warner by dismissing him and then the [[Delhi Daredevils]] collapsed due to which Mumbai Indians won comfortably by 44 runs. In the next match against the [[Pune Warriors India]] Mumbai got off to a flying start with a 54-run opening stand between the so-called Pon-dulkar (Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar) and then it was followed by Rohit Sharma due to which Mumbai scored 183/3 and won the match comfortably by 41 runs. In the next match against the [[Rajasthan Royals]] Mumbai were bundled out for just 92 giving the Rajasthan Royals an 83-run victory due to which [[Ricky Ponting]] stepped down as a captain and retired from all forms of cricket. With Rohit Sharma in good batting form, he was made the captain. Under his captaincy the Mumbai Indians improved a lot and won their first IPL title.\n\nThey continued their winning streak in the Champions League. But in the Champions League, too, they had quite slow start which saw them having to win their final match of the league stage against the [[Perth Scorchers]] by a margin; they did it by the combined efforts of [[Nathan Coulter-Nile]], Dwayne Smith and skipper Rohit Sharma. In the final [[Glenn Maxwell]] scored a quick fire 14-ball 37. Mumbai posted 202/6 and won the match comfortably by 33 runs.\n\n<big>'''2014 \u2013 2018'''</big>\n\n[[2014 Indian Premier League|In 2014]] Mumbai didn't start off well losing 5 of their matches in the UAE leg against [[Kolkata Knight Riders]], [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]], [[Chennai Super Kings]] and [[Delhi Daredevils]] by big margins but did well in their 5th match against [[Sunrisers Hyderabad]] but consequently lost the matches against respective opponents.\n\nIn the Indian leg they made a comeback by beating [[Kings XI Punjab]] who were at the top of the table at that time. After that they were inconsistent with their performance. They won against [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] but lost against [[Chennai Super Kings]]. They won against the [[Sunrisers Hyderabad]] and again lost against [[Kolkata Knight Riders]]. But after losing against the [[Kolkata Knight Riders]] they won against [[Kings XI Punjab]] and the [[Delhi Daredevils]] respectively.\n\nIn the match against [[Kings XI Punjab]], [[Lendl Simmons]] scored a hundred due to which they won comfortably by seven wickets.\n\nWith one game left to play they were fifth in the table with 12 points. In the last league-stage match of the season against [[Rajasthan Royals]] who were fourth in the league table with 14 points they needed to win by a big margin so as to leapfrog the opponent into the fourth spot and claim the play-offs spot too. Rajasthan Royals set the target of 190 runs but Mumbai Indians had to reach the target in 14.3 overs in order to improve the net run rate and claim the fourth position in the table but they just managed a tie with the [[Rajasthan Royals]] in 14.3 overs. So the Mumbai Indians needed a boundary off the next ball to push Rajasthan Royals below and claim that fourth spot and [[Aditya Tare]] hit a six to a full toss bowled by [[James Faulkner (cricketer)|James Faulkner]]. Due to that six they reached the play-offs of IPL but lost against the [[Chennai Super Kings]] in the eliminator which ended their IPL 2014 campaign.\n\nThe Mumbai Indians qualified in the qualifier round of the CLT20 2014. Due to injury to their skipper Rohit Sharma, Kieron Pollard was named as their captain.\n\nIn the first match they faced the FBT20 2014 champions [[Lahore Lions]] but they lost against them with Lahore Lions winning by 6 wickets in 18.4 overs. In the second match, they faced the [[Southern Express]], who had a slow start and lost wickets regularly but managed to score 161/6 in 20 overs. The Mumbai Indians started off with an excellent opening partnership of 139 runs in just 14 overs but lost their first wicket on the 4th ball of the 15th over but skipper Kieron Pollard ended things off in blistering way, scoring 20 runs from just 7 balls. But in the last match against the [[Northern Knights]] they just managed 132 runs which the Northern Knights won comfortably 6 wickets with 16 balls to spare. In this way Mumbai's CLT20 2014 campaign ended.\n\nMumbai Indians won their second IPL title [[2015 Indian Premier League|in 2015]] after they defeated Chennai Super Kings by 41 runs. They started the season with 4 IPL defeats mainly due to their bowling. They lost [[Aaron Finch]] and [[Corey Anderson]] due to injury for the rest of the season, which meant [[Lendl Simmons]] got a chance back into the team and with the help of 6 half-centuries, gave the team solid starts throughout the season. He was the top scorer for Mumbai with 540 runs and joint second (with [[Ajinkya Rahane]]) in total for the season behind David Warner. The introduction of another strike bowler [[Mitchell McClenaghan]] in the team provided good support to Lasith Malinga upfront. Mumbai went on to win 9 out of their last 10 Matches to win the title, thanks to solid batting performances from Simmons, Rohit Sharma, [[Ambati Rayudu]] and Kieron Pollard and good bowling from Malinga, McClenaghan and Harbhajan Singh.\n\nIn the [[Vivo IPL 2016]] Auction they bought [[Tim Southee]], [[Nathu Singh (cricketer)|Nathu Singh]], [[Jos Buttler]], [[Jitesh Sharma]], KP Kamath, [[Krunal Pandya]] and [[Deepak Punia]]. They finished the season in the fifth spot in the points table.\n\nIn [[IPL 2017]], the Mumbai Indians finished at the top of the points table, winning 10 out of 14 matches. They went on to win the trophy after beating [[Rising Pune Supergiant]] in a nail-biting finish which is often hailed as the best IPL match and IPL final till date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/indian-premier-league-2017/news/story/ipl-2017-final-rps-vs-mi-mumbai-indians-rohit-sharma-suresh-raina-978450-2017-05-22|title=RPS vs MI: Best Indian Premier League final ever, says Suresh Raina|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref> This was their 3rd IPL title and with it they became the most successful team in the history of IPL.\n\nIn [[IPL 2018]], the Mumbai Indians finished at fifth spot after winning 6 and losing 8 matches.<ref>[[2018 Indian Premier League]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}}\n\n\n<big>'''2019 - Current'''</big>\n\nIn the year 2019, Mumbai Indians and [[Chennai Super Kings]] played in the final of Vivo IPL 2019 where Mumbai defeated Chennai by 1 run to become champions for the record 4th time.

Reporting to the army training camp, he quickly makes friends with fellow-conscript Percy ([[Caleb Landry Jones]]). Though most of their intake are sent off to fight in the [[Korean War]], he and Percy are made sergeants and spend their days teaching typing. The bane of their life is Sergeant-Major Bradley ([[David Thewlis]]), a decorated veteran of [[World War II]] who is obsessive about doing things by the book. An ally against Bradley is the orderly Redmond ([[Pat Shortt]]), who teaches them the military arts of \"skiving\" (evading work). However, Bradley succeeds in getting Bill charged with subverting a private's will to fight by telling him some truths about Korea. The case is thrown out when Bill shows that all he said had been printed in ''[[The Times]]''. \n\nOutside the camp, both friends explore what the town offers by way of women. Bill falls for a beautiful but depressive upper-class girl he calls Ophelia ([[Tamsin Egerton]]), while Percy is smitten by a bubbly student nurse called Sophie ([[Aimee-Ffion Edwards]]) (who throws out some lures to Bill as well). On leave for the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]], Percy steals a car to join Bill, who is with his family on the Island. Both are delighted to find Bill's renegade sister Dawn ([[Vanessa Kirby]]), who has returned from Canada, and Dawn is soon charming Percy. Ophelia makes a brief visit but has to dash back into London. On the television, the family spot her in [[Westminster Abbey]] as one of the nobility, something which Bill did not know. Back in camp, Bill gets word that Ophelia is again in hospital with mental problems and, when he visits her, she rejects him brutally. Shocked and in tears, he is found by Sophie, who leads him to an empty room and takes his virginity. Percy then confides that he lost his to Dawn.\n\nPercy however is finding military life a strain and with Redmond concocts an absurd scheme to steal the mess clock, a gift from [[Queen Victoria]]. An investigation pinpoints his guilt, upon which Redmond betrays him. A [[court martial]] sentences him to military prison and Bill is allowed to escort him there in handcuffs. Dawn jumps on the train and says she will wait for him. Bill then goes to visit Bradley, who has cracked under the strain of Percy's persecution and is in a military hospital on mental grounds, but Bradley rejects him brutally. In a ward he sees the private he allegedly dissuaded from fighting in Korea, who has lost a foot there.\n\nThe film ends back on the Island, where Sophie is in the river acting while Bill with a new film camera is filming her. Leaving the camera running, he jumps in to embrace her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Callum Turner]] as Bill Rohan\n* [[Vanessa Kirby]] as Dawn Rohan\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Bradley\n* [[Richard E.

The [[British Empire]] was disappearing and, like the [[British Army]] which had sustained it, the nation had to find a new place in the world. The Army was radically different in having to cope with peacetime mass conscription of mostly unwilling and rebellious 18 year olds. An era passed with the death of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], who had been the focus of loyalty during [[World War II]], and the coronation of his daughter. Some saw a new age of greatness for Britain, while others were pessimistic, and television was beginning its process of turning the nation into passive spectators.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has received positive reviews from critics and currently holds a 78% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 86 reviews, with an average of 6.8/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/queen_and_country|title=Queen and Country (2015)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated in its review that \"it remains a pleasure to spend time in the presence of these characters, and a third volume \u2014 perhaps focused on Bill\u2019s entrance into the British film industry \u2014 would hardly be unwelcome.\"<ref>[https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-queen-and-country-1201186532/ Variety review of ''Queen and Country'']</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film made its debut as part of the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section of the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].

On leave for the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]], Percy steals a car to join Bill, who is with his family on the Island. Both are delighted to find Bill's renegade sister Dawn ([[Vanessa Kirby]]), who has returned from Canada, and Dawn is soon charming Percy. Ophelia makes a brief visit but has to dash back into London. On the television, the family spot her in [[Westminster Abbey]] as one of the nobility, something which Bill did not know. Back in camp, Bill gets word that Ophelia is again in hospital with mental problems and, when he visits her, she rejects him brutally. Shocked and in tears, he is found by Sophie, who leads him to an empty room and takes his virginity. Percy then confides that he lost his to Dawn.\n\nPercy however is finding military life a strain and with Redmond concocts an absurd scheme to steal the mess clock, a gift from [[Queen Victoria]]. An investigation pinpoints his guilt, upon which Redmond betrays him. A [[court martial]] sentences him to military prison and Bill is allowed to escort him there in handcuffs. Dawn jumps on the train and says she will wait for him. Bill then goes to visit Bradley, who has cracked under the strain of Percy's persecution and is in a military hospital on mental grounds, but Bradley rejects him brutally. In a ward he sees the private he allegedly dissuaded from fighting in Korea, who has lost a foot there.\n\nThe film ends back on the Island, where Sophie is in the river acting while Bill with a new film camera is filming her. Leaving the camera running, he jumps in to embrace her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Callum Turner]] as Bill Rohan\n* [[Vanessa Kirby]] as Dawn Rohan\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Bradley\n* [[Richard E.

The [[British Empire]] was disappearing and, like the [[British Army]] which had sustained it, the nation had to find a new place in the world. The Army was radically different in having to cope with peacetime mass conscription of mostly unwilling and rebellious 18 year olds. An era passed with the death of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], who had been the focus of loyalty during [[World War II]], and the coronation of his daughter. Some saw a new age of greatness for Britain, while others were pessimistic, and television was beginning its process of turning the nation into passive spectators.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has received positive reviews from critics and currently holds a 78% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 86 reviews, with an average of 6.8/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/queen_and_country|title=Queen and Country (2015)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated in its review that \"it remains a pleasure to spend time in the presence of these characters, and a third volume \u2014 perhaps focused on Bill\u2019s entrance into the British film industry \u2014 would hardly be unwelcome.\"<ref>[https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-queen-and-country-1201186532/ Variety review of ''Queen and Country'']</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film made its debut as part of the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section of the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].
