The group's name refers to New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], at the time known for its large gay population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Review: Gay Sex in the 70s |url=http://kdhx.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=378&Itemid=142 |publisher=[[KDHX]] |year=2000}}</ref> The characters were a symbolic group of American [[masculinity]]<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Rabb |title=Macho Comes to Music |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1979/06/24/macho-comes-to-music/7ceda9c6-146f-4a97-a98c-b38579438732/?noredirect=on |website=Washington Post |date=24 June 1979}}</ref> and [[machismo|macho]] gay-fantasy personas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2008/05/ymca-oral-history/ |title=Spin Magazine Online: Y.M.C.A.

In 1977, they moved to New York City to get into the American market.  Morali had written a few dance tunes when he was given a demo tape recorded by singer/actor Victor Willis. After hiring Willis to sing background vocals on the four tracks, Morali approached him and said, \"I had a dream that you sang lead on my album and it went very, very big\". Willis agreed to sing on the eponymous debut album ''Village People''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Village People, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Vol. 289, April 19, 1979</ref>\n\nSongwriters Phil Hurtt and Peter Whitehead wrote the lyrics for the first album (Willis would subsequently take over writing duties in 1978 for the group's biggest hits). The Village People studio band was called ''Gypsy Lane'', conducted by [[Horace Ott]], who also provided much of the musical arrangements for Morali, who did not play any instruments.<ref>Straight, No Chaser by Victor Willis, 1990</ref>\n\nThe album became an international hit, and demand for live appearances soon followed. Morali hastily built a group of dancers around Willis to perform in clubs and videos. Morali met the first recruit, [[Felipe Rose]] (who claims indigenous American descent and dressed as a Native American), in a  New York gay bar called the Anvil.  Willis hand-picked [[Alex Briley]] (who initially portrayed an athlete but eventually became the group's soldier/sailor). The others were Mark Mussler (construction worker), Dave Forrest (cowboy), Lee Mouton (leatherman/biker), and Peter Whitehead (one of the group's early songwriters), who appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and in the video for the group's first hit, \"San Francisco (You Got Me)\".\n\nWith record sales soaring, Morali and Willis saw the need to create a permanent group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=WIKANE |first1=CHRISTIAN JOHN |title=Under the Hard Hat: An Interview with Village People's David Hodo |url=https://www.popmatters.com/182364-under-the-hard-hat-an-interview-with-village-peoples-david-hodo-2495654587.html |website=popmatters.com}}</ref> They took out an ad in a theatre trade paper which read: ''\"''Macho Types Wanted: Must Dance And Have A Moustache.''\"''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />  [[Glenn Hughes (Village People)|Glenn Hughes]] (leatherman), [[David Hodo]] (construction worker) and [[Randy Jones (singer)|Randy Jones]] (cowboy) were among the hundreds who answered the ad.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nWith the \"official\" lineup in place, the group did a hasty photo-shoot for the cover of the already-recorded ''[[Macho Man (album)|Macho Man]]'' album.  The 1978 hit single \"[[Macho Man (song)|Macho Man]]\" catapulted the group into the mainstream, and their follow-up single \"[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]\" became one of the most popular hits of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1979, the [[United States Navy]] considered using their single \"In the Navy\" in a television and radio recruiting campaign. Belolo offered them permission if the Navy would help film a music video for it. The Navy provided them access to the San Diego Navy base, where the {{USS|Reasoner|FF-1063}}, several aircraft, and the crew of the ship would be used.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/12/popandrock8 |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Everyday people |first=Ed |last=Vulliamy |date=November 12, 2006 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> This song was also performed on the TV series ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and in the 1995 Navy comedy movie ''[[Down Periscope]]''.\n\nThe group's fame peaked in 1979 with a three-month North American tour, several appearances on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]],'' and performing with [[Bob Hope]] to entertain U.S. troops. They were also featured on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Vol. 289, April 19, 1979. Willis left the group in August 1979, during production of the upcoming musical movie tentatively titled ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Discoland: Where the Music Never Ends]]''. He was replaced by [[Ray Simpson]], the brother of [[Valerie Simpson]] (of [[Ashford & Simpson]]) who had previously sung background vocals with the group on their 1979 tour.  The end of 1979 saw the release of ''[[Live and Sleazy]]'', a double album featuring Victor Willis on lead vocals on the \u201cLive\u201d disc and Simpson's debut with the group on the \"Sleazy\" disc.\n\n=== 1980\u20131985 ===\nIn June 1980 the feature film now retitled ''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' was released. The film was directed by [[Nancy Walker]], written by [[Allan Carr]] and [[Bronte Woodard]], music and lyrics by Jacques Morali (except Willis who penned the lyrics to \"Milkshake\" and \"Magic Night\") and starring [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Valerie Perrine]], Jean-Claude Billmaer, and [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce (Caitlyn) Jenner]].  By the time it was released disco's popularity had waned.  At the [[1980 Golden Raspberry Awards|March 1981 Golden Raspberry Awards]], the movie was named [[Razzies|Worst Picture]] and [[Razzies|Worst Screenplay]], and was nominated in almost all the other categories. Although the title song became a club play chart success and moderate radio hit, it was nominated for Worst Original Song \"Razzie\" and did not live up to sales expectations, never obtaining gold status as a single or album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Razzie Awards (1981) |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1981/1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> The soundtrack also featured the talents of David London, who under his real name [[Dennis \"Fergie\" Frederiksen]] became the future lead singer of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] and one of the main contributors to Village People's next album. The group embarked on a tour in promotion of the film in Australia and Japan. The Japanese show was filmed at Budokan and released on DVD as Village People Live In Japan.\n\nThe group appeared in the November 22, 1980, episode of ''[[Love Boat]]'' (season four, episode seven). At the end of 1980, Jeff Olson joined the group as the cowboy.\n\nIn 1981, with [[new wave music]] becoming more popular than disco, Morali and Belolo ditched the familiar characters and re-branded Village People with a new look inspired by the [[New Romantic]] movement, and released the album ''[[Renaissance (Village People album)|Renaissance]]''. It only attracted minor \u2013 mostly negative \u2013 attention, but did produce the group's first hit single in Italy with \"5 O'clock in the Morning.\"\n\nWillis rejoined the group briefly in late 1981 for the writing and recording the album ''[[Fox on the Box]]'', which was released in 1982 in Europe and Japan, and in 1983 in the United States under the title ''In the Street''.  David Hodo and Ray Simpson both left the group in 1982 with Mark Lee and [[Miles Jaye]] replacing them respectively. Jaye contributed lead vocals to a single in 1983 called \"America\", which would be added as extra track to the 1999 remaster of ''In the Street''. \n\nTheir next album, the 1985 dance/[[Hi-NRG]] release ''[[Sex Over the Phone]]'', was not a huge commercial success, but it fared better in sales and club play than ''Renaissance''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The title track, when released as a single, was banned by the [[BBC]] because of its subject matter: credit-card [[phone sex]].<ref>[[Juke Magazine]] February 13, 1985.</ref> Though banned, it did peak at 59 on the UK singles chart. The album featured yet another new lead singer, [[Ray Stephens (singer)|Ray Stephens]] (of ''[[The Great Space Coaster]]'' fame). It was the group's last album of new material until ''A Village People Christmas'' in 2018.  Py Douglas came in to sub for Stephens for some of the group's live appearances in 1985 and can be seen in both promotional videos made for the group.\n\nIn 1985 the group took a hiatus, but returned in 1987 with the lineup of Randy Jones, David Hodo, Felipe Rose, Glenn Hughes, Alex Briley, and Ray Simpson and formed ''Sixuvus Ltd'' a group that managed the affairs of the group and had the license to use the name Village People and its characters in use until 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/30/guardianobituaries1|title=Obituary: Glenn Hughes|first=Dave|last=Laing|date=March 30, 2001|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s\u2013present ===\n[[File:VPStarfront.jpg|thumb|Village People receive their star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2008.

On September 22, 1991 they performed in front of 41,815 in [[Sydney]], Australia, as part of the pre-game entertainment for the [[1991 Rugby League Grand Final|New South Wales Rugby League Grand Final]] held at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].   They also performed a medley of self-parody songs at the [[1993 MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Awards]] \u2013 \"In the Movies\" (\"In the Navy\"), \"Psycho Bitch\" (\"Macho Man\"), and \"My MTV\" (\"Y.M.C.A.\"). The group also made a guest appearance on the hit show ''[[Married... with Children]]'' in the episode \"[[Take My Wife, Please (Married... with Children episode)|Take My Wife, Please]]\".\n\nFounder Jacques Morali died of complications related to [[AIDS]] in Paris, France on November 15, 1991.  Three years later, the Village People recorded with the German national football team on its official [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup '94]] song ''Far Away in America''. In 1995, Eric Anzalone replaced Glenn Hughes as the Leatherman/Biker, and made his music video debut with [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Rob Schneider]], and other cast members during the end-credits of the film ''[[Down Periscope]]'', performing \"In The Navy\" with Ray Simpson on lead vocals.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century Village People released two singles, \"Gunbalanya\" (2000) and \"Loveship 2001\" (2001) under the name \"Amazing Veepers\".  It was reported in 2001 that 'Gunbalanya', which was recorded with indigenous Australian people, took its title from a word meaning \"in the tribe\" though it is in fact the name of an Aboriginal settlement. Leatherman/Biker Glenn Hughes died of lung cancer in New York City on March 4, 2001.<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/village-peoples-hughes-dead-20010313 Village People's Hughes Dead], ''[[Rolling Stone]]''; March 13, 2001</ref>  Village People performed as the opening act for [[Cher]] on her [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour|Farewell Tour]] until it ended in April 2005.

In May 2012 Willis won a landmark ruling in the first case heard regarding the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which allows recording artists and writers to reclaim their master recordings and publishing rights initially granted to record companies and publishers after 35 years.

In 1977, they moved to New York City to get into the American market.  Morali had written a few dance tunes when he was given a demo tape recorded by singer/actor Victor Willis. After hiring Willis to sing background vocals on the four tracks, Morali approached him and said, \"I had a dream that you sang lead on my album and it went very, very big\". Willis agreed to sing on the eponymous debut album ''Village People''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Village People, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Vol. 289, April 19, 1979</ref>\n\nSongwriters Phil Hurtt and Peter Whitehead wrote the lyrics for the first album (Willis would subsequently take over writing duties in 1978 for the group's biggest hits). The Village People studio band was called ''Gypsy Lane'', conducted by [[Horace Ott]], who also provided much of the musical arrangements for Morali, who did not play any instruments.<ref>Straight, No Chaser by Victor Willis, 1990</ref>\n\nThe album became an international hit, and demand for live appearances soon followed. Morali hastily built a group of dancers around Willis to perform in clubs and videos. Morali met the first recruit, [[Felipe Rose]] (who claims indigenous American descent and dressed as a Native American), in a  New York gay bar called the Anvil.  Willis hand-picked [[Alex Briley]] (who initially portrayed an athlete but eventually became the group's soldier/sailor). The others were Mark Mussler (construction worker), Dave Forrest (cowboy), Lee Mouton (leatherman/biker), and Peter Whitehead (one of the group's early songwriters), who appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and in the video for the group's first hit, \"San Francisco (You Got Me)\".\n\nWith record sales soaring, Morali and Willis saw the need to create a permanent group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=WIKANE |first1=CHRISTIAN JOHN |title=Under the Hard Hat: An Interview with Village People's David Hodo |url=https://www.popmatters.com/182364-under-the-hard-hat-an-interview-with-village-peoples-david-hodo-2495654587.html |website=popmatters.com}}</ref> They took out an ad in a theatre trade paper which read: ''\"''Macho Types Wanted: Must Dance And Have A Moustache.''\"''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />  [[Glenn Hughes (Village People)|Glenn Hughes]] (leatherman), [[David Hodo]] (construction worker) and [[Randy Jones (singer)|Randy Jones]] (cowboy) were among the hundreds who answered the ad.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nWith the \"official\" lineup in place, the group did a hasty photo-shoot for the cover of the already-recorded ''[[Macho Man (album)|Macho Man]]'' album.  The 1978 hit single \"[[Macho Man (song)|Macho Man]]\" catapulted the group into the mainstream, and their follow-up single \"[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]\" became one of the most popular hits of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1979, the [[United States Navy]] considered using their single \"In the Navy\" in a television and radio recruiting campaign. Belolo offered them permission if the Navy would help film a music video for it. The Navy provided them access to the San Diego Navy base, where the {{USS|Reasoner|FF-1063}}, several aircraft, and the crew of the ship would be used.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/12/popandrock8 |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Everyday people |first=Ed |last=Vulliamy |date=November 12, 2006 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> This song was also performed on the TV series ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and in the 1995 Navy comedy movie ''[[Down Periscope]]''.\n\nThe group's fame peaked in 1979 with a three-month North American tour, several appearances on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]],'' and performing with [[Bob Hope]] to entertain U.S. troops. They were also featured on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Vol. 289, April 19, 1979. Willis left the group in August 1979, during production of the upcoming musical movie tentatively titled ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Discoland: Where the Music Never Ends]]''. He was replaced by [[Ray Simpson]], the brother of [[Valerie Simpson]] (of [[Ashford & Simpson]]) who had previously sung background vocals with the group on their 1979 tour.  The end of 1979 saw the release of ''[[Live and Sleazy]]'', a double album featuring Victor Willis on lead vocals on the \u201cLive\u201d disc and Simpson's debut with the group on the \"Sleazy\" disc.\n\n=== 1980\u20131985 ===\nIn June 1980 the feature film now retitled ''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' was released. The film was directed by [[Nancy Walker]], written by [[Allan Carr]] and [[Bronte Woodard]], music and lyrics by Jacques Morali (except Willis who penned the lyrics to \"Milkshake\" and \"Magic Night\") and starring [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Valerie Perrine]], Jean-Claude Billmaer, and [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce (Caitlyn) Jenner]].  By the time it was released disco's popularity had waned.  At the [[1980 Golden Raspberry Awards|March 1981 Golden Raspberry Awards]], the movie was named [[Razzies|Worst Picture]] and [[Razzies|Worst Screenplay]], and was nominated in almost all the other categories. Although the title song became a club play chart success and moderate radio hit, it was nominated for Worst Original Song \"Razzie\" and did not live up to sales expectations, never obtaining gold status as a single or album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Razzie Awards (1981) |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1981/1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> The soundtrack also featured the talents of David London, who under his real name [[Dennis \"Fergie\" Frederiksen]] became the future lead singer of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] and one of the main contributors to Village People's next album. The group embarked on a tour in promotion of the film in Australia and Japan. The Japanese show was filmed at Budokan and released on DVD as Village People Live In Japan.\n\nThe group appeared in the November 22, 1980, episode of ''[[Love Boat]]'' (season four, episode seven). At the end of 1980, Jeff Olson joined the group as the cowboy.\n\nIn 1981, with [[new wave music]] becoming more popular than disco, Morali and Belolo ditched the familiar characters and re-branded Village People with a new look inspired by the [[New Romantic]] movement, and released the album ''[[Renaissance (Village People album)|Renaissance]]''. It only attracted minor \u2013 mostly negative \u2013 attention, but did produce the group's first hit single in Italy with \"5 O'clock in the Morning.\"\n\nWillis rejoined the group briefly in late 1981 for the writing and recording the album ''[[Fox on the Box]]'', which was released in 1982 in Europe and Japan, and in 1983 in the United States under the title ''In the Street''.  David Hodo and Ray Simpson both left the group in 1982 with Mark Lee and [[Miles Jaye]] replacing them respectively. Jaye contributed lead vocals to a single in 1983 called \"America\", which would be added as extra track to the 1999 remaster of ''In the Street''. \n\nTheir next album, the 1985 dance/[[Hi-NRG]] release ''[[Sex Over the Phone]]'', was not a huge commercial success, but it fared better in sales and club play than ''Renaissance''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The title track, when released as a single, was banned by the [[BBC]] because of its subject matter: credit-card [[phone sex]].<ref>[[Juke Magazine]] February 13, 1985.</ref> Though banned, it did peak at 59 on the UK singles chart. The album featured yet another new lead singer, [[Ray Stephens (singer)|Ray Stephens]] (of ''[[The Great Space Coaster]]'' fame). It was the group's last album of new material until ''A Village People Christmas'' in 2018.  Py Douglas came in to sub for Stephens for some of the group's live appearances in 1985 and can be seen in both promotional videos made for the group.\n\nIn 1985 the group took a hiatus, but returned in 1987 with the lineup of Randy Jones, David Hodo, Felipe Rose, Glenn Hughes, Alex Briley, and Ray Simpson and formed ''Sixuvus Ltd'' a group that managed the affairs of the group and had the license to use the name Village People and its characters in use until 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/30/guardianobituaries1|title=Obituary: Glenn Hughes|first=Dave|last=Laing|date=March 30, 2001|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s\u2013present ===\n[[File:VPStarfront.jpg|thumb|Village People receive their star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2008.

On September 22, 1991 they performed in front of 41,815 in [[Sydney]], Australia, as part of the pre-game entertainment for the [[1991 Rugby League Grand Final|New South Wales Rugby League Grand Final]] held at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].   They also performed a medley of self-parody songs at the [[1993 MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Awards]] \u2013 \"In the Movies\" (\"In the Navy\"), \"Psycho Bitch\" (\"Macho Man\"), and \"My MTV\" (\"Y.M.C.A.\"). The group also made a guest appearance on the hit show ''[[Married... with Children]]'' in the episode \"[[Take My Wife, Please (Married... with Children episode)|Take My Wife, Please]]\".\n\nFounder Jacques Morali died of complications related to [[AIDS]] in Paris, France on November 15, 1991.  Three years later, the Village People recorded with the German national football team on its official [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup '94]] song ''Far Away in America''. In 1995, Eric Anzalone replaced Glenn Hughes as the Leatherman/Biker, and made his music video debut with [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Rob Schneider]], and other cast members during the end-credits of the film ''[[Down Periscope]]'', performing \"In The Navy\" with Ray Simpson on lead vocals.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century Village People released two singles, \"Gunbalanya\" (2000) and \"Loveship 2001\" (2001) under the name \"Amazing Veepers\".  It was reported in 2001 that 'Gunbalanya', which was recorded with indigenous Australian people, took its title from a word meaning \"in the tribe\" though it is in fact the name of an Aboriginal settlement. Leatherman/Biker Glenn Hughes died of lung cancer in New York City on March 4, 2001.<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/village-peoples-hughes-dead-20010313 Village People's Hughes Dead], ''[[Rolling Stone]]''; March 13, 2001</ref>  Village People performed as the opening act for [[Cher]] on her [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour|Farewell Tour]] until it ended in April 2005.
