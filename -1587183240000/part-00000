He broadcast on [[New York City]]'s [[WNYL (FM)|92.3 K-Rock]] and is a former regular guest on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.\n\nMroszak previously worked for two radio stations in the [[Twin Cities]], spending time as part of the [[92 KQRS Morning Show]]. Mroszak was fired from KQRS after he faked a segment implying that [[Brett Favre]] was staying in a [[Minneapolis]] hotel with a woman other than his wife.\n\nMroszak began his radio career as a frequent caller known as \"Cabbie\" on ''The Andy Savage Show'', airing on Minneapolis' 93.7 The Edge. When Howard Stern's show came to town, Mroszak moved to the KQRS Morning Show, the highest rated morning drive show in Minneapolis.\n\n== KQRS hijinks==\nMroszak raised his visibility at KQRS as a street reporter who took some listeners on a tour of the city's crack cocaine market. In one attempt to be outrageous, Mroszak did a \"remote report\" in which he claimed to have knocked on NFL star [[Brett Favre]]'s hotel room door when the [[NFL]]'s [[Green Bay Packers]] were in town for a Monday night game. Mroszak claimed that he intended to offer Favre some Vicodin and a six-pack of beer, but that he instead discovered the [[quarterback]] with a naked female who was not his wife. The report ended abruptly, but the press contacted the station for further information. Mroszak was forced into hiding, but eventually admitted that the story was completely fabricated. With his credibility shattered, Mroszak was fired by KQRS on December 3, 1997, and the station was sued by Favre.\n\nMroszak was not forgotten by old friend Cane (from his 93.7 The Edge days), who brought Mroszak to 92.3 K-Rock (WXRK) New York to produce his  afternoon show. Mroszak used his new job to appear on ''The Howard Stern Show''.\n\n==''The Howard Stern Show''==\nOn ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Mroszak would often discuss his [[paratrooper]] service during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]], events that occurred during his stint as a deejay for K-Rock radio, and the many bizarre incidents in his personal life.\n\nOn the March 23, 2001 show, ''The Howard Stern Show'' paid Mroszak $3,000 to air the details of his discharge from the military. Mroszak revealed that he and several other men had sex with the daughter of a Delta Force Sergeant Major. The interview shifted to Stern interrogating Mroszak about his involvement in a sexual situation that involved the presence of several men. Mroszak confirmed that he has engaged in homosexual sex but contends that he is not attracted to men.  \n\nMroszak fought two boxing matches during his association with ''The Howard Stern Show''. On April 27, 2001, he fought [[The Wack Pack|Wack Pack]] member [[The Wack Pack#Angry Black|Angry Black]] to a five-round draw and on May 31, 2002 he was defeated by [[John Melendez|Stuttering John]] by unanimous decision.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Mroszak called into ''The Howard Stern Show;'' from his rooftop in Williamsburg Brooklyn. By then the Stern Show was one of only a couple of local broadcasts still on the air. Cabbie helped explain that airplanes that people witnessed in Manhattan were [[United States Air Force]] fighters sent to patrol Manhattan airspace. He described the action of that horrific morning to the listening audience. He received numerous plaudits for his live coverage and description of the unfolding events. \n\nOn the January 6, 2003 show, Mroszak had an on-air reunion with his biological mother, who claimed to have given him up as a newborn for adoption because she could not afford to raise him.\n\nOn July 27, 2006, Mroszak was released from prison after serving a one-year sentence for tax evasion, and immediately went to [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] to visit [[Howard Stern]]. On August 15, 2006, Mroszak substituted for Sirius radio host [[Scott Ferrall]], who was on vacation.\n\nIn 2004, Mroszak allowed a [[pornographic|porno]] film featuring [[Ron Jeremy]] and [[Tabitha Stevens]] to be shot in Howard Stern's studio without permission. When confronted by Stern and crew in 2006, Mroszak contended that he produced the film but did not directly participate, but rather played \"a Steven Spielberg type role\" and that the film had been destroyed. On February 8, 2007, Stern questioned whether Mroszak could ever again be trusted, while [[Fred Norris|Fred]] described the porn antics as \"a sign of disrespect.\" In 2009, Ron Jeremy confirmed that Mroszak acted in the movie.<ref>http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/risqu-business-if-porn-star-taryn-thomas-is-any-indication-the-valley-of-the-sun-may-be-the-next-porn-capital-of-the-world-6431165</ref>\n\nOn June 28, 2007, Mroszak was fired by Sirius Satellite Radio after claiming on his website and on the Opie and Anthony radio show <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyj3pzlu8VM&t=2997s</ref> that he was in possession of a Howard Stern sex tape.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://pagesix.com/2007/06/30/stern-gives-cabbie-the-boot/\n| title      = Stern Gives Cabbie the Boot\n| work       = Page Six\n| date       = 2007-06-30\n| accessdate = 2017-06-01\n}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2015 interview on a podcast, Mroszak stated that he had retired from radio since he was fired from Sirius.<ref>http://www.radiogunk.com/crazy-cabbie-checks-in/</ref>\n\n== Tax trouble==\nMroszak spent one year in federal prison for [[tax avoidance and tax evasion#Tax evasion|tax evasion]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/17/entertainment/et-quick17.3 |title=DJ sentenced to one year in prison |date=2005-05-17 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2018-04-18 |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}</ref> He was arrested after saying on the November 9, 2004 ''Howard Stern Show'' that he did not file a tax return in many years and would not resume filing until the U.S. government cured his [[Gulf War Syndrome]].

The Institute has six Schools and offers programmes in Business, Engineering, Science, Health Sciences, Education & Humanities.\n\nThe institute opened in 1970 as a [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Regional Technical College]] and adopted its present name on May 7, 1997.<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/si/0199.html Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1997]</ref> The institute is currently headed by President Prof. Willie Donnelly.<ref name=actingpres>{{cite web|title=Office of the President\n|url=https://www.wit.ie/about_wit/at_a_glance/office_of_the_president,48165,en.html|accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Institutes of Technology in Ireland}}\nIn the 1840s, at the time of the formation of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]], Waterford politicians made strenuous, but unsuccessful, efforts to locate a university in Waterford. The cause was led by [[Thomas Wyse]], Waterford\u2019s then [[Member of Parliament]].  He was perhaps unwisely chosen as he was not influential in Parliament due to strong Napoleonic links{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} (he married a niece of [[Napoleon I]] of France), being Catholic and leaning towards an independent Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Galway]], a much smaller city at the time, won out over [[Waterford]], perhaps for geographical dispersion or to bolster the [[Irish language]]. Wyse wrote on the matter in his text \"Education reform or the necessity of a national system of education\" (London, 1836).\n\nThe '''Regional Technical College, Waterford''' was founded in 1970 and grew quickly as a result of the strong regional need for tertiary education. At the time of the RTC's founding, there were two other third-level institutions in the city, [[St. John's College, Waterford|St John\u2019s Seminary]].<ref>[http://archives.tcm.ie/waterfordnews/2004/01/23/story13295.asp On the market: St. John\u2019s College sale to fund new pastoral centre] Waterford News & Star</ref> Waterford News and Star notes the closing of the St John's Seminary in 1999 and De La Salle Brothers teacher training college.\n\nIn 1997 the college adopted its present name, Waterford Institute of Technology, by order of the Minister for Education [[Niamh Bhreathnach]]. At the time the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] was the only other Irish state third level educational college with \"institute of technology\" in its name. Following a change of government and political pressure on behalf of other regional technical colleges, especially [[Cork Regional Technical College]], all other regional technical colleges were similarly renamed by then Minister for Education [[Miche\u00e1l Martin]].\n\nSince 2001 WIT has conferred its own awards at all levels from Higher Certificate to PhD, subject to standards set and monitored by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council ([[HETAC]]) which was established by the Government in June 2001, under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.wit.ie/AboutWIT/ |title=AboutWIT|accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref> In October 2005 the institute was selected by [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] newspaper as the \"Institute of Technology of the Year\" in Ireland.\n\nWIT now has a student population of approximately 6000 full-time students and 1,000 part-time students. The Staff currently consists of approximately 470 Full-time academic, 300 part-time and 300 support staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpd-construction.com/moodle/file.php/1/Project_Partners.doc|title=Project Partners}}</ref>\n\nThe institute formally applied in 2006 for university status in accordance with the Universities Act, 1997, and the process of examining the case for redesignation has commenced. In January 2007 Dr Jim Port was engaged by the government to carry out a \"preliminary assessment\" of the institute's case.<ref>[http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=50&si=1731008&issue_id=14935 Institute a step nearer to university status] Irish Independent</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://afterschool.my/scholarship/waterford-institute-technology-scholarship/ |title=Waterford Scholarship 2017 |publisher=Afterschool}}</ref>\n\n==Ranking==\nIn 2018, Webometrics placed WIT as the 7th best higher education body in Ireland (out of 32). The Institute is also ranked at 10th place by Unirank, and the leading Irish institute of technology (with the exception of DIT, which is now classified as a Technology University).<ref>{{cite web |title=Ireland:Ranking |url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/Europe/Ireland%20 | accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\nThe Institute has 5 campuses: Cork Road, College Street, Carriganore, the Applied Technology Building and the Granary.\n\n===Cork Road Campus===\nThe Cork Road Campus (also called the Main Campus) is located on the R680 (the old Cork Road). It was established in 1970 and houses the majority of the institutes departments. The Engineering, Science, Business and Health Science Schools are located on this campus. The buildings on this campus are: The original \u201969 building which contains the main administration offices along with the Schools of Science & Engineering, the \u201977 building housing the Business School, the [[Luke Wadding]] library, [[Ernest Walton|Walton]] IT Building, O'Connell Bianconi Nursing Building,  Tourism & Leisure Building, the \u201cT-Block\" now the FTG rooms which is also where the Centre for Technology Enhanced Learning is located. The Dome Bar,College Hall & Fitness Suite are adjacent to the main building and there is also on-site accommodation \"College Fields\" apartments.\n\n===College Street Campus===\nThe College Street Campus is located 5 minutes from the City Centre. The Humanities and Lifelong Learning & Education schools are officially located here, but are in reality spread between this and the Cork Road Campus.  There is also an on-site College Library.  The buildings were purchased from the Good Shepherd Order of Nuns. The one time convent houses a [[Pugin]]-designed chapel which is used for concerts and ceremonies. WIT Conferring ceremonies take place in the Chapel on this campus every year.\n\n===Carriganore Campus===\nThe Carriganore campus, or West Campus, is located outside the city near the Waterford Bypass. It is the goal of the Institute that this campus become the college's Cork Road Campus in years to come. So far it has the [[TSSG]] Building, the ArcLabs Research and Innovation Centre (also containing [[TSSG]] staff), the National Biodiversity Centre, Carriganore House (an old mansion now home to the Macular Pigmnent Research Group) and the WIT Sports Campus.  Many of the intervarsity rugby, soccer & GAA matches take place here.\n\n===Applied Technology Building===\nThe Applied Technology Building, which is on lease from IDA Ireland, is located in Waterford\u2019s Industrial Estate. This is just a 2-minute walk from the back of the Cork Road Campus. While thought by most students to be a \u201cspill-over\u201d of the Cork Road Campus, due to its close proximity, it is officially a separate campus.

The Institute has six Schools and offers programmes in Business, Engineering, Science, Health Sciences, Education & Humanities.\n\nThe institute opened in 1970 as a [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Regional Technical College]] and adopted its present name on May 7, 1997.<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/si/0199.html Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1997]</ref> The institute is currently headed by President Prof. Willie Donnelly.<ref name=actingpres>{{cite web|title=Office of the President\n|url=https://www.wit.ie/about_wit/at_a_glance/office_of_the_president,48165,en.html|accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Institutes of Technology in Ireland}}\nIn the 1840s, at the time of the formation of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]], Waterford politicians made strenuous, but unsuccessful, efforts to locate a university in Waterford. The cause was led by [[Thomas Wyse]], Waterford\u2019s then [[Member of Parliament]].  He was perhaps unwisely chosen as he was not influential in Parliament due to strong Napoleonic links{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} (he married a niece of [[Napoleon I]] of France), being Catholic and leaning towards an independent Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Galway]], a much smaller city at the time, won out over [[Waterford]], perhaps for geographical dispersion or to bolster the [[Irish language]]. Wyse wrote on the matter in his text \"Education reform or the necessity of a national system of education\" (London, 1836).\n\nThe '''Regional Technical College, Waterford''' was founded in 1970 and grew quickly as a result of the strong regional need for tertiary education. At the time of the RTC's founding, there were two other third-level institutions in the city, [[St. John's College, Waterford|St John\u2019s Seminary]].<ref>[http://archives.tcm.ie/waterfordnews/2004/01/23/story13295.asp On the market: St. John\u2019s College sale to fund new pastoral centre] Waterford News & Star</ref> Waterford News and Star notes the closing of the St John's Seminary in 1999 and De La Salle Brothers teacher training college.\n\nIn 1997 the college adopted its present name, Waterford Institute of Technology, by order of the Minister for Education [[Niamh Bhreathnach]]. At the time the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] was the only other Irish state third level educational college with \"institute of technology\" in its name. Following a change of government and political pressure on behalf of other regional technical colleges, especially [[Cork Regional Technical College]], all other regional technical colleges were similarly renamed by then Minister for Education [[Miche\u00e1l Martin]].\n\nSince 2001 WIT has conferred its own awards at all levels from Higher Certificate to PhD, subject to standards set and monitored by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council ([[HETAC]]) which was established by the Government in June 2001, under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.wit.ie/AboutWIT/ |title=AboutWIT|accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref> In October 2005 the institute was selected by [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] newspaper as the \"Institute of Technology of the Year\" in Ireland.\n\nWIT now has a student population of approximately 6000 full-time students and 1,000 part-time students. The Staff currently consists of approximately 470 Full-time academic, 300 part-time and 300 support staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpd-construction.com/moodle/file.php/1/Project_Partners.doc|title=Project Partners}}</ref>\n\nThe institute formally applied in 2006 for university status in accordance with the Universities Act, 1997, and the process of examining the case for redesignation has commenced. In January 2007 Dr Jim Port was engaged by the government to carry out a \"preliminary assessment\" of the institute's case.<ref>[http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=50&si=1731008&issue_id=14935 Institute a step nearer to university status] Irish Independent</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://afterschool.my/scholarship/waterford-institute-technology-scholarship/ |title=Waterford Scholarship 2017 |publisher=Afterschool}}</ref>\n\n==Ranking==\nIn 2018, Webometrics placed WIT as the 7th best higher education body in Ireland (out of 32). The Institute is also ranked at 10th place by Unirank, and the leading Irish institute of technology (with the exception of DIT, which is now classified as a Technology University).<ref>{{cite web |title=Ireland:Ranking |url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/Europe/Ireland%20 | accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\nThe Institute has 5 campuses: Cork Road, College Street, Carriganore, the Applied Technology Building and the Granary.\n\n===Cork Road Campus===\nThe Cork Road Campus (also called the Main Campus) is located on the R680 (the old Cork Road). It was established in 1970 and houses the majority of the institutes departments. The Engineering, Science, Business and Health Science Schools are located on this campus. The buildings on this campus are: The original \u201969 building which contains the main administration offices along with the Schools of Science & Engineering, the \u201977 building housing the Business School, the [[Luke Wadding]] library, [[Ernest Walton|Walton]] IT Building, O'Connell Bianconi Nursing Building,  Tourism & Leisure Building, the \u201cT-Block\" now the FTG rooms which is also where the Centre for Technology Enhanced Learning is located. The Dome Bar,College Hall & Fitness Suite are adjacent to the main building and there is also on-site accommodation \"College Fields\" apartments.\n\n===College Street Campus===\nThe College Street Campus is located 5 minutes from the City Centre. The Humanities and Lifelong Learning & Education schools are officially located here, but are in reality spread between this and the Cork Road Campus.  There is also an on-site College Library.  The buildings were purchased from the Good Shepherd Order of Nuns. The one time convent houses a [[Pugin]]-designed chapel which is used for concerts and ceremonies. WIT Conferring ceremonies take place in the Chapel on this campus every year.\n\n===Carriganore Campus===\nThe Carriganore campus, or West Campus, is located outside the city near the Waterford Bypass. It is the goal of the Institute that this campus become the college's Cork Road Campus in years to come. So far it has the [[TSSG]] Building, the ArcLabs Research and Innovation Centre (also containing [[TSSG]] staff), the National Biodiversity Centre, Carriganore House (an old mansion now home to the Macular Pigmnent Research Group) and the WIT Sports Campus.  Many of the intervarsity rugby, soccer & GAA matches take place here.\n\n===Applied Technology Building===\nThe Applied Technology Building, which is on lease from IDA Ireland, is located in Waterford\u2019s Industrial Estate. This is just a 2-minute walk from the back of the Cork Road Campus. While thought by most students to be a \u201cspill-over\u201d of the Cork Road Campus, due to its close proximity, it is officially a separate campus. It houses engineering workshops and technology based facilities as well as the Careers Centre and the Engineering Research area.\n\n===The Granary===\nThe Department of Architecture and Architecture Technology is located in the old Waterford Museum of Treasures. This building is on the Merchant's Quay, very close to the city centre and the historical heart of the cifty.\n\n==Organisation==\nThe Institute is divided into 6 schools and their various departments. \n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*'''School of Business'''\n**Department of Accountancy & Economics\n**Department of Management & Organisation\n**Department of Graduate Business Studies\n*'''School of Lifelong Learning & Education'''\n**Department of Education\n**Department of Lifelong Learning\n*'''School of Engineering'''\n**Department of Architecture\n**Department of the Built Environment\n**Department of Engineering Technology\n*'''School of Health Sciences'''\n** Department of Nursing & Health Care\n** Department of Health, Sport & Exercise Science\n*'''School of Humanities'''\n**Department of Applied Arts\n**Department of Creative & Performing Arts\n**Department of Languages, Tourism & Hospitality Studies\n*'''School of Science and Computing'''\n**Department of Science\n**Department of Computing and Mathematics\n}}\n\n==Research at WIT==\n[[File:ResearchInfographic.svg|thumb|right]]\n\nWIT has secured \u20ac200 million in research funding since 2000 and has collaborated with 350 academic and industry partners over that period.

The charges arose when cheques tendered for services by these companies were dishonoured by the bank. The sums of monies are in excess of $300000.00 BDS. Both men are remanded in prison in Barbados awaiting hearing.
