This species is one of the largest molluscs native to the Caribbean sea, and [[Tropical Atlantic#Marine provinces|tropical northwestern Atlantic]], from [[Bermuda]] to [[Brazil]], reaching up to {{convert|35.2|cm}} in shell length. ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' is closely related to the goliath conch, ''[[Lobatus goliath]]'', a species [[endemic]] to Brazil, as well as the rooster conch, ''[[Lobatus gallus]]''.\n\nThe queen conch is [[herbivorous]]. It feeds by browsing for plant and algal material growing in the [[seagrass]] beds, and scavenging for decaying plant matter. These large sea snails typically reside in seagrass beds, which are sandy plains covered in swaying sea grass and associated with coral reefs, although the exact habitat of this species varies according to developmental age. The adult animal has a very large, solid and heavy [[gastropod shell|shell]], with knob-like spines on the shoulder, a flared, thick outer lip, and a characteristic pink or orange [[aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] (opening). The outside of the queen conch is sandy colored, helping them blend in with their surroundings. The flared lip is absent in juveniles; it develops once the snail reaches reproductive age. The thicker the shell's flared lip is, the older the conch is.<ref name=\"oceana.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://oceana.org/marine-life/cephalopods-crustaceans-other-shellfish/queen-conch |title = Queen Conch}}</ref> The external [[anatomy]] of the soft parts of ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' is similar to that of other snails in the family Strombidae; it has a long [[snout]], two [[eyestalk]]s with well-developed eyes, additional sensory [[tentacles]], a strong foot and a [[corneous]], [[sickle]]-shaped [[operculum (gastropod)|operculum]].\n\nThe shell and soft parts of living ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' serve as a home to several different kinds of [[commensal]] animals, including [[Crepidula|slipper snail]]s, [[porcelain crab]]s and a specialized species of [[cardinalfish]] known as the Conchfish (''[https://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/caribbean/en/thefishes/species/3613 Astrapogon stellatus]''). Its [[parasite]]s include [[coccidia]]ns. The Queen conch's natural predators include several species of large [[predatory]] sea snails, [[octopus]], [[starfish]], [[crustacean]]s and [[vertebrate]]s ([[fish]], [[sea turtle]]s, [[nurse shark]]s). It is an especially important food source for large predators like sea turtles and nurse sharks.  Human capture and consumption dates back into prehistory.\n\nIts shell is sold as a [[souvenir]] and used as a decorative object. Historically, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s and indigenous Caribbean peoples used parts of the shell to create various tools.\n\nInternational trade in the Caribbean queen conch is regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ([[CITES]]) agreement, in which it is listed as ''Strombus gigas''.<ref name=\"Acosta2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Acosta|first1=Charles C.|title=Impending Trade Suspensions of Caribbean Queen Conch under CITES: A Case Study on Fishery Impacts and Potential for Stock Recovery|journal=Fisheries|date=2006|volume=32|issue=12|pages=601\u2013606|url=http://www.nku.edu/~acostac/Acosta2006Fisheries.pdf}}</ref> This species is not endangered in the Caribbean as a whole, but is commercially threatened in numerous areas, largely due to extreme [[overfishing]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\n[[File:Strombus gigas type.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An antique-looking illustration, numbered 321, showing a large, apparently left-handed, sea snail shell with knobs on the shoulders of the whorls|For a number of years during the 20th century, this very early illustration was designated as the [[Type (biology)|neotype]] of this species: a figure of ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' from ''{{Lang|la|Recreatio mentis, et occuli}}'' (1684). The shell in the figure appears left-right reversed because of the [[engraving]] process. The original type was subsequently found, invalidating this designation.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Allmon, W.

To remedy this, in 1941 a [[neotype]] of this species was designated by the American [[malacologist]]s [[William J. Clench]] and [[R. Tucker Abbott]].

Simone proposed a [[cladogram]] (a tree of descent) based on an extensive [[morphology (biology)|morpho]]-[[anatomy|anatomical]] analysis of representatives of [[Aporrhaidae]], Strombidae, [[Xenophoridae]] and [[Struthiolariidae]], which included ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' (there referred to as ''Eustrombus gigas'').<ref name=\"Simone2005\"/>\n\nWith the exception of ''[[Lambis]]'' and ''[[Terebellum (gastropod)|Terebellum]]'', the remaining taxa were previously allocated in the genus ''Strombus'', including ''L.&nbsp;gigas''. However, according to Simone, only ''[[Strombus gracilior]]'', ''[[Strombus alatus]]'' and ''[[Strombus pugilis]]'', the [[type species]], remained within ''Strombus'', as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five [[synapomorphies]] (traits that are shared by two or more [[taxa]] and their [[most recent common ancestor]]).<ref name=\"Simone2005\"/> The remaining taxa were previously considered [[subgenera]] and were elevated to genus level by Simone. Genus ''Eustrombus'' (now considered a synonym of ''[[Lobatus]]''<ref name=\"WoRMSk\">{{WRMS species|531665|''Lobatus'' Swainson, 1837 || 5 December 2012}}</ref>), in this case, included ''Eustrombus gigas'' (now considered a synonym of ''Lobatus gigas'') and ''Eustrombus goliath'' (= ''[[Lobatus goliath]]''), which were thus considered closely related.<ref name=\"Simone2005\"/>\n\nIn a different approach, Latiolais and colleagues (2006) proposed another cladogram that attempts to show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 ''Strombus '' species, including ''Lobatus gigas'' (there referred to as ''Strombus gigas''), and three species in the allied genus ''Lambis''. The cladogram was based on [[DNA]] sequences of both nuclear [[histone H3]] and mitochondrial [[Main subunit of cytochrome c oxidase|cytochrome-c oxidase I]] (COI) protein-coding [[gene]] regions. In this proposed phylogeny, ''Strombus gigas'' and ''Strombus gallus'' (= ''[[Lobatus gallus]]'') are closely related and appear to share a [[common ancestor]].<ref name=Latiolais2006 />\n\n=== Common names ===\nCommon names include \"queen conch\" and \"pink conch\" in English, ''{{lang|es|caracol rosa}}'' and ''{{lang|es|caracol rosado}}'' in [[Mexico]], ''{{lang|es|caracol de pala}}'', ''{{lang|es|cobo}}'', ''{{lang|es|botuto}}'' and ''{{lang|es|guarura}}'' in [[Venezuela]], ''{{lang|es|caracol reina}}'', ''{{lang|es|lamb\u00ed}}'' in the [[Dominican Republic]] and Grenada,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Queen conch biology, fisheries and mariculture|year=1994|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Cientifica Los Roques|pages=13\u201324|author=Rodr\u00edguez, B.|author2=Posada, J. |editor1=Appeldoorn R. |editor2=Rodr\u00edguez, B. |location=Caracas, Venezuela|chapter=Revisi\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica de la pesquer\u00eda del botuto o guarura (''Strombus gigas'' L.) y el alcance de su programa de manejo en el Parque Nacional Archipi\u00e9lago de Los Roques, Venezuela}}</ref><ref name=\"Buitriago\">{{Cite journal|last=Buitriago|first=J.|title=Cria en cautiverio, del huevo al adulto, del botuto (''Strombus gigas''L)|journal=Memoria Sociedad de Ciencias Naturales la Salle|year=1983|volume=43|pages=29\u201339|url=http://orton.catie.ac.cr/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/?IsisScript=AGRINVE.xis&method=post&formato=2&cantidad=1&expresion=mfn=003428}}</ref><ref name=\"Avalos\">{{Cite journal|last=Avalos|first=D.

This species is one of the largest molluscs native to the Caribbean sea, and [[Tropical Atlantic#Marine provinces|tropical northwestern Atlantic]], from [[Bermuda]] to [[Brazil]], reaching up to {{convert|35.2|cm}} in shell length. ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' is closely related to the goliath conch, ''[[Lobatus goliath]]'', a species [[endemic]] to Brazil, as well as the rooster conch, ''[[Lobatus gallus]]''.\n\nThe queen conch is [[herbivorous]]. It feeds by browsing for plant and algal material growing in the [[seagrass]] beds, and scavenging for decaying plant matter. These large sea snails typically reside in seagrass beds, which are sandy plains covered in swaying sea grass and associated with coral reefs, although the exact habitat of this species varies according to developmental age. The adult animal has a very large, solid and heavy [[gastropod shell|shell]], with knob-like spines on the shoulder, a flared, thick outer lip, and a characteristic pink or orange [[aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] (opening). The outside of the queen conch is sandy colored, helping them blend in with their surroundings. The flared lip is absent in juveniles; it develops once the snail reaches reproductive age. The thicker the shell's flared lip is, the older the conch is.<ref name=\"oceana.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://oceana.org/marine-life/cephalopods-crustaceans-other-shellfish/queen-conch |title = Queen Conch}}</ref> The external [[anatomy]] of the soft parts of ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' is similar to that of other snails in the family Strombidae; it has a long [[snout]], two [[eyestalk]]s with well-developed eyes, additional sensory [[tentacles]], a strong foot and a [[corneous]], [[sickle]]-shaped [[operculum (gastropod)|operculum]].\n\nThe shell and soft parts of living ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' serve as a home to several different kinds of [[commensal]] animals, including [[Crepidula|slipper snail]]s, [[porcelain crab]]s and a specialized species of [[cardinalfish]] known as the Conchfish (''[https://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/caribbean/en/thefishes/species/3613 Astrapogon stellatus]''). Its [[parasite]]s include [[coccidia]]ns. The Queen conch's natural predators include several species of large [[predatory]] sea snails, [[octopus]], [[starfish]], [[crustacean]]s and [[vertebrate]]s ([[fish]], [[sea turtle]]s, [[nurse shark]]s). It is an especially important food source for large predators like sea turtles and nurse sharks.  Human capture and consumption dates back into prehistory.\n\nIts shell is sold as a [[souvenir]] and used as a decorative object. Historically, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s and indigenous Caribbean peoples used parts of the shell to create various tools.\n\nInternational trade in the Caribbean queen conch is regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ([[CITES]]) agreement, in which it is listed as ''Strombus gigas''.<ref name=\"Acosta2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Acosta|first1=Charles C.|title=Impending Trade Suspensions of Caribbean Queen Conch under CITES: A Case Study on Fishery Impacts and Potential for Stock Recovery|journal=Fisheries|date=2006|volume=32|issue=12|pages=601\u2013606|url=http://www.nku.edu/~acostac/Acosta2006Fisheries.pdf}}</ref> This species is not endangered in the Caribbean as a whole, but is commercially threatened in numerous areas, largely due to extreme [[overfishing]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\n[[File:Strombus gigas type.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An antique-looking illustration, numbered 321, showing a large, apparently left-handed, sea snail shell with knobs on the shoulders of the whorls|For a number of years during the 20th century, this very early illustration was designated as the [[Type (biology)|neotype]] of this species: a figure of ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' from ''{{Lang|la|Recreatio mentis, et occuli}}'' (1684).

Simone proposed a [[cladogram]] (a tree of descent) based on an extensive [[morphology (biology)|morpho]]-[[anatomy|anatomical]] analysis of representatives of [[Aporrhaidae]], Strombidae, [[Xenophoridae]] and [[Struthiolariidae]], which included ''L.&nbsp;gigas'' (there referred to as ''Eustrombus gigas'').<ref name=\"Simone2005\"/>\n\nWith the exception of ''[[Lambis]]'' and ''[[Terebellum (gastropod)|Terebellum]]'', the remaining taxa were previously allocated in the genus ''Strombus'', including ''L.&nbsp;gigas''. However, according to Simone, only ''[[Strombus gracilior]]'', ''[[Strombus alatus]]'' and ''[[Strombus pugilis]]'', the [[type species]], remained within ''Strombus'', as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five [[synapomorphies]] (traits that are shared by two or more [[taxa]] and their [[most recent common ancestor]]).<ref name=\"Simone2005\"/> The remaining taxa were previously considered [[subgenera]] and were elevated to genus level by Simone. Genus ''Eustrombus'' (now considered a synonym of ''[[Lobatus]]''<ref name=\"WoRMSk\">{{WRMS species|531665|''Lobatus'' Swainson, 1837 || 5 December 2012}}</ref>), in this case, included ''Eustrombus gigas'' (now considered a synonym of ''Lobatus gigas'') and ''Eustrombus goliath'' (= ''[[Lobatus goliath]]''), which were thus considered closely related.<ref name=\"Simone2005\"/>\n\nIn a different approach, Latiolais and colleagues (2006) proposed another cladogram that attempts to show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 ''Strombus '' species, including ''Lobatus gigas'' (there referred to as ''Strombus gigas''), and three species in the allied genus ''Lambis''. The cladogram was based on [[DNA]] sequences of both nuclear [[histone H3]] and mitochondrial [[Main subunit of cytochrome c oxidase|cytochrome-c oxidase I]] (COI) protein-coding [[gene]] regions. In this proposed phylogeny, ''Strombus gigas'' and ''Strombus gallus'' (= ''[[Lobatus gallus]]'') are closely related and appear to share a [[common ancestor]].<ref name=Latiolais2006 />\n\n=== Common names ===\nCommon names include \"queen conch\" and \"pink conch\" in English, ''{{lang|es|caracol rosa}}'' and ''{{lang|es|caracol rosado}}'' in [[Mexico]], ''{{lang|es|caracol de pala}}'', ''{{lang|es|cobo}}'', ''{{lang|es|botuto}}'' and ''{{lang|es|guarura}}'' in [[Venezuela]], ''{{lang|es|caracol reina}}'', ''{{lang|es|lamb\u00ed}}'' in the [[Dominican Republic]] and Grenada,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Queen conch biology, fisheries and mariculture|year=1994|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Cientifica Los Roques|pages=13\u201324|author=Rodr\u00edguez, B.|author2=Posada, J. |editor1=Appeldoorn R. |editor2=Rodr\u00edguez, B. |location=Caracas, Venezuela|chapter=Revisi\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica de la pesquer\u00eda del botuto o guarura (''Strombus gigas'' L.) y el alcance de su programa de manejo en el Parque Nacional Archipi\u00e9lago de Los Roques, Venezuela}}</ref><ref name=\"Buitriago\">{{Cite journal|last=Buitriago|first=J.|title=Cria en cautiverio, del huevo al adulto, del botuto (''Strombus gigas''L)|journal=Memoria Sociedad de Ciencias Naturales la Salle|year=1983|volume=43|pages=29\u201339|url=http://orton.catie.ac.cr/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/?IsisScript=AGRINVE.xis&method=post&formato=2&cantidad=1&expresion=mfn=003428}}</ref><ref name=\"Avalos\">{{Cite journal|last=Avalos|first=D.

Usage declined after 1930 as road competition became stronger. In 1959 diesel railbuses were used for the line's passenger services; this initiative halted the decline, but did not reverse the financial losses on the line, and it closed completely in 1964.\n\n==The main line at Kemble==\n[[File:Tetbury1889.png|thumb|The Tetbury branch in 1889]]Following on from the successful completion of the [[Great Western Railway]] between London and Bristol, there was a desire to open further railways connecting other important centres to the emerging railway network. The [[Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway]] was authorised in 1836 to build a line connecting Swindon (on the London to Bristol main line) and [[Cheltenham]]. In fact the C&GWUR ran into financial difficulties, and was unable to open its line promptly throughout, but it opened a section from Swindon to [[Cirencester]] via Kemble, on 31 May 1841.<ref name = macd1-170>E T MacDermot, ''History of the Great Western Railway, volume I, 1833 \u2013 1863'', published by the  Great Western Railway, London, 1927, page 170</ref>\n\nThe Great Western acquired the partly built C&GWUR line in 1843<ref group = note>Ratified by Act in 1844.</ref> and proceeded with the construction of the remainder of the line. It opened onwards from Kemble on 12 May 1845, and there was a station named Tetbury Road.

Running broadly north to south from [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire|Stonehouse]] to [[Chippenham]], it would have passed close to Tetbury, but it was not built in the proposed form. Subsequently several schemes for north-south long-distance routes came and went.\n\n[[File:Tetbury railway station (postcard).jpg|thumb|Tetbury railway station before 1920)]]A realistic proposal came forward when the independent ''Swindon and Cheltenham Railway''<ref group = note>Later named the [[Midland and South Western Junction Railway]].</ref> put forward a scheme for an extension of its own (as yet unbuilt) line. Its own main line was to run north from Swindon through Cirencester, and the extension would be a branch from [[Siddington, Gloucestershire|Siddington]], on its main line south of Cirencester, to Tetbury, crossing the GWR line. The GWR did not welcome a new line making a further encroachment into territory it considered its own, and it opposed the scheme in Parliament in 1883. To kill off the proposal it gave a formal undertaking to build a Tetbury branch itself.\n\nAccordingly in the 1884 session of Parliament, the GWR sought authorisation of a line from Kemble to Tetbury, 7 miles 6 chains in length, at an estimated cost of \u00a368,000, and the construction was authorised by Act of 7 August 1884.<ref name = maggs141>Colin G Maggs, ''Gloucestershire Railways'', Halsgrove, Wellington, 2010, {{ISBN|978 1 84114 913 4}}, pages 141 to 143</ref> The GWR displayed no urgency in constructing the line and it was not until late 1887 that work started.<ref name = randolph4>Randolph, page 4 and 6</ref>\n\n==Construction and opening==\nThe earthworks were generally rather light, the greatest difficulty being cutting through a spur of rock near Tetbury to make a flat area for the goods yard part of the station.

Usage declined after 1930 as road competition became stronger. In 1959 diesel railbuses were used for the line's passenger services; this initiative halted the decline, but did not reverse the financial losses on the line, and it closed completely in 1964.\n\n==The main line at Kemble==\n[[File:Tetbury1889.png|thumb|The Tetbury branch in 1889]]Following on from the successful completion of the [[Great Western Railway]] between London and Bristol, there was a desire to open further railways connecting other important centres to the emerging railway network. The [[Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway]] was authorised in 1836 to build a line connecting Swindon (on the London to Bristol main line) and [[Cheltenham]]. In fact the C&GWUR ran into financial difficulties, and was unable to open its line promptly throughout, but it opened a section from Swindon to [[Cirencester]] via Kemble, on 31 May 1841.<ref name = macd1-170>E T MacDermot, ''History of the Great Western Railway, volume I, 1833 \u2013 1863'', published by the  Great Western Railway, London, 1927, page 170</ref>\n\nThe Great Western acquired the partly built C&GWUR line in 1843<ref group = note>Ratified by Act in 1844.</ref> and proceeded with the construction of the remainder of the line. It opened onwards from Kemble on 12 May 1845, and there was a station named Tetbury Road. It was located close to the present-day Thames Head public house, immediately north of the Cirencester to Tetbury main road.<ref name = macd1-184>MacDermot, volume I, page 184</ref><ref name = randolph2>Stephen Randolph, ''The Tetbury Branch'', Wild Swan Publications, 1985, {{ISBN|0 906867 35 5}}, pages 2 to 4</ref><ref name = macd1-170/>\n\nThe line was broad gauge, until gauge conversion in 1872.<ref name = macd2-64>E T MacDermot, ''History of the Great Western Railway, volume II, 1863 \u2013 1921'', published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931, pages 64 and 65</ref> Tetbury Road station closed in 1882, remaining in service as Coates Goods depot.<ref name = quick>Michael Quick, ''Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology'', the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, fifth (electronic) edition, 2019</ref>\n\n==A line to Tetbury==\nThe [[Railway Mania]] brought a huge number of railway schemes to the fore, and in the peak year of 1845 a ''Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Junction Railway'' was put forward. Running broadly north to south from [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire|Stonehouse]] to [[Chippenham]], it would have passed close to Tetbury, but it was not built in the proposed form. Subsequently several schemes for north-south long-distance routes came and went.\n\n[[File:Tetbury railway station (postcard).jpg|thumb|Tetbury railway station before 1920)]]A realistic proposal came forward when the independent ''Swindon and Cheltenham Railway''<ref group = note>Later named the [[Midland and South Western Junction Railway]].</ref> put forward a scheme for an extension of its own (as yet unbuilt) line. Its own main line was to run north from Swindon through Cirencester, and the extension would be a branch from [[Siddington, Gloucestershire|Siddington]], on its main line south of Cirencester, to Tetbury, crossing the GWR line. The GWR did not welcome a new line making a further encroachment into territory it considered its own, and it opposed the scheme in Parliament in 1883. To kill off the proposal it gave a formal undertaking to build a Tetbury branch itself.\n\nAccordingly in the 1884 session of Parliament, the GWR sought authorisation of a line from Kemble to Tetbury, 7 miles 6 chains in length, at an estimated cost of \u00a368,000, and the construction was authorised by Act of 7 August 1884.<ref name = maggs141>Colin G Maggs, ''Gloucestershire Railways'', Halsgrove, Wellington, 2010, {{ISBN|978 1 84114 913 4}}, pages 141 to 143</ref>. The GWR displayed no urgency in constructing the line and it was not until late 1887 that work started.<ref name = randolph4>Randolph, page 4 and 6</ref>\n\n==Construction and opening==\nThe earthworks were generally rather light, the greatest difficulty being cutting through a spur of rock near Tetbury to make a flat area for the goods yard part of the station.

The reluctance derived from the fact that it was too much akin to the royal prerogative to afford dispensation to favorites from obedience to the law, a prerogative supposedly eliminated by the English bill of rights in 1689. The Framers were concerned lest the power should be used to shelter the treasonous activities of a President and his henchmen. The most persuasive argument on behalf of a presidential pardoning power was its potential use to reconcile warring factions. Because it would, for this purpose, be an effective tool only if it were readily available to strike a deal at any time, and because Congress was not expected to be in session all, or even most, of the time, it properly devolved on the executive.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Corwin, Edward S.

The reluctance derived from the fact that it was too much akin to the royal prerogative to afford dispensation to favorites from obedience to the law, a prerogative supposedly eliminated by the English bill of rights in 1689. The Framers were concerned lest the power should be used to shelter the treasonous activities of a President and his henchmen. The most persuasive argument on behalf of a presidential pardoning power was its potential use to reconcile warring factions. Because it would, for this purpose, be an effective tool only if it were readily available to strike a deal at any time, and because Congress was not expected to be in session all, or even most, of the time, it properly devolved on the executive.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Corwin, Edward S.
