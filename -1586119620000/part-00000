His father moved the family to [[Chicago]] in 1889 where Starrett attended [[John Marshall Metropolitan High School|John Marshall High School]].  \n\nStarrett landed a job as a cub reporter with the Chicago ''Inter-Ocean'' in 1905.  When that paper folded two years later he began working for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' as a crime reporter, a feature writer, and finally a war correspondent in [[Mexico]] from 1914 to 1915. Starrett turned to writing mystery and supernatural fiction for [[pulp magazine]]s during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn 1920, he wrote a [[Sherlock Holmes]] pastiche entitled \"The Adventure of the Unique 'Hamlet'\". Starrett on at least one occasion said that the press-run was 100 copies, but on others claimed 200; a study of surviving copies by Randall Stock documents 110.<ref>The plan had been to have half the press-run of 200 with the imprint of bookseller Walter M. Hill, and half with Starrett's imprint; the printer misunderstood the instructions and only 10 have Starrett's imprint.  Randall Stock has done a census of surviving copies.([http://www.bestofsherlock.com/unique-hamlet.htm The Unique Hamlet by Vincent Starrett: A First Edition Census]) He located one unbound and nine bound copies with the Starrett imprint, and 41 copies (with a possible 4 copies of unknown location) with the Hill imprint.  Stock believes that the press run was 100 plus 10, and the number of surviving copies seems to confirm that number.</ref> This story involved the detective investigating a missing 1604 inscribed edition of Shakespeare's play 'Hamlet.''<ref>Included in ''The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'' collection.</ref> \n\nStarrett's most famous work, ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (book)|The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'', was published in 1933.  Following that, Starrett wrote a book column, \"Books Alive,\" for ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''. He retired after 25 years of the column in 1967.  Starrett was one of the founders of The Hounds of the Baskerville (sic), a Chicago chapter of [[The Baker Street Irregulars]].\n\nStarrett's horror/fantasy stories were written primarily for the pulp magazine ''Weird Tales'', and are collected in ''The Quick and the Dead,'' (Arkham House, 1965). His story \"Penelope,\" published in the May 1923 issue of ''Weird Tales'', was also featured in the anthology ''The Moon Terror'' (1927) anonymously edited by [[Farnsworth Wright]], and published by the magazine.\n\nStarrett's other writing included poetry, collected in ''Autolycus in Limbo,'' (Dutton, 1943), detective novels, such as ''Murder on 'B' Deck,'' (Doubleday, 1929, and others). \n\nHe had also created his own detective character, Chicago sleuth Jimmie Lavender, whose adventures usually first appeared in the pulp magazine ''Short Stories''. The name Jimmie Lavender was that of an actual pitcher for the Chicago Cubs; Starrett wrote to ask the ball player for permission to use his name for a [[gentleman detective]], which the pitcher granted. The stories are collected in ''The Case Book of Jimmie Lavender'' (Gold Label, 1944).\n\nStarrett was a major enthusiast of Welsh writer [[Arthur Machen]] and was instrumental in bringing Machen's work to an American audience for the first time.\n\nA complete edition of Starrett's works is being published by [[George Vanderburgh]]'s [[Battered Silicon Dispatch Box]], a print-on-demand publisher, with 22 of a projected 25 volumes already in print. A publication in the Vincent Starrett Memorial Library is ''Sherlock Alive'', compiled and edited by Karen Murdock, and first printed in August of 2010.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Brian Fair Berkey. There is  an unrated version that runs 3 minutes longer than the theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around a perpetual loser and slacker named Richter Boudreau ([[Eric Stoltz]]). Richter is from a privileged background in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] and works as a movie reviewer at a local newspaper only because his sour mother Cynthia ([[Mary Tyler Moore]]) pulled strings for him to land the job. He is dissatisfied with the direction that his life has taken; his girlfriend Trudy ([[Cameron Diaz]]) breaks up with him in the opening scene after another disastrous date, he is about to be fired any day from his job because he can't meet deadlines, he lives in a dilapidated farmhouse, he uses and sells drugs behind the scenes for some extra cash, and he is so irresponsible with life in which he has gotten so far behind on his bills that his electricity has just been cut off.\n\nRichter also owes money to Ronnie Stover ([[James Spader]]), an abusive drug dealer who he deals with. Ronnie is married to Vicky ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), a beautiful woman who was disowned by her socially prominent family for her involvement with Ronnie. Richter is still in love with Vicky despite having ended their relationship many years before. Vicky is the sister of Keith ([[Michael Rooker]]), a [[misogynistic]] [[alcoholic]] whose large inheritance fails to soothe his anger, loneliness, and [[Clinical depression|depression]]. Cherry ([[Joanna Going]]) is an [[exotic dancer]] from [[Chicago]] who buys drugs from Ronnie and gets romantically involved with Richter.\n\nRonnie plans to [[blackmail]] Bedford Shaw ([[Marco Perella]]), the son of a socially prominent businessman named Harmon Shaw ([[James Coburn]]), after Cherry tells him that Shaw murdered her friend, a [[stripper]]/[[prostitute]], in a motel room and that she took photographs.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Brian Fair Berkey. There is  an unrated version that runs 3 minutes longer than the theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around a perpetual loser and slacker named Richter Boudreau ([[Eric Stoltz]]). Richter is from a privileged background in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] and works as a movie reviewer at a local newspaper only because his sour mother Cynthia ([[Mary Tyler Moore]]) pulled strings for him to land the job. He is dissatisfied with the direction that his life has taken; his girlfriend Trudy ([[Cameron Diaz]]) breaks up with him in the opening scene after another disastrous date, he is about to be fired any day from his job because he can't meet deadlines, he lives in a dilapidated farmhouse, he uses and sells drugs behind the scenes for some extra cash, and he is so irresponsible with life in which he has gotten so far behind on his bills that his electricity has just been cut off.\n\nRichter also owes money to Ronnie Stover ([[James Spader]]), an abusive drug dealer who he deals with. Ronnie is married to Vicky ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), a beautiful woman who was disowned by her socially prominent family for her involvement with Ronnie. Richter is still in love with Vicky despite having ended their relationship many years before. Vicky is the sister of Keith ([[Michael Rooker]]), a [[misogynistic]] [[alcoholic]] whose large inheritance fails to soothe his anger, loneliness, and [[Clinical depression|depression]]. Cherry ([[Joanna Going]]) is an [[exotic dancer]] from [[Chicago]] who buys drugs from Ronnie and gets romantically involved with Richter.\n\nRonnie plans to [[blackmail]] Bedford Shaw ([[Marco Perella]]), the son of a socially prominent businessman named Harmon Shaw ([[James Coburn]]), after Cherry tells him that Shaw murdered her friend, a [[stripper]]/[[prostitute]], in a motel room and that she took photographs. Ronnie attempts to involve Richter by having him hold on to a mysterious black pouch and by exploiting Richter's newspaper connections. Richter wants no part of the blackmail scheme. But he gets in over his head when Keith discovers that Richter has been sleeping with Vicky.\n\n==Principal Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n! Actor !!

In 1754, a land grant was issued to James Kuykendall of [[Holland]] in the locale known as Dutchman's Creek. Later in 1838, a post office in the area was named Woodlawn. In 1875, the name of the town was changed to Mount Holly, after the Mount Holly Cotton Mill that was started that year. The name \"Mount Holly\" was used in recognition of the famed yarn made at a spinning mill in [[Mount Holly, New Jersey]].\n\nA.P. and D.E. Rhyne and Ambrose Costner originally owned the [[Mount Holly Cotton Mill]]. It was the fourth mill to be built in Gaston County and is the oldest surviving mill today. The mill's success and the prosperity of the area as a whole led local residents to petition the North Carolina General Assembly for incorporation of Mount Holly in 1879.\n\nThe first railroad in Gaston County, the Carolina Central Railway, began serving Mount Holly in 1860. The line, which runs parallel with [[North Carolina State Highway 27]], is still in service and operated by [[CSX]]. In 1911, construction began on the area's second railroad, the [[Piedmont and Northern Railway]]. On May 20, 1912, it made its first run from Charlotte to Gastonia.\n\nElectricity became available to homes and businesses around the turn of the twentieth century. The Woodlawn Mill, located on Woodlawn Avenue, was built in 1906 and was the first mill in Gaston County to be served with electricity.<ref name=\"city\">[http://www.mtholly.us City of Mount Holly Website]  Retrieved on 2008-07-04.</ref>\n\nThe [[Downtown Mount Holly Historic District]] and [[Mount Holly Cotton Mill]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref><ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20120504.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2012-05-04|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 4/23/12 through 4/27/12|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 472\n|1900= 630\n|1910= 526\n|1920= 1160\n|1930= 2254\n|1940= 2055\n|1950= 2241\n|1960= 4037\n|1970= 5107\n|1980= 4530\n|1990= 7710\n|2000= 9618\n|2010= 13656\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=16135\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103123943/https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk|archive-date=November 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 9,618 people, 4,028 households, and 2,658 families residing in the city.

In 1754, a land grant was issued to James Kuykendall of [[Holland]] in the locale known as Dutchman's Creek. Later in 1838, a post office in the area was named Woodlawn. In 1875, the name of the town was changed to Mount Holly, after the Mount Holly Cotton Mill that was started that year. The name \"Mount Holly\" was used in recognition of the famed yarn made at a spinning mill in [[Mount Holly, New Jersey]].\n\nA.P. and D.E. Rhyne and Ambrose Costner originally owned the [[Mount Holly Cotton Mill]]. It was the fourth mill to be built in Gaston County and is the oldest surviving mill today. The mill's success and the prosperity of the area as a whole led local residents to petition the North Carolina General Assembly for incorporation of Mount Holly in 1879.\n\nThe first railroad in Gaston County, the Carolina Central Railway, began serving Mount Holly in 1860. The line, which runs parallel with [[North Carolina State Highway 27]], is still in service and operated by [[CSX]]. In 1911, construction began on the area's second railroad, the [[Piedmont and Northern Railway]]. On May 20, 1912, it made its first run from Charlotte to Gastonia.\n\nElectricity became available to homes and businesses around the turn of the twentieth century. The Woodlawn Mill, located on Woodlawn Avenue, was built in 1906 and was the first mill in Gaston County to be served with electricity.<ref name=\"city\">[http://www.mtholly.us City of Mount Holly Website]  Retrieved on 2008-07-04.</ref>\n\nThe [[Downtown Mount Holly Historic District]] and [[Mount Holly Cotton Mill]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref><ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20120504.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2012-05-04|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 4/23/12 through 4/27/12|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 472\n|1900= 630\n|1910= 526\n|1920= 1160\n|1930= 2254\n|1940= 2055\n|1950= 2241\n|1960= 4037\n|1970= 5107\n|1980= 4530\n|1990= 7710\n|2000= 9618\n|2010= 13656\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=16135\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103123943/https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk|archive-date=November 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 9,618 people, 4,028 households, and 2,658 families residing in the city.
