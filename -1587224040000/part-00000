These payments are variable in amount, proportional with the capital receiver's income, and may never total the initial investment amount made the capital provider.

However, the program was eventually abandoned as a failure.<ref>\"Yale to Erase Alumni Debts In 2 Loan Plans\", ''The New York Times'', April 13, 1999</ref>  Other attempts to use human capital contracts (or student loans with equity-like payoffs) to fund students, have also generally failed because of severe [[adverse selection]] problems\u2014students who opt into such programs are generally those who expect to pursue low-income careers, and are least likely to be able to repay their loans.  In addition, human capital contracts, like income taxes, can contribute to moral hazard, by discouraging borrowers from maximizing their income and encouraging them instead to focus on non-wage based forms of compensation, such as more enjoyable work, better benefits, or lighter schedules.<ref name = Simkovic>Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2012)</ref>\n\nRecently, a number of companies have begun to attempt to commercially underwrite human capital contracts for the first time, including some that are not focused on funding a student population.<ref>http://www.frugaltopia.com/education/a-new-kind-of-student-loan/</ref><ref>http://www.cumulusfunding.com/resources/</ref>\n\nAnand Reddi and Andreas Thyssen, of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, proposed the use of human capital contracts to fund U.S. medical education in their article in ''The Huffington Post'' entitled \"Healthcare Reform: Solving the Medical Student Debt Crisis Through Human Capital Contracts\".<ref>\"[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi/healthcare-reform-solving_b_874651.html Healthcare Reform: Solving the Medical Student Debt Crisis Through Human Capital Contracts]\" By Anand Reddi and Andreas Thyssen, ''The Huffington Post'', June 10, 2011</ref>  The Reddi-Thyssen plan is being vetted by the American Medical Association.
