After the battle at Luoyang the Uyghurs looted the city for three days and only stopped after large quantities of silk were extracted. For their aid, the Tang sent 20,000 rolls of silk and bestowed them with honorary titles.

The divine ruler Bogu Khan and all the elects of his retinue mounted on horses, and all the princes and the princesses led by those of high repute, the big and the small, the whole people, amidst great rejoicing proceeded to the gate of the city. And when the divine ruler had entered the city, he put the crown on his head... and sat upon the golden throne.\"|Uyghur-Manichean text.<ref name=\"Roemer editor 1984\"/>|source=}}\n\nAs conversion was based on political and economic concerns regarding trade with the Sogdians, it was driven by the rulers and often encountered resistance in lower societal strata. Furthermore, as the khaghan's political power depended on his ability to provide economically for his subjects, \"alliance with the Sogdians through adopting their religion was an important way of securing this objective.\"{{sfn|Sinor|1990}} Both the Sogdians and the Uyghurs benefited enormously from this alliance. The Sogdians enabled the Uyghurs to trade in the Western Regions and exchange silk from China for other goods. For the Sogdians it provided their Chinese trading communities with Uyghur protection. The 5th and 6th centuries saw a large emigration of Sogdians to China. The Sogdians were main traders along the Silk Roads, and China was always their biggest market. Among the paper clothing found in the [[Astana]] cemetery near [[Turfan]] is a list of taxes paid on caravan trade in the [[Gaochang]] kingdom in the 620s. The text is incomplete, but out of the 35 commercial operations it lists, 29 involve a Sogdian trader.<ref>{{cite web|last=de la Vaissi\u00e8re|first=\u00c9tienne|title=Sogdians in China: a short history and some new discoveries|url=http://silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/december/new_discoveries.htm}}</ref> Ultimately both rulers of nomadic origin and sedentary states recognized the importance of merchants like the Sogdians and made alliances to further their own agendas in controlling the Silk Roads.\n\n==Karabalghasun==\nThe Uyghurs created an empire with clear Persian influences, particularly in areas of government.{{sfn|Barfield|1992}} Soon after the empire was founded, they emulated sedentary states by establishing a permanent, settled capital, Karabalghasun ([[Ordu-Baliq]]), built on the site of the former [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks|G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]] imperial capital, northeast of the later Mongol capital, [[Karakorum]]. The city was a fully fortified commercial center, typical along the Silk Road, with concentric walls and lookout towers, stables, military and commercial stores, and administrative buildings.  Certain areas of the town were allotted for trade and handcrafts, while in the center of the town were palaces and temples, including a monastery. The palace had fortified walls and two main gates, as well as moats filled with water and watchtowers.\n\nThe khaghan maintained his court there and decided the policies of the empire. With no fixed settlement, the [[Xiongnu]] had been limited in their acquisition of Chinese goods to what they could carry. As stated by Thomas Barfield, \"the more goods a nomadic society acquired the less mobility it had, hence, at some point, one was more vulnerable trying to protect a rich treasure house by moving it than by fortifying it.\"{{sfn|Barfield|1992}} By building a fixed city, the Uyghurs created a protected storage space for trade goods from China.  They could hold a stable, fixed court, receive traders, and effectively cement their central role in Silk Road exchange.{{sfn|Barfield|1992}} However, the vulnerability that came with having a fixed city was to be the downfall of the Uyghurs.{{sfn|Sinor|1990}}\n\n==List of Uyghur Khagans==\nThe following list is based on Yihong Pan's \"Sui-Tang Foreign Policy: Four case studies\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Yihong|date=1990|title=Sui-Tang foreign policy: four case studies|language=en|doi=10.14288/1.0098752}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Personal Name\n!Turkic title\n!Chinese title\n!Reign\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Yibiaobi\n|[[Kutlug I Bilge Kagan|Qutlugh Bilge K\u00f6l Qaghan]]\n|Huairen Khagan (\u6000\u4ec1\u53ef\u6c57)\n|744-747\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Moyanchuo\n|[[Bayanchur Khan|Tengrida Bolmish El Etmish Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Yingwu Weiyuan Pijia Qaghan (\u82f1\u6b66\u5a01\u9060\u6bd7\u4f3d\u95d5\u53ef\u6c57)\n|747-759\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Yidijian\n|[[B\u00f6g\u00fc Qaghan|Tengrida Qut Bolmish El Tutmish Alp K\u00fcl\u00fcg Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Yingyi Qaghan (\u82f1\u7fa9\u53ef\u6c57)\n|759-780\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Dunmohe\n|[[Tun Baga Tarkhan|Alp Qutlugh Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Wuyi Chenggong Qaghan (\u6b66\u7fa9\u6210\u529f\u53ef\u6c57)\nChangshou Tianqin Qaghan (\u9577\u58fd\u5929\u89aa\u53ef\u6c57)\n|780-789\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Duoluosi\n|[[K\u00fcl\u00fcg Qaghan|Kulug Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Zhongzhen Qaghan (\u5fe0\u8c9e\u53ef\u6c57)\n|789-790\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Achuo\n|[[Qutluq Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Fengcheng Qaghan (\u5949\u8aa0\u53ef\u6c57)\n|790-795\n|-\n|Adie Guduolu, later\nYaoluoge Guduolu\n|[[Qutluq II|Ay Tengride Ulugh Bolmish Alp Qutluq K\u00fcl\u00fcg Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Huaixin Qaghan (\u61f7\u4fe1\u53ef\u6c57)\n|795-808\n|-\n|\n|[[Baoyi Qaghan|Ay Tengride Qut Bolmish Alp Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Baoyi Qaghan (\u4fdd\u7fa9\u53ef\u6c57)\n|808-821\n|-\n|\n|[[Chongde Qaghan|G\u00fcn Tengride Ulugh Bolmish K\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fcg Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Chonde Qaghan (\u5d07\u5fb7\u53ef\u6c57)\n|821-824\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Hesa\n|[[Zhaoli Qaghan|Ay Tengride Qut Bolmish Alp Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Zhaoli Qaghan (\u662d\u79ae\u53ef\u6c57)\n|824-833\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Hu\n|[[Zhangxin Qaghan|Ay Tengride Qut Bolmish Alp K\u00fcl\u00fcg Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Zhangxin Qaghan (\u5f70\u4fe1\u53ef\u6c57)\n|833-839\n|-\n|Jueluowu or\nYaoluoge Hesa\n|\n|[[Qasar Qaghan]] (\u354e\u99ba\u7279\u52d2)\n|839-840\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Wuxi\n|\n|[[Wujie Qaghan]] (\u70cf\u4ecb\u53ef\u6c57)\n|841-846\n|-\n|Yaoluoge E'nian\n|\n|[[Enian Qaghan]] (\u904f\u637b\u53ef\u6c57)\n|846-848\n|}\n\n==Images of Buddhist and Manichean Uyghurs==\nImages of Buddhist and Manichean Uyghurs from the Bezeklik caves and Mogao grottoes.\n\n{{gallery\n|lines=3\n|width=200\n|File:Uighur Prince.jpg|Uyghur Khagan\n|File:Dunhuang Uighur king.jpg|Uyghur king from Turfan, from the murals at the Dunhuang Mogao Caves.\n|File:Uighur woman from Bezeklik murals.jpg|Uyghur woman from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:UighurPrincess.png|Uyghur Princess.\n|File:Museum f\u00fcr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 064.jpg|Uyghur Princesses from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:Museum f\u00fcr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 063.jpg|Uyghur Princes from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:Uyghur Donors, 4th-century.jpg|Uyghur donors.\n|File:Uigure-bezeklik-17.jpg|Uyghur Prince from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:Uigure-bezeklik-19.jpg|Uyghur noble from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:Manichaean Temple Banner (MIK III 6283).jpg|Uyghur [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] Elect depicted on a temple banner from [[Qocho]].\n|File:ManichaeanElectaeKocho10thCentury.jpg|Uyghur Manichaean Electae (Chosen) from Qocho.\n|File:Museum f\u00fcr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 066.jpg|Uyghur Manichaean clergymen from Qocho.\n|File:Museum f\u00fcr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 061.jpg|[[Murals from the Nestorian temple at Qocho|Fresco of Palm Sunday from Qocho]].\n|File:Manicheans.jpg|Manichean scribes from Qocho\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries]]\n* [[History of Turkic people]]\n* [[History of the Uyghur people]]\n* [[An Lushan Rebellion]]\n* [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history]]\n* [[Guo Ziyi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last=Asimov|first=M.S.|year=1998|title=History of civilizations of Central Asia Volume IV The age of achievement: A.D. 750 to the end of the fifteenth century Part One The historical, social and economic setting|publisher=UNESCO Publishing}}\n*{{citation|last=Barfield|first=Thomas|title=The Perilous Frontier: Nomadic Empires and China|year=1989|publisher=Basil Blackwell}}\n*{{citation|last=Benson|first=Linda|title=China's last Nomads: the history and culture of China's Kazaks|year=1998|publisher=M.E.

Later that year a Uyghur-Karluk alliance formed against the Basmyls and defeated them. Their khagan was killed and the Basmyls ceased to exist as a people. Hostilities between the Uyghurs and Karluks then forced the Karluks to migrate west into [[Zhetysu]] and conflict with the [[Turgesh]], whom they defeated and conquered in 766.{{sfn|Sinor|1990|p=349}}\n\nThe Uyghur khagan's personal name was ''Qull\u0131\u011f Boyla'' (Guli Peiluo; {{zh|t=\u9aa8\u529b\u88f4\u7f85}}). He took the title ''[[Kutlug I Bilge Kagan|Qutlugh Bilge K\u00f6l Kaghan]]'' \"Glorious, wise, mighty kaghan\", claiming to be the supreme ruler of all the tribes. He built his capital at [[Ordu-Baliq]].

After building a number of trading outposts with the Tang, Bayanchur Khan used the profits to construct the capital, Ordu-Baliq, and another city further up the [[Selenga River]], [[Bai Baliq]]. The new khagan then embarked on a series of campaigns to bring all the steppe peoples under his banner. During this time the Empire expanded rapidly and brought the Sekiz Oghuz, Kyrgyz, Karluks, Turgesh, Toquz Tatars, Chiks and the remnants of the Basmyls under Uyghur rule.\n\nIn 755 [[An Lushan]] instigated a rebellion against the [[Tang dynasty]] and [[Emperor Suzong of Tang]] turned to Bayanchur Khan for assistance in 756. The khagan agreed and ordered his eldest son to provide military service to the Tang emperor. Approximately 4,000 Uyghur horsemen assisted Tang armies in retaking [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]] in 757. After the battle at Luoyang the Uyghurs looted the city for three days and only stopped after large quantities of silk were extracted. For their aid, the Tang sent 20,000 rolls of silk and bestowed them with honorary titles. In addition the horse trade was fixed at 40 rolls of silk for every horse and Uyghurs were given \"guest\" status while staying in Tang China.{{sfn|Sinor|1990|p=317\u2013342}}{{sfn|Barfield|1989|p=152}} The Tang and Uyghurs conducted an exchange marriage.

Bayanchur Khan destroyed several of their trading outposts before slaughtering a Kyrgyz army and executing their Khan.{{sfn|Barfield|1989|p=152}}\n\nIn 759 the Uyghurs attempted to assist the Tang in stamping out the rebels but failed.

The divine ruler Bogu Khan and all the elects of his retinue mounted on horses, and all the princes and the princesses led by those of high repute, the big and the small, the whole people, amidst great rejoicing proceeded to the gate of the city. And when the divine ruler had entered the city, he put the crown on his head... and sat upon the golden throne.\"|Uyghur-Manichean text.<ref name=\"Roemer editor 1984\"/>|source=}}\n\nAs conversion was based on political and economic concerns regarding trade with the Sogdians, it was driven by the rulers and often encountered resistance in lower societal strata. Furthermore, as the khaghan's political power depended on his ability to provide economically for his subjects, \"alliance with the Sogdians through adopting their religion was an important way of securing this objective.\"{{sfn|Sinor|1990}} Both the Sogdians and the Uyghurs benefited enormously from this alliance. The Sogdians enabled the Uyghurs to trade in the Western Regions and exchange silk from China for other goods. For the Sogdians it provided their Chinese trading communities with Uyghur protection. The 5th and 6th centuries saw a large emigration of Sogdians to China. The Sogdians were main traders along the Silk Roads, and China was always their biggest market. Among the paper clothing found in the [[Astana]] cemetery near [[Turfan]] is a list of taxes paid on caravan trade in the [[Gaochang]] kingdom in the 620s. The text is incomplete, but out of the 35 commercial operations it lists, 29 involve a Sogdian trader.<ref>{{cite web|last=de la Vaissi\u00e8re|first=\u00c9tienne|title=Sogdians in China: a short history and some new discoveries|url=http://silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/december/new_discoveries.htm}}</ref> Ultimately both rulers of nomadic origin and sedentary states recognized the importance of merchants like the Sogdians and made alliances to further their own agendas in controlling the Silk Roads.\n\n==Karabalghasun==\nThe Uyghurs created an empire with clear Persian influences, particularly in areas of government.{{sfn|Barfield|1992}} Soon after the empire was founded, they emulated sedentary states by establishing a permanent, settled capital, Karabalghasun ([[Ordu-Baliq]]), built on the site of the former [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks|G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]] imperial capital, northeast of the later Mongol capital, [[Karakorum]]. The city was a fully fortified commercial center, typical along the Silk Road, with concentric walls and lookout towers, stables, military and commercial stores, and administrative buildings.  Certain areas of the town were allotted for trade and handcrafts, while in the center of the town were palaces and temples, including a monastery. The palace had fortified walls and two main gates, as well as moats filled with water and watchtowers.\n\nThe khaghan maintained his court there and decided the policies of the empire. With no fixed settlement, the [[Xiongnu]] had been limited in their acquisition of Chinese goods to what they could carry. As stated by Thomas Barfield, \"the more goods a nomadic society acquired the less mobility it had, hence, at some point, one was more vulnerable trying to protect a rich treasure house by moving it than by fortifying it.\"{{sfn|Barfield|1992}} By building a fixed city, the Uyghurs created a protected storage space for trade goods from China.  They could hold a stable, fixed court, receive traders, and effectively cement their central role in Silk Road exchange.{{sfn|Barfield|1992}} However, the vulnerability that came with having a fixed city was to be the downfall of the Uyghurs.{{sfn|Sinor|1990}}\n\n==List of Uyghur Khagans==\nThe following list is based on Yihong Pan's \"Sui-Tang Foreign Policy: Four case studies\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Yihong|date=1990|title=Sui-Tang foreign policy: four case studies|language=en|doi=10.14288/1.0098752}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Personal Name\n!Turkic title\n!Chinese title\n!Reign\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Yibiaobi\n|[[Kutlug I Bilge Kagan|Qutlugh Bilge K\u00f6l Qaghan]]\n|Huairen Khagan (\u6000\u4ec1\u53ef\u6c57)\n|744-747\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Moyanchuo\n|[[Bayanchur Khan|Tengrida Bolmish El Etmish Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Yingwu Weiyuan Pijia Qaghan (\u82f1\u6b66\u5a01\u9060\u6bd7\u4f3d\u95d5\u53ef\u6c57)\n|747-759\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Yidijian\n|[[B\u00f6g\u00fc Qaghan|Tengrida Qut Bolmish El Tutmish Alp K\u00fcl\u00fcg Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Yingyi Qaghan (\u82f1\u7fa9\u53ef\u6c57)\n|759-780\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Dunmohe\n|[[Tun Baga Tarkhan|Alp Qutlugh Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Wuyi Chenggong Qaghan (\u6b66\u7fa9\u6210\u529f\u53ef\u6c57)\nChangshou Tianqin Qaghan (\u9577\u58fd\u5929\u89aa\u53ef\u6c57)\n|780-789\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Duoluosi\n|[[K\u00fcl\u00fcg Qaghan|Kulug Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Zhongzhen Qaghan (\u5fe0\u8c9e\u53ef\u6c57)\n|789-790\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Achuo\n|[[Qutluq Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Fengcheng Qaghan (\u5949\u8aa0\u53ef\u6c57)\n|790-795\n|-\n|Adie Guduolu, later\nYaoluoge Guduolu\n|[[Qutluq II|Ay Tengride Ulugh Bolmish Alp Qutluq K\u00fcl\u00fcg Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Huaixin Qaghan (\u61f7\u4fe1\u53ef\u6c57)\n|795-808\n|-\n|\n|[[Baoyi Qaghan|Ay Tengride Qut Bolmish Alp Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Baoyi Qaghan (\u4fdd\u7fa9\u53ef\u6c57)\n|808-821\n|-\n|\n|[[Chongde Qaghan|G\u00fcn Tengride Ulugh Bolmish K\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fcg Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Chonde Qaghan (\u5d07\u5fb7\u53ef\u6c57)\n|821-824\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Hesa\n|[[Zhaoli Qaghan|Ay Tengride Qut Bolmish Alp Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Zhaoli Qaghan (\u662d\u79ae\u53ef\u6c57)\n|824-833\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Hu\n|[[Zhangxin Qaghan|Ay Tengride Qut Bolmish Alp K\u00fcl\u00fcg Bilge Qaghan]]\n|Zhangxin Qaghan (\u5f70\u4fe1\u53ef\u6c57)\n|833-839\n|-\n|Jueluowu or\nYaoluoge Hesa\n|\n|[[Qasar Qaghan]] (\u354e\u99ba\u7279\u52d2)\n|839-840\n|-\n|Yaoluoge Wuxi\n|\n|[[Wujie Qaghan]] (\u70cf\u4ecb\u53ef\u6c57)\n|841-846\n|-\n|Yaoluoge E'nian\n|\n|[[Enian Qaghan]] (\u904f\u637b\u53ef\u6c57)\n|846-848\n|}\n\n==Images of Buddhist and Manichean Uyghurs==\nImages of Buddhist and Manichean Uyghurs from the Bezeklik caves and Mogao grottoes.\n\n{{gallery\n|lines=3\n|width=200\n|File:Uighur Prince.jpg|Uyghur Khagan\n|File:Dunhuang Uighur king.jpg|Uyghur king from Turfan, from the murals at the Dunhuang Mogao Caves.\n|File:Uighur woman from Bezeklik murals.jpg|Uyghur woman from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:UighurPrincess.png|Uyghur Princess.\n|File:Museum f\u00fcr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 064.jpg|Uyghur Princesses from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:Museum f\u00fcr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 063.jpg|Uyghur Princes from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:Uyghur Donors, 4th-century.jpg|Uyghur donors.\n|File:Uigure-bezeklik-17.jpg|Uyghur Prince from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:Uigure-bezeklik-19.jpg|Uyghur noble from the Bezeklik murals.\n|File:Manichaean Temple Banner (MIK III 6283).jpg|Uyghur [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] Elect depicted on a temple banner from [[Qocho]].\n|File:ManichaeanElectaeKocho10thCentury.jpg|Uyghur Manichaean Electae (Chosen) from Qocho.\n|File:Museum f\u00fcr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 066.jpg|Uyghur Manichaean clergymen from Qocho.\n|File:Museum f\u00fcr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 061.jpg|[[Murals from the Nestorian temple at Qocho|Fresco of Palm Sunday from Qocho]].\n|File:Manicheans.jpg|Manichean scribes from Qocho\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries]]\n* [[History of Turkic people]]\n* [[History of the Uyghur people]]\n* [[An Lushan Rebellion]]\n* [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history]]\n* [[Guo Ziyi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last=Asimov|first=M.S.|year=1998|title=History of civilizations of Central Asia Volume IV The age of achievement: A.D. 750 to the end of the fifteenth century Part One The historical, social and economic setting|publisher=UNESCO Publishing}}\n*{{citation|last=Barfield|first=Thomas|title=The Perilous Frontier: Nomadic Empires and China|year=1989|publisher=Basil Blackwell}}\n*{{citation|last=Benson|first=Linda|title=China's last Nomads: the history and culture of China's Kazaks|year=1998|publisher=M.E.

February 15, 1969, saw the first trip from [[Lindenwold, New Jersey]], to [[Center City, Philadelphia]]. The Speedline operates 24&nbsp;hours a day, one of only six U.S. rapid transit systems to do so (the others being the [[New York City Subway]], [[Staten Island Railway]], [[PATH (rail system)|PATH]], the [[Red Line (CTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (CTA)|Blue Lines]] of the [[Chicago \"L\"]], and the [[METRO Green Line|Green Line]] of the [[Metro (Minnesota)|Minneapolis-St. Paul Metro]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Philadelphia to Camden===\nThe modern-day PATCO Speedline follows the route of several historical mainline railroad lines, some dating back to the 19th century. These railroads all terminated in Camden, where passengers could catch ferries across the [[Delaware River]] to Philadelphia. Early in the 20th century, the idea of a fixed Delaware River crossing connecting Camden and Philadelphia gained traction, and in 1919, the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey formed the Delaware River Bridge Joint Commission to build a bridge between the two cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drpa.org/drpa/history.html|title=DRPA :: Delaware River Port Authority|work=drpa.org|access-date=June 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326225427/http://www.drpa.org/drpa/history.html|archive-date=March 26, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Delaware River Bridge (now [[Ben Franklin Bridge]]) was designed to accommodate rail as well as road traffic; when it opened on July 1, 1926, it had two outboard structures beside the main roadway for rail and space for two streetcar tracks (never installed) on the main road deck. Construction of the rail line did not actually begin until 1932, and the ''Bridge Line'' opened on June 7, 1936. Relatively short, it only had four stations: 8th Street and Franklin Square in Philadelphia (the latter currently closed) and City Hall and Broadway in Camden (connecting to the [[Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines]] at Broadway).\n\nIn Philadelphia, the line used a tunnel built in 1931 to serve both Ben Franklin Bridge trains and a [[Broad Street Line|Broad Street Subway]] spur designed to serve 8th and Market and the southern part of the city center via Locust Street. The tunnel, which replaced an earlier proposal for a downtown subway loop, extended under 8th to Locust, then under Locust to 16th, but as tracks were not laid beyond 8th and Market, the first Bridge Line trains did not run beyond 8th Street into the Locust Street Subway until February 10, 1952. This section is owned by the City of [[Philadelphia]] and leased by PATCO.<ref>{{cite web |title=DRPA-04-125 |url=http://www.drpa.org/publish/library/DRPA-04-125.pdf |last=DRPA |publisher=DRPA.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050114025234/http://drpa.org/publish/library/DRPA-04-125.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2005  }}</ref>\n\n===Extension to Lindenwold===\nAs soon as the Bridge Line entered service, the unserved neighboring communities in Southern New Jersey began requesting for extensions to the line so that those communities would also be served. To facilitate their construction, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania expanded the powers of the Delaware River Joint Commission, which owned the Ben Franklin Bridge and the New Jersey portion of the Bridge Line, rechristening it as the [[Delaware River Port Authority]] (DRPA) in 1951. The agency commissioned Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall and MacDonald (now Parsons Brinckerhoff) to study possible rapid transit services for South Jersey; Parsons, Brinckerhoff's final report recommended building a new tunnel under the Delaware and three lines in New Jersey. Route A would run to Moorestown, Route B to Kirkwood (now Lindenwold), and Route C to Woodbury Heights. A later study by Louis T. Klauder & Associates recommended using the Bridge Line instead to reach Philadelphia and suggested building Route B first, as it had the highest potential ridership.<ref>{{cite web |last=PATCO  |url=http://www.ridepatco.org/about/history.html |title=PATCO: A History of Commitment}}</ref>\n\nThe last [[Broad Street Line|Broad-Ridge Spur]] trains ran through the subway on August 23, 1968, when work began to convert the Locust Street and Camden subways for use by the new PATCO Speedline, which would use the Bridge Line subway to enter Philadelphia.

The original PATCO I cars were designed and manufactured by [[Budd Company|Budd]] of Philadelphia in 1968. Cars numbered 101-125 were single units, and cars numbered 201-250 were in permanently coupled [[married pair]]s.<ref name=\"Vigrass\">{{cite book |last=Vigrass |first=J. William |title=The Lindenwold Hi-Speed Line: The First Twenty Years of the Port Authority Transit Corporation |isbn=  |date=1990 |publisher=West Jersey Chapter, National Railway Historical Society |pages =   |asin=B0006EV7AW}}</ref> The PATCO II cars were delivered in 1980 (in parallel with the opening of the Woodcrest [[Park and ride]] facility) and consisted of married pairs numbered 251-296. The PATCO II cars were manufactured by [[Vickers Canada]] under a license from Budd, but are nearly indistinguishable from the PATCO I's, the only differences being that the PATCO II cars had a fixed partition behind the operator's booth and lack a stainless steel shroud below the door line to ease access to traction components.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nThe single units differed from the married pairs by having an extra single leaf door located behind each operators booth. This was installed before the fare collection system was finalized and there was a possibility of operators collecting fares on board during the late night hours.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe PATCO I cars were originally fitted with WABCO Model N-2 MU couplers. Because of reliability issues these were replaced by Tomlinson type couplers manufactured by [[Ohio Brass Company]]. The original electrical system in the PATCO I cars was found to have certain reliability issues and was completely rebuilt after the PATCO II cars arrived to the PATCO II standard.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nAs built, the PATCO cars used camshaft resistance type [[motor controller]]s common to DC powered rapid transit vehicles up through the 1980s. The unique whine of the motors and gear assemblies can lead many to mistake the cars for using [[thyristor drive]] or even a [[variable-frequency drive]], but this is not the case.  [[Bogie]]s are of the Budd designed Pioneer III variety and while lightweight, provide for a very bouncy ride. The married pair cars shared a single motor control unit and automatic operation box. Many PATCO Car design features also appeared in the [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M1/M3 class]] of MU railcars for the [[Long Island Rail Road]] which provides for a similar riding experience.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\n===Operation===\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=400\n|direction=horizontal\n|align=right\n|image1=PATCO 15-16 Locust.JPG\n|image2=PATCO1516LocustStation.JPG\n|footer=The [[15\u201316th & Locust station]] in Philadelphia, below ground (left) and exit onto street above (right)\n}}\nPATCO was one of the first transit systems to incorporate [[automatic train operation]] for regular service. The PATCO ATO is an analogue system that makes use of [[Pulse Code Cab Signaling|pulse code cab signaling]] supplied by [[Union Switch and Signal]]. The cab signals supply one of five different speeds ({{convert|20|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}, {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}, {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}, {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}} and {{convert|0|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the on-board ATO gear will supply maximum acceleration or maximum braking force to reach that target speed. The frequent use of such high acceleration and deceleration rates makes for a quick ride, yet one that can occasionally be perilous for non-seated passengers. Automatic station stops are handled by track mounted transponders and can be overridden by the operator for non-stopping trains.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe system suffers from problems handling slippery track conditions and human operators are required to take control in any sort of precipitation. Because of the ATO limitations, drivers must make one trip per day under manual operation to stay in practice and are not penalized for running their trains manually at any time of their choosing. In practice, most operators prefer automatic operation as not only is it less effort, but it also tends to result in faster trips.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe system was designed for [[OPTO|one person train operation]], also known as [[OPTO]] by exclusively utilizing [[island platforms]] and right-handed operation with operators sitting on the left side of the vehicle where they can open their window and monitor the boarding process. Where trains have to use the \"wrong\" side, mirrors are provided to give the operator a proper view. Prior to the rebuild, the operator was not isolated from the passenger cabin, instead being surrounded by a low partition. Operators wishing privacy could pull a curtain closed during operation, but were still on call to answer inquiries from passengers and when the booth was not in use, a lockable cover slid over the console controls. {{As of|2018}} all of the legacy vehicles have been rebuilt with modern controls and full width cabs.  The Operators are still responsible, opening and closing the doors, sounding the horn, starting the train from station stops and full manual operation of the train (when necessary).  The rebuild also replaced the manual announcements with automated announcements.\n\nTrains operate at a maximum of {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on}} on the surface portion of the system and {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on}} in the subway portion and over the bridge. Trains used to have a top speed of {{convert|75|mph|abbr=on}} on the surface portion, but this caused excessive wear on the traction motors and was cut back to {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on}} in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nPATCO runs the majority of its trains in 2-, 4- or 6-car configurations.  Before the Alstom rebuild, single-unit trains were occasionally seen late at night, while 3- or 5-car trains were encountered only when not enough cars are available to meet the load line.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />  All stations are capable of handling 7- or 8-car trains, but these lengths have never been run except for brief testing and for the annual holiday \"Santa Train\" special for children. In an effort to contain costs, PATCO actively manages its consist length as opposed to running trains in fixed sets. Train length is matched to the demand level for that particular time of day. In peak periods trains are 6 cars long, on \"shoulder\" periods they are 4 cars long, off peak they are 2 cars long, and overnight sometimes single units were run alone (this is no longer possible as the single units have since been converted into 2-car married pairs as part of the Alstom rebuild).<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />  Due to recent capital improvements, weekend and mid-day [[headway]]s have grown, prompting PATCO to run 4-car trains all day, albeit less frequently than the 2-car trains.\n\n===Cabin===\n[[Image:PATCO Budd-Interior.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Original 1968 PATCO car interior.]]\nPATCO maintained the same interior styling in its vehicles from their introduction in 1969 through the end of the rebuilding process in 2018 with the 1980 PATCO II cars receiving the exact same look. The color combination was a base of [[Cream (color)|cream]] with an [[avocado green]] fill. The rebuild replaced this with a grey and white interior with brighter fluorescent lighting.  Seating is a 2+2 arrangement, with half of the seats in each car facing the direction of travel, and half facing the opposite direction. Seats originally ran the full length of the car, with the front seats next to the operator's booth having the benefit of a large picture window. However, the newly refurbished cars now have full-width operator's cabs, resulting in the loss of four passenger seats, in addition to a number of folding longitudinal seats for ADA compliance.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nEach PATCO car has a pair of doors on each side with a foyer area inside the doors for [[standing passenger]]s. There are also hand-holds on all seat backs for standing passengers the entire length of the aisles. Car end-doors are unlocked, but inter-car movement is discouraged because of the extreme motions between cars. Interior cabs are halved to free up the space for passengers, however both cabs at the front and rear of any train are left in their full width configuration.\n\n====Refurbishment====\nPATCO announced plans for the complete refurbishment of the entire fleet with work expected to begin in 2009.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.sjmagazine.net/articles.aspx?aid=378 SJ Magazine Articles your South Jersey source<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The contract for rebuilding the rolling stock was awarded to [[Alstom]], at a cost of [[US dollar|$]]194.2 million, beating [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]]'s bid by $35 million, though Bombardier claimed the contract was incorrectly awarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trn.trains.com/Railroad%20News/News%20Wire/2010/11/Bombardier%20objects%20to%20Alstom-PATCO%20contract.aspx|title=Bombardier objects to Alstom-PATCO contract|publisher=Trains Magazine|date=November 23, 2010|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>  PATCO began to ship the railcars with their [[Bogie|trucks]] removed and replaced with highway tires for the road trip to the Alstom facility in [[Hornell, New York]], in March 2011.<ref name=comegno />\n\nThe refurbishment consisted of a completely new interior with more modern colors, wheelchair access and more reliable HVAC systems. The rollsigns were replaced with digital displays, and the cars received automated announcements. These changes reduced seating by eight seats, from 160 to 152. The refurbishment also saw the replacement of the propulsion and automatic train operation systems, which used technology last updated in the early 1980s; the camshaft resistance type motor controller was replaced by a new [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] unit using [[IGBT]]s and the relay based ATO unit was replaced by a computerized system. The General Electric DC motors, [[Pioneer III]] trucks and gearboxes were not replaced, but rebuilt by Alstom as well. Also, Alstom purchased many extra GE 1255 A2 motors from retired [[Metro-North Railroad]] M-1A's from a scrap dealer in Ohio, and rebuilt them to provide PATCO with extra DC motors for future replacement if needed, or required.\n\nThe first rebuilt cars were redelivered to PATCO's Lindenwold, New Jersey Shops on November 12, 2013, and were tested accordingly before going into service. Rebuilt cars are being renumbered into the 1000 series instead of their former numbers. The formerly single unit cars were converted into married-pair type cars instead of their former singles status, with the former single-leaf door behind the train operators position removed and sealed-off. The rebuilding is expected to extend the lives of these cars by 20 years, similar to the rebuilds received by many of the [[New York City Subway]]'s cars from [[R26 (New York City Subway car)|R26]]'s thru the [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]]'s. On May 28, 2015, after over a year and a half of exhaustive testing, and after a brief ceremony, along with a public unveiling for the rebuilt cars was held at the Woodcrest Station for all interested parties, passengers or persons alike, the first four (4) of the rebuilt cars (1095-6 & 1101-2, formerly or ex-295-6 and ex-101 and 102 the former single units respectively) were finally placed back into service, as Alstom has worked to iron-out most of the teething bugs and problems with the communications, automatic train control, propulsion, braking systems, and other bugs out of the sixteen redelivered cars during their 500 hours of extensive mandatory acceptance testing period, which these cars passed on December 16, 2014.<ref name=comegno>{{cite news|last1=Comegno|first1=Carol|title=New PATCO cars make first runs|url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/local/south-jersey/2015/05/28/commuters-inaugurate-new-patco-cars/28072013/|accessdate=May 29, 2015|work=Courier-Post|date=May 28, 2015}}</ref> The recorded announcements on the refurbished cars are provided by [[Bernie Wagenblast]].\n[[File:PATCO Refurb Interior.jpg|thumb|The interior of a rebuilt PATCO car.]]\n\nIn rebuilding these cars, PATCO and Alstom had struggled to incorporate new computer technology into the operational systems of these 46-year-old train cars, causing computer interface problems between PATCO's old 1969 DC technology, and Alstom's new 2014 AC technologies. Alstom will now proceed with the rebuilding of the remaining fleet of cars at a production and delivery rate of 4 to 6 cars per month until all cars have gone through this overhaul and rebuilding process.\n\nThe final run of the non-refurbished \"legacy\" trains took place on June 10, 2018, with a contest held for a rider to sit in the front row seat for the last time, something that is no longer possible with the refurbished trains. {{As of|2019|03|24|df=us}}, All 120 cars have  been overhauled and accepted back into service, except for one single car #116 which was damaged beyond repair by an arson fire back in 1997, and was thereby excluded from this overhaul, and rebuilding program.\n\n===Route identification===\nAs built, one of the six possible routes were displayed on a fluorescent lit piece of glass in the car. The text for the six routes were cut through a dark tinted piece of glass, the light behind the correct one identifying the train route. There were also rolling signs on the car ends and sides displaying this same route.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />  The routes were as follows, with the current three service designations in bold:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Local routes\n!Express routes\n|-\n|'''Lindenwold Local'''\n|Lindenwold Express\n|-\n|'''Philadelphia Local'''\n|'''Philadelphia Express'''\n|-\n|Woodcrest Local\n|\n|-\n|Ferry Avenue Local\n|\n|}\nAn additional sign (Special) was displayed when the train was not accepting passengers. The only currently operating express service is westbound from Lindenwold towards Philadelphia, which operates six times daily between 7:30 am \u2013 8:45 am, skipping only Haddonfield, Westmont, and Collingswood stations. (Unfortunately signage inside the cars indicates that express trains stop at Haddonfield.) There is currently no eastbound express service, and all eastbound trains terminate at Lindenwold, as opposed to terminating early at Ferry Avenue or Woodcrest.\n\nThe newly rehabilitated cars had all of their existing front and side signage removed and replaced with Luminator amber colored LED electronic signs.\n\n===Signaling===\n\nPATCO trains are governed by a [[Pulse code cab signaling]] system which transmits signal codes to the trains via the running rails. Wayside signals are located only at [[interlocking]]s and consist of two lamps on a single signal head: one lunar white, the other red. There are three typical signal indications; red for \"stop\", lunar white for \"proceed under cab signals on main route\" and flashing lunar white for \"proceed under cab signals on diverging route\". Historically, a green signal was provided to indicate a clear track to the next interlocking (absolute block), but these were eliminated as reverse direction cab signaling was installed.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" /> A yellow signal also existed east of 8th and Market to indicate a route lined for the SEPTA Broad Ridge Spur, but this was removed along with the connection in the late 1990s.\n\nThere are 5 cab signals, each corresponding to a speed. The cab signals are displayed to the operator via a series of 5 lamps above the [[speedometer]], red for Stop, yellow/red for 20&nbsp;mph, yellow for 30&nbsp;mph, yellow/green for 40&nbsp;mph and green for 65&nbsp;mph. These lamps correspond to the same cab signals in use by various [[NORAC|northeastern railroads]]. Even when the Automatic Train Operation System is not in use, the cab signal speed control function is still enabled and if an operator goes above the permitted speed, the power is cut and the brakes are applied until the speed is back within the limit.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe entire PATCO system is run from Center Tower, centrally located above a substation near the [[Walter Rand Transportation Center|Broadway station]] in [[Camden, NJ]]. Center Tower is staffed by two operators at peak periods and a single operator otherwise. Wayside signals are marked with their corresponding lever in the old US&S fashion with R signals indicating a \"right\" lever motion and L signals indicating \"left\".<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />  Signals and switches are numbered in ascending order from west to east with 15th/16th Locust using levers 1-4 and Lindenwold using levers 73-76. The interlocking at Woodcrest, which was added in 1980, uses levers 87-98.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe following fixed signs are also present on PATCO:\n* '''H''' - Sound Horn\n* '''T''' - Trigger Sign - Station stop outer transponder, trains not stopping must cancel automatic stop.\n* '''AB''' - Approach block, trains operating without cab signals prepare to stop.\n* '''Speed X mph''' - Speed limit sign in tunnel section and bridge.\n* '''Clear #''' - Train of # car lengths has cleared sharp curve.\n\nIn case of a cab signal failure or the need to disregard them, the cab signal may be cut out by the operator with permission from Center Tower.\n\n===Power===\nAll PATCO trains are electrically powered. Power comes from a top contact covered [[third rail]] at 750 V [[Direct current|DC]]. There are two feeds from the commercial power grid, one located in Philadelphia from [[PECO Energy]] for the old Bridge Line tunnel segments and the other in New Jersey from [[PSE&G]] for the new mainline segments. In New Jersey power is distributed via wayside AC transmission lines in the 26.4 kV range and a series of 7 substations, located approximately every {{convert|2|mi|km}}, transform and rectify the current to the 750 V DC used in the third rail.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\n==Fare collection==\n\n===Magnetic system===\nFrom its beginning in 1969, PATCO used a magnetic ticket as the sole means of collecting fares. The plastic tickets may still be bought for single rides through vending machines in the stations. These machines once required coins, so [[bill changer]]s were placed in stations. Each [[vending machine]] was capable of selling two types of tickets, which the rider chose by pushing a button after inserting the correct fare. Several machines were needed in each station, since different types of one-way and two-way tickets needed to be sold. After the ticket was purchased, it was inserted through a [[turnstile]] gate. To exit the station, it was inserted again, and if it had rides remaining, returned to the rider. A ticket with no rides was re-encoded by the system and returned to use in the vending machine. Tickets could also be purchased in ten-trip passes, but these were obtained through mail or in an office.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nAt its inception, this system was state-of-the-art, but became more problematic as the years went on. Tickets were vulnerable to damage from magnetic sources such as [[cell phone]]s and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] that did not exist when the system was put in place, and the equipment to read and code the farecards began to suffer from extreme reliability problems as well as replacement part availability.\n\n===Freedom system===\n{{main|Freedom Card}}\nIn July 2006, PATCO announced that it would start the transition from a magnetic ticket fare system to an electronic [[smart card]] system. Magnetic tickets are still sold, for the occasional riders, however they are now in a paper form. The new computer vending machines allow more advanced purchasing options for Freedom Cards (the term used for the smart cards). Payment can now be in the form of coins, bills, [[credit cards]], or [[debit cards]]; however, credit and debit cards can only be used to load fare onto a Freedom Card or purchase a new card. PATCO has a system that allows balances to be reloaded on the [[Internet]].\n\nEach fare machine in the unpaid areas (i.e. outside the gates) performs all transactions (except for [[SEPTA]] transfers in PA stations, as the transfers are only sold on the unpaid side of NJ stations). Also, to augment the call-for-aid phones, there are now exit fare machines located inside of the fare gates, so that if a rider has purchased the wrong fare, they may pay the remaining fare to exit.\n\nThe system has been in use by the general public at all PATCO stations since its launch in 2007.\n\nThe system was put into effect in an attempt to gain ridership, which had fallen sharply since its peak in 1990.<ref name=\"autogenerated1-1\">[http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/nj/20081016_PATCO_ridership_hits_7-year_high.html?text=reg&c=y \"PATCO ridership hits 7-year high\"] by Paul Nussbaum, ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', October 16, 2008. Retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref> The system was designed, built and integrated by [[Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc.]]<ref name=\"post1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060711/BUSINESS/607110326 |title=Card makes change for PATCO riders |first=Eileen |last=Stilwell |publisher=Courier-Post |date=July 11, 2006 |access-date=July 11, 2006}}.</ref>\n\nBecause of the system's flexibility, it could eventually be used on the SEPTA and RiverLine rail networks, allowing an integration of the systems.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBecause the smart cards store value (instead of \"rides\") and the paper tickets expire after three days, it is no longer possible to hoard \"rides\" in advance of a fare increase. Also, the combination of the contactless card payment and the new swinging fare gates have decreased turnstile throughput, resulting in long exit queues after a train discharges a load of passengers at a station.\n\n===Open payment===\nIn September 2011 PATCO started Phase One of a pilot program for a new form of open payment called PATCO Wave And Pay Anywhere. Phase One allowed for a PATCO-branded [[Credit card#Prepaid cards|prepaid]] [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] card. The card was also put in by CUBIC Transportation Systems. It required a $6.00 balance to travel on PATCO. The card works the same as the Freedom Card except it could be used at any location that accepts Visa.\n\nIn April 2012, Phase Two of this open payment system was initiated. This phase allowed for station gates and parking terminals to accept other forms of [[contactless payment]] systems in use by Visa, MasterCard, or Discover. In addition to credit cards with the technology built in, the system also accepted [[Near field communication]] virtual wallet payment methods such as [[Google Wallet]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.contactlessnews.com/2012/04/03/patco-rolls-into-new-phase-of-open-payment-system | title = PATCO rolls into new phase of open payment system | accessdate = July 17, 2012 | author = ContactlessNews | date = April 3, 2012 | publisher = ContactlessNews}}</ref> This pilot program ended in October 2012.

The New Jersey Transit [[Atlantic City Line]] also stops at Lindenwold Station, and the [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] connects at Broadway Station ([[Walter Rand Transportation Center]]).\n\n===SEPTA connections===\nThe [[SEPTA]] (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority) [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] connects to PATCO at the [[8th Street (SEPTA station)|8th & Market Station]], which is two blocks away from SEPTA's [[Jefferson Station (Philadelphia)|Jefferson Station]], where all [[Cynwyd Line|but one]] of SEPTA's regional trains stop.\n\nSEPTA's [[Broad Street Line]] connects to PATCO at the [[Walnut\u2013Locust (SEPTA station)|Walnut\u2013Locust]] station via a short underground walkway to PATCO's 12th-13th & Locust, and 15-16th & Locust stations. The [[Broad-Ridge Spur]] connects to PATCO at the 8th & Market Station via a pedestrian walkway.\n\nFormerly, a special \"SEPTA Transfer\" ticket could be purchased from the unpaid side of any New Jersey station. These tickets were sold for $3.50 ($1.75 per ride, a savings compared to a single $2.25 cash fare or a token for $2.00) and dispensed two paper receipts, one good for a ride within one hour of the time of purchase and another good for a ride within 24 hours of the time of purchase. Originally, both transfers were going to be valid for 24 hours, however, PATCO changed the time limit to prevent the unauthorized sale of PATCO transfers at Pennsylvania stations.\n\nWith the release of [[SEPTA Key]], a new type of Freedom card is now required to purchase a transfer to the SEPTA system. The cost of a transfer is $2 with this system and it is debited directly from an account based Freedom Card account, provided a new Freedom Share card is used, which is compatible with both PATCO Freedom and SEPTA Key card systems.\n\n==Station list==\nSome westbound trains skip [[Collingswood station|Collingswood]], [[Westmont (PATCO station)|Westmont]], and [[Haddonfield

February 15, 1969, saw the first trip from [[Lindenwold, New Jersey]], to [[Center City, Philadelphia]]. The Speedline operates 24&nbsp;hours a day, one of only six U.S. rapid transit systems to do so (the others being the [[New York City Subway]], [[Staten Island Railway]], [[PATH (rail system)|PATH]], the [[Red Line (CTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (CTA)|Blue Lines]] of the [[Chicago \"L\"]], and the [[METRO Green Line|Green Line]] of the [[Metro (Minnesota)|Minneapolis-St. Paul Metro]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Philadelphia to Camden===\nThe modern-day PATCO Speedline follows the route of several historical mainline railroad lines, some dating back to the 19th century. These railroads all terminated in Camden, where passengers could catch ferries across the [[Delaware River]] to Philadelphia. Early in the 20th century, the idea of a fixed Delaware River crossing connecting Camden and Philadelphia gained traction, and in 1919, the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey formed the Delaware River Bridge Joint Commission to build a bridge between the two cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drpa.org/drpa/history.html|title=DRPA :: Delaware River Port Authority|work=drpa.org|access-date=June 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326225427/http://www.drpa.org/drpa/history.html|archive-date=March 26, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Delaware River Bridge (now [[Ben Franklin Bridge]]) was designed to accommodate rail as well as road traffic; when it opened on July 1, 1926, it had two outboard structures beside the main roadway for rail and space for two streetcar tracks (never installed) on the main road deck. Construction of the rail line did not actually begin until 1932, and the ''Bridge Line'' opened on June 7, 1936. Relatively short, it only had four stations: 8th Street and Franklin Square in Philadelphia (the latter currently closed) and City Hall and Broadway in Camden (connecting to the [[Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines]] at Broadway).\n\nIn Philadelphia, the line used a tunnel built in 1931 to serve both Ben Franklin Bridge trains and a [[Broad Street Line|Broad Street Subway]] spur designed to serve 8th and Market and the southern part of the city center via Locust Street. The tunnel, which replaced an earlier proposal for a downtown subway loop, extended under 8th to Locust, then under Locust to 16th, but as tracks were not laid beyond 8th and Market, the first Bridge Line trains did not run beyond 8th Street into the Locust Street Subway until February 10, 1952.

To facilitate their construction, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania expanded the powers of the Delaware River Joint Commission, which owned the Ben Franklin Bridge and the New Jersey portion of the Bridge Line, rechristening it as the [[Delaware River Port Authority]] (DRPA) in 1951. The agency commissioned Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall and MacDonald (now Parsons Brinckerhoff) to study possible rapid transit services for South Jersey; Parsons, Brinckerhoff's final report recommended building a new tunnel under the Delaware and three lines in New Jersey. Route A would run to Moorestown, Route B to Kirkwood (now Lindenwold), and Route C to Woodbury Heights. A later study by Louis T. Klauder & Associates recommended using the Bridge Line instead to reach Philadelphia and suggested building Route B first, as it had the highest potential ridership.<ref>{{cite web |last=PATCO  |url=http://www.ridepatco.org/about/history.html |title=PATCO: A History of Commitment}}</ref>\n\nThe last [[Broad Street Line|Broad-Ridge Spur]] trains ran through the subway on August 23, 1968, when work began to convert the Locust Street and Camden subways for use by the new PATCO Speedline, which would use the Bridge Line subway to enter Philadelphia.

The original PATCO I cars were designed and manufactured by [[Budd Company|Budd]] of Philadelphia in 1968. Cars numbered 101-125 were single units, and cars numbered 201-250 were in permanently coupled [[married pair]]s.<ref name=\"Vigrass\">{{cite book |last=Vigrass |first=J. William |title=The Lindenwold Hi-Speed Line: The First Twenty Years of the Port Authority Transit Corporation |isbn=  |date=1990 |publisher=West Jersey Chapter, National Railway Historical Society |pages =   |asin=B0006EV7AW}}</ref> The PATCO II cars were delivered in 1980 (in parallel with the opening of the Woodcrest [[Park and ride]] facility) and consisted of married pairs numbered 251-296. The PATCO II cars were manufactured by [[Vickers Canada]] under a license from Budd, but are nearly indistinguishable from the PATCO I's, the only differences being that the PATCO II cars had a fixed partition behind the operator's booth and lack a stainless steel shroud below the door line to ease access to traction components.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nThe single units differed from the married pairs by having an extra single leaf door located behind each operators booth. This was installed before the fare collection system was finalized and there was a possibility of operators collecting fares on board during the late night hours.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe PATCO I cars were originally fitted with WABCO Model N-2 MU couplers. Because of reliability issues these were replaced by Tomlinson type couplers manufactured by [[Ohio Brass Company]]. The original electrical system in the PATCO I cars was found to have certain reliability issues and was completely rebuilt after the PATCO II cars arrived to the PATCO II standard.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nAs built, the PATCO cars used camshaft resistance type [[motor controller]]s common to DC powered rapid transit vehicles up through the 1980s. The unique whine of the motors and gear assemblies can lead many to mistake the cars for using [[thyristor drive]] or even a [[variable-frequency drive]], but this is not the case.  [[Bogie]]s are of the Budd designed Pioneer III variety and while lightweight, provide for a very bouncy ride. The married pair cars shared a single motor control unit and automatic operation box. Many PATCO Car design features also appeared in the [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M1/M3 class]] of MU railcars for the [[Long Island Rail Road]] which provides for a similar riding experience.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\n===Operation===\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=400\n|direction=horizontal\n|align=right\n|image1=PATCO 15-16 Locust.JPG\n|image2=PATCO1516LocustStation.JPG\n|footer=The [[15\u201316th & Locust station]] in Philadelphia, below ground (left) and exit onto street above (right)\n}}\nPATCO was one of the first transit systems to incorporate [[automatic train operation]] for regular service. The PATCO ATO is an analogue system that makes use of [[Pulse Code Cab Signaling|pulse code cab signaling]] supplied by [[Union Switch and Signal]]. The cab signals supply one of five different speeds ({{convert|20|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}, {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}, {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}, {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}} and {{convert|0|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the on-board ATO gear will supply maximum acceleration or maximum braking force to reach that target speed. The frequent use of such high acceleration and deceleration rates makes for a quick ride, yet one that can occasionally be perilous for non-seated passengers. Automatic station stops are handled by track mounted transponders and can be overridden by the operator for non-stopping trains.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe system suffers from problems handling slippery track conditions and human operators are required to take control in any sort of precipitation. Because of the ATO limitations, drivers must make one trip per day under manual operation to stay in practice and are not penalized for running their trains manually at any time of their choosing. In practice, most operators prefer automatic operation as not only is it less effort, but it also tends to result in faster trips.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe system was designed for [[OPTO|one person train operation]], also known as [[OPTO]] by exclusively utilizing [[island platforms]] and right-handed operation with operators sitting on the left side of the vehicle where they can open their window and monitor the boarding process. Where trains have to use the \"wrong\" side, mirrors are provided to give the operator a proper view. Prior to the rebuild, the operator was not isolated from the passenger cabin, instead being surrounded by a low partition. Operators wishing privacy could pull a curtain closed during operation, but were still on call to answer inquiries from passengers and when the booth was not in use, a lockable cover slid over the console controls. {{As of|2018}} all of the legacy vehicles have been rebuilt with modern controls and full width cabs.  The Operators are still responsible, opening and closing the doors, sounding the horn, starting the train from station stops and full manual operation of the train (when necessary).  The rebuild also replaced the manual announcements with automated announcements.\n\nTrains operate at a maximum of {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on}} on the surface portion of the system and {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on}} in the subway portion and over the bridge. Trains used to have a top speed of {{convert|75|mph|abbr=on}} on the surface portion, but this caused excessive wear on the traction motors and was cut back to {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on}} in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nPATCO runs the majority of its trains in 2-, 4- or 6-car configurations.  Before the Alstom rebuild, single-unit trains were occasionally seen late at night, while 3- or 5-car trains were encountered only when not enough cars are available to meet the load line.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />  All stations are capable of handling 7- or 8-car trains, but these lengths have never been run except for brief testing and for the annual holiday \"Santa Train\" special for children. In an effort to contain costs, PATCO actively manages its consist length as opposed to running trains in fixed sets. Train length is matched to the demand level for that particular time of day. In peak periods trains are 6 cars long, on \"shoulder\" periods they are 4 cars long, off peak they are 2 cars long, and overnight sometimes single units were run alone (this is no longer possible as the single units have since been converted into 2-car married pairs as part of the Alstom rebuild).<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />  Due to recent capital improvements, weekend and mid-day [[headway]]s have grown, prompting PATCO to run 4-car trains all day, albeit less frequently than the 2-car trains.\n\n===Cabin===\n[[Image:PATCO Budd-Interior.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Original 1968 PATCO car interior.]]\nPATCO maintained the same interior styling in its vehicles from their introduction in 1969 through the end of the rebuilding process in 2018 with the 1980 PATCO II cars receiving the exact same look. The color combination was a base of [[Cream (color)|cream]] with an [[avocado green]] fill. The rebuild replaced this with a grey and white interior with brighter fluorescent lighting.  Seating is a 2+2 arrangement, with half of the seats in each car facing the direction of travel, and half facing the opposite direction. Seats originally ran the full length of the car, with the front seats next to the operator's booth having the benefit of a large picture window. However, the newly refurbished cars now have full-width operator's cabs, resulting in the loss of four passenger seats, in addition to a number of folding longitudinal seats for ADA compliance.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nEach PATCO car has a pair of doors on each side with a foyer area inside the doors for [[standing passenger]]s. There are also hand-holds on all seat backs for standing passengers the entire length of the aisles. Car end-doors are unlocked, but inter-car movement is discouraged because of the extreme motions between cars. Interior cabs are halved to free up the space for passengers, however both cabs at the front and rear of any train are left in their full width configuration.\n\n====Refurbishment====\nPATCO announced plans for the complete refurbishment of the entire fleet with work expected to begin in 2009.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.sjmagazine.net/articles.aspx?aid=378 SJ Magazine Articles your South Jersey source<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The contract for rebuilding the rolling stock was awarded to [[Alstom]], at a cost of [[US dollar|$]]194.2 million, beating [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]]'s bid by $35 million, though Bombardier claimed the contract was incorrectly awarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trn.trains.com/Railroad%20News/News%20Wire/2010/11/Bombardier%20objects%20to%20Alstom-PATCO%20contract.aspx|title=Bombardier objects to Alstom-PATCO contract|publisher=Trains Magazine|date=November 23, 2010|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>  PATCO began to ship the railcars with their [[Bogie|trucks]] removed and replaced with highway tires for the road trip to the Alstom facility in [[Hornell, New York]], in March 2011.<ref name=comegno />\n\nThe refurbishment consisted of a completely new interior with more modern colors, wheelchair access and more reliable HVAC systems. The rollsigns were replaced with digital displays, and the cars received automated announcements. These changes reduced seating by eight seats, from 160 to 152. The refurbishment also saw the replacement of the propulsion and automatic train operation systems, which used technology last updated in the early 1980s; the camshaft resistance type motor controller was replaced by a new [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] unit using [[IGBT]]s and the relay based ATO unit was replaced by a computerized system. The General Electric DC motors, [[Pioneer III]] trucks and gearboxes were not replaced, but rebuilt by Alstom as well. Also, Alstom purchased many extra GE 1255 A2 motors from retired [[Metro-North Railroad]] M-1A's from a scrap dealer in Ohio, and rebuilt them to provide PATCO with extra DC motors for future replacement if needed, or required.\n\nThe first rebuilt cars were redelivered to PATCO's Lindenwold, New Jersey Shops on November 12, 2013, and were tested accordingly before going into service. Rebuilt cars are being renumbered into the 1000 series instead of their former numbers. The formerly single unit cars were converted into married-pair type cars instead of their former singles status, with the former single-leaf door behind the train operators position removed and sealed-off. The rebuilding is expected to extend the lives of these cars by 20 years, similar to the rebuilds received by many of the [[New York City Subway]]'s cars from [[R26 (New York City Subway car)|R26]]'s thru the [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]]'s. On May 28, 2015, after over a year and a half of exhaustive testing, and after a brief ceremony, along with a public unveiling for the rebuilt cars was held at the Woodcrest Station for all interested parties, passengers or persons alike, the first four (4) of the rebuilt cars (1095-6 & 1101-2, formerly or ex-295-6 and ex-101 and 102 the former single units respectively) were finally placed back into service, as Alstom has worked to iron-out most of the teething bugs and problems with the communications, automatic train control, propulsion, braking systems, and other bugs out of the sixteen redelivered cars during their 500 hours of extensive mandatory acceptance testing period, which these cars passed on December 16, 2014.<ref name=comegno>{{cite news|last1=Comegno|first1=Carol|title=New PATCO cars make first runs|url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/local/south-jersey/2015/05/28/commuters-inaugurate-new-patco-cars/28072013/|accessdate=May 29, 2015|work=Courier-Post|date=May 28, 2015}}</ref> The recorded announcements on the refurbished cars are provided by [[Bernie Wagenblast]].\n[[File:PATCO Refurb Interior.jpg|thumb|The interior of a rebuilt PATCO car.]]\n\nIn rebuilding these cars, PATCO and Alstom had struggled to incorporate new computer technology into the operational systems of these 46-year-old train cars, causing computer interface problems between PATCO's old 1969 DC technology, and Alstom's new 2014 AC technologies. Alstom will now proceed with the rebuilding of the remaining fleet of cars at a production and delivery rate of 4 to 6 cars per month until all cars have gone through this overhaul and rebuilding process.\n\nThe final run of the non-refurbished \"legacy\" trains took place on June 10, 2018, with a contest held for a rider to sit in the front row seat for the last time, something that is no longer possible with the refurbished trains. {{As of|2019|03|24|df=us}}, All 120 cars have  been overhauled and accepted back into service, except for one single car #116 which was damaged beyond repair by an arson fire back in 1997, and was thereby excluded from this overhaul, and rebuilding program.\n\n===Route identification===\nAs built, one of the six possible routes were displayed on a fluorescent lit piece of glass in the car. The text for the six routes were cut through a dark tinted piece of glass, the light behind the correct one identifying the train route. There were also rolling signs on the car ends and sides displaying this same route.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />  The routes were as follows, with the current three service designations in bold:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Local routes\n!Express routes\n|-\n|'''Lindenwold Local'''\n|Lindenwold Express\n|-\n|'''Philadelphia Local'''\n|'''Philadelphia Express'''\n|-\n|Woodcrest Local\n|\n|-\n|Ferry Avenue Local\n|\n|}\nAn additional sign (Special) was displayed when the train was not accepting passengers. The only currently operating express service is westbound from Lindenwold towards Philadelphia, which operates six times daily between 7:30 am \u2013 8:45 am, skipping only Haddonfield, Westmont, and Collingswood stations. (Unfortunately signage inside the cars indicates that express trains stop at Haddonfield.) There is currently no eastbound express service, and all eastbound trains terminate at Lindenwold, as opposed to terminating early at Ferry Avenue or Woodcrest.\n\nThe newly rehabilitated cars had all of their existing front and side signage removed and replaced with Luminator amber colored LED electronic signs.\n\n===Signaling===\n\nPATCO trains are governed by a [[Pulse code cab signaling]] system which transmits signal codes to the trains via the running rails. Wayside signals are located only at [[interlocking]]s and consist of two lamps on a single signal head: one lunar white, the other red. There are three typical signal indications; red for \"stop\", lunar white for \"proceed under cab signals on main route\" and flashing lunar white for \"proceed under cab signals on diverging route\". Historically, a green signal was provided to indicate a clear track to the next interlocking (absolute block), but these were eliminated as reverse direction cab signaling was installed.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" /> A yellow signal also existed east of 8th and Market to indicate a route lined for the SEPTA Broad Ridge Spur, but this was removed along with the connection in the late 1990s.\n\nThere are 5 cab signals, each corresponding to a speed. The cab signals are displayed to the operator via a series of 5 lamps above the [[speedometer]], red for Stop, yellow/red for 20&nbsp;mph, yellow for 30&nbsp;mph, yellow/green for 40&nbsp;mph and green for 65&nbsp;mph. These lamps correspond to the same cab signals in use by various [[NORAC|northeastern railroads]]. Even when the Automatic Train Operation System is not in use, the cab signal speed control function is still enabled and if an operator goes above the permitted speed, the power is cut and the brakes are applied until the speed is back within the limit.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe entire PATCO system is run from Center Tower, centrally located above a substation near the [[Walter Rand Transportation Center|Broadway station]] in [[Camden, NJ]]. Center Tower is staffed by two operators at peak periods and a single operator otherwise. Wayside signals are marked with their corresponding lever in the old US&S fashion with R signals indicating a \"right\" lever motion and L signals indicating \"left\".<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />  Signals and switches are numbered in ascending order from west to east with 15th/16th Locust using levers 1-4 and Lindenwold using levers 73-76. The interlocking at Woodcrest, which was added in 1980, uses levers 87-98.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nThe following fixed signs are also present on PATCO:\n* '''H''' - Sound Horn\n* '''T''' - Trigger Sign - Station stop outer transponder, trains not stopping must cancel automatic stop.\n* '''AB''' - Approach block, trains operating without cab signals prepare to stop.\n* '''Speed X mph''' - Speed limit sign in tunnel section and bridge.\n* '''Clear #''' - Train of # car lengths has cleared sharp curve.\n\nIn case of a cab signal failure or the need to disregard them, the cab signal may be cut out by the operator with permission from Center Tower.\n\n===Power===\nAll PATCO trains are electrically powered. Power comes from a top contact covered [[third rail]] at 750 V [[Direct current|DC]]. There are two feeds from the commercial power grid, one located in Philadelphia from [[PECO Energy]] for the old Bridge Line tunnel segments and the other in New Jersey from [[PSE&G]] for the new mainline segments. In New Jersey power is distributed via wayside AC transmission lines in the 26.4 kV range and a series of 7 substations, located approximately every {{convert|2|mi|km}}, transform and rectify the current to the 750 V DC used in the third rail.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\n==Fare collection==\n\n===Magnetic system===\nFrom its beginning in 1969, PATCO used a magnetic ticket as the sole means of collecting fares. The plastic tickets may still be bought for single rides through vending machines in the stations. These machines once required coins, so [[bill changer]]s were placed in stations. Each [[vending machine]] was capable of selling two types of tickets, which the rider chose by pushing a button after inserting the correct fare. Several machines were needed in each station, since different types of one-way and two-way tickets needed to be sold. After the ticket was purchased, it was inserted through a [[turnstile]] gate. To exit the station, it was inserted again, and if it had rides remaining, returned to the rider. A ticket with no rides was re-encoded by the system and returned to use in the vending machine. Tickets could also be purchased in ten-trip passes, but these were obtained through mail or in an office.<ref name=\"Vigrass\" />\n\nAt its inception, this system was state-of-the-art, but became more problematic as the years went on. Tickets were vulnerable to damage from magnetic sources such as [[cell phone]]s and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] that did not exist when the system was put in place, and the equipment to read and code the farecards began to suffer from extreme reliability problems as well as replacement part availability.\n\n===Freedom system===\n{{main|Freedom Card}}\nIn July 2006, PATCO announced that it would start the transition from a magnetic ticket fare system to an electronic [[smart card]] system. Magnetic tickets are still sold, for the occasional riders, however they are now in a paper form. The new computer vending machines allow more advanced purchasing options for Freedom Cards (the term used for the smart cards). Payment can now be in the form of coins, bills, [[credit cards]], or [[debit cards]]; however, credit and debit cards can only be used to load fare onto a Freedom Card or purchase a new card. PATCO has a system that allows balances to be reloaded on the [[Internet]].\n\nEach fare machine in the unpaid areas (i.e. outside the gates) performs all transactions (except for [[SEPTA]] transfers in PA stations, as the transfers are only sold on the unpaid side of NJ stations). Also, to augment the call-for-aid phones, there are now exit fare machines located inside of the fare gates, so that if a rider has purchased the wrong fare, they may pay the remaining fare to exit.\n\nThe system has been in use by the general public at all PATCO stations since its launch in 2007.\n\nThe system was put into effect in an attempt to gain ridership, which had fallen sharply since its peak in 1990.<ref name=\"autogenerated1-1\">[http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/nj/20081016_PATCO_ridership_hits_7-year_high.html?text=reg&c=y \"PATCO ridership hits 7-year high\"] by Paul Nussbaum, ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', October 16, 2008.

Also, the combination of the contactless card payment and the new swinging fare gates have decreased turnstile throughput, resulting in long exit queues after a train discharges a load of passengers at a station.\n\n===Open payment===\nIn September 2011 PATCO started Phase One of a pilot program for a new form of open payment called PATCO Wave And Pay Anywhere. Phase One allowed for a PATCO-branded [[Credit card#Prepaid cards|prepaid]] [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] card. The card was also put in by CUBIC Transportation Systems. It required a $6.00 balance to travel on PATCO. The card works the same as the Freedom Card except it could be used at any location that accepts Visa.\n\nIn April 2012, Phase Two of this open payment system was initiated. This phase allowed for station gates and parking terminals to accept other forms of [[contactless payment]] systems in use by Visa, MasterCard, or Discover. In addition to credit cards with the technology built in, the system also accepted [[Near field communication]] virtual wallet payment methods such as [[Google Wallet]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.contactlessnews.com/2012/04/03/patco-rolls-into-new-phase-of-open-payment-system | title = PATCO rolls into new phase of open payment system | accessdate = July 17, 2012 | author = ContactlessNews | date = April 3, 2012 | publisher = ContactlessNews}}</ref> This pilot program ended in October 2012.

The New Jersey Transit [[Atlantic City Line]] also stops at Lindenwold Station, and the [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] connects at Broadway Station ([[Walter Rand Transportation Center]]).\n\n===SEPTA connections===\nThe [[SEPTA]] (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority) [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] connects to PATCO at the [[8th Street (SEPTA station)|8th & Market Station]], which is two blocks away from SEPTA's [[Jefferson Station (Philadelphia)|Jefferson Station]], where all [[Cynwyd Line|but one]] of SEPTA's regional trains stop.\n\nSEPTA's [[Broad Street Line]] connects to PATCO at the [[Walnut\u2013Locust (SEPTA station)|Walnut\u2013Locust]] station via a short underground walkway to PATCO's 12th-13th & Locust, and 15-16th & Locust stations. The [[Broad-Ridge Spur]] connects to PATCO at the 8th & Market Station via a pedestrian walkway.\n\nFormerly, a special \"SEPTA Transfer\" ticket could be purchased from the unpaid side of any New Jersey station. These tickets were sold for $3.50 ($1.75 per ride, a savings compared to a single $2.25 cash fare or a token for $2.00) and dispensed two paper receipts, one good for a ride within one hour of the time of purchase and another good for a ride within 24 hours of the time of purchase. Originally, both transfers were going to be valid for 24 hours, however, PATCO changed the time limit to prevent the unauthorized sale of PATCO transfers at Pennsylvania stations.\n\nWith the release of [[SEPTA Key]], a new type of Freedom card is now required to purchase a transfer to the SEPTA system. The cost of a transfer is $2 with this system and it is debited directly from an account based Freedom Card account, provided a new Freedom Share card is used, which is compatible with both PATCO

He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Yokohama Stadium]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[NHK Hall]], and [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]].\n\nOe has also written and produced music for many artists, including [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Misato Watanabe]], [[Hiromi Go]], [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]] and [[Sayuri Ishikawa]].\n\nHe has composed music for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Believe\" which was featured in [[Sanrio Puroland]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSenri Oe was born on September 6th, 1960, in Fujiidera city [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was classically trained by his then junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to become an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to become a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first bands during his time at university, was scouted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music]] and signed to [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] Japan in 1981.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album ===\nOn February 27, 1983, Oe performed on [[Sapporo Television Broadcasting|STV Radio]]'s Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio.\n\nOe soon released his first single \"Wallabee Shoes  (\u30ef\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u306c\u304e\u3059\u3066\u3066),\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU. Quickly garnering popularity, \"Wallabee Shoes\" charted at No. 10 in Sapporo radio.\n\nOe appeared on [[All Night Fuji]] (Akin to Saturday Night Live in Japan) on Channel 8 alongside [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] label-mates [[Wham!|Wham]] from Britain.\n\n=== 1985-2007: Greater pop music career success ===\nDirectly after graduating from [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], Oe rose to fame in November 1984 with the success of his sixth single, \"10 People, 10 Colors (\u5341\u4eba\u5341\u8272).\" His third album, Miseinen (\u672a\u6210\u5e74) Juvenile charted at No. 5 on [[Oricon]] (Japanese equivalent to the Billboard weekly chart).\n\nWith his now growing popularity across Japan, Oe toured performing in Japan's largest venues and stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]] (with [[seating capacity]] of 14,471, akin to Madison Square Garden) to promote his fifth album, AVEC Tour Final, in 1987.\n\nOe's seventh album 1234 was awarded Album of the Year in the third [[Japan Gold Disc Award|Gold Disc Awards]] (Japan's equivalent of the Grammy Awards) in the Pop Male Solo Artist Category.\n\nContinuing to tour large venues throughout Japan, Oe released the album, ''Sloppy Joe'', on March 25, 1989, which charted at No. 2 on the [[Oricon]] (Japan's equivalent of Billboard weekly chart).\n\nMeanwhile, Oe appeared as an actor on television for the first time, in the dramatic show entitled Kimi Ga Uso Wo Tuita.\n\nOe's ninth album, APOLLO, was the first of his albums to be recorded in New York City. The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1217486/|title=Senri Oe|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sanrio Puroland]] Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist [[Princess Tenko]] Play, for Destiny. Also, notably, Oe scored music for the Japanese animated film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Kono Hoshino Dokokade\" by Yasuda Sisters.\n\n=== 2008-2012: Career shift to jazz ===\nOn December 22, 2007, Oe announced that he would study jazz music in [[School of Jazz (The New School)|The New School for Jazz]] and moved to Manhattan on January 10, 2008, with his then puppy, a [[dachshund]] named Peace.\n\nSince Oe was fifteen years old, he was intent on learning jazz music theory at school. Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nAfter graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \"Peace Never Die\" Records, abbreviated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo. Peace has received a certificate which allows her to officially qualify as an emotional support dog for Oe.\n\nOe's jazz debut album was ''Boys Mature Slow''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/video/senri-oe/5600|title=SENRI OE Boys mature slow /Senri Oe (video)|website=JazzMusicArchives.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nFollowing conversations with former Tokyo Jazz Festival producer, Atsuko Yashima, Oe concluded that his second album's style could expand to include for a jazz 'big band' ensemble.\n\nOe composed eleven pieces for his next album, ''Spooky Hotel'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/B214393|title=Senri Oe|website=www.kennedy-center.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> which was released in 2013.\n\nFollowing ''Spooky Hotel'', Oe's big band performed in the Tokyo Jazz Festival at Tokyo Forum A Hall.\n\nOe's progress again toward composing for a drumless trio was entitled Collective Scribble;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/reports/2015/05/05/senri-oe-ny-trio-collective-scribble-tour-2015.html|title=Senri Oe Trio Bluenote collective Scribble|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Oe remarked that here, saxophone and piano combined with upright bass, \"like a drawing scribble.\"\n\nAt the same time, Oe was creating his fourth jazz vocal album, ''Answer July'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzspeaks.org/senri-oe-record-release-answer-july/|title=Senri Oe Record Release: Answer July|website=Jazz Speaks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicalmemoirs.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/new-cd-releases-reflect-sounds-of-summer-and-celebrate-men-of-jazz/|title=NEW CD RELEASES REFLECT SOUNDS OF SUMMER and CELEBRATE MEN OF JAZZ|date=2016-07-15|website=Musicalmemoirs's Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> with Sheila Jordan, Jon Hendricks, Theo Bleckmann and Lauren Kinham\n\n''Answer July'' was a Grammy-nominated consideration album in the Best Jazz Album in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Oe challenged himself to adopt the concept of combining pop with jazz in his fifth studio jazz album ''Boys & Girls'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-j-pop-star-turned-jazz-man-senri-oe-talks-solo-piano-for-det-132772|title=Interview: J-Pop star-turned-jazz man Senri Oe talks solo piano for Detroit Jazz Fest|work=AXS|access-date=2019-10-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/04/11/detroit-jazz-festival-chick-corea-bassist-esparanza-spaulding-drummer-terri-lyne-carrington/33738717/|title=2018 Detroit Jazz Fest lineup boasts diversity|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khon2.com/living-808/japanese-superstar-senri-oe-plays-the-blue-note/|title=Japanese Superstar Senri Oe plays the Blue Note|date=2019-05-21|website=KHON2|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox2detroit.com/mornings/jazz-pianist-senri-oe-performs|title=Jazz pianist Senri Oe performs|date=2018-09-03|website=FOX 2 Detroit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/a-whole-new-world-senri-oe-gets-his-kicks-as-a-jazz-pianist/|title=A Whole New World: Senri Oe Gets His Kicks As a Jazz Pianist|last=Magazine|first=JAZZIZ|date=2018-12-15|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> released in 2018.

He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Yokohama Stadium]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[NHK Hall]], and [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]].\n\nOe has also written and produced music for many artists, including [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Misato Watanabe]], [[Hiromi Go]], [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]] and [[Sayuri Ishikawa]].\n\nHe has composed music for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Believe\" which was featured in [[Sanrio Puroland]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSenri Oe was born on September 6th, 1960, in Fujiidera city [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was classically trained by his then junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to become an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to become a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first bands during his time at university, was scouted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music]] and signed to [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] Japan in 1981.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album ===\nOn February 27, 1983, Oe performed on [[Sapporo Television Broadcasting|STV Radio]]'s Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio.\n\nOe soon released his first single \"Wallabee Shoes  (\u30ef\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u306c\u304e\u3059\u3066\u3066),\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU. Quickly garnering popularity, \"Wallabee Shoes\" charted at No. 10 in Sapporo radio.\n\nOe appeared on [[All Night Fuji]] (Akin to Saturday Night Live in Japan) on Channel 8 alongside [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] label-mates [[Wham!|Wham]] from Britain.\n\n=== 1985-2007: Greater pop music career success ===\nDirectly after graduating from [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], Oe rose to fame in November 1984 with the success of his sixth single, \"10 People, 10 Colors (\u5341\u4eba\u5341\u8272).\" His third album, Miseinen (\u672a\u6210\u5e74) Juvenile charted at No. 5 on [[Oricon]] (Japanese equivalent to the Billboard weekly chart).\n\nWith his now growing popularity across Japan, Oe toured performing in Japan's largest venues and stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]] (with [[seating capacity]] of 14,471, akin to Madison Square Garden) to promote his fifth album, AVEC Tour Final, in 1987.\n\nOe's seventh album 1234 was awarded Album of the Year in the third [[Japan Gold Disc Award|Gold Disc Awards]] (Japan's equivalent of the Grammy Awards) in the Pop Male Solo Artist Category.\n\nContinuing to tour large venues throughout Japan, Oe released the album, ''Sloppy Joe'', on March 25, 1989, which charted at No. 2 on the [[Oricon]] (Japan's equivalent of Billboard weekly chart).\n\nMeanwhile, Oe appeared as an actor on television for the first time, in the dramatic show entitled Kimi Ga Uso Wo Tuita.\n\nOe's ninth album, APOLLO, was the first of his albums to be recorded in New York City. The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1217486/|title=Senri Oe|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sanrio Puroland]] Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist [[Princess Tenko]] Play, for Destiny. Also, notably, Oe scored music for the Japanese animated film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Kono Hoshino Dokokade\" by Yasuda Sisters.\n\n=== 2008-2012: Career shift to jazz ===\nOn December 22, 2007, Oe announced that he would study jazz music in [[School of Jazz (The New School)|The New School for Jazz]] and moved to Manhattan on January 10, 2008, with his then puppy, a [[dachshund]] named Peace.\n\nSince Oe was fifteen years old, he was intent on learning jazz music theory at school. Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nAfter graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \"Peace Never Die\" Records, abbreviated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo. Peace has received a certificate which allows her to officially qualify as an emotional support dog for Oe.\n\nOe's jazz debut album was ''Boys Mature Slow''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/video/senri-oe/5600|title=SENRI OE Boys mature slow /Senri Oe (video)|website=JazzMusicArchives.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nFollowing conversations with former Tokyo Jazz Festival producer, Atsuko Yashima, Oe concluded that his second album's style could expand to include for a jazz 'big band' ensemble.\n\nOe composed eleven pieces for his next album, ''Spooky Hotel'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/B214393|title=Senri Oe|website=www.kennedy-center.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> which was released in 2013.\n\nFollowing ''Spooky Hotel'', Oe's big band performed in the Tokyo Jazz Festival at Tokyo Forum A Hall.\n\nOe's progress again toward composing for a drumless trio was entitled Collective Scribble;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/reports/2015/05/05/senri-oe-ny-trio-collective-scribble-tour-2015.html|title=Senri Oe Trio Bluenote collective Scribble|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Oe remarked that here, saxophone and piano combined with upright bass, \"like a drawing scribble.\"\n\nAt the same time, Oe was creating his fourth jazz vocal album, ''Answer July'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzspeaks.org/senri-oe-record-release-answer-july/|title=Senri Oe Record Release: Answer July|website=Jazz Speaks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicalmemoirs.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/new-cd-releases-reflect-sounds-of-summer-and-celebrate-men-of-jazz/|title=NEW CD RELEASES REFLECT SOUNDS OF SUMMER and CELEBRATE MEN OF JAZZ|date=2016-07-15|website=Musicalmemoirs's Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> with Sheila Jordan, Jon Hendricks, Theo Bleckmann and Lauren Kinham\n\n''Answer July'' was a Grammy-nominated consideration album in the Best Jazz Album in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Oe challenged himself to adopt the concept of combining pop with jazz in his fifth studio jazz album ''Boys & Girls'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-j-pop-star-turned-jazz-man-senri-oe-talks-solo-piano-for-det-132772|title=Interview: J-Pop star-turned-jazz man Senri Oe talks solo piano for Detroit Jazz Fest|work=AXS|access-date=2019-10-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/04/11/detroit-jazz-festival-chick-corea-bassist-esparanza-spaulding-drummer-terri-lyne-carrington/33738717/|title=2018 Detroit Jazz Fest lineup boasts diversity|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khon2.com/living-808/japanese-superstar-senri-oe-plays-the-blue-note/|title=Japanese Superstar Senri Oe plays the Blue Note|date=2019-05-21|website=KHON2|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox2detroit.com/mornings/jazz-pianist-senri-oe-performs|title=Jazz pianist Senri Oe performs|date=2018-09-03|website=FOX 2 Detroit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/a-whole-new-world-senri-oe-gets-his-kicks-as-a-jazz-pianist/|title=A Whole New World: Senri Oe Gets His Kicks As a Jazz Pianist|last=Magazine|first=JAZZIZ|date=2018-12-15|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> released in 2018.

He tends to put Ferb's name on inventions. This may be because Ferb does most of the building. However, he never seems angry or resentful of giving his brother the credit.\n\nPhineas appears to be addicted to inventing. In \"Bully Bromance Break Up\" he goes into withdrawal when the other kids insist on climbing a mountain without using any crazy gadgets.\n\nOn a few episodes, Phineas shows an angrier side of himself, first seen in the ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]'' movie, where Phineas gets angry at Perry after finding out his secret identity because Perry \"never trusted him\" by telling him the truth, but later realizes that Perry kept his identity hidden because if Phineas and his family found out, Perry would be forced to relocate to another family. Another episode, ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]'' again demonstrates Phineas' angry side, when he got angry at Candace when she accidentally caused Baljeet to turn into a [[Hulk]]-type version of himself, but they later made amends at the end of the episode.

Most notably Candace is constantly frustrated in her efforts to \"bust\" her brothers throughout the series,<ref name=\"AM2\"/> and in rare cases, Phineas has unwittingly caused misfortune to others. For example, in the episode \"Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face,\" Phineas gives all the kids at camp a fright when he tricks them into thinking [[Bigfoot]] is attacking, though this is mostly getting into the spirit of spooky story telling.<ref name=\"GTB\">{{cite episode|title=Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face!|series=Phineas and Ferb|season= 1|number= 6 |credits= Director: Zac Moncrief|network=Disney Channel}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Povenmire and Marsh intended for Phineas and Ferb to be motivated only by fun.<ref name=\"AM1\"/> In one episode, \"Thaddeus and Thor\", Phineas says that fun is his only goal in his daily schemes &ndash; though Ferb adds that they also do it \"for the ladies.\"<ref name=\"TT\">{{cite episode|title=Thaddeus and Thor|series=Phineas and Ferb|season=2|credits=Writers: Antoine Guilbaud, Kim Roberson; Director: Zac Moncrief|network=Disney XD}}</ref> Phineas also says that he wants his adventures to give him something interesting to say when he gets back to school,<ref name=\"RC\"/> a setting the creators have confirmed they will never put him in.<ref name=\"PP32\">{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBJ6FaXnFog&feature=channel|title=Piper's Pick #32|publisher=Piper's Pick TV|people=Dan Povenmire|accessdate=2009-09-30|date=2009-04-22}}</ref>\n\nPhineas is also very modest. He tends to put Ferb's name on inventions. This may be because Ferb does most of the building. However, he never seems angry or resentful of giving his brother the credit.\n\nPhineas appears to be addicted to inventing. In \"Bully Bromance Break Up\" he goes into withdrawal when the other kids insist on climbing a mountain without using any crazy gadgets.\n\nOn a few episodes, Phineas shows an angrier side of himself, first seen in the ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]'' movie, where Phineas gets angry at Perry after finding out his secret identity because Perry \"never trusted him\" by telling him the truth, but later realizes that Perry kept his identity hidden because if Phineas and his family found out, Perry would be forced to relocate to another family. Another episode, ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]'' again demonstrates Phineas' angry side, when he got angry at Candace when she accidentally caused Baljeet to turn into a [[Hulk]]-type version of himself, but they later made amends at the end of the episode. Later, on \"Phineas and Ferb Save Summer\", when Candace tries to power-up the machine, Phineas starts raising his voice at her in order for her to stop, to which Buford breaks the fourth wall by saying: \"Must be a special episode, he's yelling at his sister again!\".\n\n==Reception==\nPhineas has received mostly positive reviews.

However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices.

However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the previous two years. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|{{Center|Marine Cove}}]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area&nbsp;C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located.

He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1&nbsp;million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|{{Center|View of Bedok Jetty}} {{Center|from East Coast Park}}]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in the East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space.

He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1&nbsp;million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|{{Center|View of Bedok Jetty}} {{Center|from East Coast Park}}]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in the East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space.

However, with the imposition of parking fees for its carpark and the opening of Marine Cove in June 2016, customer numbers and revenues decreased sharply in the second half of 2016.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |last=Singh |first=Bryna |date=11 December 2016 |title=Where are the crowds? |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808142457/https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |archive-date=8 August 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe park is accessible by East Coast Park Service Road with numerous exits along the East Coast Parkway.

ELISA has been used as a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] tool in medicine, [[plant pathology]], and [[biotechnology]], as well as a [[quality control]] check in various industries.\n\nIn the most simple form of an ELISA, [[antigen]]s from the sample are attached to a surface. Then, a matching [[antibody]] is applied over the surface so it can bind to the antigen. This antibody is linked to an enzyme, and in the final step, a substance containing the enzyme's [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]] is added. The subsequent reaction produces a detectable signal, most commonly a color change.\n\nPerforming an ELISA involves at least one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support (usually a [[polystyrene]] [[microtiter plate]]) either non-specifically (via [[adsorption]] to the surface) or specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a \"sandwich\" ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with the antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an [[enzyme]] or can itself be detected by a [[secondary antibody]] that is linked to an enzyme through [[bioconjugation]]. Between each step, the plate is typically washed with a mild [[detergent]] solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that are non-specifically bound. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding an enzymatic [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] to produce a visible [[signal (information theory)|signal]], which indicates the quantity of antigen in the sample.\n\nOf note, ELISA can perform other forms of [[ligand binding assay]]s instead of strictly \"immuno\" assays, though the name carried the original \"immuno\" because of the common use and history of development of this method. The technique essentially requires any ligating reagent that can be immobilized on the solid phase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use an enzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified. In between the washes, only the ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain specifically bound or \"immunosorbed\" by [[antigen-antibody interaction]]s to the solid phase, while the nonspecific or unbound components are washed away. Unlike other spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same reaction well (e.g., a cuvette) can be reused after washing, the ELISA plates have the reaction products immunosorbed on the solid phase, which is part of the plate, and so are not easily reusable.\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the development of the ELISA, the only option for conducting an immunoassay was [[radioimmunoassay]], a technique using [[radioactive]]ly labeled antigens or antibodies. In radioimmunoassay, the radioactivity provides the signal, which indicates whether a specific antigen or antibody is present in the sample. Radioimmunoassay was first described in a scientific paper by [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]] and [[Solomon Berson]] published in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yalow |first1=Rosalyn S. |last2=Berson |first2=Solomon A. |title=Immunoassay of endogenous plasma insulin in man |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=39 |issue= 7|pages=1157\u201375 |year=1960 |pmid=13846364 |pmc=441860 |doi=10.1172/JCI104130 }}</ref>\n\nAs radioactivity poses a potential health threat, a safer alternative was sought. A suitable alternative to radioimmunoassay would substitute a nonradioactive signal in place of the radioactive signal. When enzymes (such as [[horseradish peroxidase]]) react with appropriate substrates (such as [[ABTS]] or [[3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine|TMB]]), a change in color occurs, which is used as a signal. However, the signal has to be associated with the presence of antibody or antigen, which is why the enzyme has to be linked to an appropriate antibody. This linking process was independently developed by Stratis Avrameas and G. B. Pierce.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lequin |first1=R.

Often, this substrate changes color upon reaction with the enzyme.  \n*The higher the concentration of the primary antibody present in the serum, the stronger the color change. Often, a spectrometer is used to give quantitative values for color strength.\n\nThe enzyme acts as an amplifier; even if only few enzyme-linked antibodies remain bound, the enzyme molecules will produce many signal molecules. Within common-sense limitations, the enzyme can go on producing color indefinitely, but the more antibody is bound, the faster the color will develop. A major disadvantage of the direct ELISA is that the method of antigen immobilization is not specific; when serum is used as the source of test antigen, all proteins in the sample may stick to the microtiter plate well, so small concentrations of analyte in serum must compete with other serum proteins when binding to the well surface. The sandwich or indirect ELISA provides a solution to this problem, by using a \"capture\" antibody specific for the test antigen to pull it out of the serum's molecular mixture.\n\nELISA may be run in a qualitative or quantitative format. Qualitative results provide a simple positive or negative result (yes or no) for a sample. The cutoff between positive and negative is determined by the analyst and may be statistical. Two or three times the standard deviation (error inherent in a test) is often used to distinguish positive from negative samples. In quantitative ELISA, the optical density (OD) of the sample is compared to a standard curve, which is typically a serial dilution of a known-concentration solution of the target molecule.  For example, if a test sample returns an OD of 1.0, the point on the standard curve that gave OD = 1.0 must be of the same analyte concentration as the sample.\n\nThe use and meaning of the names \"indirect ELISA\" and \"direct ELISA\" differs in the literature and on web sites depending on the context of the experiment. When the presence of an antigen is analyzed, the name \"direct ELISA\" refers to an ELISA in which only a labelled primary antibody is used, and the term \"indirect ELISA\" refers to an ELISA in which the antigen is bound by the primary antibody which then is detected by a labeled secondary antibody. In the latter case a sandwich ELISA is clearly distinct from an indirect ELISA. When the \"primary\" antibody is of interest, e.g. in the case of immunization analyses, this antibody is directly detected by the secondary antibody and the term \"indirect ELISA\" applies to a setting with two antibodies.\n\n===Sandwich ELISA ===\n[[Image:ELISA-sandwich.svg|thumb|300px|'''A sandwich ELISA'''. (1) Plate is coated with a capture antibody; (2) sample is added, and any antigen present binds to capture antibody; (3) detecting antibody is added, and binds to antigen; (4) enzyme-linked secondary antibody is added, and binds to detecting antibody; (5) substrate is added, and is converted by enzyme to detectable form.]]\n\nA \"sandwich\" ELISA is used to detect sample antigen.<ref name=\"Schmidt2012\">{{Cite book |last1=Schmidt |first1=SD |last2=Mazzella |first2=MJ |last3=Nixon |first3=RA |last4=Mathews |first4=PM |title=A\u03b2 measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay |journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=849 |pages=507\u201327 |year=2012 |pmid=22528112 |doi=10.1007/978-1-61779-551-0_34 |isbn=978-1-61779-550-3 }}</ref> The steps are:\n\n# A surface is prepared to which a known quantity of capture antibody is bound.\n# Any nonspecific binding sites on the surface are blocked.\n# The antigen-containing sample is applied to the plate, and captured by antibody.\n# The plate  is washed to remove unbound antigen.\n# A  specific antibody is added, and binds to antigen (hence the 'sandwich': the antigen is stuck between two antibodies). This primary antibody could also be in the serum of a donor to be tested for reactivity towards the antigen.\n# Enzyme-linked secondary antibodies are applied as detection antibodies that also bind specifically to the antibody's Fc region (nonspecific).\n# The plate is washed to remove the unbound antibody-enzyme conjugates.\n# A chemical is added to be converted by the enzyme into a color or fluorescent or electrochemical signal.\n# The absorbance or fluorescence or electrochemical signal (e.g., current) of the plate wells is measured to determine the presence and quantity of antigen.\n\nThe image to the right includes the use of a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme, though, in the technical sense, this is not necessary if the primary antibody is conjugated to an enzyme (which would be direct ELISA). However, the use of a secondary-antibody conjugate avoids the expensive process of creating enzyme-linked antibodies for every antigen one might want to detect. By using an enzyme-linked antibody that binds the Fc region of other antibodies, this same enzyme-linked antibody can be used in a variety of situations. Without the first layer of \"capture\" antibody, any proteins in the sample (including serum proteins) may competitively adsorb to the plate surface, lowering the quantity of antigen immobilized. Use of the purified specific antibody to attach the antigen to the plastic eliminates a need to purify the antigen from complicated mixtures before the measurement, simplifying the assay, and increasing the specificity and the sensitivity of the assay. A sandwich ELISA used for research often needs validation because of the risk of false positive results.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kragstrup|first1=Tue W|last2=Vorup-Jensen|first2=Thomas|last3=Deleuran|first3=Bent|last4=Hvid|first4=Malene|title=A simple set of validation steps identifies and removes false results in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay caused by anti-animal IgG antibodies in plasma from arthritis patients|journal=SpringerPlus|date=2013|volume=2|issue=1|pages=263|doi=10.1186/2193-1801-2-263|pmid=23875127|pmc=3695686}}</ref>\n\n===Competitive ELISA===\nA third use of ELISA is through competitive binding. The steps for this ELISA are somewhat different from the first two examples:\n\n# Unlabeled antibody is incubated in the presence of its antigen (sample).\n# These bound antibody/antigen complexes are then added to an antigen-coated well.\n# The plate is washed, so unbound antibodies are removed. (The more antigen in the sample, the more Ag-Ab complexes are formed and so there are less unbound antibodies available to bind to the antigen in the well, hence \"competition\".)\n# The [[secondary antibody]], specific to the primary antibody, is added. This second antibody is coupled to the enzyme.\n# A substrate is added, and remaining enzymes elicit a chromogenic or fluorescent signal.\n# The reaction is stopped to prevent eventual saturation of the signal.\n\nSome competitive ELISA kits include enzyme-linked antigen rather than enzyme-linked antibody. The labeled antigen competes for primary antibody binding sites with the sample antigen (unlabeled). The less antigen in the sample, the more labeled antigen is retained in the well and the stronger the signal.\n\nCommonly, the antigen is not first positioned in the well.\n\nFor the detection of HIV antibodies, the wells of microtiter plate are coated with the HIV antigen. Two specific antibodies are used, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in serum (if serum is positive for the antibody). Cumulative competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen, causing a stronger signal to be seen. Sera to be tested are added to these wells and incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C, and then washed. If antibodies are present, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs. No antigen is left for the enzyme-labelled specific HIV antibodies. These antibodies remain free upon addition and are washed off during washing. Substrate is added, but there is no enzyme to act on it, so a positive result shows no color change.\n\n===Reverse ELISA===\nA fourth ELISA test does not use the traditional wells.&nbsp; This test leaves the antigens suspended in the test fluid.<ref>{{cite patent|title=United States Patent: 7767404 - Apparatus and method for single-step immunosorbent assay for single and multiple analytes|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=4&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=charbonnet.INNM.&OS=IN/charbonnet&RS=IN/charbonnet|patent-number=7767404|issue-date=August 3, 2010|access-date=2018-11-02|inventor-last=Charbonnet|inventor-first=Derrick}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|title=United States Patent: 8735142 - Systems and methods for immunosorbent assays for single and multiple analytes|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=charbonnet.INNM.&OS=IN/charbonnet&RS=IN/charbonnet|patent-number=8735142|issue-date=May 27, 2014|access-date=2018-11-02|inventor-last=Charbonnet|inventor2-last=Evans|inventor-first=Derrick|inventor2-first=Norman Scott}}</ref>\n\n# Unlabeled antibody is incubated in the presence of its antigen (sample)\n#A sufficient incubation period is provided to allow the antibodies to bind to the antigens.\n#The sample is then passed through the Scavenger container.&nbsp; This can be a test tube or a specifically designed flow through channel.&nbsp; The surface of the Scavenger container or channel has \u201cScavenger Antigens\u201d bound to it.&nbsp; These can be identical or sufficiently similar to the primary antigens that the free antibodies will bind.\n#The Scavenger container must have sufficient surface area and sufficient time to allow the Scavenger Antigens to bind to all the excess Antibodies introduced into the sample.\n#The sample, that now contains the tagged and bound antibodies, is passed through a detector.

In an ELISA, a person's serum is diluted 400 times and applied to a plate to which HIV antigens are attached. If antibodies to HIV are present in the serum, they may bind to these HIV antigens. The plate is then washed to remove all other components of the serum. A specially prepared \"secondary antibody\" \u2014 an antibody that binds to other antibodies \u2014 is then applied to the plate, followed by another wash. This secondary antibody is chemically linked in advance to an enzyme.\n\nThus, the plate will contain enzyme in proportion to the amount of secondary antibody bound to the plate. A substrate for the enzyme is applied, and catalysis by the enzyme leads to a change in color or fluorescence. ELISA results are reported as a number; the most controversial aspect of this test is determining the \"cut-off\" point between a positive and a negative result.\n\nA cut-off point may be determined by comparing it with a known standard. If an ELISA test is used for drug screening at workplace, a cut-off concentration, 50&nbsp;ng/ml, for example, is established, and a sample containing the standard concentration of analyte will be prepared. Unknowns that generate a stronger signal than the known sample are \"positive.\" Those that generate weaker signal are \"negative\".\n\nDr Dennis E Bidwell and Alister Voller created the ELISA test to detect various kind of diseases, such as [[Dengue fever|dengue]], [[malaria]], [[Chagas disease]], [[paratuberculosis|Johne's disease]], and others.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=J.

ELISA has been used as a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] tool in medicine, [[plant pathology]], and [[biotechnology]], as well as a [[quality control]] check in various industries.\n\nIn the most simple form of an ELISA, [[antigen]]s from the sample are attached to a surface. Then, a matching [[antibody]] is applied over the surface so it can bind to the antigen. This antibody is linked to an enzyme, and in the final step, a substance containing the enzyme's [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]] is added. The subsequent reaction produces a detectable signal, most commonly a color change.\n\nPerforming an ELISA involves at least one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support (usually a [[polystyrene]] [[microtiter plate]]) either non-specifically (via [[adsorption]] to the surface) or specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a \"sandwich\" ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with the antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an [[enzyme]] or can itself be detected by a [[secondary antibody]] that is linked to an enzyme through [[bioconjugation]]. Between each step, the plate is typically washed with a mild [[detergent]] solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that are non-specifically bound. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding an enzymatic [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] to produce a visible [[signal (information theory)|signal]], which indicates the quantity of antigen in the sample.\n\nOf note, ELISA can perform other forms of [[ligand binding assay]]s instead of strictly \"immuno\" assays, though the name carried the original \"immuno\" because of the common use and history of development of this method. The technique essentially requires any ligating reagent that can be immobilized on the solid phase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use an enzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified. In between the washes, only the ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain specifically bound or \"immunosorbed\" by [[antigen-antibody interaction]]s to the solid phase, while the nonspecific or unbound components are washed away. Unlike other spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same reaction well (e.g., a cuvette) can be reused after washing, the ELISA plates have the reaction products immunosorbed on the solid phase, which is part of the plate, and so are not easily reusable.\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the development of the ELISA, the only option for conducting an immunoassay was [[radioimmunoassay]], a technique using [[radioactive]]ly labeled antigens or antibodies. In radioimmunoassay, the radioactivity provides the signal, which indicates whether a specific antigen or antibody is present in the sample. Radioimmunoassay was first described in a scientific paper by [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]] and [[Solomon Berson]] published in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yalow |first1=Rosalyn S. |last2=Berson |first2=Solomon A. |title=Immunoassay of endogenous plasma insulin in man |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=39 |issue= 7|pages=1157\u201375 |year=1960 |pmid=13846364 |pmc=441860 |doi=10.1172/JCI104130 }}</ref>\n\nAs radioactivity poses a potential health threat, a safer alternative was sought. A suitable alternative to radioimmunoassay would substitute a nonradioactive signal in place of the radioactive signal. When enzymes (such as [[horseradish peroxidase]]) react with appropriate substrates (such as [[ABTS]] or [[3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine|TMB]]), a change in color occurs, which is used as a signal. However, the signal has to be associated with the presence of antibody or antigen, which is why the enzyme has to be linked to an appropriate antibody. This linking process was independently developed by Stratis Avrameas and G. B. Pierce.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lequin |first1=R.

Often, this substrate changes color upon reaction with the enzyme.  \n*The higher the concentration of the primary antibody present in the serum, the stronger the color change. Often, a spectrometer is used to give quantitative values for color strength.\n\nThe enzyme acts as an amplifier; even if only few enzyme-linked antibodies remain bound, the enzyme molecules will produce many signal molecules. Within common-sense limitations, the enzyme can go on producing color indefinitely, but the more antibody is bound, the faster the color will develop. A major disadvantage of the direct ELISA is the method of antigen immobilization is not specific; when serum is used as the source of test antigen, all proteins in the sample may stick to the microtiter plate well, so small concentrations of analyte in serum must compete with other serum proteins when binding to the well surface. The sandwich or indirect ELISA provides a solution to this problem, by using a \"capture\" antibody specific for the test antigen to pull it out of the serum's molecular mixture.\n\nELISA may be run in a qualitative or quantitative format. Qualitative results provide a simple positive or negative result (yes or no) for a sample. The cutoff between positive and negative is determined by the analyst and may be statistical. Two or three times the standard deviation (error inherent in a test) is often used to distinguish positive from negative samples. In quantitative ELISA, the optical density (OD) of the sample is compared to a standard curve, which is typically a serial dilution of a known-concentration solution of the target molecule.  For example, if a test sample returns an OD of 1.0, the point on the standard curve that gave OD = 1.0 must be of the same analyte concentration as the sample.\n\nThe use and meaning of the names \"indirect ELISA\" and \"direct ELISA\" differs in the literature and on web sites depending on the context of the experiment. When the presence of an antigen is analyzed, the name \"direct ELISA\" refers to an ELISA in which only a labelled primary antibody is used, and the term \"indirect ELISA\" refers to an ELISA in which the antigen is bound by the primary antibody which then is detected by a labeled secondary antibody. In the latter case a sandwich ELISA is clearly distinct from an indirect ELISA. When the \"primary\" antibody is of interest, e.g. in the case of immunization analyses, this antibody is directly detected by the secondary antibody and the term \"indirect ELISA\" applies to a setting with two antibodies.\n\n===Sandwich ELISA ===\n[[Image:ELISA-sandwich.svg|thumb|300px|'''A sandwich ELISA'''. (1) Plate is coated with a capture antibody; (2) sample is added, and any antigen present binds to capture antibody; (3) detecting antibody is added, and binds to antigen; (4) enzyme-linked secondary antibody is added, and binds to detecting antibody; (5) substrate is added, and is converted by enzyme to detectable form.]]\n\nA \"sandwich\" ELISA is used to detect sample antigen.<ref name=\"Schmidt2012\">{{Cite book |last1=Schmidt |first1=SD |last2=Mazzella |first2=MJ |last3=Nixon |first3=RA |last4=Mathews |first4=PM |title=A\u03b2 measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay |journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=849 |pages=507\u201327 |year=2012 |pmid=22528112 |doi=10.1007/978-1-61779-551-0_34 |isbn=978-1-61779-550-3 }}</ref> The steps are:\n\n# A surface is prepared to which a known quantity of capture antibody is bound.\n# Any nonspecific binding sites on the surface are blocked.\n# The antigen-containing sample is applied to the plate, and captured by antibody.\n# The plate  is washed to remove unbound antigen.\n# A  specific antibody is added, and binds to antigen (hence the 'sandwich': the antigen is stuck between two antibodies). This primary antibody could also be in the serum of a donor to be tested for reactivity towards the antigen.\n# Enzyme-linked secondary antibodies are applied as detection antibodies that also bind specifically to the antibody's Fc region (nonspecific).\n# The plate is washed to remove the unbound antibody-enzyme conjugates.\n# A chemical is added to be converted by the enzyme into a color or fluorescent or electrochemical signal.\n# The absorbance or fluorescence or electrochemical signal (e.g., current) of the plate wells is measured to determine the presence and quantity of antigen.\n\nThe image to the right includes the use of a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme, though, in the technical sense, this is not necessary if the primary antibody is conjugated to an enzyme (which would be direct ELISA). However, the use of a secondary-antibody conjugate avoids the expensive process of creating enzyme-linked antibodies for every antigen one might want to detect. By using an enzyme-linked antibody that binds the Fc region of other antibodies, this same enzyme-linked antibody can be used in a variety of situations. Without the first layer of \"capture\" antibody, any proteins in the sample (including serum proteins) may competitively adsorb to the plate surface, lowering the quantity of antigen immobilized. Use of the purified specific antibody to attach the antigen to the plastic eliminates a need to purify the antigen from complicated mixtures before the measurement, simplifying the assay, and increasing the specificity and the sensitivity of the assay. A sandwich ELISA used for research often needs validation because of the risk of false positive results.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kragstrup|first1=Tue W|last2=Vorup-Jensen|first2=Thomas|last3=Deleuran|first3=Bent|last4=Hvid|first4=Malene|title=A simple set of validation steps identifies and removes false results in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay caused by anti-animal IgG antibodies in plasma from arthritis patients|journal=SpringerPlus|date=2013|volume=2|issue=1|pages=263|doi=10.1186/2193-1801-2-263|pmid=23875127|pmc=3695686}}</ref>\n\n===Competitive ELISA===\nA third use of ELISA is through competitive binding. The steps for this ELISA are somewhat different from the first two examples:\n\n# Unlabeled antibody is incubated in the presence of its antigen (sample).\n# These bound antibody/antigen complexes are then added to an antigen-coated well.\n# The plate is washed, so unbound antibodies are removed. (The more antigen in the sample, the more Ag-Ab complexes are formed and so there are less unbound antibodies available to bind to the antigen in the well, hence \"competition\".)\n# The [[secondary antibody]], specific to the primary antibody, is added. This second antibody is coupled to the enzyme.\n# A substrate is added, and remaining enzymes elicit a chromogenic or fluorescent signal.\n# The reaction is stopped to prevent eventual saturation of the signal.\n\nSome competitive ELISA kits include enzyme-linked antigen rather than enzyme-linked antibody. The labeled antigen competes for primary antibody binding sites with the sample antigen (unlabeled). The less antigen in the sample, the more labeled antigen is retained in the well and the stronger the signal.\n\nCommonly, the antigen is not first positioned in the well.\n\nFor the detection of HIV antibodies, the wells of microtiter plate are coated with the HIV antigen. Two specific antibodies are used, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in serum (if serum is positive for the antibody). Cumulative competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen, causing a stronger signal to be seen. Sera to be tested are added to these wells and incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C, and then washed. If antibodies are present, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs. No antigen is left for the enzyme-labelled specific HIV antibodies. These antibodies remain free upon addition and are washed off during washing.

In an ELISA, a person's serum is diluted 400 times and applied to a plate to which HIV antigens are attached. If antibodies to HIV are present in the serum, they may bind to these HIV antigens. The plate is then washed to remove all other components of the serum. A specially prepared \"secondary antibody\" \u2014 an antibody that binds to other antibodies \u2014 is then applied to the plate, followed by another wash. This secondary antibody is chemically linked in advance to an enzyme.\n\nThus, the plate will contain enzyme in proportion to the amount of secondary antibody bound to the plate. A substrate for the enzyme is applied, and catalysis by the enzyme leads to a change in color or fluorescence. ELISA results are reported as a number; the most controversial aspect of this test is determining the \"cut-off\" point between a positive and a negative result.\n\nA cut-off point may be determined by comparing it with a known standard. If an ELISA test is used for drug screening at workplace, a cut-off concentration, 50&nbsp;ng/ml, for example, is established, and a sample containing the standard concentration of analyte will be prepared. Unknowns that generate a stronger signal than the known sample are \"positive.\" Those that generate weaker signal are \"negative\".\n\nDr Dennis E Bidwell and Alister Voller created the ELISA test to detect various kind of diseases, such as [[Dengue fever|dengue]], [[malaria]], [[Chagas disease]], [[paratuberculosis|Johne's disease]], and others.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=J.
