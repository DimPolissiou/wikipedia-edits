One of his earliest successes, \"[[Boys (The Shirelles song)|Boys]]\" (co-written with [[Luther Dixon]]), appeared on the B-side of [[the Shirelles]]' number-one 1960 hit \"[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow]]\", and in 1963 was covered by [[the Beatles]] for their debut album ''[[Please Please Me]]''. Farrell's biggest chart hit as a composer \u2013 [[the McCoys]]' 1965 US #1 single  \"[[Hang On Sloopy]]\" (a reworking of \"My Girl Sloopy\", co-written with [[Bert Berns|Bert Russell]]) \u2013 remains one of the most performed songs in the history of popular music, according to the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.\n\nOther Farrell pop hits include [[the Animals]]' UK debut single \"[[Baby Let Me Take You Home]]\" (co-written with Bert Russell, #21, 1964) and two 1964 releases for [[Jay and the Americans]]: \"[[Come a Little Bit Closer]]\" (co-written with songwriters [[Boyce and Hart|Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart]], US #3) and \"[[Let's Lock the Door (And Throw Away the Key)]]\" (with Roy Alfred, US #11 in early 1965). Farrell also co-wrote \"Come and Take a Ride in My Boat\" (with [[Jerry Goldstein (producer)|Jerry Goldstein]]), slightly reworked in 1967 to provide [[Every Mother's Son]] with their signature hit \"[[Come on Down to My Boat]]\" (US #6).  He also co-wrote (with Larry Kusik and Ritchie Adams) the song [[Happy Summer Days]], a hit for [[Ronnie Dove]] in 1966.\n\nFarrell's Top 40 hit \"Look What You've Done\" \u2014 first recorded in 1966 by the [[Pozo Seco Singers]] \u2014 appears on [[Carla Olson|Carla Olson's]] 2013 album ''Have Harmony, Will Travel'' as a duet with Rob Waller (of I See Hawks in LA).\n\nIn 1966, Farrell wrote the theme song for ''[[Gamera (film)|Gammera the Invincible]]'' (aka ''Gamera''), the American cut of the first [[Gamera]] film .<ref name=\"AFI_1997\">\n{{cite book| author = American Film Institute| authorlink = American Film Institute| title = The AFI Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States: Feature Films, 1961-1970| publisher = University of California Press| year = 1997| isbn = 0520209702| page = 388| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s1k1RsGvFwwC&pg=PA388&dq=%22wes+farrell%22+%22gamera%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9DGyUKaiCuW40gHkzoCQDg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22wes%20farrell%22%20%22gamera%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nSuccess as a producer came in 1968 when Farrell produced \"[[Indian Lake (song)|Indian Lake]]\" for the [[Cowsills]]. The recording of that song written by [[Tony Romeo]] was a top ten hit. He produced three other tracks for that family band, including \"Poor Baby\" and \"The Path of Love\", also written by Romeo. His association with them continued, to some extent, when he was hired to produce the music for the recordings associated with the television show that was loosely based on their life and career. That show, which aired from 1970-1974, \"[[The Partridge Family]]\", featured the theme song, \"C'mon Get Happy\" which was written by Farrell (with Danny Janssen). Seven studio albums connected with the show were produced by Farrell.<ref name=Tiger>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmongethappy.com/interviews/wf/|title=Interview with Wes Farrell|website=CmonGetHappy.com|publisher=[[Tiger Beat]] special edition ''[[Partridge Family]] Magazine''|date=March 1971|}}</ref> They included 30 songs which Farrell also co-wrote.  Among those songs were \"[[Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted]]\" (with Jim Cretecos and [[Mike Appel]]), and \"[[I'll Meet You Halfway]]\" (with [[Gerry Goffin]]), which were both top ten U.S. hits.  Unlike the Cowsills, who were actually featured on their own records, the albums produced under the name of the Partridge Family mostly featured session musicians now known as [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]] with backing vocals by [[the Ron Hicklin Singers]]. The only cast members that contributed to the recordings were [[David Cassidy]] and to a much lesser extent, [[Shirley Jones]].<ref name=Tiger></ref>\n\nOther recording artists Farrell produced were [[Elephant's Memory]] (whose songs \"Jungle Gym at the Zoo\" and \"[[Old Man Willow#Song inspiration|Old Man Willow]]\" appeared in the movie ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') and singer [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] (two 1970s albums).\n\nFarrell founded [[Chelsea Records]] in 1972.<ref name=\"Lichtman_1996_118\">{{cite journal| last = Lichtman| first = Irv| title = Songwriter/Entrepreneur Wes Farrell Dies| magazine = Billboard| volume = 108| issue = 11| date = March 16, 1996| issn = 0006-2510| page = 118| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA118&dq=%22Chelsea+Records%22+%22RCA%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eCCyUJ2YGbSp0AH69oG4Cg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAjgy#v=onepage&q=%22Chelsea%20Records%22%20%22RCA%22&f=false| accessdate = 2012-11-25}}</ref><ref name=\"Billboard_1972\">{{cite journal| title = Chelsea Hits Gold\u2014Fast| magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| volume = 84| issue = 31| date = July 29, 1972| issn = 0006-2510| page = 3| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EigEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3&dq=%22Chelsea+Records%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yhuyUJmwMsjD0QGx64BY&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22Chelsea%20Records%22&f=false| accessdate = 2012-11-25}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nFarrell was born in 1939 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 1965 he married Joan Arthurs, and they had a daughter, named Dawn. Farrell and Arthurs divorced in 1972.

One of his earliest successes, \"[[Boys (The Shirelles song)|Boys]]\" (co-written with [[Luther Dixon]]), appeared on the B-side of [[the Shirelles]]' number-one 1960 hit \"[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow]]\", and in 1963 was covered by [[the Beatles]] for their debut album ''[[Please Please Me]]''. Farrell's biggest chart hit as a composer \u2013 [[the McCoys]]' 1965 US #1 single  \"[[Hang On Sloopy]]\" (a reworking of \"My Girl Sloopy\", co-written with [[Bert Berns|Bert Russell]]) \u2013 remains one of the most performed songs in the history of popular music, according to the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.\n\nOther Farrell pop hits include [[the Animals]]' UK debut single \"[[Baby Let Me Take You Home]]\" (co-written with Bert Russell, #21, 1964) and two 1964 releases for [[Jay and the Americans]]: \"[[Come a Little Bit Closer]]\" (co-written with songwriters [[Boyce and Hart|Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart]], US #3) and \"[[Let's Lock the Door (And Throw Away the Key)]]\" (with Roy Alfred, US #11 in early 1965). Farrell also co-wrote \"Come and Take a Ride in My Boat\" (with [[Jerry Goldstein (producer)|Jerry Goldstein]]), slightly reworked in 1967 to provide [[Every Mother's Son]] with their signature hit \"[[Come on Down to My Boat]]\" (US #6).  He also co-wrote (with Larry Kusik and Ritchie Adams) the song [[Happy Summer Days]], a hit for [[Ronnie Dove]] in 1966.\n\nFarrell's Top 40 hit \"Look What You've Done\" \u2014 first recorded in 1966 by the [[Pozo Seco Singers]] \u2014 appears on [[Carla Olson|Carla Olson's]] 2013 album ''Have Harmony, Will Travel'' as a duet with Rob Waller (of I See Hawks in LA).\n\nIn 1966, Farrell wrote the theme song for ''[[Gamera (film)|Gammera the Invincible]]'' (aka ''Gamera''), the American cut of the first [[Gamera]] film .<ref name=\"AFI_1997\">\n{{cite book| author = American Film Institute| authorlink = American Film Institute| title = The AFI Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States: Feature Films, 1961-1970| publisher = University of California Press| year = 1997| isbn = 0520209702| page = 388| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s1k1RsGvFwwC&pg=PA388&dq=%22wes+farrell%22+%22gamera%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9DGyUKaiCuW40gHkzoCQDg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22wes%20farrell%22%20%22gamera%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nSuccess as a producer came in 1968 when Farrell produced \"[[Indian Lake (song)|Indian Lake]]\" for the [[Cowsills]]. The recording of that song written by [[Tony Romeo]] was a top ten hit. He produced three other tracks for that family band, including \"Poor Baby\" and \"The Path of Love\", also written by Romeo. His association with them continued, to some extent, when he was hired to produce the music for the recordings associated with the television show that was loosely based on their life and career. That show, which aired from 1970-1974, \"[[The Partridge Family]]\", featured the theme song, \"C'mon Get Happy\" which was written by Farrell (with Danny Janssen). Seven studio albums connected with the show were produced by Farrell.<ref name=Tiger>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmongethappy.com/interviews/wf/|title=Interview with Wes Farrell|website=CmonGetHappy.com|publisher=[[Tiger Beat]] special edition [[Partridge Family]] magazine|date=March 1971|}}</ref> They included 30 songs which Farrell also co-wrote.  Among those songs were \"[[Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted]]\" (with Jim Cretecos and [[Mike Appel]]), and \"[[I'll Meet You Halfway]]\" (with [[Gerry Goffin]]), which were both top ten U.S. hits.

The album was a huge success staying 43 consecutive weeks in the Portuguese Albums Chart and peaking at number 1. The album was certified double platinum. The single \"Esta noite\" from the album became a major hit. David Carreira went on a big tour culminating in a concert at the Coliseu dos Recreios on 16 February 2013.\n\nOn 11 November 2013, he released his follow-up album ''[[A for\u00e7a est\u00e1 em n\u00f3s]]'' with the collaborations from [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Bxsoss AC]], [[Anselmo Ralph]], [[Diana Chaves]] and the French singer [[L\u00e9a Castel]].

The album was a huge success staying 43 consecutive weeks in the Portuguese Albums Chart and peaking at number 1. The album was certified double platinum. The single \"Esta noite\" from the album became a major hit. David Carreira went on a big tour culminating in a concert at the Coliseu dos Recreios on 16 February 2013.\n\nOn 11 November 2013, he released his follow-up album ''[[A for\u00e7a est\u00e1 em n\u00f3s]]'' with the collaborations from [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Bxsoss AC]], [[Anselmo Ralph]], [[Diana Chaves]] and the French singer [[L\u00e9a Castel]]. The albon the Portuguese Album Charts.\n\nSimultaneously with his Portuguese career, Carreira developed an international career starting with the French-language market through a deal with Warner France. His debut single in France was \"Obrigado la famille\", a duo with French rapper [[Dry (rapper)|Dry]]. The single was produced by [[Wati B]] who has produced major French hip hop acts like [[Sexion d'Assaut]], [[Ma\u00eetre Gims]] and [[The Shin Seka\u00ef]].\n\nThe single was an initial release from the forthcoming French-language album in 2014 on Warner Music France.

It lies at one end of the [[Boluminski Highway]] which runs {{convert|293|km|mi}} of sealed road to [[Namatanai]].\n\nKavieng has all the services one would expect from a local administrative centre: local government offices, shopping, hotels (namely the Kavieng Hotel, the Malagan Beach Resort hotel and the Kavieng Club, the former \"colonial club\" in the town), a hospital providing general medical, paediatric and surgical services, and a weekly market. There is also a large wharf for [[copra]] export on the town's edge, allowing deep-water ships to load copra and oil directly from the land.\n\nVisible from Kavieng are the many islands of the archipelago lying between New Ireland and [[New Hanover Island|New Hanover]], including Nusa Lik, Nusa Lawa, and Nango Island, which was formerly the site of a fish cannery in the 1960s and 1970s. Nango is the site of a new marine research centre for the PNG National Fisheries Authority. Its opening was overseen by the Governor-General of PNG Mr. Paulius Matane in July 2009.\n\n== History ==\nThe area was first charted by Dutch explorers in 1616, but it was not until the early 1900s (decade) that Kavieng town was founded by the [[Germany|German]] colonial administration. Though some on the island became quite wealthy with the development of copra plantations, Kavieng itself remained a tiny settlement, with as few as eighty residents. After the [[First World War]], Kavieng, as part of [[Papua New Guinea]], was ceded to Australian control. This resulted in the deportation of German missionaries and the seizure of all German property in the town.\n\nOn 21 January 1942, during [[World War II]], Kavieng came under a massive aerial bombardment by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces. That night, the vast majority of [[Australia]]ns were evacuated from New Ireland. The Japanese invaded and occupied the island on 24 January. Over the next two years, almost all of the [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] who had remained on the island were killed by the Japanese. Rear Admiral [[Ryukichi Tamura]] gave the order to kill all the European prisoners in Kavieng if an imminent invasion by Allied forces was expected. At least twenty-three of these were executed in the Kavieng Wharf Massacre in March 1944, which later led to the perpetrators being sentenced for [[war crimes]]. By the time the Allies retook the island in 1945, Kavieng had been almost completely destroyed.\n\nAs a result of the Japanese occupation and subsequent Allied invasion there are a number of wartime relics in the town, most notably a large gun sitting above a bunker adjacent to the Harbour Road. Although not officially open to the public, the bunker has several openings allowing entry, and the gun position provides an extensive view of the harbour.\n\nToday Kavieng is home to a thriving tourism industry. Dive, trekking, and surf tourism predominate with all of the tourism depending on the rich biological diversity of New Ireland. The surf tourism industry has entered into partnerships with local land and reef owners to develop what they refer to as a \"surf management plan.\" This plan provides resource owners with income from the surfers and limits the number of surfers on any break at one time.\n\n==Climate==\nKavieng has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Kavieng\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 30.6\n|Feb high C = 30.6\n|Mar high C = 30.6\n|Apr high C = 30.4\n|May high C = 30.6\n|Jun high C = 30.3\n|Jul high C = 30.1\n|Aug high C = 30.2\n|Sep high C = 30.5\n|Oct high C = 30.7\n|Nov high C = 30.7\n|Dec high C = 30.4\n  \n|Jan mean C = 27.3\n|Feb mean C = 27.3\n|Mar mean C = 27.2\n|Apr mean C = 26.9\n|May mean C = 26.6\n|Jun mean C = 25.7\n|Jul mean C = 25.1\n|Aug mean C = 25.0\n|Sep mean C = 25.6\n|Oct mean C = 26.3\n|Nov mean C = 26.8\n|Dec mean C = 27.2\n\n|Jan low C = 23.0\n|Feb low C = 23.1\n|Mar low C = 23.1\n|Apr low C = 22.9\n|May low C = 23.1\n|Jun low C = 22.4\n|Jul low C = 22.0\n|Aug low C = 21.8\n|Sep low C = 22.3\n|Oct low C = 22.7\n|Nov low C = 22.7\n|Dec low C = 23.0\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm= 316\n|Feb precipitation mm= 269\n|Mar precipitation mm= 344\n|Apr precipitation mm= 297\n|May precipitation mm= 249\n|Jun precipitation mm= 224\n|Jul precipitation mm= 223\n|Aug precipitation mm= 199\n|Sep precipitation mm= 167\n|Oct precipitation mm= 239\n|Nov precipitation mm= 256\n|Dec precipitation mm= 326\n|year precipitation mm= \n\n|source =<ref>https://en.climate-data.org/location/766073</ref>\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kavieng Urban LLG]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Murray, Mary.

Prior to India's independence from the British, Himachal comprised the hilly regions of [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] of [[British India]]. After independence, many of the hilly territories were organized as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh which later became a union territory. In 1966, hilly areas of neighboring [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.\n\nHimachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them.
