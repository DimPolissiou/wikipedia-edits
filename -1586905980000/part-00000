The three underscores are an syntax for a {{code|BlankNullSequence[]}}, for a sequence that can be null.\n\nA ReplaceRepeated {{code|//.}} operator can be used to apply this rule repeatedly, until no more change happens:\n<source lang=mathematica>\n{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 } //. sortRule\n(* = ReplaceRepeated[{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 }, sortRule] *)\n(* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} *)\n</source>\n\nThe pattern matching system also easily gives rise to rule-based integration and derivation.

The three underscores are an syntax for a {{code|BlankNullSequence[]}}, for a sequence that can be null.\n\nA ReplaceRepeated {{code|//.}} operator can be used to apply this rule repeatedly, until no more change happens:\n<source lang=mathematica>\n{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 } //. sortRule\n(* = ReplaceRepeated[{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 }, sortRule] *)\n(* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} *)\n</source>\n\nThe pattern matching system also easily gives rise to rule-based integration and derivation. The following are excerpts from the Rubi package of rules:<ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome to Rubi, the Rule-based Integrator |url=https://rulebasedintegration.org/ |website=Rule-based Integration}}</ref>\n<source lang=mathematica>\n(* Reciprocal rule *)\nInt[1/x_,x_Symbol] :=\n  Log[x];\n(* Power rule *)\nInt[x_^m_.,x_Symbol] :=\n  x^(m+1)/(m+1) /;\nFreeQ[m,x] && NeQ[m,-1]\n</source>\n\n=== Online features ===\n<!-- Yeah, this is when it gets wishy-wishy. -->\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe official, and reference, implementation of the Wolfram Language lies in Mathematica and associated online services.

He is Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at [[Harvard University]], and is known for his advocacy of [[evolutionary psychology]] and the [[computational theory of mind]].\n\nPinker's academic specializations are [[perception|visual cognition]] and [[psycholinguistics]]. His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and [[grammar]], and the psychology of cooperation and communication, including [[euphemism]], [[innuendo]], emotional expression, and common knowledge. He has written two technical books that proposed a general theory of [[language acquisition]] and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In particular, his work with [[Alan Prince]] published in 1989 critiqued the [[connectionist]] model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, arguing instead that children use default rules such as adding \"-ed\" to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one.\n\nPinker is also the author of eight books for general audiences. His earlier works argue that the human faculty for language is an [[instinct]], an innate behavior shaped by [[natural selection]] and [[adaptation|adapted]] to our communication needs. ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' (1994), ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997), ''[[Words and Rules]]'' (2000), ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), and ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' (2007), describe aspects of [the field of] psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. Pinker's ''[[The Sense of Style]]'' (2014), as a general [[style guide]], is another language-oriented work. Informed by modern science and psychology, it offers advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explains why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.\n\nPinker's two other books for the public leave behind individual questions of language and learning in favor of broader societal themes. ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'' (2011) makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. ''[[Enlightenment Now]]'' (2018) continues the optimistic thesis of ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' by using social science data from various sources to argue for a general improvement of the human condition over recent history.\n\nPinker has been named as one of the world's most influential intellectuals by various magazines. He has won awards from the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain|Royal Institution]], the [[Cognitive Neuroscience Society]] and the [[American Humanist Association]]. He delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 2013. He has served on the editorial boards of a variety of journals, and on the advisory boards of several institutions. He has frequently participated in public debates on science and society.\n\n==Biography==\nPinker was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], in 1954, to a middle-class Jewish family.

He wrote a tutorial review of the field followed by two books that advanced his own theory of language acquisition, and a series of experiments on how children acquire the passive, dative, and locative constructions. These books were ''Language Learnability and Language Development'' (1984), in Pinker's words \"outlin[ing] a theory of how children acquire the words and grammatical structures of their mother tongue\",<ref name=LongBiog>{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html | title=Steven Pinker: Long Biography | publisher=Harvard University | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051229054325/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html | archivedate=29 December 2005 }}</ref> and ''Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure'' (1989), in Pinker's words \"focus[ing] on one aspect of this process, the ability to use different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences, such as intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and verbs taking different combinations of complements and indirect objects\".<ref name=LongBiog/> He then focused on verbs of two kinds that illustrate what he considers to be the processes required for human language: retrieving whole words from memory, like the past form of the [[Regular and irregular verbs|irregular verb]]<ref>Pinker has written a piece on [http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_03_landfall.html The Irregular Verbs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606015902/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_03_landfall.html |date=2014-06-06 }}, stating that \"I like the Irregular verbs of English, all 180 of them, because of what they tell us about the history of  the  language  and  the  human  minds  that  have perpetuated it.</ref> \"bring\", namely \"brought\"; and using rules to combine (parts of) words, like the past form of the regular verb \"walk\", namely \"walked\".<ref name=LongBiog/>\n\nIn 1988 Pinker and [[Alan Prince]] published an influential critique of a [[connectionist]] model of the acquisition of the past tense (a textbook problem in language acquisition), followed by a series of studies of how people use and acquire the past tense. This included a monograph on children's [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of irregular forms and his popular 1999 book, ''[[Words and Rules|Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language]]''. Pinker argued that language depends on two things, the associative remembering of sounds and their meanings in words, and the use of rules to manipulate symbols for [[grammar]]. He presented evidence against connectionism, where a child would have to learn all forms of all words and would simply retrieve each needed form from memory, in favour of the older alternative theory, the use of words and rules combined by [[generative phonology]]. He showed that mistakes made by children indicate the use of default rules to add suffixes such as \"-ed\": for instance 'breaked' and 'comed' for 'broke' and 'came'. He argued that this shows that irregular verb-forms in English have to be learnt and retrieved from memory individually, and that the children making these errors were predicting the regular \"-ed\" ending in an open-ended way by applying a mental rule. This rule for combining verb stems and the usual suffix can be expressed as<ref name=WRessay>{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Edinburgh.pdf | title=Words and rules (essay) | publisher=Harvard University | accessdate=24 May 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830145603/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Edinburgh.pdf | archivedate=30 August 2014 }}</ref> V<sub>past</sub> \u2192 V<sub>stem</sub> + d, where V is a verb and d is the regular ending. Pinker further argued that since the ten most frequently occurring English verbs (be, have, do, say, make ... ) are all irregular, while 98.2% of  the thousand least common verbs are regular, there is a \"massive correlation\" of frequency and irregularity. He explains this by arguing that every irregular form, such as 'took', 'came' and 'got', has to be committed to memory by the children in each generation, or else lost, and that the common forms are the most easily memorized.

In his interview on the [[Point of Inquiry]] podcast in 2007, he provides the following examples of what he considers defensible conclusions of what science says human nature is:\n* The sexes are not statistically identical; \"their interests and talents form two overlapping distributions\". Any policy that wants to provide equal outcomes for both men and women will have to discriminate against one or the other.\n* \"Individuals differ in personality and intelligence.\"\n* \"People favor themselves and their families over an abstraction called society.\"\n* Humans are \"systematically self deceived. Each one of us thinks of ourselves as more competent and benevolent than we are.\"\n* \"People crave status and power\"\n\nHe informs the listeners that one can read more about human nature in his book, ''Blank Slate''.\n\nPinker also speaks about [[evolutionary psychology]] in the podcast and believes that this area of science is going to pay off. He cites the fact that there are many areas of study, such as beauty, religion, play, and sexuality, that were not studied 15 years ago. It is thanks to evolutionary psychology that these areas are being studied.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\" />\n\n==Popularization of science==\n[[File:Steven Pinker 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|Pinker in 2011.]]\n\n===Human cognition and natural language===\n{{main|The Language Instinct|Words and Rules|How the Mind Works|The Blank Slate|The Stuff of Thought}}\n\n<!--[[File:AmericanBeaver.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Pinker argues that the human faculty for [[language]] is as much an instinct as a [[beaver]]'s ability to build dams.]]-->\nPinker's 1994 ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' was the first of several books to combine [[cognitive science]] with [[behavioral genetics]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. It introduces the science of language and popularizes [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language \u2013 that it needs to be taught, that people's [[grammar]] is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]] that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that [[Great Ape language|other great apes can learn languages]]. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an [[instinct]] as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a [[spider]]'s web-weaving or a [[beaver]]'s dam-building.\n\nPinker states in his introduction that his ideas are \"deeply influenced\"<ref name=LIintro/> by Chomsky; he also lists scientists whom Chomsky influenced to \"open up whole new areas of language study, from child development and speech perception to neurology and genetics\"<ref name=LIintro/> \u2014 [[Eric Lenneberg]], [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], [[Roger William Brown|Roger Brown]], [[Morris Halle]] and [[Alvin Liberman]].<ref name=LIintro>{{cite book | title=The Language Instinct | publisher=Penguin | author=Pinker, Steven | year=1994 | pages=23\u201324}}</ref> Brown mentored Pinker through his thesis; Pinker stated that Brown's \"funny and instructive\"<ref name=BrownObit>{{cite journal | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Brown_obituary.pdf | title=Obituary: Roger Brown | author=Pinker, Steven | journal=Cognition | year=1998 | pages=199\u2013213 (see page 205) | doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(98)00027-4 | volume=66 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518180224/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Brown_obituary.pdf | archivedate=2015-05-18 }}</ref> book ''Words and Things'' (1958) was one of the inspirations for ''The Language Instinct''.<ref name=BrownObit/><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/brown-roger-w.pdf | title=Roger William Brown 1925-1997 | author=Kagan, Jerome | journal=Biographical Memoirs | year=1999 | volume=77 | pages=7}}</ref>\n\nThe reality of Pinker's proposed language instinct, and the related claim that grammar is innate and genetically based, has been contested by many linguists. One prominent opponent of Pinker's view is [[Geoffrey Sampson]] whose 1997 book, ''[[Educating Eve|Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate]]'' has been described as the \"definitive response\" to Pinker's book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/1449/|title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate|publisher=University of Sussex}}</ref><ref name=Sampson>{{cite web | url=http://www.grsampson.net/REmpNat.html | title=Empiricism v.

In his 1996 book ''Impossible Minds'', the [[machine intelligence]] researcher [[Igor Aleksander]] calls ''The Language Instinct'' excellent, and argues that Pinker presents a relatively soft claim for innatism, accompanied by a strong dislike of the 'Standard Social Sciences Model' or SSSM (Pinker's term), which supposes that development is purely dependent on culture. Further, Aleksander writes that while Pinker criticises some attempts to explain language processing with neural nets, Pinker later makes use of a neural net to create past tense verb forms correctly. Aleksander concludes that while he doesn't support the SSSM, \"a cultural repository of language just seems the easy trick for an efficient evolutionary system armed with an iconic [[state machine]] to play.\"<ref name=Aleksander>{{cite book | title=Impossible Minds | author=Aleksander, Igor | year=1996 | pages=228\u2013234 | isbn=1-86094-030-7}}</ref>\n\nTwo other books, ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), broadly surveyed the mind and defended the idea of a complex human nature with many mental faculties that are [[adaptive]] (Pinker is an ally of [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] in many disputes surrounding [[adaptationism]]). Another major theme in Pinker's theories is that human cognition works, in part, by combinatorial symbol-manipulation, not just associations among sensory features, as in many connectionist models. On the debate around ''The Blank Slate'', Pinker called [[Thomas Sowell]]'s book ''[[A Conflict of Visions]]'' \"wonderful\",<ref name=Sailer>{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/media_articles/2002_10_30_upi.html | title=Q&A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate' | agency=United Press International | date=30 October 2002 | accessdate=10 May 2014 | author=Sailer, Steve}}</ref> and explained that \"The Tragic Vision\" and the \"Utopian Vision\" are the views of human nature behind [[right-wing|right-]] and left-wing ideologies.<ref name=Sailer/>\n\nIn ''[[Words and Rules|Words and Rules: the Ingredients of Language]]'' (1999), Pinker argues from his own research that regular and irregular phenomena are products of computation and memory lookup, respectively, and that language can be understood as an interaction between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/wr/index.html |title=Words and Rules (book) |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=24 May 2014 |author=Pinker, Steven |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330020838/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/wr/index.html |archivedate=March 30, 2014 }}</ref> \"Words and Rules\" is also the title of an essay by Pinker outlining many of the topics discussed in the book.<ref name=WRessay/> Critiqueing the book from the perspective of [[generative linguistics]] [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]], in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', writes that \"this book never runs low on [[hubris]] or [[hyperbole]]\".<ref name=LRB>{{cite journal | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n16/charles-yang/dig-dug-think-thunk | title=Dig-dug, think-thunk (review of ''Words and Rules'' by Steven Pinker) | author=Yang, Charles | journal=London Review of Books | date=24 August 2000 | volume=22 | issue=6 | page=33}}</ref> The book's topic, the English past tense, is in Yang's view unglamorous, and Pinker's attempts at compromise risk being in no man's land between rival theories. Giving the example of German, Yang argues that irregular nouns in that language at least all belong to classes, governed by rules, and that things get even worse in languages that attach prefixes and suffixes to make up long 'words': they can't be learnt individually, as there are untold numbers of combinations. \"All Pinker (and the connectionists) are doing is turning over the rocks at the base of the intellectual landslide caused by the Chomskian revolution.\"<ref name=LRB/>\n\nIn ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' (2007), Pinker looks at a wide range of issues around the way words related to thoughts on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to [[Stone Age]] life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/stuff/index.html | title=The Stuff of Thought | publisher=Harvard University | accessdate=30 May 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509163145/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/stuff/index.html | archivedate=9 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nPinker is critical of theories about the [[Evolution of language|evolutionary origins of language]] that argue that linguistic cognition might have evolved from earlier musical cognition. He sees language as being tied primarily to the capacity for logical reasoning, and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] \u2014 a feature not adaptive in its own right, but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical, and thus selected for. In ''How the Mind Works'', Pinker reiterates [[Immanuel Kant]]'s view  that music is not in itself an important cognitive phenomenon, but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio-motor cognitive functions. Pinker compares music to \"auditory cheesecake\", stating that \"As far as biological cause and effect is concerned, music is useless\". This argument has been rejected by [[Daniel Levitin]] and [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]], experts in [[music cognition]], who argue that music has had an important role in the evolution of human cognition.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Levitin | first1 = D.

Pinker considers it unlikely that human nature has changed. In his view, it is more likely that human nature comprises inclinations toward violence and those that counteract them, the \"better angels of our nature\". He outlines six 'major historical declines of violence' that all have their own socio/cultural/economic causes:<ref name=\"http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence\">{{cite web|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Decline of Violence|url=http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence|publisher=IAI|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n# \"The Pacification Process\" \u2013 The rise of organized systems of government has a correlative relationship with the decline in violent deaths. As states expand they prevent tribal feuding, reducing losses.\n# \"The Civilizing Process\" \u2013 Consolidation of centralized states and kingdoms throughout Europe results in the rise of criminal justice and commercial infrastructure, organizing previously chaotic systems that could lead to raiding and mass violence.\n# \"The Humanitarian Revolution\" \u2013 The 18th - 20th  century abandonment of institutionalized violence by the state (breaking on the wheel, burning at the stake). Suggests this is likely due to the spike in literacy after the invention of the printing press thereby allowing the proletariat to question conventional wisdom.\n# \"The Long Peace\" \u2013 The powers of 20th Century believed that period of time to be the bloodiest in history. This led to a largely peaceful 65-year period post World War I and World War II. Developed countries have stopped warring (against each other and colonially), adopted democracy, and this has led a massive decline (on average) of deaths.\n# \"The New Peace\" \u2013  The decline in organized conflicts of all kinds since the end of the Cold War.\n# \"The Rights Revolutions\" \u2013 The reduction of systemic violence at smaller scales against vulnerable populations (racial minorities, women, children, homosexuals, animals).\n\nThe book was welcomed by many critics and reviewers, who found its arguments convincing and its synthesis of a large volume of historical evidence compelling.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Horgan |title=Will War Ever End?

He is Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at [[Harvard University]], and is known for his advocacy of [[evolutionary psychology]] and the [[computational theory of mind]].\n\nPinker's academic specializations are [[perception|visual cognition]] and [[psycholinguistics]]. His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and [[grammar]], and the psychology of cooperation and communication, including [[euphemism]], [[innuendo]], emotional expression, and common knowledge. He has written two technical books that proposed a general theory of [[language acquisition]] and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In particular, his work with [[Alan Prince]] published in 1989 critiqued the [[connectionist]] model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, arguing instead that children use default rules such as adding \"-ed\" to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one.\n\nPinker is also the author of eight books for general audiences. His earlier works argue that the human faculty for language is an [[instinct]], an innate behavior shaped by [[natural selection]] and [[adaptation|adapted]] to our communication needs. ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' (1994), ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997), ''[[Words and Rules]]'' (2000), ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), and ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' (2007), describe aspects of [the field of] psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. Pinker's ''[[The Sense of Style]]'' (2014), as a general [[style guide]], is another language-oriented work. Informed by modern science and psychology, it offers advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explains why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.\n\nPinker's two other books for the public leave behind individual questions of language and learning in favor of broader societal themes. ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'' (2011) makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. ''[[Enlightenment Now]]'' (2018) continues the optimistic thesis of ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' by using social science data from various sources to argue for a general improvement of the human condition over recent history.\n\nPinker has been named as one of the world's most influential intellectuals by various magazines. He has won awards from the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain|Royal Institution]], the [[Cognitive Neuroscience Society]] and the [[American Humanist Association]].

He wrote a tutorial review of the field followed by two books that advanced his own theory of language acquisition, and a series of experiments on how children acquire the passive, dative, and locative constructions. These books were ''Language Learnability and Language Development'' (1984), in Pinker's words \"outlin[ing] a theory of how children acquire the words and grammatical structures of their mother tongue\",<ref name=LongBiog>{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html | title=Steven Pinker: Long Biography | publisher=Harvard University | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051229054325/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html | archivedate=29 December 2005 }}</ref> and ''Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure'' (1989), in Pinker's words \"focus[ing] on one aspect of this process, the ability to use different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences, such as intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and verbs taking different combinations of complements and indirect objects\".<ref name=LongBiog/> He then focused on verbs of two kinds that illustrate what he considers to be the processes required for human language: retrieving whole words from memory, like the past form of the [[Regular and irregular verbs|irregular verb]]<ref>Pinker has written a piece on [http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_03_landfall.html The Irregular Verbs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606015902/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_03_landfall.html |date=2014-06-06 }}, stating that \"I like the Irregular verbs of English, all 180 of them, because of what they tell us about the history of  the  language  and  the  human  minds  that  have perpetuated it.</ref> \"bring\", namely \"brought\"; and using rules to combine (parts of) words, like the past form of the regular verb \"walk\", namely \"walked\".<ref name=LongBiog/>\n\nIn 1988 Pinker and [[Alan Prince]] published an influential critique of a [[connectionist]] model of the acquisition of the past tense (a textbook problem in language acquisition), followed by a series of studies of how people use and acquire the past tense. This included a monograph on children's [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of irregular forms and his popular 1999 book, ''[[Words and Rules|Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language]]''. Pinker argued that language depends on two things, the associative remembering of sounds and their meanings in words, and the use of rules to manipulate symbols for [[grammar]]. He presented evidence against connectionism, where a child would have to learn all forms of all words and would simply retrieve each needed form from memory, in favour of the older alternative theory, the use of words and rules combined by [[generative phonology]]. He showed that mistakes made by children indicate the use of default rules to add suffixes such as \"-ed\": for instance 'breaked' and 'comed' for 'broke' and 'came'. He argued that this shows that irregular verb-forms in English have to be learnt and retrieved from memory individually, and that the children making these errors were predicting the regular \"-ed\" ending in an open-ended way by applying a mental rule. This rule for combining verb stems and the usual suffix can be expressed as<ref name=WRessay>{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Edinburgh.pdf | title=Words and rules (essay) | publisher=Harvard University | accessdate=24 May 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830145603/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Edinburgh.pdf | archivedate=30 August 2014 }}</ref> V<sub>past</sub> \u2192 V<sub>stem</sub> + d, where V is a verb and d is the regular ending. Pinker further argued that since the ten most frequently occurring English verbs (be, have, do, say, make ... ) are all irregular, while 98.2% of  the thousand least common verbs are regular, there is a \"massive correlation\" of frequency and irregularity. He explains this by arguing that every irregular form, such as 'took', 'came' and 'got', has to be committed to memory by the children in each generation, or else lost, and that the common forms are the most easily memorized. Any irregular verb that falls in popularity past a certain point is lost, and all future generations will treat it as a regular verb instead.<ref name=WRessay/>\n\nIn 1990, Pinker, with [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]], published the paper \"Natural Language and Natural Selection\", arguing that the human language faculty must have evolved through [[natural selection]].<ref>Pinker,&nbsp;S. & Bloom, P.

In his interview on the [[Point of Inquiry]] podcast in 2007, he provides the following examples of what he considers defensible conclusions of what science says human nature is:\n* The sexes are not statistically identical; \"their interests and talents form two overlapping distributions\". Any policy that wants to provide equal outcomes for both men and women will have to discriminate against one or the other.\n* \"Individuals differ in personality and intelligence.\"\n* \"People favor themselves and their families over an abstraction called society.\"\n* Humans are \"systematically self deceived. Each one of us thinks of ourselves as more competent and benevolent than we are.\"\n* \"People crave status and power\"\n\nHe informs the listeners that one can read more about human nature in his book, ''Blank Slate''.\n\nPinker also speaks about [[evolutionary psychology]] in the podcast and believes that this area of science is going to pay off. He cites the fact that there are many areas of study, such as beauty, religion, play, and sexuality, that were not studied 15 years ago. It is thanks to evolutionary psychology that these areas are being studied.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\" />\n\n==Popularization of science==\n[[File:Steven Pinker 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|Pinker in 2011.]]\n\n===Human cognition and natural language===\n{{main|The Language Instinct|Words and Rules|How the Mind Works|The Blank Slate|The Stuff of Thought}}\n\n<!--[[File:AmericanBeaver.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Pinker argues that the human faculty for [[language]] is as much an instinct as a [[beaver]]'s ability to build dams.]]-->\nPinker's 1994 ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' was the first of several books to combine [[cognitive science]] with [[behavioral genetics]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. It introduces the science of language and popularizes [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language \u2013 that it needs to be taught, that people's [[grammar]] is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]] that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that [[Great Ape language|other great apes can learn languages]]. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an [[instinct]] as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a [[spider]]'s web-weaving or a [[beaver]]'s dam-building.\n\nPinker states in his introduction that his ideas are \"deeply influenced\"<ref name=LIintro/> by Chomsky; he also lists scientists whom Chomsky influenced to \"open up whole new areas of language study, from child development and speech perception to neurology and genetics\"<ref name=LIintro/> \u2014 [[Eric Lenneberg]], [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], [[Roger William Brown|Roger Brown]], [[Morris Halle]] and [[Alvin Liberman]].<ref name=LIintro>{{cite book | title=The Language Instinct | publisher=Penguin | author=Pinker, Steven | year=1994 | pages=23\u201324}}</ref> Brown mentored Pinker through his thesis; Pinker stated that Brown's \"funny and instructive\"<ref name=BrownObit>{{cite journal | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Brown_obituary.pdf | title=Obituary: Roger Brown | author=Pinker, Steven | journal=Cognition | year=1998 | pages=199\u2013213 (see page 205) | doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(98)00027-4 | volume=66 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518180224/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Brown_obituary.pdf | archivedate=2015-05-18 }}</ref> book ''Words and Things'' (1958) was one of the inspirations for ''The Language Instinct''.<ref name=BrownObit/><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/brown-roger-w.pdf | title=Roger William Brown 1925-1997 | author=Kagan, Jerome | journal=Biographical Memoirs | year=1999 | volume=77 | pages=7}}</ref>\n\nThe reality of Pinker's proposed language instinct, and the related claim that grammar is innate and genetically based, has been contested by many linguists.

In his 1996 book ''Impossible Minds'', the [[machine intelligence]] researcher [[Igor Aleksander]] calls ''The Language Instinct'' excellent, and argues that Pinker presents a relatively soft claim for innatism, accompanied by a strong dislike of the 'Standard Social Sciences Model' or SSSM (Pinker's term), which supposes that development is purely dependent on culture. Further, Aleksander writes that while Pinker criticises some attempts to explain language processing with neural nets, Pinker later makes use of a neural net to create past tense verb forms correctly. Aleksander concludes that while he doesn't support the SSSM, \"a cultural repository of language just seems the easy trick for an efficient evolutionary system armed with an iconic [[state machine]] to play.\"<ref name=Aleksander>{{cite book | title=Impossible Minds | author=Aleksander, Igor | year=1996 | pages=228\u2013234 | isbn=1-86094-030-7}}</ref>\n\nTwo other books, ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), broadly surveyed the mind and defended the idea of a complex human nature with many mental faculties that are [[adaptive]] (Pinker is an ally of [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] in many disputes surrounding [[adaptationism]]). Another major theme in Pinker's theories is that human cognition works, in part, by combinatorial symbol-manipulation, not just associations among sensory features, as in many connectionist models.

Giving the example of German, Yang argues that irregular nouns in that language at least all belong to classes, governed by rules, and that things get even worse in languages that attach prefixes and suffixes to make up long 'words': they can't be learnt individually, as there are untold numbers of combinations. \"All Pinker (and the connectionists) are doing is turning over the rocks at the base of the intellectual landslide caused by the Chomskian revolution.\"<ref name=LRB/>\n\nIn ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' (2007), Pinker looks at a wide range of issues around the way words related to thoughts on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to [[Stone Age]] life could work in the modern world.

He sees language as being tied primarily to the capacity for logical reasoning, and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] \u2014 a feature not adaptive in its own right, but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical, and thus selected for. In ''How the Mind Works'', Pinker reiterates [[Immanuel Kant]]'s view  that music is not in itself an important cognitive phenomenon, but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio-motor cognitive functions. Pinker compares music to \"auditory cheesecake\", stating that \"As far as biological cause and effect is concerned, music is useless\". This argument has been rejected by [[Daniel Levitin]] and [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]], experts in [[music cognition]], who argue that music has had an important role in the evolution of human cognition.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Levitin | first1 = D.

Pinker considers it unlikely that human nature has changed. In his view, it is more likely that human nature comprises inclinations toward violence and those that counteract them, the \"better angels of our nature\". He outlines six 'major historical declines of violence' that all have their own socio/cultural/economic causes:<ref name=\"http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence\">{{cite web|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Decline of Violence|url=http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence|publisher=IAI|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n# \"The Pacification Process\" \u2013 The rise of organized systems of government has a correlative relationship with the decline in violent deaths. As states expand they prevent tribal feuding, reducing losses.\n# \"The Civilizing Process\" \u2013 Consolidation of centralized states and kingdoms throughout Europe results in the rise of criminal justice and commercial infrastructure, organizing previously chaotic systems that could lead to raiding and mass violence.\n# \"The Humanitarian Revolution\" \u2013 The 18th - 20th  century abandonment of institutionalized violence by the state (breaking on the wheel, burning at the stake). Suggests this is likely due to the spike in literacy after the invention of the printing press thereby allowing the proletariat to question conventional wisdom.\n# \"The Long Peace\" \u2013 The powers of 20th Century believed that period of time to be the bloodiest in history. This led to a largely peaceful 65-year period post World War I and World War II. Developed countries have stopped warring (against each other and colonially), adopted democracy, and this has led a massive decline (on average) of deaths.\n# \"The New Peace\" \u2013  The decline in organized conflicts of all kinds since the end of the Cold War.\n# \"The Rights Revolutions\" \u2013 The reduction of systemic violence at smaller scales against vulnerable populations (racial minorities, women, children, homosexuals, animals).\n\nThe book was welcomed by many critics and reviewers, who found its arguments convincing and its synthesis of a large volume of historical evidence compelling.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Horgan |title=Will War Ever End?
