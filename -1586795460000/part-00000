The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

{"title_page": "Nauvoo Illinois Temple", "text_new": "{{for|the original structure on the same site|Nauvoo Temple}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{ LDS Temple/Nauvoo Illinois Temple |format= Infobox LDS Temple }}\n\nThe '''Nauvoo Illinois Temple''' is the 113th dedicated [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). It is the third such temple that has been built in [[Illinois]] (the [[Nauvoo Temple|original Nauvoo Temple]] and [[Chicago Illinois Temple]] being the others).\n\n==History==\nLocated in the town of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], the temple's construction was announced on April 4, 1999, by [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]]. Groundbreaking was conducted on October 24, 1999 and the cornerstones were laid November 5, 2000. The structure itself was built in the [[Greek Revival]] architectural style using limestone block quarried in [[Russellville, Alabama]]. It is built in the same location as the [[Nauvoo Temple|original structure]] that was dedicated in 1846.\n\nThe origins of the temple go back to 1937. In that year, Wilford C. Wood purchased some of the land on behalf of the LDS Church and purchased another piece of land that he later sold to the church. He also organized a group of church members from the Chicago Illinois [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]], co-led by Ariel S. Williams, to clear and beautify the recently purchased land. At the time, the Chicago Stake was one of only two east of the Mississippi River.<ref>[https://rsc.byu.edu/es/archived/nauvoo-temple-story-faith/13-temple-rebuilt Don F. Colvin. ''Nauvoo Temple: A Story of Faith''. BYU Religious Studies Center, Chapter 13]</ref>\n\nWood purchased land in 1951 that included a house which was made a visitors center for the temple site. In the late-1950s, and then in 1962, agents for the LDS Church completed the purchase of the temple lot.<ref>Colvin, ''Nauvoo Temple''</ref>\n\n==Exterior design and decoration==\nThe building measures {{convert|130|ft|m}} long, {{convert|90|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|162|ft|m}} tall to the top of the statue of angel Moroni.  It has an area of {{convert|54000|sqft|m2}}.  It is the only temple owned by the LDS Church today that has a bell tower, although the [[Kirtland Temple]] also has a bell tower. The temple spire is surmounted by a statue of the [[angel Moroni]] in standing position covered in gold leaf, following the pattern of the statue on the Salt Lake temple. The angel on the first Nauvoo temple was a weather vane, sculpted in tin and covered in gold. The figure was positioned horizontally as if it were flying. Clothed in a robe and cap, the angel held a book in one hand and a trumpet in the other.  \n\nChurch leaders and architects carefully worked to replicate the original exterior design of the [[Nauvoo Temple|19th-century temple]], which was damaged by an arson fire in 1848 and by a tornado on May 27, 1850. It was consequently condemned and demolished by the Nauvoo City Council. Construction materials and furniture were derived from the original design as well.\n\n==Interior design and decoration==\nIts interior floor plan is noticeably different from that of the old Nauvoo Temple. It was in the original Nauvoo Temple that the endowment ceremony assumed its present form. At the direction of Joseph Smith, the west end of the attic story was divided by cloth partitions into four spaces that were used to administer the Endowment ordinances. One of the canvas \"rooms\" was decorated with potted plants to suggest the Garden of Eden. This set a pattern that was followed for the Salt Lake City [[Endowment House]] and early Utah temples. These temples had a series of four rooms through which patrons moved during the presentation of the endowment. The first three rooms were decorated with murals representing, in succession, the creation of the world, the Garden of Eden, and the world after the fall of Adam and Eve. The fourth room, known as the Terrestrial Room, was ornately decorated but did not have murals on the walls. This pattern was followed through the [[Los Angeles Temple]], which was dedicated in 1956. After that, temples presented the endowment in one or two rooms without murals adorning the ordinance rooms. The use of murals resumed again in 2001 with the opening of the [[Columbia River Washington Temple]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}. The Nauvoo Illinois Temple is an  exception to this pattern, as it has the four-room progressive format with murals decorating the first three rooms. \n\nThe completion and official dedication took place on June 27, 2002, on the anniversary of the death of [[Joseph Smith]], the church's founder.\n\nUp to 1.5 million visitors a year have visited Nauvoo since the temple opened in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title= Mormon temple a tourism draw for tiny Nauvoo |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-08-22-mormon-temple-tourism_x.htm |first= Jan |last= Dennis |date= August 22, 2006 |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |agency= [[Associated Press|AP]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, like all the church's other temples, the Nauvoo Illinois Temple was closed in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>Stack, Peggy Fletcher.

He also organized a group of church members from the Chicago Illinois [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]], co-led by Ariel S. Williams, to clear and beautify the recently purchased land. At the time, the Chicago Stake was one of only two east of the Mississippi River.<ref>[https://rsc.byu.edu/es/archived/nauvoo-temple-story-faith/13-temple-rebuilt Don F. Colvin. ''Nauvoo Temple: A Story of Faith''. BYU Religious Studies Center, Chapter 13]</ref>\n\nWood purchased land in 1951 that included a house which was made a visitors center for the temple site. In the late-1950s, and then in 1962, agents for the LDS Church completed the purchase of the temple lot.<ref>Colvin, ''Nauvoo Temple''</ref>\n\n==Exterior design and decoration==\nThe building measures {{convert|130|ft|m}} long, {{convert|90|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|162|ft|m}} tall to the top of the statue of angel Moroni.  It has an area of {{convert|54000|sqft|m2}}.  It is the only temple owned by the LDS Church today that has a bell tower, although the [[Kirtland Temple]] also has a bell tower. The temple spire is surmounted by a statue of the [[angel Moroni]] in standing position covered in gold leaf, following the pattern of the statue on the Salt Lake temple. The angel on the first Nauvoo temple was a weather vane, sculpted in tin and covered in gold. The figure was positioned horizontally as if it were flying. Clothed in a robe and cap, the angel held a book in one hand and a trumpet in the other.  \n\nChurch leaders and architects carefully worked to replicate the original exterior design of the [[Nauvoo Temple|19th-century temple]], which was damaged by an arson fire in 1848 and by a tornado on May 27, 1850. It was consequently condemned and demolished by the Nauvoo City Council. Construction materials and furniture were derived from the original design as well.\n\n==Interior design and decoration==\nIts interior floor plan is noticeably different from that of the old Nauvoo Temple. It was in the original Nauvoo Temple that the endowment ceremony assumed its present form. At the direction of Joseph Smith, the west end of the attic story was divided by cloth partitions into four spaces that were used to administer the Endowment ordinances. This set a pattern that was followed for the Salt Lake City [[Endowment House]] and early temples in Utah. These temples had a series of four rooms through which patrons moved during the presentation of the endowment. The first three rooms were decorated with murals representing, in succession, the creation of the world, the Garden of Eden, and the world after the fall of Adam and Eve. The fourth room, known as the Terrestrial Room, was ornately decorated but did not have murals on the walls. This pattern was followed through the [[Los Angeles Temple]], which was dedicated in 1956. After that, temples presented the endowment in one or two rooms without murals adorning the ordinance rooms. The use of murals resumed again in 2001 with the opening of the [[Columbia River Washington Temple]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}. The Nauvoo Illinois Temple is an  exception to this pattern, as it has the four-room progressive format with murals decorating the first three rooms. \n\nThe completion and official dedication took place on June 27, 2002, on the anniversary of the death of [[Joseph Smith]], the church's founder.\n\nUp to 1.5 million visitors a year have visited Nauvoo since the temple opened in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title= Mormon temple a tourism draw for tiny Nauvoo |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-08-22-mormon-temple-tourism_x.htm |first= Jan |last= Dennis |date= August 22, 2006 |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |agency= [[Associated Press|AP]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, like all the church's other temples, the Nauvoo Illinois Temple was closed in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>Stack, Peggy Fletcher.

Written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], it is the sequel to ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and the second full-length installment of [[The Incredibles (franchise)|the franchise]]. The story follows the Parr family as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Catherine Keener]] and [[Jonathan Banks]]. [[Michael Giacchino]] returned to compose the score.\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Incredibles,'' Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\n\n''Incredibles 2'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in [[Disney Digital 3-D]], [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received largely positive reviews and praise for its animation, humor and musical score. The film made $182.7&nbsp;million in its opening weekend, setting the record for [[List of highest-grossing openings for animated films|best debut for an animated film]], and has grossed over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2018]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|fourth-highest-grossing animated film]] (behind the 2019 version of ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Frozen II]]'', and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'') and the [[List of highest-grossing films|18th-highest-grossing film]] of all time, along with being the third Pixar film to gross $1 billion after ''[[Finding Dory]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. ''Incredibles 2'' was named by the [[National Board of Review]] as the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film|Best Animated Film]] of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] and [[91st Academy Awards]], losing both to ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nFollowing immediately after the events of the [[The Incredibles|first film]], the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Parr Family|Incredibles]] and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Frozone|Frozone]] battle the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Underminer|Underminer]] who has just appeared to terrorize Municiberg. Though they prevent the destruction of City Hall, they are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage caused by the incident outrages the government and prompts them to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs and other superheroes without financial assistance. [[Violet Parr|Violet]]'s love interest [[List of The Incredibles characters#Tony Rydinger|Tony Rydinger]] also discovers her superhero identity, forcing agent [[List of The Incredibles characters#Rick Dicker|Rick Dicker]] to erase his memory of her. Frozone informs [[List of The Incredibles characters#Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible)|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Helen Parr (Pixar character)|Elastigirl]] of an offer from [[List of The Incredibles characters#Winston Deavor|Winston Deavor]], a wealthy businessman. He and his sister [[List of The Incredibles characters#Evelyn Deavor|Evelyn]] propose sending the heroes on secret missions which will be recorded and publicized to regain public trust in superheroes.\n\nDue to Mr. Incredible's tendency to accidentally cause collateral damage, Winston chooses Elastigirl for the initial missions. While Elastigirl is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: [[Dash Parr|Dash]] has trouble with math homework, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony fails to show up for their first date due to his memory wipe, and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. He takes Jack-Jack to [[Edna Mode]], who develops a suit that helps control his abilities. Meanwhile, on her missions, Elastigirl encounters a mysterious [[supervillain]] called the Screenslaver, who projects [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] images via TV screens. After preventing him from destroying a crowded runaway [[commuter rail|commuter train]], and thwarting his attempt to assassinate a diplomat, she tracks him down to his hideout in an apartment building, and following a brief struggle, unmasks him as a pizza deliveryman who claims to have no recollection of his actions.\n\nAt a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the ''Everjust''. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was being controlled by a pair of [[Mind control|mind-control]] goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself to be the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains that she has hated superheroes since [[List of The Incredibles characters#List of known superheroes|Gazerbeam and Fironic]] failed to save her father when he was murdered by burglars. The event led her to conclude that superheroes have taken independence from society, who in turn had become dangerously over-reliant on superheroes. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using Elastigirl, she lures Bob into a trap, then sends another group of hypnotized superheroes previously invited to the summit to subdue the Parr children. Frozone tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.\n\nViolet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by their father, and reach Winston's hydrofoil yacht. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air designed to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship's crew, aim the hydrofoil at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. The Parr children reach them, and Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles. She in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Incredibles and Frozone release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles, then work together to prevent the ''Everjust'' from crashing into the city by turning the ship. Evelyn attempts to escape in a jet, but is apprehended by Elastigirl and arrested. Due to their actions, superheroes around the world regain legal status.\n\nLater, Tony accompanies Violet to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit of gunmen by the [[police]], Violet leaves Tony at the theater, promising to be back in time, and the Incredibles give chase in a remodeled Incredimobile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Incredibles characters}}\n* [[Craig T.

Producer John Walker said, \"I think that one of the things that excited Brad and [[Ralph Eggleston]], the production designer, was the fact that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004.

He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' and ''Incredibles 2'', which meant that Bird's film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another ''Incredibles'' film, or something else.\" Cast members including [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Sophia Bush]] have expressed interest in reprising their roles.

Written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], it is the sequel to ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and the second full-length installment of [[The Incredibles (franchise)|the franchise]]. The story follows the Parr family as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Catherine Keener]] and [[Jonathan Banks]]. [[Michael Giacchino]] returned to compose the score.\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Incredibles,'' Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\n\n''Incredibles 2'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in [[Disney Digital 3-D]], [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received largely positive reviews and praise for its animation, humor and musical score. The film made $182.7&nbsp;million in its opening weekend, setting the record for [[List of highest-grossing openings for animated films|best debut for an animated film]], and has grossed over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2018]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|fourth-highest-grossing animated film]] (behind the 2019 version of ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Frozen II]]'', and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'') and the [[List of highest-grossing films|18th-highest-grossing film]] of all time, along with being the third Pixar film to gross $1 billion after ''[[Finding Dory]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. ''Incredibles 2'' was named by the [[National Board of Review]] as the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film|Best Animated Film]] of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] and [[91st Academy Awards]], losing both to ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nFollowing immediately after the events of the [[The Incredibles|first film]], the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Parr Family|Incredibles]] and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Frozone|Frozone]] battle the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Underminer|Underminer]] who has just appeared to terrorize Municiberg. Though they prevent the destruction of City Hall, they are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage caused by the incident outrages the government and prompts them to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs and other superheroes without financial assistance. [[Violet Parr|Violet]]'s love interest [[List of The Incredibles characters#Tony Rydinger|Tony Rydinger]] also discovers her superhero identity, forcing agent [[List of The Incredibles characters#Rick Dicker|Rick Dicker]] to erase his memory of her. Frozone informs [[List of The Incredibles characters#Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible)|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Helen Parr (Pixar character)|Elastigirl]] of an offer from [[List of The Incredibles characters#Winston Deavor|Winston Deavor]], a wealthy businessman. He and his sister [[List of The Incredibles characters#Evelyn Deavor|Evelyn]] propose sending the heroes on secret missions which will be recorded and publicized to regain public trust in superheroes.\n\nDue to Mr. Incredible's tendency to accidentally cause collateral damage, Winston chooses Elastigirl for the initial missions. While Elastigirl is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: [[Dash Parr|Dash]] has trouble with math homework, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony fails to show up for their first date due to his memory wipe, and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. He takes Jack-Jack to [[Edna Mode]], who develops a suit that helps control his abilities. Meanwhile, on her missions, Elastigirl encounters a mysterious [[supervillain]] called the Screenslaver, who projects [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] images via TV screens. After preventing him from destroying a crowded runaway [[commuter rail|commuter train]], and thwarting his attempt to assassinate a diplomat, she tracks him down to his hideout in an apartment building, and following a brief struggle, unmasks him as a pizza deliveryman who claims to have no recollection of his actions.\n\nAt a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the ''Everjust''. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was being controlled by a pair of [[Mind control|mind-control]] goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself to be the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains that she has hated superheroes since [[List of The Incredibles characters#List of known superheroes|Gazerbeam and Fironic]] failed to save her father when he was murdered by burglars. The event led her to conclude that superheroes have taken independence from society, who in turn had become dangerously over-reliant on superheroes. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using Elastigirl, she lures Bob into a trap, then sends another group of hypnotized superheroes previously invited to the summit to subdue the Parr children. Frozone tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.\n\nViolet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by their father, and reach Winston's hydrofoil yacht. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air designed to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship's crew, aim the hydrofoil at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. The Parr children reach them, and Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles. She in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Incredibles and Frozone release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles, then work together to prevent the ''Everjust'' from crashing into the city by turning the ship. Evelyn attempts to escape in a jet, but is apprehended by Elastigirl and arrested. Due to their actions, superheroes around the world regain legal status.\n\nLater, Tony accompanies Violet to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit of gunmen by the [[police]], Violet leaves Tony at the theater, promising to be back in time, and the Incredibles give chase in a remodeled Incredimobile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Incredibles characters}}\n* [[Craig T.

This allowed him to keep characters with the same superpowers and not have to develop new ones, nor did he need to figure out how to deal with Violet and Dash being adults. This also allowed him to keep Jack-Jack as an infant with an array of powers, which Bird likened to how [[Language acquisition|infants are able to understand numerous languages]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-incredibles-2-starts-exactly-where-the-origina/1100-6458277/ |title=Why Incredibles 2 Starts Exactly Where The Original Ended |first=Michael |last=Rougeau |date=April 16, 2018 |accessdate=April 16, 2018 |work=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> While the plot of the 2005 follow-up [[video game]] to ''The Incredibles'', ''[[The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer]]'', begins at that same point of time,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/14/15973580/the-incredibles-2-opening-pixar-d23 |title=The Incredibles 2 picks up right where the original left off |last=Sarkar |first=Samit |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date=July 14, 2017 |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> the film discards the game's continuity.

Producer John Walker said, \"I think that one of the things that excited Brad and [[Ralph Eggleston]], the production designer, was the fact that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004. There were no notions of, 'Well, we don't know how to do long hair, we don't know how to do humans, we don't know how to do muscles.' Everybody knows how to do it.

He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' and ''Incredibles 2'', which meant that Bird's film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another ''Incredibles'' film, or something else.\" Cast members including [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Sophia Bush]] have expressed interest in reprising their roles. Producer [[John Walker (film producer)|John Walker]] would not \"rule [a third film] out\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/06/17/incredibles-3-potential-brad-bird/ |title=Could there be an Incredibles 3?
