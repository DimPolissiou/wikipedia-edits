As a member of the powerful [[Salusbury Family]], she belonged to one of the most illustrious Welsh land-owning dynasties of the Georgian era. Through her father's line, she was a direct descendant of [[Katheryn of Berain]].\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Hester Lynch Thrale (Mrs Piozzi) 02185.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving of a ''Portrait of Mrs. Thrale at the age of 40'' by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n[[File:thralehouse.jpg|thumb|upright|Streatham Park]]\n\nAfter her father had gone bankrupt in an attempt to invest in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Canada, she married the rich brewer [[Henry Thrale]] on 11 October 1763, at St. Anne's Chapel, [[Soho]], London. They had 12 children and lived at [[Streatham|Streatham Park]]. The marriage often was strained, however: her husband frequently felt slighted by members of the court and may well have married to improve his social status. The Thrales' eldest daughter, [[Hester Maria Elphinstone, Viscountess Keith|Hester]], became a viscountess.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nAfter her marriage, Thrale was liberated and free to associate with whom she pleased. Due to her husband's financial status, she was able to enter London society, as a result of which she met [[Samuel Johnson]], [[James Boswell]], Bishop [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], and other literary figures, including the young [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney]], whom she took with her to [[Gay Street, Bath|Gay Street]], [[Bath, England|Bath]].<ref>Burney, F.

Her impression was that Thrale was very vexatious in wishing to engross all his attention, which annoyed him much.\"{{sfn |Stapleton Cotton |Stapleton Cotton |Knollys |1866 |page=22}}\n\nJohnson wrote two verses for Thrale in 1775, the first in celebration of her 35th birthday,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140316214121/http://www.thrale.com/mrs_thrale_35_verses].</ref> and another in Latin to honour her.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140316214609/http://www.thrale.com/latin_ode_hester_thrale].</ref>\n\nFanny Burney, in her diary, describes the conversations at several of Thrale's [[Party#Soir.C3.A9es|soir\u00e9es]], including one in 1779 about a young woman named Miss Sophy Streatfeild (1755\u20131835),<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45505]</ref> who was a favourite of both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Thrale, rather to the chagrin of Hester, who commented that Sophy \"had a power of captivation that was irresistible... her beauty joined to her softness, her caressing manners, her tearful eyes, and alluring looks, would insinuate her into the heart of any man she thought worth attacking.\"<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 32.</ref> The touch of understandable spite hereby revealed in Thrale's nature is tempered by her wry humour in remarking (after another of her male guests had professed devotion to Sophy and the desire to \"soothe\" her): \"I would ensure her power of crying herself into any of your hearts she pleased. I made her cry to Miss Burney, to show how beautiful she looked in tears\" and (on being rebuked about this) \"Oh but she liked it... Miss Burney would have run away but she came forward on purpose to show herself. Sophy Streatfeild is never happier than when tears trickle down from her fine eyes in company.\"<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 33.</ref>\n\nThe Thrales were in Bath in 1780 at the time of the [[Gordon Riots]], when a Roman Catholic chapel was set on fire,<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 54\u201356.</ref> although the greater worry was whether Mr. Thrale's brewery in Southwark would escape being ransacked, which it narrowly did.<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 59.</ref>\n\nFanny records Thrale's distress on losing her husband (4 April 1781), referring to her as \"sweet Mrs. Thrale\" and sympathising with the \"agitation\" she was under in having to sell the brewery and wind up his affairs. Fanny was there to congratulate and cheer Thrale when the business was concluded.<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\nDuring the ensuing years, Thrale fell in love with Gabriel Mario Piozzi, an Italian music teacher, and married him on 25 July 1784. She complained: \"I see the English newspapers are full of gross Insolence towards me,\" with one commenting how Thrale could not have imagined \"his wife's disgrace, by eventually raising an obscure and penniless Fiddler into sudden Wealth.\"{{sfn |Gopnik |2008}} This caused a rift with Johnson, which was only perfunctorily mended shortly before his death. The levelling marriage also earned her the disapproval of Fanny (who would herself marry in 1793 the impoverished, Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9 Alexandre D'Arblay) and her cousins the [[Viscount Combermere|Cottons]]. With her second husband, Hester retired to [[Brynbella]], a specially built [[country house]] on her Bach y Graig estate in the [[Vale of Clwyd]], near [[Tremeirchion]] village in north Wales. During this time she began to reflect heavily on her ancestry, and for a time became obsessed with the idea of reclaiming her father's Canadian lands in [[Herring Cove]], an enclave of [[Nova Scotia]].{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nAfter Johnson's death, she published ''[[Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson]]'' (1786) and their letters to each other (1788).<ref name=\"ODNB page\" >Michael J.

''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 187.</ref> Together with Thrale's diaries, which were known as ''[[Thraliana]]'', and were not published until 1949, these sources help to fill out the biased picture of Johnson often presented in Boswell's ''Life''. Johnson often stayed with the Thrale household and had his own room above the library at Streatham, in which he worked. Hester's papers provide more insight into his composition process.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nHer ''Retrospection: or a review of the most striking and important events, characters, situations, and their consequences which the last eighteen hundred years have presented to the view of mankind''<ref>Hester Thrale Piozzi, 2 vols, London: John Stockdale, 1801</ref> was an attempt at a popular history of that period, but it was not received well by critics, some of whom patently resented female intrusion into the male preserve of history. Posterity has been kinder. According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', \"it has since been seen as a [[feminist history]], concerned to show changes in manners and mores in so far as they affected women; it has also been judged to anticipate Marxian history in its keen apprehension of reification: 'machines imitated mortals to unhoped perfection, and men found out they were themselves machines.'\"<ref name=\"ODNB page\" />\n\nA lexicographer in her own right Mrs. Piozzi's ''British synonymy, or, An attempt at regulating the choice of words in familiar conversation'' was published in 1794, ten years after Dr. Johnson's death, by G.G. & J.

As a member of the powerful [[Salusbury Family]], she belonged to one of the most illustrious Welsh land-owning dynasties of the Georgian era. Through her father's line, she was a direct descendant of [[Katheryn of Berain]].\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Hester Lynch Thrale (Mrs Piozzi) 02185.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving of a ''Portrait of Mrs. Thrale at the age of 40'' by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n[[File:thralehouse.jpg|thumb|upright|Streatham Park]]\n\nAfter her father had gone bankrupt in an attempt to invest in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Canada, she married the rich brewer [[Henry Thrale]] on 11 October 1763, at St. Anne's Chapel, [[Soho]], London. They had 12 children and lived at [[Streatham|Streatham Park]]. The marriage often was strained, however: her husband frequently felt slighted by members of the court and may well have married to improve his social status. The Thrales' eldest daughter, [[Hester Maria Elphinstone, Viscountess Keith|Hester]], became a viscountess.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nAfter her marriage, Thrale was liberated and free to associate with whom she pleased. Due to her husband's financial status, she was able to enter London society, as a result of which she met [[Samuel Johnson]], [[James Boswell]], Bishop [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], and other literary figures, including the young [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney]], whom she took with her to [[Gay Street, Bath|Gay Street]], [[Bath, England|Bath]].<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nIn July 1774 Johnson visited Wales in Thrale's company,{{sfn |Boswell |1851 |page=185}} during which time they visited Hester's uncle [[Sir Lynch Cotton, 4th Baronet|Sir Lynch Cotton]] at [[Combermere Abbey|Combermere]] in Denbighshire.{{sfn |Broadley |1909 |page=176}} Frances, the wife of Sir Lynch's son [[Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton, 5th Baronet|Robert]] \"found Johnson, despite his rudeness, at times delightful, having a manner peculiar to himself in relating anecdotes that could not fail to attract old and young. Her impression was that Thrale was very vexatious in wishing to engross all his attention, which annoyed him much.\"{{sfn |Stapleton Cotton |Stapleton Cotton |Knollys |1866 |page=22}}\n\nJohnson wrote two verses for Thrale in 1775, the first in celebration of her 35th birthday,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140316214121/http://www.thrale.com/mrs_thrale_35_verses].</ref> and another in Latin to honour her.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140316214609/http://www.thrale.com/latin_ode_hester_thrale].</ref>\n\nFanny Burney, in her diary, describes the conversations at several of Thrale's [[Party#Soir.C3.A9es|soir\u00e9es]], including one in 1779 about a young woman named Miss Sophy Streatfeild (1755\u20131835),<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45505]</ref> who was a favourite of both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Thrale, rather to the chagrin of Hester, who commented that Sophy \"had a power of captivation that was irresistible... her beauty joined to her softness, her caressing manners, her tearful eyes, and alluring looks, would insinuate her into the heart of any man she thought worth attacking.\"<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 32.</ref> The touch of understandable spite hereby revealed in Thrale's nature is tempered by her wry humour in remarking (after another of her male guests had professed devotion to Sophy and the desire to \"soothe\" her): \"I would ensure her power of crying herself into any of your hearts she pleased. I made her cry to Miss Burney, to show how beautiful she looked in tears\" and (on being rebuked about this) \"Oh but she liked it... Miss Burney would have run away but she came forward on purpose to show herself. Sophy Streatfeild is never happier than when tears trickle down from her fine eyes in company.\"<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 33.</ref>\n\nThe Thrales were in Bath in 1780 at the time of the [[Gordon Riots]], when a Roman Catholic chapel was set on fire,<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 54\u201356.</ref> although the greater worry was whether Mr. Thrale's brewery in Southwark would escape being ransacked, which it narrowly did.<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 59.</ref>\n\nFanny records Thrale's distress on losing her husband (4 April 1781), referring to her as \"sweet Mrs. Thrale\" and sympathising with the \"agitation\" she was under in having to sell the brewery and wind up his affairs. Fanny was there to congratulate and cheer Thrale when the business was concluded.<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\nDuring the ensuing years, Thrale fell in love with Gabriel Mario Piozzi, an Italian music teacher, and married him on 25 July 1784. She complained: \"I see the English newspapers are full of gross Insolence towards me,\" with one commenting how Thrale could not have imagined \"his wife's disgrace, by eventually raising an obscure and penniless Fiddler into sudden Wealth.\"{{sfn |Gopnik |2008}} This caused a rift with Johnson, which was only perfunctorily mended shortly before his death. The levelling marriage also earned her the disapproval of Fanny (who would herself marry in 1793 the impoverished, Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9 Alexandre D'Arblay) and her cousins the [[Viscount Combermere|Cottons]]. With her second husband, Hester retired to [[Brynbella]], a specially built [[country house]] on her Bach y Graig estate in the [[Vale of Clwyd]], near [[Tremeirchion]] village in north Wales. During this time she began to reflect heavily on her ancestry, and for a time became obsessed with the idea of reclaiming her father's Canadian lands in [[Herring Cove]], an enclave of [[Nova Scotia]].{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nAfter Johnson's death, she published ''[[Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson]]'' (1786) and their letters to each other (1788).<ref name=\"ODNB page\" >Michael J. Franklin, \"Piozzi , Hester Lynch (1741\u20131821)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22309 Retrieved 25 April 2017.]</ref> Fanny Burney, who considered both Johnson and Thrale to be among her dearest friends, read the unpublished manuscript with much interest, but disapproved of the decision to publish, noting, \"She has given all \u2013 every word \u2013 and thinks that, perhaps, a justice to Dr. Johnson, which, in fact, is the greatest injury to his memory.\"<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 187.</ref> Together with Thrale's diaries, which were known as ''[[Thraliana]]'', and were not published until 1949, these sources help to fill out the biased picture of Johnson often presented in Boswell's ''Life''. Johnson often stayed with the Thrale household and had his own room above the library at Streatham, in which he worked. Hester's papers provide more insight into his composition process.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nHer ''Retrospection: or a review of the most striking and important events, characters, situations, and their consequences which the last eighteen hundred years have presented to the view of mankind''<ref>Hester Thrale Piozzi, 2 vols, London: John Stockdale, 1801</ref> was an attempt at a popular history of that period, but it was not received well by critics, some of whom patently resented female intrusion into the male preserve of history. Posterity has been kinder. According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', \"it has since been seen as a [[feminist history]], concerned to show changes in manners and mores in so far as they affected women; it has also been judged to anticipate Marxian history in its keen apprehension of reification: 'machines imitated mortals to unhoped perfection, and men found out they were themselves machines.'\"<ref name=\"ODNB page\" />\n\nA lexicographer in her own right Mrs. Piozzi's ''British synonymy, or, An attempt at regulating the choice of words in familiar conversation'' was published in 1794, ten years after Dr. Johnson's death, by G.G. & J. Robinson of London.<ref>[https://www.rct.uk/collection/1071556/british-synonymy-or-an-attempt-at-regulating-the-choice-of-words-in-familiar].</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nHester Piozzi died at No. 10 (now 20) Sion Row, [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]], Bristol, of complications after a fall, and was buried on 16 May 1821 near Brynbella in the churchyard of Corpus Christi Church, [[Tremeirchion]], next to Piozzi.<ref name=\"ODNB page\" /> A marble inside the church was erected in 1909 inscribed with the words\n<blockquote>Near this place are interred the remains of<br />\nHester Lynch Piozzi.<br />\n\"Doctor Johnson's Mrs Thrale\"<br />\nBorn 1741.

Nowadays she is referred to as Hester Lynch Piozzi or Mrs Piozzi.\n\n[[Samuel Beckett]] drew on Thrale's diaries and ''[[Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson|Anecdotes]]'' to dramatize her and Samuel Johnson's relationship in one of his earliest plays, ''[[Disjecta (Beckett)#Part IV: Human Wishes|Human Wishes]]''. The play was abandoned after the completion of the first act.\n\nAuthor [[Lillian de la Torre]] featured Thrale in the story \"The Stolen Christmas Box\", part of a series featuring [[Samuel Johnson]] as a detective.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n*[[Salusbury Family]]\n*[[John Salusbury Piozzi Salusbury]] \u2013 adopted son\n*[[Lleweni Hall]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Beryl Bainbridge]], ''According to Queeney'', Little Brown & Co., 2001 (novel)\n*{{Cite book |last=Boswell |first=James |author-link=James Boswell |title=The life of Samuel Johnson. &#91;Followed by&#93; The journal of a tour to the Hebrides |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8EIAAAAQAAJ |year=1851 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |title=Hester Lynch Piozzi (Mrs. Thrale) |first=James L. |last=Clifford |author-link= |year=1987 |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-06389-X |ref=none}}\n*Marianna D'Ezio, \"The Advantages of \"Demi-Naturalization\": Hester Piozzi's \"Observations and Reflections Made in the Course of a Journey Through France, Italy and Germany\" (1789), ''Journal for Eighteenth Century Studies'' 33:2 (2010), pp. 165\u2013180\n*Marianna D'Ezio, ''Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi.

Osmanabad's history dates way back to the era of the Ramayana where the [[Hindu]] deity [[Rama]] is said to have spent a few years of his exile. As per historical evidence, the district was ruled by the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas. In early centuries the city belonged to the Hindu Chalukyas and Devagiri Yadavas, but later became a part of the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms.\n\nFor a period of time, Osmanabad was also ruled by the Mughals, Bahmani, Nizam and Adil Shah kingdoms. Before the Hyderabad Nizam's rule, it was under control of the Mughal King Aurangzeb. Being under the Nizam rule, the district did not celebrate its freedom when the rest of India became independent in 1947. However, soon in 1948, Hyderabad State was merged with independent India and the district became a part of the then Mumbai District.

Based on 168 reviews collected by [[IMDb]], the show has an average score of 7.6/10.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/> Viewership peaked at a near 15 million live viewers on 17 February 2020 (Episode 18) which marked the episode as one of the most-watched television telecast in Pakistan and [[Bol Network]]'s highest viewing figures to date. Episodes made available on [[Youtube]] following the live telecast received over 2 million views in a 24-hour span and were trending on Youtube in Pakistan and India over the course of respective weekly releases.<ref name=\"bolnews.com\"/> Ratings declined subsequently in episodes that followed. Critics compared the series to a [[soap opera]] commenting that the episodes contain merely ''10 minutes of watch-worthy content which is made up into a 90 minute episode''. The series was also accused of [[clickbaiting]] viewers for majority of the episodes. Content shown in teasers and thumbnails is usually flashy and falsely advertised to appear the coming week and does not actually unfold until a few weeks later.\n\n==Criticism and controversy==\n===Selection of certain housemates===\nThe programme attracted criticism in December 2019 for putting several vulnerable people through to the auditions. Rabail Sheikh, an aspiring model, who had a history of [[substance abuse]] and suffered from [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] was selected after she attempted to expose a cricketer by threatening to leak a lewd video as leverage. There was no psych test done to screen any participants to determine if they are fit to enter the house. Muhammad Yahya had arm disability, Muhammad Bilal a [[cleft palette]] and difficulty in speaking and Daniya Kanwal who suffered from [[asthma]] were all selected in auditions as [[Tokenism|token diversity]].\n\n===Legal complications and censorship===\nDuring the auditions Rabail revealed that she has a private video of a famous Pakistani cricketer who had allegedly stripped down on webcam and showed her his genitals in the video.<ref>https://www.kansascity-comiccon.com/complete-audition-of-rabail-sheikh-champions-audition-waqar-zaka-show-vidA4onYNX3xMAHd</ref> The video was blurred during telecast and Rabail was persuaded to delete it in order for her to get selected as contestant. However it is alleged that the video is still in possession of Rabail. <br />\n[[Hareem Shah]] and Sandal Khattak appeared during auditions and discussed their media scandals in details on the show. They claimed to have videos and audio recordings of news anchor [[Mubashir Lucman]] and Minister [[Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad|Sheikh Rasheed]].<ref>https://www.newsdesk.pk/hareem-shah-new-video-leaked-by-bhola-record-hareem-leaks/</ref><ref>https://www.oyeyeah.com/celebrity/hareem-shah-scandal-things-are-getting-out-of-hands/</ref> Prior to the show they had released several snippets of their conversation with Lucman and Rasheed as evidence which became popular on social media in mid-2019.<ref>https://www.mangobaaz.com/a-new-video-of-tiktok-star-hareem-shah-has-leaked-this-its-with-sheikh-rashid</ref><ref>https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/tiktok-star-hareem-shah-video-sheikh-rasheed-ahmad-imran-khan-pakistan-1633398-2020-01-02</ref> Waqar Zaka revealed that Bol Network had received threats from Lucman's team to pursue legal action against the network to stop the telecast of the episodes featuring Shah and Khattak. Shah and Khattak were selected to become housemates but did not enter the house amidst these complications.\n\n===Discrimination and abuse===\nThe production was heavily criticized for its leniency towards unacceptable behavior among housemates and telecasting strong themes under the pretense of [[Television content rating system|family show]]. Caste-based discrimination and [[Discrimination based on skin color|colorism]] were primary underlying themes in conversations inside the house. [[Bol Network]] received 1574 complaints after Episode 17 was aired regarding Rabail and Aamir's behavior toward Kashaf.<ref>https://dailytimes.com.pk/13503/pemra-revokes-bol-news-bol-entertainment-licenses/</ref><ref>https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/09/06/pemra-issues-show-cause-notice-to-bol-news/</ref> Rabail alongside Aamir called Kashaf dark, fat and ugly on several instances, spat on her, destroyed her clothes and physically assaulted her repeatedly after an elimination task.<ref>https://runwaypakistan.com/is-bol-champions-the-type-of-content-we-want/</ref> On a separate occasion Rabail sprayed Daniya with an [[aerosol spray]] triggering an asthma attack for which she had to be hospitalized for the night. Rabail was disqualified but made to stay on the show to garner more ratings hence rewarding her behavior.<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/1499482/pemra-issues-show-cause-notices-bol-news-urdu-1/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=2997962ffd6875fa911157254dc6f7558afcbab5-1582304610-0-Aan94MNl5RohOHlYC57z0XYnv2Xp8k5scWnEJUpfH9PRfmruPZzKxZ4qTOfoo5N6lzqTA7Ikfw4HwMzWTEbQtp7M_Jrj8OsmmhsZNmA_NKDEIpZ8F9N704IzGEuxYmiDJvC0aQRZBTLYZPhQX-CI5suXaK5ne_A4iXkcsClmA87zQsO5gwbbUOXNLSsg3SzKt4-H9yncbp2yE7L1ohk9Xl9inlMs2AZiC1MagHjSDk0CqBTD-jqUau6pw869vcoCwrhHraTNZu63rFsOJsKaOTkNuJSvbl9VJmsk4tYZYsKv4IAXoQaFIYss5w1F6a7vHUC6jo2PcVkC9JCdMBnzUbqg_PbmtFw60SoA5KXLYlcz</ref><ref>https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/549523-pemra-warns-public-against-buying-tv-channel-s-scratch-cards</ref>\n\nRabail, on day 2, [[outed]] Hammad telling housemates that he had confided in her about the past lover he mentioned during auditions being a man. Previous to this incident many housemates including Daniya, Tooba and Sidra had referred to Hammad as ''meetha'' a derogatory term used in Urdu for homosexual or [[effeminate]] men.<ref>https://dailytimes.com.pk/463433/with-rampant-misogyny-homophobia-punjabi-sunni-supremacy-pakistan-wonders-why-the-world-isnt-buying-its-pro-human-rights-kashmir-stance/</ref> Hammad [[came out as gay]] on his youtube channel after he was evicted.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8u5FfXNTqE&t=160s</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.bolentertainment.com/tv-shows/champions/}}\n* {{IMDb title | id= tt11421324}}\n\n[[Category:BOL Network]]\n[[Category:Pakistani reality television series]]\n[[Category:2019 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n", "text_old": "{{INDEX}} \n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = \n| image                    = File:Champions Logo.jpg\n| image_alt                = Official logo\n| caption                  = \n| genre                    = Reality\n| director                 = \n| creative_director        = \n| presenter                = [[Waqar Zaka]]\n| starring                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = Khawaja Danish <small>(OST)</small>\n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = Wajid Saeed<br/>Lucky Ali\n| country                  = [[Pakistan]]\n| language                 = [[Urdu]]\n| num_seasons              = 1\n| num_episodes             = 23 ({{As of|2020|03|30}})<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bolentertainment.com/tv-shows/champions/|title=Champions - Reality Show}}</ref>\n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = \n| producer                 = \n| camera                   = Multi-camera\n| runtime                  = Approx. 90 minutes\n| company                  = [[BOL Network|BOL TV]] (Season 1)\n| picture_format           = [[1080i]] ([[High-definition television|HDTV]])\n| first_aired              = {{start date|df=yes|2019|11|04}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| related                  = \n| website                  = https://www.bolentertainment.com/tv-shows/champions/\n| website_title            = Champions with Waqar Zaka\n| image_size               = \n| network                  = \n| channel                  = [[BOL Network|BOL TV]]\n}}\n\n'''''Champions With Waqar Zaka '''''is a Pakistani youth-based [[reality show]] that airs on the [[BOL Network]] and is hosted by [[Waqar Zaka]]. The episodes are also available online.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The series premiered on 4 November 2019.\n\nFilming of the show took place at the ''Bol House'' in [[Korangi Creek Cantonment]], Karachi which partially serves as [[Bol Network]]'s headquarters. Contestants lived in the house for 30 days from 4 January to 4 February 2020 until four finalists emerged. The finale is scheduled to be filmed before the month of [[Ramadan]] which is expected to begin on the evening of 24 April 2020 in Pakistan.\n\n''Champions'' was the subject of viewer complaints and press attention regarding a variety of controversial issues, including vulagrity, the well-being of certain participants and discrimination based on [[sexuality]] and color.

Based on 168 reviews collected by [[IMDb]], the show has an average score of 7.6/10.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/> Viewership peaked at a near 15 million live viewers on 17 February 2020 (Episode 18) which marked the episode as one of the most-watched television telecast in Pakistan and [[Bol Network]]'s highest viewing figures to date. Episodes made available on [[Youtube]] following the live telecast received over 2 million views in a 24-hour span and were trending on Youtube in Pakistan and India over the course of respective weekly releases.<ref name=\"bolnews.com\"/> Ratings declined subsequently in episodes that followed. Critics compared the series to a [[soap opera]] commenting that the episodes contain merely ''10 minutes of watch-worthy content which is made up into a 90 minute episode''. The series was also accused of [[clickbaiting]] viewers for majority of the episodes. Content shown in teasers and thumbnails is usually flashy and falsely advertised to appear the coming week and does not actually unfold until a few weeks later.\n\n==Criticism and controversy==\n===Selection of certain housemates===\nThe programme attracted criticism in December 2019 for putting several vulnerable people through to the auditions. Rabail Sheikh, an aspiring model, who had a history of [[substance abuse]] and suffered from [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] was selected after she attempted to expose a cricketer by threatening to leak a lewd video as leverage. There was no psych test done to screen any participants to determine if they are fit to enter the house. Muhammad Yahya had arm disability, Muhammad Bilal a [[cleft palette]] and difficulty in speaking and Daniya Kanwal who suffered from [[asthma]] were all selected in auditions as [[Tokenism|token diversity]].\n\n===Legal complications and censorship===\nDuring the auditions Rabail revealed that she has a private video of a famous Pakistani cricketer who had allegedly stripped down on webcam and showed her his genitals in the video.<ref>https://www.kansascity-comiccon.com/complete-audition-of-rabail-sheikh-champions-audition-waqar-zaka-show-vidA4onYNX3xMAHd</ref> The video was blurred during telecast and Rabail was persuaded to delete it in order for her to get selected as contestant. However it is alleged that the video is still in possession of Rabail. <br />\n[[Hareem Shah]] and Sandal Khattak appeared during auditions and discussed their media scandals in details on the show. They claimed to have videos and audio recordings of news anchor [[Mubashir Lucman]] and Minister [[Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad|Sheikh Rasheed]].<ref>https://www.newsdesk.pk/hareem-shah-new-video-leaked-by-bhola-record-hareem-leaks/</ref><ref>https://www.oyeyeah.com/celebrity/hareem-shah-scandal-things-are-getting-out-of-hands/</ref> Prior to the show they had released several snippets of their conversation with Lucman and Rasheed as evidence which became popular on social media in mid-2019.<ref>https://www.mangobaaz.com/a-new-video-of-tiktok-star-hareem-shah-has-leaked-this-its-with-sheikh-rashid</ref><ref>https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/tiktok-star-hareem-shah-video-sheikh-rasheed-ahmad-imran-khan-pakistan-1633398-2020-01-02</ref> Waqar Zaka revealed that Bol Network had received threats from Lucman's team to pursue legal action against the network to stop the telecast of the episodes featuring Shah and Khattak. Shah and Khattak were selected to become housemates but did not enter the house amidst these complications.\n\n===Discrimination and abuse===\nThe production was heavily criticized for its leniency towards unacceptable behavior among housemates and telecasting strong themes under the pretense of [[Television content rating system|family show]]. Caste-based discrimination and [[Discrimination based on skin color|colorism]] were primary underlying themes in conversations inside the house. [[Bol Network]] received 1574 complaints after Episode 17 was aired regarding Rabail and Aamir's behavior toward Kashaf.<ref>https://dailytimes.com.pk/13503/pemra-revokes-bol-news-bol-entertainment-licenses/</ref><ref>https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/09/06/pemra-issues-show-cause-notice-to-bol-news/</ref> Rabail alongside Aamir called Kashaf dark, fat and ugly on several instances, spat on her, destroyed her clothes and physically assaulted her repeatedly after an elimination task.<ref>https://runwaypakistan.com/is-bol-champions-the-type-of-content-we-want/</ref> On a separate occasion Rabail sprayed Daniya with an [[aerosol spray]] triggering an asthma attack for which she had to be hospitalized for the night. Rabail was disqualified but made to stay on the show to garner more ratings hence rewarding her behavior.<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/1499482/pemra-issues-show-cause-notices-bol-news-urdu-1/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=2997962ffd6875fa911157254dc6f7558afcbab5-1582304610-0-Aan94MNl5RohOHlYC57z0XYnv2Xp8k5scWnEJUpfH9PRfmruPZzKxZ4qTOfoo5N6lzqTA7Ikfw4HwMzWTEbQtp7M_Jrj8OsmmhsZNmA_NKDEIpZ8F9N704IzGEuxYmiDJvC0aQRZBTLYZPhQX-CI5suXaK5ne_A4iXkcsClmA87zQsO5gwbbUOXNLSsg3SzKt4-H9yncbp2yE7L1ohk9Xl9inlMs2AZiC1MagHjSDk0CqBTD-jqUau6pw869vcoCwrhHraTNZu63rFsOJsKaOTkNuJSvbl9VJmsk4tYZYsKv4IAXoQaFIYss5w1F6a7vHUC6jo2PcVkC9JCdMBnzUbqg_PbmtFw60SoA5KXLYlcz</ref><ref>https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/549523-pemra-warns-public-against-buying-tv-channel-s-scratch-cards</ref>\n\nRabail, on day 2, [[outed]] Hammad telling housemates that he had confided in her about the past lover he mentioned during auditions being a man. Previous to this incident many housemates including Daniya, Tooba and Sidra had referred to Hammad as ''meetha'' a derogatory term used in Urdu for homosexual or [[effeminate]] men.<ref>https://dailytimes.com.pk/463433/with-rampant-misogyny-homophobia-punjabi-sunni-supremacy-pakistan-wonders-why-the-world-isnt-buying-its-pro-human-rights-kashmir-stance/</ref> Hammad [[came out as gay]] on his youtube channel after he was evicted.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8u5FfXNTqE&t=160s</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.bolentertainment.com/tv-shows/champions/}}\n* {{IMDb title | id= tt11421324}}\n\n[[Category:BOL Network]]\n[[Category:Pakistani reality television series]]\n[[Category:2019 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n", "name_user": "Balach Masud", "label": "safe", "comment": "Just gave a link to balach masud biography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champions_(Pakistani_TV_series)"}
