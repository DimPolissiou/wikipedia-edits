It is believed that the [[Christ's Hospital]] school in London in 1552 was the first [[school]] to use a uniform for its [[student]]s.<ref>see {{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-29047752 |title=The history of school uniforms |last=Scott |first=Jenny |date=2014-09-05 |work=BBC News}}</ref> The earliest documented proof of institutionalised use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ordered the wearing of the ''cappa clausa''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The School Uniform Movement and what it Tells Us about American Education |last=Brunsma |first=David L. |pages=3 ff |chapter=A Brief History of School Uniforms and Dress Code}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of wearing school uniform has been adopted by many other countries, and is now common in many parts of the world. Uniforms can be regarded as promoting social equality among students and an [[esprit de corps]], but have also been criticised for promoting a form of uniformity characteristic of militarism.\n\nThe decision as to whether to implement school uniform policy or not is a controversial one and also polarised in societies and countries. In countries such as the United Kingdom, South Africa and a number of Asian nations, school children have to wear approved school uniforms that conform to the uniform policy of their school. In modern Europe, Britain and Ireland stand out as the only countries where school uniform is widely adopted by state schools and generally supported by national and local governments, although there is no legislation governing school uniform in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web\n|last1=McCourt\n|first1=Laura\n|title=School Uniform Policy in Scotland, England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland briefing paper 48/13\n|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2013/education/4813.pdf\n|website=Northern Ireland Assembly\n|publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service\n|accessdate=9 November 2015\n|ref=NIAR 862-12\n|date=4 January 2013}}</ref> There are some independent schools and state schools that do not have school uniforms: their pupils are at liberty to dress in a way considered to be appropriate by the school, themselves and their parents or guardians.\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300\n| header = School uniforms in different countries\n| image1 = Indian school girls 4.jpg\n| image2 = JfCalabaSanIsidroNuevaEcijaRosaryParishHighSchoolfvf 08.JPG\n| image3 = Anak_SD_di_Ciwidey.jpg\n| image4 = Centro de Estudiantes.jpg\n}}\n\n== Australia ==\n[[File:Barack Obama at Campbell High School.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Barack Obama]] with students at an Australian high school in 2011.]]\nIn Australia, each school or school system can set its own uniform policy. Wearing a uniform is compulsory in most Australian private and all Catholic schools, as well as in most public schools, although it is sometimes less enforced in primary schools that have uniforms. Uniforms usually have a colour scheme based on the school colours. Uniform and appearance are generally strictly enforced in private and Catholic schools, though less so in public schools, which generally allow their students a reasonable amount of leeway. Most, if not all, private schools have the school logo incorporated in the uniform ensemble, typically on the necktie and the blazer breast pocket.\n\nFor boys, the uniforms generally include a button-up or polo shirt with either [[short pants|shorts]] (especially for summer wear) or long trousers, usually in grey or navy blue or the school colour. Some schools allow boys to wear shorts only in younger years, and they must wear long trousers once they are a senior (17-18). At others, even older boys wear shorts in summer due to the heat.<ref>See e.g. [http://www.dobsons.com.au/static_site/pdf/St%20Kevins%20College.pdf School uniform price list] making a distinction between summer uniform and winter uniform.</ref> Where short trousers are to be worn, socks in school colours (more commonly white) are often required. Girls' uniforms generally include a checkered or striped dress (usually sleeveless or short-sleeved) worn over a blouse for summer and, in most secondary schools, girls wear a skirt as well as a button-up or polo shirt in winter with a blazer and tie. In a number of schools, girls are also permitted to wear a button-up or polo shirt and dark trousers.\n\nIn public schools, the uniform is usually a polo shirt for juniors and a different one for seniors and  trousers or skirt. This set may be complemented by a school [[necktie]] and, typically, a v-neck jumper (pullover or sweater) or a blazer. In the summer, boys usually do not wear ties, pullovers, or blazers. Instead, they wear a short-sleeved version of the shirt and short trousers. A neck-tie, blazer, and hat are also common in private and Catholic schools.\n\nIn most high schools a PE uniform is the norm for sports days only. At many high schools, children are required to change into and out of their PE uniform around the PE lesson. The PE uniform usually consists of shorts and a polo shirt, as well as a light weatherproof rain jacket (mainly at private or Catholic schools), usually made of polyester, for winter and wet weather and sometimes a netball skirt for girls. It is common for students in their final year of primary school or secondary school to have their own jersey, jumper or jacket to denote their final-year status.\n\n== Bangladesh ==\n\nSchool uniforms are mandatory in all public and private schools (up to 12th standard) in Bangladesh. While the colour and exact cut of the uniform depend on school regulations and policies, male students in Bangladesh are usually expected to wear full/half sleeve shirts with trousers and female students are expected to wear skirts/pants with shirts or salwar kameez with belts and dupattas.\n\nThe uniform rule only applies to students of primary, secondary, and higher secondary education. Although there are no uniforms for university students in Bangladesh, they are expected to follow the respective dress codes of their institutions.\n\nThe rationale behind the uniform policy of Bangladesh is that the authorities want to protect the students from class stratification that can become apparent when students are given the choice to dress as they like. In addition, authorities believe that students should not misuse their time in trying to dress up for school.\n\n== Brazil ==\n\nThere is no legal requirement for school uniforms in Brazil. On a state-by-state or city-by-city basis, governments may issue uniforms to public school pupils but may not require their use.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/educacao/um-em-cada-quatro-alunos-de-escola-estadual-recebe-uniforme/n1238146989999.html |title=Um em cada quatro alunos de escola estadual recebe uniforme |last=Costa |first=Marina Morena |date=2011-03-10 |website=\u00daltimo Segundo |language=pt-BR |access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> Private schools are free to set their own uniform policy.\n\nBrazilian school uniforms can vary widely by school. There are many schools that opt for a more elegant outfit, while others opt for a simpler one (social shirt, shorts). Some schools use \"intelligent uniforms\" embedded with locator chips that allow computers to automatically record whether pupils have arrived in school or not. If pupils do not turn up for school or classes, an automated message is sent to inform the parents accordingly. The benefit of the automated system is to curb absenteeism and class skipping.<ref>see http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23rfid-chip-brazil-student_n_1374886.html</ref> In this country, where schools have set a uniform, it is the student's obligation to wear it.\n\nMost [[education in Brazil|schools in Brazil]] choose the use of uniforms. The average Brazilian school uniform for boys is a T-shirt with the school's logo, sweatpants or bermuda shorts and a sweatshirt or hoodie. The uniform for girls is very similar, but instead leggings or short shorts are worn, although ballerina pants are also highly popular. Younger girls may have the choice to wear a skirts with shorts underneath. Most schools require sneakers.\n\n== Burundi ==\n\nSchool uniforms are compulsory for school children in [[Burundi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.org/projects/2112-educational-for-street-children-in-burundi|title=Bildungschancen f\u00fcr Stra\u00dfenkinder in Burundi|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> Burundi, like most African countries, has a compulsory school uniform policy. Burundi's school uniform policy dates back to the colonial days. During those days, chiefs' sons wore a white uniform and all other children wore khaki.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/iiep/PDF/pubs/2008/Burundi.pdf|title=IIEP UNESCO|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> The uniform policy is still in force in Burundi to date. However, schools decide on what uniform the pupils wear. It is also argued that the cost of buying the school uniform and poverty, especially in the rural areas, negatively affect school enrollment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imagine-burundi-terimbere.com/contact/school-uniform-and-little-sun.html|title=SCHOOL UNIFORM AND LITTLE SUN|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Cambodia ==\n[[File:\u00c9coliers au Cambodge.jpg|thumb|School children wearing uniforms in [[Cambodia]]]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nIn Cambodia, students of all ages (pre-school to college) wear school uniforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cctnz.org.nz/education-projects|title=- The Cambodia Charitable Trust|date=13 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> The uniforms differ by school and age level. Generally, boys wear a white dress shirt and a pair of shorts. The colour and length of the shorts varies at each school.  Male college students wear the same kind of uniform, but instead of shorts, they wear black dress trousers. Girls usually wear white blouses and a skirt. Their skirts vary in colour and length depending upon the school and their ages. Generally, the younger students wear long skirts that almost reach their ankles and older students, particularly in college, wear shorter ones. Skirts are generally blue or black but may be other colours as well, depending on the school. Some schools also have alternative uniforms which students of both genders wear every other day. These often consist of a coloured shirt and slacks. High school girls must wear black or blue long skirts. High school boys wear long black or blue trousers. The white shirt can be short-sleeved or long-sleeved for both genders. High school students are also required to wear name tags on the left hand side of their shirts.\n\n==Canada==\n[[File:Maison Piacente highschool uniforms.jpg|thumb|right|Highschool uniforms on sale at a warehouse store in [[Montreal, Quebec]].]]\nIn Canada, the province of Quebec is the only province where school uniforms are present in a majority of schools. Within the English school system of Quebec, almost all schools from elementary to high school have mandatory school uniforms. In the rest of Canada, school uniforms are not required in most public schools or [[separate schools]], except in exceptional circumstances such as school performances or international field trips. However, the majority of Catholic high schools in [[southern Ontario]] (Grade 9-12) do require uniforms.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/2010/01/19/st-marys-committee-asks-parents-about-uniforms | title=Owen Sound Sun Times}}</ref> These uniforms generally have long- or short-sleeved shirts with the school logo or crest near the collar and trousers or kilted skirts. Schools often allow girls the option of choosing to wear a skirt or trousers. Some schools also mandate dress shoes and a particular type and length of socks to go with the uniform. A cardigan sweater, vest, or blazer may be part of the ensemble, particularly in winter. Additionally, as of 2011, the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] has implemented an ''Appropriate Dress Code'' of navy blue and white in all elementary separate schools which do not already have their own uniforms.<ref name=TCDSB>{{cite web|title=Dress Code in TCDSB Schools|url=https://www.tcdsb.org/FORPARENTS/DressCode/Pages/default.aspx|website=TCDSB|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nOtherwise, specific regulations and policies regarding school-appropriate dress and the extent of dress code enforcement will vary by school.\n\nUniforms are used in most private schools, and also in special or alternative programs of public and Catholic schools, such as the Traditional Learning Centres, a program that takes a [[liberal arts]] approach, while focusing on high levels of academic excellence. In [[Quebec]], most metropolitan anglophone school boards require a uniform.\n\n== Chile ==\n\n{{Main|Chilean school uniform}}\nIn Chile, most schools have a uniform.\n\nUntil 1930, it was uncommon for students to wear a uniform. Under the government of [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]], all students became obliged to wear a school uniform. During the administration of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], a unified uniform was introduced for all public and private schools and other education centers. Today, these uniforms have disappeared in private schools, who prefer to use a customised one.\n\n== China ==\n[[File:School uniforms in China - 03.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese high school students in their summer school uniforms.]]\nUniforms are a common part of the [[Education in China|schools in China]]. Almost all secondary schools as well as some elementary schools require students to wear uniforms. Uniforms in mainland China usually consist of five sets: 2 formal sets and 3 everyday sets. A formal set is worn on Mondays or special occasions (school anniversaries, school ceremonies, etc.) They consist of a white collared shirt with a sweater on top and a skirt for girls or a suit for boys. There is one formal set for summer and one set for winter. Everyday uniforms for boys in the winter usually consist of a zippered [[sweater]] and trousers and a collared shirt (usually white). Thinner materials are worn in the spring and fall and short or long trousers may be worn in the summer. The everyday uniforms for girls are very similar to the boys' uniform. It is relatively common for there to be some kind of sponsored advertisement on some non-formal school uniform shirts, though this trend has fluctuated in recent years.\n\n== Colombia ==\n[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Colombian primary school students with their teacher.]]\nIn Colombia, all students are required to wear uniforms in public and private schools. Uniforms in Colombia consist of two sets, one for everyday use and a sports one for physical education. Everyday uniforms for girls generally include a knee-length skirt, a white T-shirt with a vest, and white calf-length socks. For boys, the uniform generally includes dark-coloured long trousers and a short- or long-sleeved shirt. The shoes for both girls and boys are black lace-up shoes (sometimes the shoes may be dark blue or wine-coloured, depending on the uniform colours) and the shirts usually have the school's symbol at the left side. The sports uniform includes sweat pants, a collared T-shirt, and white sports shoes. The designs and the colours of the uniforms depend on the school's colours and the principal's preference.\n\n== El Salvador ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Independencia desfile Santa Tecla 2012.jpg|thumb|204x204px|Salvadoran school students celebrating independence day]]\nIn El Salvador, all students from public schools  and private schools are required to wear uniforms.\n\n== France ==\n\nSince 1968, uniforms have not been enforced in French schools, a few exceptions (such as [[Maison d'\u00e9ducation de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur]], les \u00c9coles TUNON, and Vatel).  [[Xavier Darcos]], a former teacher and [[Department of Education|Minister of Education]] from 2007 to 2009, is an advocate of the reintroduction of uniforms:  \"This is not outrageous. This removes the visible differences in social status or wealth. This is an additional factor of integration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2009/01/17/525744-Darcos-ressort-l-uniforme-du-placard.html|title=Darcos ressort l'uniforme du placard|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince March 2012, the students of the Boarding School of Excellence [[Sourdun]] wear a uniform with the insignia of their establishment.\n\nLes lyc\u00e9es de la d\u00e9fense, formerly known as [[Military school#France|military schools]], require their students to wear uniforms.  At some universities, the [[academic dress]] is becoming popular.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nIn the [[French Antilles]] ([[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]), as well as French Guiana, a uniform has been required since September 2008.\n\n== Germany ==\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2010}}\n[[File:Waldgrundschule Schulkleidung.jpg|thumb|German school children wearing voluntary \"Schulkleidung\" (2009).]]\n\nThere is no tradition of wearing school uniforms in Germany, and today, almost all students of state schools, private schools or universities do not wear school uniforms. However, certain garments have been common to students in former times:\n\nFrom the 16th century, students (especially of secondary or grammar schools and similar institutions) were often subject to regulations that prescribed, for example, modest and not too stylish attire. In many cases these regulations were part of wider laws concerning the clothing of all citizens of certain social classes.\n\nA blue coat became a widespread obligatory status symbol of students of secondary schools; it fell out of use during the latter half of the 18th century. In more recent times, school uniforms in any real sense did not exist outside of convent schools and private boarding schools. At times, certain fashions became so widespread that they approached uniform status; this is true in particular for so-called student hats (''Sch\u00fclerm\u00fctzen'') that became widespread from the 1880s on and remained somewhat popular until they were banned by the Nazis. Their wearing was advocated by teachers and the students themselves and occasionally made mandatory, but never on a national or statewide level. Another instance are the [[sailor suits]] that became fashionable around the turn of the 19th century. These, too, were not usually a prescribed uniform.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Handbuch der Geschichte des Bayerischen Bildungswesens\n| author = M.

They did, however, institute mandatory membership in the uniformed [[Hitler Youth]] (''HJ'') from 1936 until their fall. HJ uniforms were worn in the HJ training academies and in the [[National Political Institutes of Education|Napolas]]; students of other schools sometimes wore them to school at their own discretion.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn recent times, the introduction of school uniforms has been discussed, but usually the expression \"uniform\" (the word is the same in German) is avoided in favour of terms like \"school clothing\" (\"Schulkleidung\"). School clothing has been introduced in a small number of schools, for example in [[Hamburg]]-Sinstorf in 2000, and in [[Friesenheim (Baden)|Friesenheim]] and [[Haag in Obb|Haag (Oberbayern)]] in 2005. In these cases the clothes are collections of shirts, sweaters, and the like, catering to contemporary fashion senses. Uniforms in a more traditional sense are almost never proposed in earnest.\n\nThe debate on mandatory school uniforms intensified in Germany when two Muslim girls dressed in burkas arrived at a school in Bonn in 2006. The girls' actions were interpreted as political action and they were subsequently suspended from school. Then-Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries  in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag stated that the simple solution to the issue under consideration is mandatory introduction of school uniforms for boys and girls across Germany. She further argued that school uniforms would help to prevent conflicts arising from religious or political differences.  Her stance was supported by then-Minister Of Education Annette Schavan. The proposal was met with opposition from the teacher union and opposition political parties. The teacher union argued that school uniforms are not the solution for integration problems nor the issue of fashion obsession. The leader of the teacher union  Heinz-Peter Meidinger also added that the school uniforms have been a controversial issue in Germany over the years.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4753623.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - School uniform row grips Germany|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|date=9 May 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to school uniforms===\nA senior member of the Green Party, Krista Sager, also said that the introduction of school uniforms would be unacceptable state interference in religious matters. She then proposed that individual schools have to find their own solutions and rejected solutions imposed by government. She further noted that school uniforms are no longer up to date and their imposition would be rejected by the current generation of students. The Conference of Education Ministers, a body which decides on school policies, also kicked back against school uniforms. They cited historical reasons dating back to WWII with memories of Hitler Youth's uniform still fresh in people's minds. They also concluded that the imposition of school uniforms would be excessive government encroachment on personal liberty of pupils and parents.<ref name=\"dw.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/in-germany-veiled-students-stir-up-uniform-debate/a-1996295|title=In Germany, Veiled Students Stir Up Uniform Debate - Germany - DW.COM - 08.05.2006|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> \nHowever, a number of schools sell branded clothing that can be worn as a sign of school pride.<ref name=\"dw.de\"/>\n\nThe [[Bildungsstreik]] movement fights against school uniforms due to their belief that it represents some kind of [[militarism]].<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\n== Ghana ==\n\n[[File:Ghana students.jpg|thumb|left| Students in [[Ghana]] wearing their uniform]]\n\nAll children have to wear school uniforms in [[Ghana]].

Hence the cost of school uniforms acts as one of the barriers to educational access.  In an effort to achieve universal primary education the government, as part of its educational policy, initiated free school uniform distribution throughout the country in 2010.<ref>http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Ghana/Ghana_MDG_Report_2010.pdf</ref> According to government data, a total of 170,221 pupils were supplied with free school uniforms in 2013 and it planned to supply 10,000 uniforms in 2014.<ref>http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/2012-02-08-08-24-49/ministry-of-education</ref> There are public programs to offer poor families financial help to buy uniforms.

As seen here, Indian schoolgirls can have uniform of both shirt and skirt, as well as ''[[salwar kameez]]''.]]\nUniforms are compulsory in India in both public and private schools. The boys' uniforms are often made of a light-coloured shirt, long trousers usually blue, white or black, and those of the girls are often a shirt and a skirt. At the state level, the secondary schools are required to use a [[salwar kameez]]. This is not compulsory but they do have certain specific dress code.\n\nMany schools require students to wear uniform shoes, ties and ID cards, and comb their hair down and keep it clean and short. Long hair is tied in braids. Uniform is one of the most important components of school life and is taken very seriously in India.\n\nSome institutions also require the use of a tie, especially the schools run by [[Christians|Christian]] missionaries, and the Indian government does not prohibit the children to have religious symbols, so the [[Muslim]] girls can wear the veil (hijab) ([[burqa|burka]]) and [[Sikh]] boys a [[turban]] in addition to the uniform. However, most of the schools, whether public or private, prohibit students to have a ponytail or dyed hair.\n\n== Indonesia ==\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], school uniforms are mandatory for every student. They can be simply described as below for each stage of education:\n* Primary schools or ''Sekolah Dasar'' (''SD'') students wear a white short-sleeve shirt with red shorts for male students, and below-knee skirts for females.\n* Lower secondary schools or ''Sekolah Menengah Pertama'' (''SMP'') require navy blue shorts or trousers with a short-sleeve white shirt for male students. Females wear a below-knee-length or long navy blue skirt and short-sleeve white shirt.\n* Upper secondary schools ''Sekolah Menengah Atas'' (''SMA'') require blue-grey trousers with a short-sleeve white shirt. Females wear a below-knee-length or long blue-grey skirt, and wear short-sleeve or long-sleeve white shirts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pendidikan.jogja.go.id/index.php?pilih=hal&id=9|title=Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Education: School Uniforms|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\nPublic schools in Indonesia tolerate religious freedoms. For example, [[Muslim]] girls may opt to wear long-sleeve shirts, longer skirts, and [[jilbab]] to cover their heads. Most [[Education in Indonesia|schools in Indonesia]] also have a [[batik]] uniform, usually worn on Thursday or Friday. This kind of uniform consists of a batik short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirt, with long or short trousers for SMA and below-knee or long skirts for females. The motifs and colours of batik depend on the school. Some schools tend to issue neckties and/or vests for their students. These neckties and vests may vary from school to school in colour and sewing pattern, even among public schools.\n\nNowadays, with the increase of private schools in Indonesia, most private schools have their own signature school uniform. Most consist of shirts with shorts or trousers for males, and skirts for females, only with differences on the colour.\n\nEvery school has its own standard grooming. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Accessories are also normally prohibited for males, except for watches. Females are usually allowed to use simple accessories such as watches, earrings, and sometimes bracelets. Wearing nail polish is usually not allowed.\n\nMost schools pay attention to the shoes that can be worn. Black or white sneakers with white laces are the most common shoes. Few higher-level students, such as in ''SMA'' or ''SMK'', are normally required to wear black leather shoes.\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Meisjes met angklungs TMnr 20018432.jpg|thumb|left|Schoolgirls in Indonesia]]\n\nThe school badge is usually put on the right sleeve of a shirt, consist of school's name and location, and some have their own school's logo. Others prefer to wear the school's logo as a lapel or breast plastic or metal pin. The emblem of OSIS (''Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah''), or School's Intern Student Organization, is put on the shirt's left pocket. Students' names are usually on the right side of the shirt and embedded by sewing, ironing or as a detachable badge. Some schools (usually \"SMP\" and \"SMA\") distinguish the grade of their students by stripes on the official neckties issued or an emblem below the school emblem (it can be stripes, chevrons or numbers). Nowadays some schools require the students to wear an Indonesian flag school badge sewn on top of their left pocket. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe [[scouts]] (pramuka) uniform is used in many schools in Indonesia at least once a week. It consists of light-brown short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirts, with dark-brown shorts or trousers, and below-knee skirts or longer for females. The common day to wear the scout uniform usually falls on Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday. Furthermore, on certain occasions (usually on ceremonies or competitions), the uniform should be worn as full dress, with red and white scarf/necktie, dark brown beret, rope, dagger and scout's stick.\n\nThe scout uniform has two breast pockets. Above right pocket is the student's name. The [[Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia]] (Indonesian Scout Movement) logo is sewn on the left pocket (for male students). On the right sleeve there are scouting organization's location, number and logo, while on the left sleeve usually are the student's scouting team logo and chevrons denoting his/her grade. Male students wear International Scout Organization logo above their name and female students on their lapel.\n\n== Israel ==\n\nAccording to former Education Minister [[Limor Livnat]], about 1,400 Israeli public schools require pupils to wear uniforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=111|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403111140/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=111|url-status= dead|title=Israel QA File news, Israel diplomatic map|archivedate=3 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nSchool uniforms used to be the norm in the state's early days, but have since fallen out of favour. However, in recent years, the number of schools using school uniforms has been increasing once more. Many teachers, parents and students are in favour of returning the school uniform to common use to prevent the deepening of the gap between affluent children and those less well-off. Nowadays school uniforms are mainly associated with \"national religious\" schools within the [[Education in Israel|Israeli system of education]].<ref>Dr. Zvi Zameret, [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Israel%20at%2050/Fifty%20Years%20of%20Education%20in%20the%20State%20of%20Israel ''Fifty Years of Education in the State of Israel''], Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1998.</ref> Schools for [[Arab citizens of Israel]]  also frequently require uniforms: for girls, it is often a [[pinafore]] to be worn over trousers and shirt.\n\nIn the [[Haredi]] or ultra-Orthodox school system, uniforms are compulsory in essentially all girls' schools. In the vast majority of these, the style adopted by the [[Bais Yaakov|Beit Ya'akov]] network is used: a sky-blue, button-down, open-collar, loose-fitting blouse with an Oxford-blue, pleated skirt which comes to just below the knee and dark stockings. In cold weather, a Yale-blue sweater may be added. A small fraction of schools alter the colour scheme to pink and burgundy, while otherwise retaining the same overall appearance. In boys' schools there is usually not an identifiable school uniform, distinct from what is considered acceptable for ordinary street wear. However, the standards of acceptable street wear for boys and men in Haredi communities are so precise and exacting that in almost all cases all of the boys in a particular school will be dressed identically.\n\nIn non-Haredi schools today, school uniforms in Israel consist only of a shirt with the school logo. In the summer, the uniform shirt is a simple T-shirt, while in the winter, the shirts worn are warm or hooded sweaters. Although the shirts are uniform, they usually come in various colours, and allow students to customise and express themselves even while wearing a uniform. The shirts sell for a very small amount of money, so that even the less well-off can acquire them.\n\n== Italy ==\n\nIn Italy, school uniforms are uncommon, partially because child uniforms are associated with the era of [[Benito Mussolini]] before World War II when children were placed according to their age into [[Italian Fascist]] youth movements and had to wear uniforms inside and outside school.\n\nHowever, until the early 1960s many high schools required girls to wear black ''grembiule'' (resembling a doctor smock) on top of their clothes: no uniform was required for boys.\n\nNowadays, many pre-schools advise parents to dress their children with a ''grembiulino'', i.e., a small ''grembiule'', usually shorter and more colourful, that can be purchased cheaply.\n\nSome elementary schools advise some kind of ''grembiule'' for the younger pupils. Sometimes girls are required to wear a pink or white ''grembiulino'', while boys may be required to wear a short cotton jacket, usually blue or black. In other cases both boys and girls may be required to wear a more neutral blue ''grembiule''.\n\nSome parents send their children to school in a ''grembiule'' even if the school does not require it.\n\nPoet and children's writer [[Gianni Rodari]] has described adult life as \"a school without ''grembiule'' and school desk\".<ref>[http://tuttomio.splinder.com/post/10825033/la+scuola+dei+grandi \"la scuola dei grandi\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716120550/http://tuttomio.splinder.com/post/10825033/la+scuola+dei+grandi |date=2011-07-16 }}.</ref>\n\nIn 2004 the Italian chapter of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] warned that synthetic ''grembiuli'' were harmful to pupils.<ref>[http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=47573 \"WWF: attenti ai tessuti di grembiuli e abitini per bambini\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821185319/http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=47573 |date=2006-08-21 }}, ''VITA'' magazine, 13 September 2004.</ref>\n\nIn July 2008 Education Minister Mariastella Gelmini proposed the re-introduction of the compulsory smock in public schools, provoking a debate in the Italian press.<ref>{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=6137276 |title= Students Protest as Italian Senate Passes Reforms |work=ABC News |location =New York |date=29 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Japan ==\n{{main|Japanese school uniform}}\n\n[[File:\u5236\u670d (5346443876).jpg|thumb|[[Arashiyama]] schoolgirls in [[loose socks]]]]\nJapan introduced school uniforms in the late 19th century. Today, school uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems. They are also used in some women's colleges. The Japanese word for uniform is {{Nihongo|''seifuku''|\u5236\u670d}}.\n\nIn the majority of elementary schools, students are not required to wear a uniform to school. Where they are required, many boys wear white shirts, short trousers, and caps. Young boys often dress more formally in their class pictures than they do other days of the school year. Girls' uniforms might include a grey pleated skirt and white blouse. Occasionally the sailor outfit is used for girls. The uniform codes may vary by season to work with the environment and occasion. It is common for  boys and girls to wear brightly coloured caps to prevent traffic accidents. It is normal for uniforms to be worn outside of school areas. However, this is going out of fashion and many students are wearing casual dress.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe Japanese junior- and senior-high-school uniform traditionally consists of a [[Gakuran|military style]] for boys and a [[Japanese school uniform#Sailor outfit|sailor outfit]] for girls. These uniforms are based on [[Meiji era]] formal military dress, themselves modeled on European-style naval uniforms. The sailor outfit replace the undivided [[hakama]] (andon bakama \u884c\u706f\u88b4) designed by [[Utako Shimoda]] between 1920 and 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyogo-c.ed.jp/~kaibara-hs/gaiyo/100nen/33.htm|title=\u5236\u670d\u3067\u305f\u3069\u308b\u767e\u5e74|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> While this style is still in use, many schools have moved to more Western-pattern [[parochial school]] uniform styles. They consist of a white shirt, tie, [[blazer]] or [[sweater vest]] with school crest, and tailored trousers (often not of the same colour as the blazer or sweater vest) for boys and a white blouse, tie, blazer with school crest, and [[tartan]] skirt for girls.\n\nMuch like the male uniform, the [[gakuran]], the sailor outfit bears a similarity to military-styled [[naval]] uniforms. The uniform generally consists of a [[blouse]] attached with a sailor-style collar and a [[pleat]]ed [[skirt]]. There are seasonal variations for summer and winter: sleeve length and fabric are adjusted accordingly. A ribbon is tied in the front and laced through a loop attached to the blouse. Several variations on the ribbon include [[necktie]]s, [[bolo tie]]s, [[neckerchief]]s, and bows. Common colours are navy blue, white, grey, light green and black.\n[[File:\u30ae\u30ea\u30ae\u30ea\u77ed (15580964194).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kogal]] culture: [[Miniskirt]] used as school uniform in Japan, including during winter season.]]\n\nShoes, socks, and other accessories are sometimes included as part of the uniform. The socks are typically navy or white. The shoes are typically brown or black [[penny loafer]]s. Although not part of the prescribed uniform, alternate forms of legwear (such as [[loose socks]], knee-length stockings, or similar) are commonly matched by more fashionable girls with their sailor outfits.\n\nRegardless of what type of uniform any particular school assigns its students, all schools have a summer version (usually consisting of a white dress shirt and dark slacks for boys and a reduced-weight traditional uniform or blouse and tartan skirt with tie for girls) and a sports-activity uniform (a polyester track suit for year-round use and a T-shirt and shorts for summer activities). Depending on the discipline level of their school, students may wear seasonal and activity uniforms in the same classroom during the day. Students may attempt to subvert the system of uniforms by wearing them incorrectly or by adding prohibited elements such as large [[loose socks]] or badges.\n\nMiniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they became part of school uniforms, and they came to be worn within the [[Kogal]] culture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/11/12/business/man-who-gave-us-loose-white-socks-eyes-comeback/|title=Man who gave us loose white socks eyes comeback|first=Taiga|last=Uranaka|date=12 November 2003|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|newspaper=Japan Times Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/japans-schoolgirls-set-the-trend-1295844.html|title=Japan's schoolgirls set the trend|date=23 November 1997|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Lebanon ==\n\nIn Lebanon, all private schools require uniforms.

Some schools require students to sew their name tags in addition to the badge. For upper forms, students generally have to wear a school-specific tie, except those who are wearing the baju kurung.\n\nIn Malaysia, Muslim girls tend to wear the baju kurung. Most of them start wearing a white ''tudung'' (Malaysian version of the Muslim headscarf or hijab) upon entering secondary school, for religious reasons. Non-Muslim girls tend to wear the pinafore. Some non-Muslim girls wear the baju kurung.\n[[File:Sandakan Sabah School-boys-in-their-school-uniform-01.jpg|thumb|left|Malaysian secondary school boys uniform.]]\nMuslim boys may wear [[baju melayu]] at school on Fridays, often with a [[songkok]] hat, to be dressed for going to the mosque for prayers at lunchtime.\n\nGirls who choose to wear the pinafore, especially those attending co-ed schools, usually wear shorts under their pinafore to allow for carefree movement as the skirt only covers up to the knee. Those who wear the baju kurung tend not to wear shorts under their long skirt as their skirt covers their legs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n[[Neckties]] are often worn by prefects, class monitors, librarians, and other students of rank.

Most Mexican schools have 2 types of uniforms: one for P.E. and another for regular school days. Many public secondary schools have a different regular uniform for each grade, especially for girls. \n\n\nUniforms usually consist of the following (but may vary by school):\n\n* '''Regular''' \n** '''Boys'''\n*** Polo shirt\n**** Vest or sweater\n**** Cloth pants\n**** Socks\n**** Black shoes\n** '''Girls'''\n*** Polo shirt\n*** Vest or sweater\n*** Pleated skirt (plaid most of the time)\n*** Knee high socks (white for most public schools)\n*** Black [[Mary Jane (shoe)|mary janes]] (elementary school) / black laced shoes (secondary school)\n* '''P.E.'''\nNote: The uniform is unisex most of the time.\n** Polo or shirt\n** Open sweatshirt \n** Athletic pants\n**socks and sneakers (preferably white)\n\nNowadays, a complete school uniform set cost can go up to 98.39USD for girls, and 102.32USD for boys, which contradicts the uniforms implementation original goal during the [[1930s]]: to reduce clothing costs and avoid [[classism]].<ref>https://lopezdoriga.com/vida-y-estilo/por-que-se-usan-uniformes-en-la-escuela/</ref>\n\nOn 2019, Mexico City's government announced a new Law that permitted pupils to choose whether to wear the pants or skirt version of their regular uniform, regardless of their gender.

Both sexes wear an 'official' school jersey. Blazers and jackets are of varied colours according to the school - dark or light blue, grey, crimson, scarlet, green or black. Some follow the British practice of having contrasting colours edging the lapels and jacket fronts.

In some private schools, there are specified days when students can wear civilian clothing, typically in special occasions like a holiday or last day of school. There is usually no uniform in universities and progressive schools except for uniforms used in P.E classes, and in specific schools such as the [[University of Santo Tomas]].\n\nPublic school uniforms for primary levels are typically white, short-sleeved, buttoned-up shirts, with long skirts for girls and light brown knee-length trousers for boys. Uniforms for public high schools and private schools vary widely in pattern and colour, but most often are in the official school  colours. Muslim girls in some higher institutions are often required to wear a white [[hijab]] versus other colours.

The idea of school uniforms in Poland did not exist before the early 20th century. In the [[People's Republic of Poland]], uniform ceased to be compulsory in most schools during the 1980s due to economic issues. Since then, there has been made only one effort to reintroduce uniform into Polish schools - by the former minister of education [[Roman Giertych]], in 2006. It was then decided that school uniform would not be enforced by the state onto the whole country, but would be a matter decided upon by the [[head teacher|principal]] of each school respectively. Initially this was meant to permit only a [[dress code]], but this was later modified in 2007 to address school uniform. From 2007, all [[primary school]]s and [[Gimnazjum#Countries with gymnasium schools|middle schools]] were to enforce compulsory uniform, whilst [[Liceum#Poland|high schools]] and other forms of further education were given the choice to decide on their own. The appearance of school uniform was decided upon locally, which meant that \"uniform\" in most schools consisted of a jacket or shirt only - selected by the school management purely to avoid breaking regulations (the rest of clothing was still up to the students to decide). By mid-2008, compulsory school uniforms were repealed and it remains so to this day.\n\n== Republic of Ireland ==\n\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], almost all primary and secondary schools require students to wear a uniform. These can vary from school to school but for the most part include trousers for male students, a skirt or pinafore for female students and a shirt, a jumper and a necktie. In recent years many schools also offer the option of trousers for female students. Some schools require blazers rather than jumpers. Some primary schools now let their pupils wear a school tracksuit rather than a formal uniform.\n\nIn recent years there has been criticism, including by the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education]] of the requirement that a school uniform jumper must have the school crest or name imprinted onto it and of the practice where a school's uniform can only be bought from a certain supplier, which can markedly increase the price of a uniform. As well as rules regarding the wearing of a uniform many schools have regulations regarding hair, footwear, the growth of facial hair for males, the wearing of makeup and the length of school skirts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/department-issues-guidelines-on-wearing-of-uniforms-for-exams-1.26079|title=Department issues guidelines on wearing of uniforms for exams|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-09-24|language=English}}</ref>\n\n== Russia ==\nDuring the [[Soviet Union|Soviet period]], a standardised \"universal\" school uniform was worn by all schools. Originally of a military style with peaked cap and high collared tunic, by the 1980s boys wore a functional dark blue pattern with shoulder patches identifying the school. For formal occasions such as the first day of term, girls wore white lace collars and aprons dating back to the reign of [[Catherine the Great]]. During the initial post Soviet period from 1994 to 2013, the mandatory uniform policy was abandoned and pupils generally wore casual clothing such as jeans, T-shirts and sweaters. However, uniforms were reintroduced under a new education law in September 2013.<ref name=\"one-europe.info\">http://one-europe.info/school-uniform-the-russian-experience</ref> Among the supporters of the new uniform law of 2013, arguments included tackling social inequality, but also putting an end to the controversial problem of whether school students are allowed to wear traditional religious clothing to school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/opinions/762985|title=Mandatory school uniform stages comeback in Russia|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nEach school can now choose its own uniform.<ref name=\"one-europe.info\"/> Also, there are many instances in which schools do not enforce the rules on school uniform\n\n== South Africa ==\n\n[[File:Carl Redelinghuis Sentrum.jpg|thumb|Typical example of an assembly in a South African school.

However, many of these same schools will have a \"number ones\" uniform for special occasions which include such items. In cities such as Cape Town, on the other hand, it is more common to see formal apparel required in public and private schools on a daily basis.\n\nMany schools across South Africa also provide the choice between a summer and winter uniform, with khaki uniforms and brown shoes being very common in the summer. Although many schools allow girls to also wear trousers (especially during winter months) South African law has not required gender neutrality in school dress codes and a distinction between girls' and boys' uniforms remains. Boys of all ages are normally required to wear grey or khaki long or [[short trousers]] with socks, and the socks are usually long when worn with shorts, as in the illustration (right). Until recently, the straw boater was a common accessory in affluent public and private high schools, although these have now become optional in some cases.<ref>[http://www.corpun.com/rules2.htm#zaschools Picture of senior high school boys in blazers, short trousers and straw boaters].</ref>\n\nNearly all schools, public or fee paying, have sports' kits (uniforms) that often allow bare feet for junior schools, regardless of the season.\n\n== South Korea ==\n{{Main|Korean school uniform}}\n[[File:Jin Jung-seon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|South Korean school uniform]]\nAlmost all South Korean [[Education in South Korea#Secondary education|secondary]] students wear a uniform called \"''gyobok''\" ([[Korean language|Korean]]: \uad50\ubcf5, \u6821\u670d). The majority of elementary schools, except some private ones, do not have uniforms; however, the uniform is strictly monitored from the start of middle school and up. Based on Western-style ones, the South Korean uniform usually consists of a shirt, blazer and tie, with skirts for girls and trousers for boys.\n\nMore recently, the uniform is often worn by celebrities who target the younger, teen audience to sell entertainment products. The school uniform and school setting is frequently used as a venue for romance. As a result, the uniform has become something akin to an expression of fashion among students.\n\nName tags that are worn usually have different colours per grade. Oftentimes the writing is in black or white, whereas the background is coloured.\n\n== Spain ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nIn Spain the use of school uniforms is not compulsory in the public school at any stage. Their use depends on school councils involving parents. However, it is customary to wear uniforms in private schools, where typically girls wear uniform shirt and jersey skirt and boys wear white shirt and tie and sometimes jacket.\n\n== Sri Lanka ==\nIt is mandatory for Sri Lankan school students to wear a uniform regardless of them attending a government, semi-government or private school. In most government and semi-government schools, boys will wear a short-sleeved white shirt and a navy blue short when they are in the junior grades. This will later transition to white shorts and then to white trousers towards the latter part of the school life. A tie is not always worn, but may be worn for special school events along with a long-sleeved shirt. Proper black dress shoes and socks are also a part of this uniform. Certain schools also require the uniform to have the school's insignia stitched to a corner of the pocket of the shirt.\n\nGirls who attend government and semi-government schools will wear a white one-piece dress. This may or may not have sleeves. Certain schools make wearing a tie mandatory for girls and some may have a plastic badge or the school's insignia stitched to the dress. Proper dress shoes and socks are mandatory in most schools.\n\nOn special occasions, students who bear a post in a sports team, club or association, would wear a blazer which would normally be white and having accents based on the school colours.\n\nIn privately run schools, the suit is very similar but the colours might differ. They range from khaki and dark green to bright blue.\n\n== Taiwan ==\n[[File:\u8473\u683c\u9ad8\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4e2d\u90e8\u5973\u751f\u590f\u5b63\u5236\u670d(\u914d\u904b\u52d5\u5916\u5957).jpg|thumb|upright|A schoolgirl of Taiwan in her uniform.]]\n\nAs Taiwan experienced a long period of Japanese colonial rule, it is influenced by Japanese culture and the uniform style can be said to be close. However the school uniforms in the two regions are not identical.\n\nThere are a total of 471 Taiwanese high schools. All schools have two sets of uniforms, a summer uniform and a uniform for winter. According to the provisions, sportswear is worn.\n\n'''Summer'''\n\nPrimary school\uff1aWhite short pants and shirts are most common for the boys, while girls will wear a pleated skirt\n\nSecondary school\uff1aMales wear short-sleeved shirts with shorts.

Female students, wear a knee-length dark blue or black skirt, and a pale white blouse with a loosely hanging bow tie. The bow tie is dropped in favour of an open-necked pale blue shirt from Matthayom 4.\n\nThe girls' uniform is complemented by white ankle socks and black school shoes. The student's name, number, and name of the school are often embroidered on the blouse or shirt. Some independent or international schools have uniforms more closely resembling British school uniform standards, and boys in senior high school grades may be allowed to wear long trousers. The standard dress for children in kindergarten is a red skirt and white blouse for girls, and red short trousers and a white shirt for boys. In all Thai schools, one day per week, usually Wednesday, is dedicated to scouting, when beige scout uniforms for boys and dark green guide uniforms are the rule, both wearing yellow neckerchiefs.\n\nThe hairstyle of students is also given attention by schools and the Ministry of Education. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Some prohibit even girls from having long hair.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/95321/thailand-whats-hair-got-to-do-with-childrens-rights/ |title=Thailand: What has hair got to do with children's rights? |author= Saksith Saiyasombut & Siam Voices  |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oknation.net/blog/print.php?id=165611 |script-title=th:\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e14\u0e47\u0e08\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19 \u0e46 \u0e43\u0e19\u0e42\u0e23\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19 |author= \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e25\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22\u0e43\u0e08 |date= November 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2013|language=th}}</ref> The use of accessories is prohibited for males, while females are sometimes allowed to use simple accessories.

Uniforms are usually in the colours of their respective churches and Red for Government Schools. Catholic schools are usually light blue, Wesleyan (Royal Blue), Anglican (Navy Blue) and LDS Schools (Green). A [[Ta'ovala]] bordered with school colours and a tupenu are usually worn by boys with a white button-up shirt. Pupils usually wear shorts and a white button up shirt. Nearly all Tongan secondary schools require girls to wear a pinafore dress with a white shirt, except for Catholic schools which allow a striped blouse and skirt. Pupils are usually required to wear Roman sandals in English-medium schools, and [[Flip-flops|thongs]] (flip-flops) in most other schools.\n\n== Turkey ==\n\n[[File:08913-Perspective Run.jpg|thumb|Turkish school uniforms.]]\n\nSchool uniforms were used in all public and private institutions. There were several exceptions and most kindergartens did not require school uniforms. The uniforms varied in their appearance; primary schools used one-piece blue uniforms, while in secondary and high schools boys wore dark grey trousers with white shirts, jackets and a tie. Girls had skirts and shirts coloured like the boys' uniform, plus a tie. Most private institutions have their own uniforms. School uniforms for primary schools were black until the 1990s. None of the universities or higher-education institutes have uniforms.\n\nSchool uniforms abolished in 2012 and schools gave a poll to families to select uniform or casual cloths. Dress code says that students' shoulder should be covered, girls cannot wear leggings or miniskirts. This caused a controversy in Western cities since some students were wearing mini's, shorts and leggings. New law says that students can wear hijabs at school but it's prohibited to wear makeup, tattoos, piercings, dye \u0131n hair etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/School%20Uniforms/school-uniforms-turkey|title=School Uniforms in Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=K12 Academics|access-date=February 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSchool uniforms have a long history in Turkey. They were first introduced because normal clothing would give hints about the child's family's economic situation. In order to prevent groupings amongst children from different social classes, uniforms were accepted.\n\nHowever, school uniforms were officially abolished on 27 November 2012, when the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Turkish Ministry of Education]] suddenly abolished the nationwide uniform requirement in schools (international/foreign schools are excluded) and lifted the headscarf ban for religious imam-hatip schools, prompting fierce criticism from opposition parties, unions and educators. Opponents claim that economic differences cause pedagogical traumas for children and that permitting headscarves harms secular education. Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] defended the move, saying education in uniform has drawn complaints for many years. But students attending minority schools (Greeks, Jews and Armenians), which are also part of the Turkish Ministry of Education, have been excluded from this change, and are still required to wear school uniforms.<ref>[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/145198/obligatory-school-uniforms-abolished-amid-criticisms.html \"Obligatory School Uniforms Abolished amid Criticisms\"].

[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/education/abu-dhabi-school-pupils-wear-a-whole-new-look-1.1380600]  Earlier, each school had its own uniform. \nUniforms include options for varying weather conditions. [http://www.adec.ac.ae/en/MediaCenter/Pages/Downloads.aspx]\nBoys in Kindergarten and Cycle 1 (Grades 1 to 5) can wear either a long-sleeved shirt and trousers or a short-sleeved shirt and shorts. Tie, winter blazer, and cardigan are optional.\nBoys in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 (Grades 6 to 12) wear a [[kandoora]] (traditional white robe) and [[ghetra]] (head scarf). Pullover sweater or blazer are optional\nGirls in Kindergarten or Cycle 1 (Grades 1 to 5) wear a long sleeved shirt with either a school dress or skirt. Cardigan, blazer, and scarf are optional.\nGirls in Cycle 2 or 3 (Grades 6 to 12) wear a long sleeved shirt with a choice of a skirt or two different styles of dress plus a scarf. Cardigan or blazer are optional. These are only for the schools with the Arabic curriculum, not the other schools.\n\nPrivate schools in the UAE require a school uniform. It can range from a T-shirt or a simple white/black polo bearing the school logo to a more complete uniform with a button up shirt worn with a skirt, shorts or trousers. In the British schools, there is a blouse and either a skirt or trousers for the girls or a button up shirt with trousers. Shirts bear the school logo. Certain schools have certain codes on the use of makeup (some don't condone it at all) and the sporting of bracelets/jewellery.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\nWhile school uniform is common in the United Kingdom, there is no legislation enforcing it in any of the three separate legal jurisdictions of England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and enforcement of school uniform policy and dress codes is generally for individual schools to determine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCourt|first1=Laura|title=School Uniform Policy in Scotland, England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland briefing paper 48/13|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2013/education/4813.pdf|website=Northern Ireland Assembly|publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=4 January 2013}}</ref>  However, schools do have to take into account Equality legislation in dress policies to prevent discrimination on grounds such as age, sex, race, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The schools provisions of the Act|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/private-and-public-sector-guidance/education-providers/schools-guidance/introduction/schools-provisions-act|website=Equality and Human Rights Commission|publisher=EHRC|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=21 May 2014}}</ref> School uniforms are required to be similar in cost for both boys and girls,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/514978/School_Uniform_Guidance.pdf|title=School uniform: Guidance for governing bodies, school leaders, school staff and local authorities|last=|first=|date=September 2013|website=education.gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|access-date=}}</ref> to be reasonably low cost, and to tolerate religious freedoms, e.g. allowing male Sikhs to wear turbans and female Muslims to wear headscarves.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/find_out/guides/2003/school_uniform/newsid_3181000/3181847.stm \"School uniform\"], ''CBBC Newsround'', retrieved on 28 August 2008.</ref> In order to ensure that policies are fair and non-discriminatory schools are expected to consult widely with staff, pupils, parents and governors when introducing or amending dress policies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cc30c04f-9785-49ef-b0bd-c0f9b07904b7 |title=School uniform policies and the Equality Act 2010 |last=Bell |first=Bircham Dyson |date=5 July 2012 |website=Lexology |publisher=Globe Business Publishing |access-date=9 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== England ===\n\n[[File:School uniforms GBR.jpg|thumb|English girls in modern school uniform.]]\n{{Main|School uniforms in England}}\n\nIn 2011, more than 90% of English secondary schools had a compulsory uniform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/school-uniform-results|title=School uniform does not improve results \u2013 discuss|first=Stephanie|last=Northen|date=18 January 2011|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> School uniforms were first introduced on a large scale{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://histclo.com/schun/hist/schun-hist.html|title=The History of School Uniforms|publisher=Historical Boys Clothing|accessdate=28 August 2008}}</ref> The uniforms of the time were referred as \"bluecoats\", as they consisted of long trench-coat-style jackets dyed blue.

These reforms encouraged schools to implement uniform codes which were similar to other schools. Distinct \"summer\" and \"winter\" uniforms were sometimes required, particularly for girls, for whom dresses were mandated for summer and gymslips for winter.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the 21st century, the typical primary school uniform is fairly casual while secondary school uniform is often formal. Uniform in primary school is generally a polo shirt or [[T-shirt]], a jumper with the school logo, and trousers or shorts or a skirt. The typical secondary school uniform is a blazer, white shirt or blouse, a tie, trousers or skirt, and black shoes. Some primary schools have more formal uniform, with tie and blazer, and for secondary schools to require only a jumper.

However, a child that simply refuses to wear the school uniform can be disciplined by the school if it thinks that academic or disciplinary problems might be caused by the refusal. Many schools do have a policy covering the wearing of school clothing. The policy may state that certain items must be worn and that other items cannot be worn, for example, jeans. Schools must take religious and cultural requirements into account when drawing up a school uniform policy.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/scotland/your_family/education_scotland/problems_at_school_scotland.htm#generalappearance\n|title = Problems at School\n|work = Adviceguide\n|publisher = Citizen Advice\n|accessdate = 14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the way that the uniforms are worn is usually not an issue, some state schools may have regulation on the subject (e.g. height of ties, whether the shirt is tucked in or not), the selection of clothes worn, whether they follow the policy, can be very strict. For example, in black and white uniform schools, wearing colours such as grey or wearing white shoes is forbidden. However, in schools that only use a basic uniform (e.g. jumper and trousers) the policy is often less strict.\n\n=== Wales ===\n\nThe [[Welsh Assembly Government]] issued detailed guidance to governing bodies on uniform and appearance policies that begins by making explicit, \"There is no education legislation specifically covering the wearing of school uniform or other aspects of appearance such as hair colour and style, and the wearing of jewellery and makeup.

[[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] praised the idea in his 1996 [[State of the Union Address]], saying that \"if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms.\"[http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/New/other/sotu.html] The adoption of school- or district-wide uniform policies (or \"standardised dress codes\", less rigid than uniform requirements and allowing some leeway in parameters) has been motivated by a need to counter \"[[gang signals|gang clothing]]\" or the pressure for families to purchase upscale-label clothing (to avoid the ostracism of their children by \"fashion cliques\"), as well as to improve [[morale]] and [[school discipline]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe proportion of U.S. public schools requiring uniforms had increased from 3% in 1996 to 25% in 2010.\n\nIn [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Puerto Rico Department of Education|Department of Education]] requires all students to wear school uniforms, with only medical exemptions.<ref>{{Citation |title=Volante supletorio reglamento general de estudiantes del sistema de educaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica de Puerto Rico que deroga el reglamento n\u00famero 5364 de 17 de enero de 1996 |url=http://www.de.gobierno.pr/dePortal/Descargas/REGLAMENTOCONDENSADO20042005.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902053940/http://www.de.gobierno.pr/DEPortal/Descargas/REGLAMENTOCONDENSADO20042005.pdf |publisher=[[Puerto Rico Department of Education]] |archive-date=2009-09-02 |language=es}}</ref>\n\n== Vietnam ==\n\nMost schools in [[Vietnam]] require uniforms. The rules on uniform vary between schools and areas. The most common type of uniform consists of a white shirt with a school logo on left sleeve and navy/black trousers, with a [[red scarf]] for students from grade 3 to grade 9. This kind of uniform is often seen in public schools in North Vietnam and in rural areas. There is no differences between boys' and girls' uniforms. However, many schools (usually private or famous public schools) have their own designed uniforms, which often replace trousers with skirts for girls or include bows, ties or vests/blazers.<ref>Examples of different school uniforms in Vietnam http://www.asiafinest.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=305508&st=0</ref>\n\n[[File:KHAIGIANGLSTS.jpg|thumb|School uniforms of Lawrence S. Ting School in 7th District, [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]]]]\n\nThe white [[\u00e1o d\u00e0i]] is also a tradition uniform for high school girls in Vietnam, but most schools in [[Northern Vietnam]] only require it for important events or ceremonies, since wearing \u00e1o d\u00e0i is uncomfortable for daily use. Otherwise, \u00e1o d\u00e0i is very familiar with school girls in [[Mekong Delta]], where it is \"daily uniform\" of all them. The image of a high school girl with [[n\u00f3n l\u00e1]] and white \u00e1o d\u00e0i on a bike is still considered symbolic.\n\n[[File:Bicycle of Ho Chi Minh City.jpg|thumb|left|Two highschool girls in \u00e1o d\u00e0i in HCMC]]\n\nThere are also uniforms for [[Physical Education]] in Vietnamese schools, this usually includes T-shirt and [[tracksuit]], the T-shirts have school logo on them. The tracksuit jacket is popular and often used as a winter uniform, even outside of gym activity.\n\nThere are no specific [[shoes]] for Vietnamese students, however, flip-flops, slippers and high heels are forbidden. Sandals and boots are allowed, although students normally wear sneakers or flats to school. [[Dyeing hair|Dyed hair]], nail polish and make-up are banned in many schools.\n\n== Venezuela ==\n\nSchool uniforms are used in [[Venezuela]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualcampuses.eu/index.php/Venezuela|title=Venezuela - Researching Virtual Initiatives in Education|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> By Venezuelan decree, uniforms are required at all schools in all grades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ediplomat.com/np/post_reports/pr_ve.htm|title=Venezuela - Post Report - e Diplomat|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> Boys wear navy trousers and girls wear navy skirts or trousers, depending on the school. The shirts have short sleeves and the colour varies by the level in which the student is. Students in nursery wear yellow shirts, while students in kindergarten wear red shirts. From first to sixth grade, students wear white polo shirts. From seventh to ninth grade they wear light blue polo shirts, and from tenth to eleventh grade they wear beige polo shirts. These shirts are to be stuffed inside the trousers with a black belt. Black dress shoes are the norm in public school, however some private schools can be more flexible with the shoes to be worn.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Fashion|Schools}}\n* [[School uniform]]\n* [[Catholic school uniform]]\n* [[Uniform fetishism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Alleyne, Sylvan I., Velma LaPoint, Jennifer Lee and Harold W.

It is believed that the [[Christ's Hospital]] school in London in 1552 was the first [[school]] to use a uniform for its [[student]]s.<ref>see {{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-29047752 |title=The history of school uniforms |last=Scott |first=Jenny |date=2014-09-05 |work=BBC News}}</ref> The earliest documented proof of institutionalised use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ordered the wearing of the ''cappa clausa''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The School Uniform Movement and what it Tells Us about American Education |last=Brunsma |first=David L. |pages=3 ff |chapter=A Brief History of School Uniforms and Dress Code}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of wearing school uniform has been adopted by many other countries, and is now common in many parts of the world. Uniforms can be regarded as promoting social equality among students and an [[esprit de corps]], but have also been criticised for promoting a form of uniformity characteristic of militarism.\n\nThe decision as to whether to implement school uniform policy or not is a controversial one and also polarised in societies and countries. In countries such as the United Kingdom, South Africa and a number of Asian nations, school children have to wear approved school uniforms that conform to the uniform policy of their school. In modern Europe, Britain and Ireland stand out as the only countries where school uniform is widely adopted by state schools and generally supported by national and local governments, although there is no legislation governing school uniform in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web\n|last1=McCourt\n|first1=Laura\n|title=School Uniform Policy in Scotland, England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland briefing paper 48/13\n|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2013/education/4813.pdf\n|website=Northern Ireland Assembly\n|publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service\n|accessdate=9 November 2015\n|ref=NIAR 862-12\n|date=4 January 2013}}</ref> There are some independent schools and state schools that do not have school uniforms: their pupils are at liberty to dress in a way considered to be appropriate by the school, themselves and their parents or guardians.\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300\n| header = School uniforms in different countries\n| image1 = Indian school girls 4.jpg\n| image2 = JfCalabaSanIsidroNuevaEcijaRosaryParishHighSchoolfvf 08.JPG\n| image3 = Anak_SD_di_Ciwidey.jpg\n| image4 = Centro de Estudiantes.jpg\n}}\n\n== Australia ==\n[[File:Barack Obama at Campbell High School.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Barack Obama]] with students at an Australian high school in 2011.]]\nIn Australia, each school or school system can set its own uniform policy. Wearing a uniform is compulsory in most Australian private and all Catholic schools, as well as in most public schools, although it is sometimes less enforced in primary schools that have uniforms. Uniforms usually have a colour scheme based on the school colours. Uniform and appearance are generally strictly enforced in private and Catholic schools, though less so in public schools, which generally allow their students a reasonable amount of leeway. Most, if not all, private schools have the school logo incorporated in the uniform ensemble, typically on the necktie and the blazer breast pocket.\n\nFor boys, the uniforms generally include a button-up or polo shirt with either [[short pants|shorts]] (especially for summer wear) or long trousers, usually in grey or navy blue or the school colour. Some schools allow boys to wear shorts only in younger years, and they must wear long trousers once they are a senior (17-18). At others, even older boys wear shorts in summer due to the heat.<ref>See e.g. [http://www.dobsons.com.au/static_site/pdf/St%20Kevins%20College.pdf School uniform price list] making a distinction between summer uniform and winter uniform.</ref> Where short trousers are to be worn, socks in school colours (more commonly white) are often required. Girls' uniforms generally include a checkered or striped dress (usually sleeveless or short-sleeved) worn over a blouse for summer and, in most secondary schools, girls wear a skirt as well as a button-up or polo shirt in winter with a blazer and tie. In a number of schools, girls are also permitted to wear a button-up or polo shirt and dark trousers.\n\nIn public schools, the uniform is usually a polo shirt for juniors and a different one for seniors and  trousers or skirt. This set may be complemented by a school [[necktie]] and, typically, a v-neck jumper (pullover or sweater) or a blazer. In the summer, boys usually do not wear ties, pullovers, or blazers. Instead, they wear a short-sleeved version of the shirt and short trousers. A neck-tie, blazer, and hat are also common in private and Catholic schools.\n\nIn most high schools a PE uniform is the norm for sports days only. At many high schools, children are required to change into and out of their PE uniform around the PE lesson. The PE uniform usually consists of shorts and a polo shirt, as well as a light weatherproof rain jacket (mainly at private or Catholic schools), usually made of polyester, for winter and wet weather and sometimes a netball skirt for girls. It is common for students in their final year of primary school or secondary school to have their own jersey, jumper or jacket to denote their final-year status.\n\n== Bangladesh ==\n\nSchool uniforms are mandatory in all public and private schools (up to 12th standard) in Bangladesh. While the colour and exact cut of the uniform depend on school regulations and policies, male students in Bangladesh are usually expected to wear full/half sleeve shirts with trousers and female students are expected to wear skirts/pants with shirts or salwar kameez with belts and dupattas.\n\nThe uniform rule only applies to students of primary, secondary, and higher secondary education. Although there are no uniforms for university students in Bangladesh, they are expected to follow the respective dress codes of their institutions.\n\nThe rationale behind the uniform policy of Bangladesh is that the authorities want to protect the students from class stratification that can become apparent when students are given the choice to dress as they like. In addition, authorities believe that students should not misuse their time in trying to dress up for school.\n\n== Brazil ==\n\nThere is no legal requirement for school uniforms in Brazil. On a state-by-state or city-by-city basis, governments may issue uniforms to public school pupils but may not require their use.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/educacao/um-em-cada-quatro-alunos-de-escola-estadual-recebe-uniforme/n1238146989999.html |title=Um em cada quatro alunos de escola estadual recebe uniforme |last=Costa |first=Marina Morena |date=2011-03-10 |website=\u00daltimo Segundo |language=pt-BR |access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> Private schools are free to set their own uniform policy.\n\nBrazilian school uniforms can vary widely by school. There are many schools that opt for a more elegant outfit, while others opt for a simpler one (social shirt, shorts). Some schools use \"intelligent uniforms\" embedded with locator chips that allow computers to automatically record whether pupils have arrived in school or not. If pupils do not turn up for school or classes, an automated message is sent to inform the parents accordingly. The benefit of the automated system is to curb absenteeism and class skipping.<ref>see http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23rfid-chip-brazil-student_n_1374886.html</ref> In this country, where schools have set a uniform, it is the student's obligation to wear it.\n\nMost [[education in Brazil|schools in Brazil]] choose the use of uniforms. The average Brazilian school uniform for boys is a T-shirt with the school's logo, sweatpants or bermuda shorts and a sweatshirt or hoodie. The uniform for girls is very similar, but instead leggings or short shorts are worn, although ballerina pants are also highly popular. Younger girls may have the choice to wear a skirts with shorts underneath. Most schools require sneakers.\n\n== Burundi ==\n\nSchool uniforms are compulsory for school children in [[Burundi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.org/projects/2112-educational-for-street-children-in-burundi|title=Bildungschancen f\u00fcr Stra\u00dfenkinder in Burundi|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> Burundi, like most African countries, has a compulsory school uniform policy. Burundi's school uniform policy dates back to the colonial days. During those days, chiefs' sons wore a white uniform and all other children wore khaki.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/iiep/PDF/pubs/2008/Burundi.pdf|title=IIEP UNESCO|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> The uniform policy is still in force in Burundi to date. However, schools decide on what uniform the pupils wear. It is also argued that the cost of buying the school uniform and poverty, especially in the rural areas, negatively affect school enrollment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imagine-burundi-terimbere.com/contact/school-uniform-and-little-sun.html|title=SCHOOL UNIFORM AND LITTLE SUN|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Cambodia ==\n[[File:\u00c9coliers au Cambodge.jpg|thumb|School children wearing uniforms in [[Cambodia]]]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nIn Cambodia, students of all ages (pre-school to college) wear school uniforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cctnz.org.nz/education-projects|title=- The Cambodia Charitable Trust|date=13 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> The uniforms differ by school and age level. Generally, boys wear a white dress shirt and a pair of shorts. The colour and length of the shorts varies at each school.  Male college students wear the same kind of uniform, but instead of shorts, they wear black dress trousers. Girls usually wear white blouses and a skirt. Their skirts vary in colour and length depending upon the school and their ages. Generally, the younger students wear long skirts that almost reach their ankles and older students, particularly in college, wear shorter ones. Skirts are generally blue or black but may be other colours as well, depending on the school. Some schools also have alternative uniforms which students of both genders wear every other day. These often consist of a coloured shirt and slacks. High school girls must wear black or blue long skirts. High school boys wear long black or blue trousers. The white shirt can be short-sleeved or long-sleeved for both genders. High school students are also required to wear name tags on the left hand side of their shirts.\n\n==Canada==\n[[File:Maison Piacente highschool uniforms.jpg|thumb|right|Highschool uniforms on sale at a warehouse store in [[Montreal, Quebec]].]]\nIn Canada, the province of Quebec is the only province where school uniforms are present in a majority of schools. Within the English school system of Quebec, almost all schools from elementary to high school have mandatory school uniforms. In the rest of Canada, school uniforms are not required in most public schools or [[separate schools]], except in exceptional circumstances such as school performances or international field trips. However, the majority of Catholic high schools in [[southern Ontario]] (Grade 9-12) do require uniforms.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/2010/01/19/st-marys-committee-asks-parents-about-uniforms | title=Owen Sound Sun Times}}</ref> These uniforms generally have long- or short-sleeved shirts with the school logo or crest near the collar and trousers or kilted skirts. Schools often allow girls the option of choosing to wear a skirt or trousers. Some schools also mandate dress shoes and a particular type and length of socks to go with the uniform. A cardigan sweater, vest, or blazer may be part of the ensemble, particularly in winter. Additionally, as of 2011, the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] has implemented an ''Appropriate Dress Code'' of navy blue and white in all elementary separate schools which do not already have their own uniforms.<ref name=TCDSB>{{cite web|title=Dress Code in TCDSB Schools|url=https://www.tcdsb.org/FORPARENTS/DressCode/Pages/default.aspx|website=TCDSB|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nOtherwise, specific regulations and policies regarding school-appropriate dress and the extent of dress code enforcement will vary by school.\n\nUniforms are used in most private schools, and also in special or alternative programs of public and Catholic schools, such as the Traditional Learning Centres, a program that takes a [[liberal arts]] approach, while focusing on high levels of academic excellence. In [[Quebec]], most metropolitan anglophone school boards require a uniform.\n\n== Chile ==\n\n{{Main|Chilean school uniform}}\nIn Chile, most schools have a uniform.\n\nUntil 1930, it was uncommon for students to wear a uniform. Under the government of [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]], all students became obliged to wear a school uniform. During the administration of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], a unified uniform was introduced for all public and private schools and other education centers. Today, these uniforms have disappeared in private schools, who prefer to use a customised one.\n\n== China ==\n[[File:School uniforms in China - 03.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese high school students in their summer school uniforms.]]\nUniforms are a common part of the [[Education in China|schools in China]]. Almost all secondary schools as well as some elementary schools require students to wear uniforms. Uniforms in mainland China usually consist of five sets: 2 formal sets and 3 everyday sets. A formal set is worn on Mondays or special occasions (school anniversaries, school ceremonies, etc.) They consist of a white collared shirt with a sweater on top and a skirt for girls or a suit for boys. There is one formal set for summer and one set for winter. Everyday uniforms for boys in the winter usually consist of a zippered [[sweater]] and trousers and a collared shirt (usually white). Thinner materials are worn in the spring and fall and short or long trousers may be worn in the summer. The everyday uniforms for girls are very similar to the boys' uniform. It is relatively common for there to be some kind of sponsored advertisement on some non-formal school uniform shirts, though this trend has fluctuated in recent years.\n\n== Colombia ==\n[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Colombian primary school students with their teacher.]]\nIn Colombia, all students are required to wear uniforms in public and private schools. Uniforms in Colombia consist of two sets, one for everyday use and a sports one for physical education. Everyday uniforms for girls generally include a knee-length skirt, a white T-shirt with a vest, and white calf-length socks. For boys, the uniform generally includes dark-coloured long trousers and a short- or long-sleeved shirt. The shoes for both girls and boys are black lace-up shoes (sometimes the shoes may be dark blue or wine-coloured, depending on the uniform colours) and the shirts usually have the school's symbol at the left side. The sports uniform includes sweat pants, a collared T-shirt, and white sports shoes. The designs and the colours of the uniforms depend on the school's colours and the principal's preference.\n\n== El Salvador ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Independencia desfile Santa Tecla 2012.jpg|thumb|204x204px|Salvadoran school students celebrating independence day]]\nIn El Salvador, all students from public schools  and private schools are required to wear uniforms.\n\n== France ==\n\nSince 1968, uniforms have not been enforced in French schools, a few exceptions (such as [[Maison d'\u00e9ducation de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur]], les \u00c9coles TUNON, and Vatel).  [[Xavier Darcos]], a former teacher and [[Department of Education|Minister of Education]] from 2007 to 2009, is an advocate of the reintroduction of uniforms:  \"This is not outrageous. This removes the visible differences in social status or wealth. This is an additional factor of integration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2009/01/17/525744-Darcos-ressort-l-uniforme-du-placard.html|title=Darcos ressort l'uniforme du placard|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince March 2012, the students of the Boarding School of Excellence [[Sourdun]] wear a uniform with the insignia of their establishment.\n\nLes lyc\u00e9es de la d\u00e9fense, formerly known as [[Military school#France|military schools]], require their students to wear uniforms.  At some universities, the [[academic dress]] is becoming popular.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nIn the [[French Antilles]] ([[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]), as well as French Guiana, a uniform has been required since September 2008.\n\n== Germany ==\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2010}}\n[[File:Waldgrundschule Schulkleidung.jpg|thumb|German school children wearing voluntary \"Schulkleidung\" (2009).]]\n\nThere is no tradition of wearing school uniforms in Germany, and today, almost all students of state schools, private schools or universities do not wear school uniforms. However, certain garments have been common to students in former times:\n\nFrom the 16th century, students (especially of secondary or grammar schools and similar institutions) were often subject to regulations that prescribed, for example, modest and not too stylish attire. In many cases these regulations were part of wider laws concerning the clothing of all citizens of certain social classes.\n\nA blue coat became a widespread obligatory status symbol of students of secondary schools; it fell out of use during the latter half of the 18th century. In more recent times, school uniforms in any real sense did not exist outside of convent schools and private boarding schools. At times, certain fashions became so widespread that they approached uniform status; this is true in particular for so-called student hats (''Sch\u00fclerm\u00fctzen'') that became widespread from the 1880s on and remained somewhat popular until they were banned by the Nazis. Their wearing was advocated by teachers and the students themselves and occasionally made mandatory, but never on a national or statewide level. Another instance are the [[sailor suits]] that became fashionable around the turn of the 19th century. These, too, were not usually a prescribed uniform.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Handbuch der Geschichte des Bayerischen Bildungswesens\n| author = M. Freyer\n| chapter = Geschichte der Schulkleidung\n| editor = H. Liedtke\n| pages = 273 ff\n| volume = 4}}</ref>\n\nThe Nazis banned student hats \u2013 the last remaining, if voluntary, form of unified student clothing \u2013 because they considered them an attribute of class society. They did, however, institute mandatory membership in the uniformed [[Hitler Youth]] (''HJ'') from 1936 until their fall. HJ uniforms were worn in the HJ training academies and in the [[National Political Institutes of Education|Napolas]]; students of other schools sometimes wore them to school at their own discretion.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn recent times, the introduction of school uniforms has been discussed, but usually the expression \"uniform\" (the word is the same in German) is avoided in favour of terms like \"school clothing\" (\"Schulkleidung\"). School clothing has been introduced in a small number of schools, for example in [[Hamburg]]-Sinstorf in 2000, and in [[Friesenheim (Baden)|Friesenheim]] and [[Haag in Obb|Haag (Oberbayern)]] in 2005. In these cases the clothes are collections of shirts, sweaters, and the like, catering to contemporary fashion senses. Uniforms in a more traditional sense are almost never proposed in earnest.\n\nThe debate on mandatory school uniforms intensified in Germany when two Muslim girls dressed in burkas arrived at a school in Bonn in 2006. The girls' actions were interpreted as political action and they were subsequently suspended from school. Then-Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries  in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag stated that the simple solution to the issue under consideration is mandatory introduction of school uniforms for boys and girls across Germany. She further argued that school uniforms would help to prevent conflicts arising from religious or political differences.  Her stance was supported by then-Minister Of Education Annette Schavan. The proposal was met with opposition from the teacher union and opposition political parties. The teacher union argued that school uniforms are not the solution for integration problems nor the issue of fashion obsession. The leader of the teacher union  Heinz-Peter Meidinger also added that the school uniforms have been a controversial issue in Germany over the years.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4753623.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - School uniform row grips Germany|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|date=9 May 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to school uniforms===\nA senior member of the Green Party, Krista Sager, also said that the introduction of school uniforms would be unacceptable state interference in religious matters. She then proposed that individual schools have to find their own solutions and rejected solutions imposed by government. She further noted that school uniforms are no longer up to date and their imposition would be rejected by the current generation of students. The Conference of Education Ministers, a body which decides on school policies, also kicked back against school uniforms. They cited historical reasons dating back to WWII with memories of Hitler Youth's uniform still fresh in people's minds. They also concluded that the imposition of school uniforms would be excessive government encroachment on personal liberty of pupils and parents.<ref name=\"dw.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/in-germany-veiled-students-stir-up-uniform-debate/a-1996295|title=In Germany, Veiled Students Stir Up Uniform Debate - Germany - DW.COM - 08.05.2006|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> \nHowever, a number of schools sell branded clothing that can be worn as a sign of school pride.<ref name=\"dw.de\"/>\n\nThe [[Bildungsstreik]] movement fights against school uniforms due to their belief that it represents some kind of [[militarism]].<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\n== Ghana ==\n\n[[File:Ghana students.jpg|thumb|left| Students in [[Ghana]] wearing their uniform]]\n\nAll children have to wear school uniforms in [[Ghana]].

In an effort to achieve universal primary education the government, as part of its educational policy, initiated free school uniform distribution throughout the country in 2010.<ref>http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Ghana/Ghana_MDG_Report_2010.pdf</ref> According to government data, a total of 170,221 pupils were supplied with free school uniforms in 2013 and it planned to supply 10,000 uniforms in 2014.<ref>http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/2012-02-08-08-24-49/ministry-of-education</ref> There are public programs to offer poor families financial help to buy uniforms.

As seen here, Indian schoolgirls can have uniform of both shirt and skirt, as well as ''[[salwar kameez]]''.]]\nUniforms are compulsory in India in both public and private schools. The boys' uniforms are often made of a light-coloured shirt, long trousers usually blue, white or black, and those of the girls are often a shirt and a skirt. At the state level, the secondary schools are required to use a [[salwar kameez]]. This is not compulsory but they do have certain specific dress code.\n\nMany schools require students to wear uniform shoes, ties and ID cards, and comb their hair down and keep it clean and short. Long hair is tied in braids. Uniform is one of the most important components of school life and is taken very seriously in India.\n\nSome institutions also require the use of a tie, especially the schools run by [[Christians|Christian]] missionaries, and the Indian government does not prohibit the children to have religious symbols, so the [[Muslim]] girls can wear the veil (hijab) ([[burqa|burka]]) and [[Sikh]] boys a [[turban]] in addition to the uniform. However, most of the schools, whether public or private, prohibit students to have a ponytail or dyed hair.\n\n== Indonesia ==\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], school uniforms are mandatory for every student. They can be simply described as below for each stage of education:\n* Primary schools or ''Sekolah Dasar'' (''SD'') students wear a white short-sleeve shirt with red shorts for male students, and below-knee skirts for females.\n* Lower secondary schools or ''Sekolah Menengah Pertama'' (''SMP'') require navy blue shorts or trousers with a short-sleeve white shirt for male students. Females wear a below-knee-length or long navy blue skirt and short-sleeve white shirt.\n* Upper secondary schools ''Sekolah Menengah Atas'' (''SMA'') require blue-grey trousers with a short-sleeve white shirt. Females wear a below-knee-length or long blue-grey skirt, and wear short-sleeve or long-sleeve white shirts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pendidikan.jogja.go.id/index.php?pilih=hal&id=9|title=Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Education: School Uniforms|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\nPublic schools in Indonesia tolerate religious freedoms. For example, [[Muslim]] girls may opt to wear long-sleeve shirts, longer skirts, and [[jilbab]] to cover their heads. Most [[Education in Indonesia|schools in Indonesia]] also have a [[batik]] uniform, usually worn on Thursday or Friday. This kind of uniform consists of a batik short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirt, with long or short trousers for SMA and below-knee or long skirts for females. The motifs and colours of batik depend on the school. Some schools tend to issue neckties and/or vests for their students. These neckties and vests may vary from school to school in colour and sewing pattern, even among public schools.\n\nNowadays, with the increase of private schools in Indonesia, most private schools have their own signature school uniform. Most consist of shirts with shorts or trousers for males, and skirts for females, only with differences on the colour.\n\nEvery school has its own standard grooming. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Accessories are also normally prohibited for males, except for watches. Females are usually allowed to use simple accessories such as watches, earrings, and sometimes bracelets. Wearing nail polish is usually not allowed.\n\nMost schools pay attention to the shoes that can be worn. Black or white sneakers with white laces are the most common shoes. Few higher-level students, such as in ''SMA'' or ''SMK'', are normally required to wear black leather shoes.\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Meisjes met angklungs TMnr 20018432.jpg|thumb|left|Schoolgirls in Indonesia]]\n\nThe school badge is usually put on the right sleeve of a shirt, consist of school's name and location, and some have their own school's logo. Others prefer to wear the school's logo as a lapel or breast plastic or metal pin. The emblem of OSIS (''Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah''), or School's Intern Student Organization, is put on the shirt's left pocket. Students' names are usually on the right side of the shirt and embedded by sewing, ironing or as a detachable badge. Some schools (usually \"SMP\" and \"SMA\") distinguish the grade of their students by stripes on the official neckties issued or an emblem below the school emblem (it can be stripes, chevrons or numbers). Nowadays some schools require the students to wear an Indonesian flag school badge sewn on top of their left pocket. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe [[scouts]] (pramuka) uniform is used in many schools in Indonesia at least once a week. It consists of light-brown short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirts, with dark-brown shorts or trousers, and below-knee skirts or longer for females. The common day to wear the scout uniform usually falls on Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday. Furthermore, on certain occasions (usually on ceremonies or competitions), the uniform should be worn as full dress, with red and white scarf/necktie, dark brown beret, rope, dagger and scout's stick.\n\nThe scout uniform has two breast pockets. Above right pocket is the student's name. The [[Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia]] (Indonesian Scout Movement) logo is sewn on the left pocket (for male students). On the right sleeve there are scouting organization's location, number and logo, while on the left sleeve usually are the student's scouting team logo and chevrons denoting his/her grade. Male students wear International Scout Organization logo above their name and female students on their lapel.\n\n== Israel ==\n\nAccording to former Education Minister [[Limor Livnat]], about 1,400 Israeli public schools require pupils to wear uniforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=111|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403111140/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=111|url-status= dead|title=Israel QA File news, Israel diplomatic map|archivedate=3 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nSchool uniforms used to be the norm in the state's early days, but have since fallen out of favour. However, in recent years, the number of schools using school uniforms has been increasing once more. Many teachers, parents and students are in favour of returning the school uniform to common use to prevent the deepening of the gap between affluent children and those less well-off. Nowadays school uniforms are mainly associated with \"national religious\" schools within the [[Education in Israel|Israeli system of education]].<ref>Dr. Zvi Zameret, [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Israel%20at%2050/Fifty%20Years%20of%20Education%20in%20the%20State%20of%20Israel ''Fifty Years of Education in the State of Israel''], Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1998.</ref> Schools for [[Arab citizens of Israel]]  also frequently require uniforms: for girls, it is often a [[pinafore]] to be worn over trousers and shirt.\n\nIn the [[Haredi]] or ultra-Orthodox school system, uniforms are compulsory in essentially all girls' schools. In the vast majority of these, the style adopted by the [[Bais Yaakov|Beit Ya'akov]] network is used: a sky-blue, button-down, open-collar, loose-fitting blouse with an Oxford-blue, pleated skirt which comes to just below the knee and dark stockings. In cold weather, a Yale-blue sweater may be added. A small fraction of schools alter the colour scheme to pink and burgundy, while otherwise retaining the same overall appearance. In boys' schools there is usually not an identifiable school uniform, distinct from what is considered acceptable for ordinary street wear. However, the standards of acceptable street wear for boys and men in Haredi communities are so precise and exacting that in almost all cases all of the boys in a particular school will be dressed identically.\n\nIn non-Haredi schools today, school uniforms in Israel consist only of a shirt with the school logo. In the summer, the uniform shirt is a simple T-shirt, while in the winter, the shirts worn are warm or hooded sweaters. Although the shirts are uniform, they usually come in various colours, and allow students to customise and express themselves even while wearing a uniform. The shirts sell for a very small amount of money, so that even the less well-off can acquire them.\n\n== Italy ==\n\nIn Italy, school uniforms are uncommon, partially because child uniforms are associated with the era of [[Benito Mussolini]] before World War II when children were placed according to their age into [[Italian Fascist]] youth movements and had to wear uniforms inside and outside school.\n\nHowever, until the early 1960s many high schools required girls to wear black ''grembiule'' (resembling a doctor smock) on top of their clothes: no uniform was required for boys.\n\nNowadays, many pre-schools advise parents to dress their children with a ''grembiulino'', i.e., a small ''grembiule'', usually shorter and more colourful, that can be purchased cheaply.\n\nSome elementary schools advise some kind of ''grembiule'' for the younger pupils. Sometimes girls are required to wear a pink or white ''grembiulino'', while boys may be required to wear a short cotton jacket, usually blue or black. In other cases both boys and girls may be required to wear a more neutral blue ''grembiule''.\n\nSome parents send their children to school in a ''grembiule'' even if the school does not require it.\n\nPoet and children's writer [[Gianni Rodari]] has described adult life as \"a school without ''grembiule'' and school desk\".<ref>[http://tuttomio.splinder.com/post/10825033/la+scuola+dei+grandi \"la scuola dei grandi\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716120550/http://tuttomio.splinder.com/post/10825033/la+scuola+dei+grandi |date=2011-07-16 }}.</ref>\n\nIn 2004 the Italian chapter of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] warned that synthetic ''grembiuli'' were harmful to pupils.<ref>[http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=47573 \"WWF: attenti ai tessuti di grembiuli e abitini per bambini\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821185319/http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=47573 |date=2006-08-21 }}, ''VITA'' magazine, 13 September 2004.</ref>\n\nIn July 2008 Education Minister Mariastella Gelmini proposed the re-introduction of the compulsory smock in public schools, provoking a debate in the Italian press.<ref>{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=6137276 |title= Students Protest as Italian Senate Passes Reforms |work=ABC News |location =New York |date=29 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Japan ==\n{{main|Japanese school uniform}}\n\n[[File:\u5236\u670d (5346443876).jpg|thumb|[[Arashiyama]] schoolgirls in [[loose socks]]]]\nJapan introduced school uniforms in the late 19th century. Today, school uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems. They are also used in some women's colleges. The Japanese word for uniform is {{Nihongo|''seifuku''|\u5236\u670d}}.\n\nIn the majority of elementary schools, students are not required to wear a uniform to school. Where they are required, many boys wear white shirts, short trousers, and caps. Young boys often dress more formally in their class pictures than they do other days of the school year. Girls' uniforms might include a grey pleated skirt and white blouse. Occasionally the sailor outfit is used for girls. The uniform codes may vary by season to work with the environment and occasion. It is common for  boys and girls to wear brightly coloured caps to prevent traffic accidents. It is normal for uniforms to be worn outside of school areas. However, this is going out of fashion and many students are wearing casual dress.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe Japanese junior- and senior-high-school uniform traditionally consists of a [[Gakuran|military style]] for boys and a [[Japanese school uniform#Sailor outfit|sailor outfit]] for girls. These uniforms are based on [[Meiji era]] formal military dress, themselves modeled on European-style naval uniforms. The sailor outfit replace the undivided [[hakama]] (andon bakama \u884c\u706f\u88b4) designed by [[Utako Shimoda]] between 1920 and 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyogo-c.ed.jp/~kaibara-hs/gaiyo/100nen/33.htm|title=\u5236\u670d\u3067\u305f\u3069\u308b\u767e\u5e74|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> While this style is still in use, many schools have moved to more Western-pattern [[parochial school]] uniform styles. They consist of a white shirt, tie, [[blazer]] or [[sweater vest]] with school crest, and tailored trousers (often not of the same colour as the blazer or sweater vest) for boys and a white blouse, tie, blazer with school crest, and [[tartan]] skirt for girls.\n\nMuch like the male uniform, the [[gakuran]], the sailor outfit bears a similarity to military-styled [[naval]] uniforms. The uniform generally consists of a [[blouse]] attached with a sailor-style collar and a [[pleat]]ed [[skirt]]. There are seasonal variations for summer and winter: sleeve length and fabric are adjusted accordingly. A ribbon is tied in the front and laced through a loop attached to the blouse. Several variations on the ribbon include [[necktie]]s, [[bolo tie]]s, [[neckerchief]]s, and bows. Common colours are navy blue, white, grey, light green and black.\n[[File:\u30ae\u30ea\u30ae\u30ea\u77ed (15580964194).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kogal]] culture: [[Miniskirt]] used as school uniform in Japan, including during winter season.]]\n\nShoes, socks, and other accessories are sometimes included as part of the uniform. The socks are typically navy or white. The shoes are typically brown or black [[penny loafer]]s. Although not part of the prescribed uniform, alternate forms of legwear (such as [[loose socks]], knee-length stockings, or similar) are commonly matched by more fashionable girls with their sailor outfits.\n\nRegardless of what type of uniform any particular school assigns its students, all schools have a summer version (usually consisting of a white dress shirt and dark slacks for boys and a reduced-weight traditional uniform or blouse and tartan skirt with tie for girls) and a sports-activity uniform (a polyester track suit for year-round use and a T-shirt and shorts for summer activities). Depending on the discipline level of their school, students may wear seasonal and activity uniforms in the same classroom during the day. Students may attempt to subvert the system of uniforms by wearing them incorrectly or by adding prohibited elements such as large [[loose socks]] or badges.\n\nMiniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they became part of school uniforms, and they came to be worn within the [[Kogal]] culture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/11/12/business/man-who-gave-us-loose-white-socks-eyes-comeback/|title=Man who gave us loose white socks eyes comeback|first=Taiga|last=Uranaka|date=12 November 2003|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|newspaper=Japan Times Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/japans-schoolgirls-set-the-trend-1295844.html|title=Japan's schoolgirls set the trend|date=23 November 1997|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Lebanon ==\n\nIn Lebanon, all private schools require uniforms.

Some schools require students to sew their name tags in addition to the badge. For upper forms, students generally have to wear a school-specific tie, except those who are wearing the baju kurung.\n\nIn Malaysia, Muslim girls tend to wear the baju kurung. Most of them start wearing a white ''tudung'' (Malaysian version of the Muslim headscarf or hijab) upon entering secondary school, for religious reasons. Non-Muslim girls tend to wear the pinafore. Some non-Muslim girls wear the baju kurung.\n[[File:Sandakan Sabah School-boys-in-their-school-uniform-01.jpg|thumb|left|Malaysian secondary school boys uniform.]]\nMuslim boys may wear [[baju melayu]] at school on Fridays, often with a [[songkok]] hat, to be dressed for going to the mosque for prayers at lunchtime.\n\nGirls who choose to wear the pinafore, especially those attending co-ed schools, usually wear shorts under their pinafore to allow for carefree movement as the skirt only covers up to the knee. Those who wear the baju kurung tend not to wear shorts under their long skirt as their skirt covers their legs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n[[Neckties]] are often worn by prefects, class monitors, librarians, and other students of rank.

Uniform is one of the most important components of school life and is taken very seriously in Nepal.\n\n== New Zealand ==\n\nTraditionally, many New Zealand [[Middle school|intermediate]] and [[high school]]s, and [[state-integrated school|state-integrated]] and private [[primary school]]s, have followed the British system of school uniforms,<ref>Elaine Webster, [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cos/2008/00000042/00000001/art00012 \"New Zealand School Uniforms in the Era of Democracy: 1965 to 1975\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024010817/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cos/2008/00000042/00000001/art00012 |date=2012-10-24 }} in ''Costume'', Volume 42, Number 1, 2008 , pp. 169-183 (15).</ref> although it is common in state schools for the boy's uniform to have a jersey and grey [[short trousers]] rather than a blazer with tie and long trousers. This usually consists of a variety of the following apparel: for boys, a business-style shirt with an official school tie, and long or short trousers; and for girls, a blouse, and a plain and/or [[Plaid (pattern)|plaid]] (usually [[tartan]]) skirt, and in some schools, especially in the [[South Island]], kilts. Both sexes wear an 'official' school jersey. Blazers and jackets are of varied colours according to the school - dark or light blue, grey, crimson, scarlet, green or black. Some follow the British practice of having contrasting colours edging the lapels and jacket fronts. Caps have generally been discarded since the 1970s but in many primary schools there is a compulsory broad-brimmed floppy hat, in the school colours, to help prevent sunburn. Where short trousers are worn, boys are usually required to wear long dark socks, which may require garters to hold them up.<ref>Pictured at [http://histclo.com/Schun/hist/schun-hist.html The History of School Uniforms].</ref> Since 1990 an increasing number of schools, especially in the North Island, include sandals as the standard summer footwear.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s there was a tendency for the traditional uniform to be replaced by cheaper and more 'modern' options: [[polo shirt]]s,<ref>See e.g. [http://www.lphs.school.nz/files/Uniform.pdf Uniform rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529200611/http://www.lphs.school.nz/files/Uniform.pdf |date=2009-05-29 }} at Logan Park High School.</ref> [[polar fleece]] tops, or a complete doing away with uniforms in favour of mufti.

Both the public and the private schools have mandated uniforms. Boys uniforms are often made of a light-coloured shirt, long trousers usually brown or blue. The girls often wear Shalwar Qameez suit or in some schools shirt and skirt.\n\n== Peru ==\n\nSchool uniforms are used in Peru. Almost all private schools, especially, the British one's use schools uniforms.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Philippines==\nSchool uniforms ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''uniporme'' or ''kasuotang pampaaralan'', \"school attire\"), much like Mexico, are commonplace in public schools and required in private schools. In some private schools, there are specified days when students can wear civilian clothing, typically in special occasions like a holiday or last day of school. There is usually no uniform in universities and progressive schools except for uniforms used in P.E classes, and in specific schools such as the [[University of Santo Tomas]].\n\nPublic school uniforms for primary levels are typically white, short-sleeved, buttoned-up shirts, with long skirts for girls and light brown knee-length trousers for boys. Uniforms for public high schools and private schools vary widely in pattern and colour, but most often are in the official school  colours. Muslim girls in some higher institutions are often required to wear a white [[hijab]] versus other colours. Some school uniforms in the Philippines can bear resemblance to Japanese school uniforms.\n\nThe material for these usually loose uniforms is often light and suited to the country's tropical climate (e.g. cotton). \n[[File:Philippine students.jpg|thumb|315x315px|Filipino students wearing their school uniforms in [[Tagaytay, Cavite]], 2010.]]\n* '''Primary school'''\n** '''Boys'''\n*** White polo shirt and\n**** Navy blue short trousers and Navy blue trousers; ''or''\n**** Navy blue long trousers\n**** Blazer or vest (in some international schools)\n**** Necktie (some schools)\n** '''Girls'''\n*** Cream-coloured blouse and checkered skirt; ''or''\n*** Sailor uniform with knee-length checkered or plaid blue skirt\n*** Blazer or vest (in some international schools)\n*** Necktie (some schools)\n** '''Boys'''\n*** White Polo and\n**** Brown Slacks; ''or''\n**** White Polo with black trousers; ''or''\n**** White trousers (generally only for prefects)\n****(May include a blazer for certain international schools)\n** '''Girls'''\n*** White or yellow blouse (with necktie) and checkered deep green skirt; ''or''\n*** Sailor uniform with knee-length checkered blue skirt\n***(May include a blazer for certain international schools)\n\nIn 2008, the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] ordered that students are no longer required to wear uniforms.

The idea of school uniforms in Poland did not exist before the early 20th century. In the [[People's Republic of Poland]], uniform ceased to be compulsory in most schools during the 1980s due to economic issues. Since then, there has been made only one effort to reintroduce uniform into Polish schools - by the former minister of education [[Roman Giertych]], in 2006. It was then decided that school uniform would not be enforced by the state onto the whole country, but would be a matter decided upon by the [[head teacher|principal]] of each school respectively. Initially this was meant to permit only a [[dress code]], but this was later modified in 2007 to address school uniform. From 2007, all [[primary school]]s and [[Gimnazjum#Countries with gymnasium schools|middle schools]] were to enforce compulsory uniform, whilst [[Liceum#Poland|high schools]] and other forms of further education were given the choice to decide on their own. The appearance of school uniform was decided upon locally, which meant that \"uniform\" in most schools consisted of a jacket or shirt only - selected by the school management purely to avoid breaking regulations (the rest of clothing was still up to the students to decide). By mid-2008, compulsory school uniforms were repealed and it remains so to this day.\n\n== Republic of Ireland ==\n\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], almost all primary and secondary schools require students to wear a uniform. These can vary from school to school but for the most part include trousers for male students, a skirt or pinafore for female students and a shirt, a jumper and a necktie. In recent years many schools also offer the option of trousers for female students. Some schools require blazers rather than jumpers. Some primary schools now let their pupils wear a school tracksuit rather than a formal uniform.\n\nIn recent years there has been criticism, including by the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education]] of the requirement that a school uniform jumper must have the school crest or name imprinted onto it and of the practice where a school's uniform can only be bought from a certain supplier, which can markedly increase the price of a uniform. As well as rules regarding the wearing of a uniform many schools have regulations regarding hair, footwear, the growth of facial hair for males, the wearing of makeup and the length of school skirts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/department-issues-guidelines-on-wearing-of-uniforms-for-exams-1.26079|title=Department issues guidelines on wearing of uniforms for exams|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-09-24|language=English}}</ref>\n\n== Russia ==\nDuring the [[Soviet Union|Soviet period]], a standardised \"universal\" school uniform was worn by all schools. Originally of a military style with peaked cap and high collared tunic, by the 1980s boys wore a functional dark blue pattern with shoulder patches identifying the school. For formal occasions such as the first day of term, girls wore white lace collars and aprons dating back to the reign of [[Catherine the Great]]. During the initial post Soviet period from 1994 to 2013, the mandatory uniform policy was abandoned and pupils generally wore casual clothing such as jeans, T-shirts and sweaters. However, uniforms were reintroduced under a new education law in September 2013.<ref name=\"one-europe.info\">http://one-europe.info/school-uniform-the-russian-experience</ref> Among the supporters of the new uniform law of 2013, arguments included tackling social inequality, but also putting an end to the controversial problem of whether school students are allowed to wear traditional religious clothing to school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/opinions/762985|title=Mandatory school uniform stages comeback in Russia|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nEach school can now choose its own uniform.<ref name=\"one-europe.info\"/> Also, there are many instances in which schools do not enforce the rules on school uniform\n\n== South Africa ==\n\n[[File:Carl Redelinghuis Sentrum.jpg|thumb|Typical example of an assembly in a South African school. All students are in uniform, with a sharp difference between the sexes.]]\n[[File:Gr 12A Feb 2013.JPG|thumb|left|Students of [[Sinenjongo High School]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].]]\nAs in many other former British colonies, all South African private and public schools have a uniform, and it is compulsory in all public schools and in the vast majority of private schools for children above pre-school level.<ref>[http://www.southafrica.info/services/education/edufacts.htm#21 \"A parent's guide to schooling\"], SouthAfrica.info.</ref> Uniform types vary less between public and private schools than they do across regions, where schools in more rural areas tend to forgo the daily wearing of ties and/or blazers for boys and girls regardless of their public or private nature. However, many of these same schools will have a \"number ones\" uniform for special occasions which include such items. In cities such as Cape Town, on the other hand, it is more common to see formal apparel required in public and private schools on a daily basis.\n\nMany schools across South Africa also provide the choice between a summer and winter uniform, with khaki uniforms and brown shoes being very common in the summer. Although many schools allow girls to also wear trousers (especially during winter months) South African law has not required gender neutrality in school dress codes and a distinction between girls' and boys' uniforms remains. Boys of all ages are normally required to wear grey or khaki long or [[short trousers]] with socks, and the socks are usually long when worn with shorts, as in the illustration (right). Until recently, the straw boater was a common accessory in affluent public and private high schools, although these have now become optional in some cases.<ref>[http://www.corpun.com/rules2.htm#zaschools Picture of senior high school boys in blazers, short trousers and straw boaters].</ref>\n\nNearly all schools, public or fee paying, have sports' kits (uniforms) that often allow bare feet for junior schools, regardless of the season.\n\n== South Korea ==\n{{Main|Korean school uniform}}\n[[File:Jin Jung-seon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|South Korean school uniform]]\nAlmost all South Korean [[Education in South Korea#Secondary education|secondary]] students wear a uniform called \"''gyobok''\" ([[Korean language|Korean]]: \uad50\ubcf5, \u6821\u670d). The majority of elementary schools, except some private ones, do not have uniforms; however, the uniform is strictly monitored from the start of middle school and up. Based on Western-style ones, the South Korean uniform usually consists of a shirt, blazer and tie, with skirts for girls and trousers for boys.\n\nMore recently, the uniform is often worn by celebrities who target the younger, teen audience to sell entertainment products. The school uniform and school setting is frequently used as a venue for romance. As a result, the uniform has become something akin to an expression of fashion among students.\n\nName tags that are worn usually have different colours per grade. Oftentimes the writing is in black or white, whereas the background is coloured.\n\n== Spain ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nIn Spain the use of school uniforms is not compulsory in the public school at any stage. Their use depends on school councils involving parents. However, it is customary to wear uniforms in private schools, where typically girls wear uniform shirt and jersey skirt and boys wear white shirt and tie and sometimes jacket.\n\n== Sri Lanka ==\nIt is mandatory for Sri Lankan school students to wear a uniform regardless of them attending a government, semi-government or private school. In most government and semi-government schools, boys will wear a short-sleeved white shirt and a navy blue short when they are in the junior grades. This will later transition to white shorts and then to white trousers towards the latter part of the school life. A tie is not always worn, but may be worn for special school events along with a long-sleeved shirt. Proper black dress shoes and socks are also a part of this uniform. Certain schools also require the uniform to have the school's insignia stitched to a corner of the pocket of the shirt.\n\nGirls who attend government and semi-government schools will wear a white one-piece dress. This may or may not have sleeves. Certain schools make wearing a tie mandatory for girls and some may have a plastic badge or the school's insignia stitched to the dress. Proper dress shoes and socks are mandatory in most schools.\n\nOn special occasions, students who bear a post in a sports team, club or association, would wear a blazer which would normally be white and having accents based on the school colours.\n\nIn privately run schools, the suit is very similar but the colours might differ. They range from khaki and dark green to bright blue.\n\n== Taiwan ==\n[[File:\u8473\u683c\u9ad8\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4e2d\u90e8\u5973\u751f\u590f\u5b63\u5236\u670d(\u914d\u904b\u52d5\u5916\u5957).jpg|thumb|upright|A schoolgirl of Taiwan in her uniform.]]\n\nAs Taiwan experienced a long period of Japanese colonial rule, it is influenced by Japanese culture and the uniform style can be said to be close. However the school uniforms in the two regions are not identical.\n\nThere are a total of 471 Taiwanese high schools. All schools have two sets of uniforms, a summer uniform and a uniform for winter. According to the provisions, sportswear is worn.\n\n'''Summer'''\n\nPrimary school\uff1aWhite short pants and shirts are most common for the boys, while girls will wear a pleated skirt\n\nSecondary school\uff1aMales wear short-sleeved shirts with shorts.

Female students, wear a knee-length dark blue or black skirt, and a pale white blouse with a loosely hanging bow tie. The bow tie is dropped in favour of an open-necked pale blue shirt from Matthayom 4.\n\nThe girls' uniform is complemented by white ankle socks and black school shoes. The student's name, number, and name of the school are often embroidered on the blouse or shirt. Some independent or international schools have uniforms more closely resembling British school uniform standards, and boys in senior high school grades may be allowed to wear long trousers. The standard dress for children in kindergarten is a red skirt and white blouse for girls, and red short trousers and a white shirt for boys. In all Thai schools, one day per week, usually Wednesday, is dedicated to scouting, when beige scout uniforms for boys and dark green guide uniforms are the rule, both wearing yellow neckerchiefs.\n\nThe hairstyle of students is also given attention by schools and the Ministry of Education. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Some prohibit even girls from having long hair.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/95321/thailand-whats-hair-got-to-do-with-childrens-rights/ |title=Thailand: What has hair got to do with children's rights? |author= Saksith Saiyasombut & Siam Voices  |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oknation.net/blog/print.php?id=165611 |script-title=th:\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e14\u0e47\u0e08\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19 \u0e46 \u0e43\u0e19\u0e42\u0e23\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19 |author= \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e25\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22\u0e43\u0e08 |date= November 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2013|language=th}}</ref> The use of accessories is prohibited for males, while females are sometimes allowed to use simple accessories.

Uniforms are usually in the colours of their respective churches and Red for Government Schools. Catholic schools are usually light blue, Wesleyan (Royal Blue), Anglican (Navy Blue) and LDS Schools (Green). A [[Ta'ovala]] bordered with school colours and a tupenu are usually worn by boys with a white button-up shirt. Pupils usually wear shorts and a white button up shirt. Nearly all Tongan secondary schools require girls to wear a pinafore dress with a white shirt, except for Catholic schools which allow a striped blouse and skirt. Pupils are usually required to wear Roman sandals in English-medium schools, and [[Flip-flops|thongs]] (flip-flops) in most other schools.\n\n== Turkey ==\n\n[[File:08913-Perspective Run.jpg|thumb|Turkish school uniforms.]]\n\nSchool uniforms were used in all public and private institutions. There were several exceptions and most kindergartens did not require school uniforms. The uniforms varied in their appearance; primary schools used one-piece blue uniforms, while in secondary and high schools boys wore dark grey trousers with white shirts, jackets and a tie. Girls had skirts and shirts coloured like the boys' uniform, plus a tie. Most private institutions have their own uniforms. School uniforms for primary schools were black until the 1990s. None of the universities or higher-education institutes have uniforms.\n\nSchool uniforms abolished in 2012 and schools gave a poll to families to select uniform or casual cloths. Dress code says that students' shoulder should be covered, girls cannot wear leggings or miniskirts. This caused a controversy in Western cities since some students were wearing mini's, shorts and leggings. New law says that students can wear hijabs at school but it's prohibited to wear makeup, tattoos, piercings, dye \u0131n hair etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/School%20Uniforms/school-uniforms-turkey|title=School Uniforms in Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=K12 Academics|access-date=February 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSchool uniforms have a long history in Turkey. They were first introduced because normal clothing would give hints about the child's family's economic situation. In order to prevent groupings amongst children from different social classes, uniforms were accepted.\n\nHowever, school uniforms were officially abolished on 27 November 2012, when the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Turkish Ministry of Education]] suddenly abolished the nationwide uniform requirement in schools (international/foreign schools are excluded) and lifted the headscarf ban for religious imam-hatip schools, prompting fierce criticism from opposition parties, unions and educators. Opponents claim that economic differences cause pedagogical traumas for children and that permitting headscarves harms secular education. Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] defended the move, saying education in uniform has drawn complaints for many years. But students attending minority schools (Greeks, Jews and Armenians), which are also part of the Turkish Ministry of Education, have been excluded from this change, and are still required to wear school uniforms.<ref>[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/145198/obligatory-school-uniforms-abolished-amid-criticisms.html \"Obligatory School Uniforms Abolished amid Criticisms\"].

Cardigan or blazer are optional. These are only for the schools with the Arabic curriculum, not the other schools.\n\nPrivate schools in the UAE require a school uniform. It can range from a T-shirt or a simple white/black polo bearing the school logo to a more complete uniform with a button up shirt worn with a skirt, shorts or trousers. In the British schools, there is a blouse and either a skirt or trousers for the girls or a button up shirt with trousers. Shirts bear the school logo. Certain schools have certain codes on the use of makeup (some don't condone it at all) and the sporting of bracelets/jewellery.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\nWhile school uniform is common in the United Kingdom, there is no legislation enforcing it in any of the three separate legal jurisdictions of England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and enforcement of school uniform policy and dress codes is generally for individual schools to determine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCourt|first1=Laura|title=School Uniform Policy in Scotland, England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland briefing paper 48/13|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2013/education/4813.pdf|website=Northern Ireland Assembly|publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=4 January 2013}}</ref>  However, schools do have to take into account Equality legislation in dress policies to prevent discrimination on grounds such as age, sex, race, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The schools provisions of the Act|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/private-and-public-sector-guidance/education-providers/schools-guidance/introduction/schools-provisions-act|website=Equality and Human Rights Commission|publisher=EHRC|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=21 May 2014}}</ref> School uniforms are required to be similar in cost for both boys and girls,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/514978/School_Uniform_Guidance.pdf|title=School uniform: Guidance for governing bodies, school leaders, school staff and local authorities|last=|first=|date=September 2013|website=education.gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|access-date=}}</ref> to be reasonably low cost, and to tolerate religious freedoms, e.g. allowing male Sikhs to wear turbans and female Muslims to wear headscarves.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/find_out/guides/2003/school_uniform/newsid_3181000/3181847.stm \"School uniform\"], ''CBBC Newsround'', retrieved on 28 August 2008.</ref> In order to ensure that policies are fair and non-discriminatory schools are expected to consult widely with staff, pupils, parents and governors when introducing or amending dress policies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cc30c04f-9785-49ef-b0bd-c0f9b07904b7 |title=School uniform policies and the Equality Act 2010 |last=Bell |first=Bircham Dyson |date=5 July 2012 |website=Lexology |publisher=Globe Business Publishing |access-date=9 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== England ===\n\n[[File:School uniforms GBR.jpg|thumb|English girls in modern school uniform.]]\n{{Main|School uniforms in England}}\n\nIn 2011, more than 90% of English secondary schools had a compulsory uniform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/school-uniform-results|title=School uniform does not improve results \u2013 discuss|first=Stephanie|last=Northen|date=18 January 2011|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> School uniforms were first introduced on a large scale{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://histclo.com/schun/hist/schun-hist.html|title=The History of School Uniforms|publisher=Historical Boys Clothing|accessdate=28 August 2008}}</ref> The uniforms of the time were referred as \"bluecoats\", as they consisted of long trench-coat-style jackets dyed blue.

The popularity of uniforms increased, and eventually most schools had a uniform.<ref name=\"History\"/> During this period most uniforms reflected the trends of the age, with boys wearing [[short trousers]] and blazers until roughly the age of puberty and then long trousers from about 14 or 15. Girls mainly wore [[blouse]]s, tunic dress and pinafores.<ref name=\"History\"/><ref>I{{cite web|url=http://www.objectlessons.org/ol/index.php?mod=PageMod.showComponent&component_id=137|title=Victorian Girls' School Uniform|publisher=Object lessons|accessdate=28 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427090834/http://www.objectlessons.org/ol/index.php?mod=PageMod.showComponent&component_id=137 |archivedate = 27 April 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.album1900.com/uk/0005_ukschooluniform/0005_ukschooluniforms_girls.php|title=School uniforms in the UK|publisher=Album 1900|language=English|accessdate=3 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021151611/http://www.album1900.com/uk/0005_ukschooluniform/0005_ukschooluniforms_girls.php|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThese uniforms continued until the 1950s when after the [[Education Act 1944|Butler reforms]] secondary education was made free and the school leaving age was raised to 15. These reforms encouraged schools to implement uniform codes which were similar to other schools. Distinct \"summer\" and \"winter\" uniforms were sometimes required, particularly for girls, for whom dresses were mandated for summer and gymslips for winter.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the 21st century, the typical primary school uniform is fairly casual while secondary school uniform is often formal. Uniform in primary school is generally a polo shirt or [[T-shirt]], a jumper with the school logo, and trousers or shorts or a skirt. The typical secondary school uniform is a blazer, white shirt or blouse, a tie, trousers or skirt, and black shoes. Some primary schools have more formal uniform, with tie and blazer, and for secondary schools to require only a jumper. Uniforms sometimes match the school colours, but are most commonly found in blue, black and grey.\n\n=== Scotland ===\n[[File:Schoolshorts.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A school uniform worn in Scotland \u2013 [[Marr College]] in [[Troon]] <small>(socks and shorts are not part of the uniform, pupils can wear either trousers or skirts and shorter socks)</small>]]\n[[Scottish law]] is not specific on the question of school uniform. Generally, the school must provide information on its policy on clothing and uniform and the Education Authority must provide written information on its general policy on wearing school uniform. Some Education Authorities do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities.<ref name=\"Gourock High School\">{{cite web|url=http://gourockhigh.inverclyde.sch.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAxADYANAB8AHwARgBhAGwAcwBlAHwAfAA0AHwA0 |title=Authority Strategic Statement of Inverclyde Education Service |publisher=Gourock High School |accessdate=28 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064212/http://gourockhigh.inverclyde.sch.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAxADYANAB8AHwARgBhAGwAcwBlAHwAfAA0AHwA0 |archivedate=March 14, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nChildren cannot be disciplined for not wearing a uniform if their parents do not want their child to wear it. However, a child that simply refuses to wear the school uniform can be disciplined by the school if it thinks that academic or disciplinary problems might be caused by the refusal. Many schools do have a policy covering the wearing of school clothing. The policy may state that certain items must be worn and that other items cannot be worn, for example, jeans. Schools must take religious and cultural requirements into account when drawing up a school uniform policy.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/scotland/your_family/education_scotland/problems_at_school_scotland.htm#generalappearance\n|title = Problems at School\n|work = Adviceguide\n|publisher = Citizen Advice\n|accessdate = 14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the way that the uniforms are worn is usually not an issue, some state schools may have regulation on the subject (e.g. height of ties, whether the shirt is tucked in or not), the selection of clothes worn, whether they follow the policy, can be very strict. For example, in black and white uniform schools, wearing colours such as grey or wearing white shoes is forbidden. However, in schools that only use a basic uniform (e.g. jumper and trousers) the policy is often less strict.\n\n=== Wales ===\n\nThe [[Welsh Assembly Government]] issued detailed guidance to governing bodies on uniform and appearance policies that begins by making explicit, \"There is no education legislation specifically covering the wearing of school uniform or other aspects of appearance such as hair colour and style, and the wearing of jewellery and makeup. However, as part of its responsibility for the conduct of the school, a governing body can specify a uniform which pupils are required to wear and other rules relating to appearance.\"<ref>[http://wales.gov.uk/dcells/publications/publications/guidanceandinformation/uniformandappearance/guidanceschooluniforme.pdf?lang=en Guidance to Governing Bodies on Uniform and Appearance Policies]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

This is claimed via local Education and Library Boards for parents in receipt of income support. At the end of August 2009, there were 24,135 successful applications for the grant.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-de/news-de-september-2009/news-de-150909-ruane-welcomes-new.htm | title = Ruane welcomes new uniforms for the new school term | date = 15 September 2009 | publisher = Northern Ireland Executive }}</ref>\n\nThe most common secondary school uniform in Northern Ireland is a shirt, blazer and sweater with a tie and a skirt or trousers. The uniform (most likely the sweater and tie) may change after Year 12. The uniform in primary school is similar to those used in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n== United States ==\nMost schools in the United States do not require uniforms. Private schools and other specialized schools sometimes require an informal uniform, called a \u201cstandardized dress code\u201d. Policy regarding school-appropriate dress, and the extent of enforcement, will vary by school and school district.\n\nA study conducted in 2000 found that only 23% of public, private, and sectarian schools had any sort of uniform policy in the United States at or before 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationbug.org/a/public-school-uniform-statistics.html|title=Public School Uniform Statistics - Education Bug|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> Over the subsequent decade, more public schools, specifically those in urban areas, instituted stricter dress codes. For instance, red, white or blue polo shirts, with a logo, with navy or khaki bottoms and a belt, was the uniform policy imposed at Palmer Elementary School in [[Houston, Texas]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/25/us/dress-for-success-public-school-uniforms.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm | work=The New York Times |title=Dress for Success: Public School Uniforms |date=25 September 1997}}</ref> Schools may also have polo shirts and trousers as a uniform. \nRoughly half the public schools in the United States had these more limiting dress codes by 2011.<ref>http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/crimeindicators2011/tables/table_20_1.asp</ref>\n\nThe schools that do require uniforms, or a more common [[standardized|standard]] [[dress code]] in towns and suburbs, tend to be more casual than those in Britain or other commonwealth nations. Commonly, students wear collared, buttoned shirts, with a tie for boys and a tie for girls, worn with khaki trousers, and a belt, depending on the age of the school's student body. Skirts of a modest length are occasionally an option for girls.\n\nDress codes vary widely among private schools, although a [[Catholic school uniform]] tends to keep the shirt and tie.<ref name=\"naesp.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://ww1.naesp.com/?sub1=6cd14d5e-2fd7-11ea-afc0-c572d6b6d83b|title=naesp.com\u00a0-\u00a0This website is for sale!\u00a0-\u00a0naesp Resources and Information.|website=ww1.naesp.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Research studies and legislation ===\n\nThe National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) conducted a phone survey of 755 principals in 2000, which revealed that 21% of public schools had a uniform policy; 23% had firm plans to create one.<ref>[http://www.educationbug.org/a/public-school-uniform-statistics.html Public School Uniform Statistics]. Retrieved on 21 December 2011.</ref> However, this only accounts for those with school uniform policies and not for standardised dress codes, which provide for allowable student dress but are slightly more lax: For instance, instead of requiring everyone to wear the same shirt, or set of shirts, they may specify \"any solid collared three-button polo/oxford shirt\" and leave more specific details up to the parents. In 2007-2008, 55% of public school principals said their schools enforce a strict dress code, requiring students at least wear a collared shirt and trousers with an acceptable belt to school.<ref>[http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=50 NCST Fast Facts - School Uniforms].

This began a trend for uniforms in American [[Primary education|elementary]] public schools, especially in [[Urban area|urban]] school districts. [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] praised the idea in his 1996 [[State of the Union Address]], saying that \"if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms.\"[http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/New/other/sotu.html] The adoption of school- or district-wide uniform policies (or \"standardised dress codes\", less rigid than uniform requirements and allowing some leeway in parameters) has been motivated by a need to counter \"[[gang signals|gang clothing]]\" or the pressure for families to purchase upscale-label clothing (to avoid the ostracism of their children by \"fashion cliques\"), as well as to improve [[morale]] and [[school discipline]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe proportion of U.S. public schools requiring uniforms had increased from 3% in 1996 to 25% in 2010.\n\nIn [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Puerto Rico Department of Education|Department of Education]] requires all students to wear school uniforms, with only medical exemptions.<ref>{{Citation |title=Volante supletorio reglamento general de estudiantes del sistema de educaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica de Puerto Rico que deroga el reglamento n\u00famero 5364 de 17 de enero de 1996 |url=http://www.de.gobierno.pr/dePortal/Descargas/REGLAMENTOCONDENSADO20042005.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902053940/http://www.de.gobierno.pr/DEPortal/Descargas/REGLAMENTOCONDENSADO20042005.pdf |publisher=[[Puerto Rico Department of Education]] |archive-date=2009-09-02 |language=es}}</ref>\n\n== Vietnam ==\n\nMost schools in [[Vietnam]] require uniforms. The rules on uniform vary between schools and areas. The most common type of uniform consists of a white shirt with a school logo on left sleeve and navy/black trousers, with a [[red scarf]] for students from grade 3 to grade 9. This kind of uniform is often seen in public schools in North Vietnam and in rural areas. There is no differences between boys' and girls' uniforms. However, many schools (usually private or famous public schools) have their own designed uniforms, which often replace trousers with skirts for girls or include bows, ties or vests/blazers.<ref>Examples of different school uniforms in Vietnam http://www.asiafinest.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=305508&st=0</ref>\n\n[[File:KHAIGIANGLSTS.jpg|thumb|School uniforms of Lawrence S. Ting School in 7th District, [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]]]]\n\nThe white [[\u00e1o d\u00e0i]] is also a tradition uniform for high school girls in Vietnam, but most schools in [[Northern Vietnam]] only require it for important events or ceremonies, since wearing \u00e1o d\u00e0i is uncomfortable for daily use. Otherwise, \u00e1o d\u00e0i is very familiar with school girls in [[Mekong Delta]], where it is \"daily uniform\" of all them. The image of a high school girl with [[n\u00f3n l\u00e1]] and white \u00e1o d\u00e0i on a bike is still considered symbolic.\n\n[[File:Bicycle of Ho Chi Minh City.jpg|thumb|left|Two highschool girls in \u00e1o d\u00e0i in HCMC]]\n\nThere are also uniforms for [[Physical Education]] in Vietnamese schools, this usually includes T-shirt and [[tracksuit]], the T-shirts have school logo on them. The tracksuit jacket is popular and often used as a winter uniform, even outside of gym activity.\n\nThere are no specific [[shoes]] for Vietnamese students, however, flip-flops, slippers and high heels are forbidden. Sandals and boots are allowed, although students normally wear sneakers or flats to school. [[Dyeing hair|Dyed hair]], nail polish and make-up are banned in many schools.\n\n== Venezuela ==\n\nSchool uniforms are used in [[Venezuela]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualcampuses.eu/index.php/Venezuela|title=Venezuela - Researching Virtual Initiatives in Education|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> By Venezuelan decree, uniforms are required at all schools in all grades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ediplomat.com/np/post_reports/pr_ve.htm|title=Venezuela - Post Report - e Diplomat|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> Boys wear navy trousers and girls wear navy skirts or trousers, depending on the school. The shirts have short sleeves and the colour varies by the level in which the student is. Students in nursery wear yellow shirts, while students in kindergarten wear red shirts. From first to sixth grade, students wear white polo shirts. From seventh to ninth grade they wear light blue polo shirts, and from tenth to eleventh grade they wear beige polo shirts. These shirts are to be stuffed inside the trousers with a black belt. Black dress shoes are the norm in public school, however some private schools can be more flexible with the shoes to be worn.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Fashion|Schools}}\n* [[School uniform]]\n* [[Catholic school uniform]]\n* [[Uniform fetishism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Alleyne, Sylvan I., Velma LaPoint, Jennifer Lee and Harold W.

Stobie described his invention as\n<blockquote>\"an improved pole adopted to be used for very many purposes, but particularly for carrying electric cables, telegraph wires... [it] consists of two flanged beams of iron or steel, preferably rolled steel joist of ''''H'''' or of channel sections, placed one beside the other with their flanges inward and preferably at a very slight angle one with the other and held together by means of tie bolts, the space between them being filled with cement concrete.\"<ref name=Linn>Rob Linn, ''ETSA \u2013 The Story of Electricity in South Australia'' (1996) pp.38\u201339</ref></blockquote> \n\nA second patent was granted to Stobie and Frederick William Herbert Weadon in 1946.

The Stobie pole was central to the speedy expansion of Adelaide Electricity Supply Company's supply. It was cheap and simple to produce, had a uniform appearance, saved an enormous amount of timber from being harvested, had a long life expectancy and, at the time, was seen as more environmentally sensitive.<ref name=Linn/> [[SA Power Networks]] review alternative pole designs available on the market and has yet to find one with the benefits offered by the Stobie pole.\n\n==Design==\nThe poles carry supply voltages from 240<!--415 is voltage between wires; each is 240V--> to 275,000 volts and come in various sizes from 9 to 26 metres in length, though studies indicate heights to 36 metres are feasible.<ref>[http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=341903057420867;res=IELENG McCormack, John ''Development of 36m Stobie Poles for 275kV Transmission Line''] accessed 22 April 2011</ref> The service life of a Stobie pole is predicted to be in excess of 80 years.

An accident while playing bows and arrows with his two brothers left him with a distinctive scar on his right cheek. He made his stage debut in a 1946 [[The Old Vic|Old Vic]] production of ''[[Richard II]]'' at the [[No\u00ebl Coward Theatre|New Theatre]], which was directed by [[Ralph Richardson]] and featured [[Harry Andrews]], [[Ren\u00e9e Asherson]] and [[Alec Guinness]]. The same ensemble went on to perform in other Shakespearean plays, including ''[[Coriolanus]]'' and ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', and Jordan remained friends with Asherson and Guinness.\n\nJordan's screen roles included several war films, including ''[[The Battle of the River Plate (film)|The Battle of the River Plate]]'' (1956), ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), ''[[The Heroes of Telemark]]'' (1965), ''[[Play Dirty]]'' (1968), and ''[[Too Late the Hero (film)|Too Late the Hero]]'' (1970). He is perhaps best remembered for his uncredited speaking role as Imperial Officer Cass, an aide to [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] ([[Peter Cushing]]), in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), a role secured for him by Guinness, who played [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Jordan was offered the choice of either a guaranteed fee for his role, or a small share of the film's royalties. As he was dubious about the film's prospects, he opted for the former, a decision which he later regretted in light of the film's immense success. Jordan's television appearances included ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'', ''[[Angels (TV series)|Angels]]'', ''[[Terry and June]]'', ''[[Shine on Harvey Moon]]'', ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot|Poirot]]'', ''[[Crossroads (British TV series)|Crossroads]]'', and ''[[The Bill]]''.

The same ensemble went on to perform in other Shakespearean plays, including ''[[Coriolanus]]'' and ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', and Jordan remained friends with Asherson and Guinness.\n\nJordan's screen roles included several war films, including ''[[The Battle of the River Plate (film)|The Battle of the River Plate]]'' (1956), ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), ''[[The Heroes of Telemark]]'' (1965), ''[[Play Dirty]]'' (1968), and ''[[Too Late the Hero (film)|Too Late the Hero]]'' (1970). He is perhaps best remembered for his uncredited speaking role as Imperial Officer Cass, an aide to [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] ([[Peter Cushing]]), in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), a role secured for him by Guinness, who played [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Jordan was offered the choice of either a guaranteed fee for his role, or a small share of the film's royalties. As he was dubious about the film's prospects, he opted for the former, a decision which he later regretted in light of the film's immense success. Jordan's television appearances included ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'', ''[[Angels (TV series)|Angels]]'', ''[[Terry and June]]'', ''[[Shine on Harvey Moon]]'', ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot|Poirot]]'', ''[[Crossroads (British TV series)|Crossroads]]'', and ''[[The Bill]]''. He retired in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theatricalia.com/person/sr3/patrick-jordan|title=Patrick Jordan \u2013 Theatricalia|website=theatricalia.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Born: 20 October 1923, Harrow, Middx. |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/23475 |title=Patrick Jordan &#124; BFI |publisher=Ftvdb.bfi.org.uk |date=1923-10-20 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}</ref> \n\nJordan was married to illustrator [[Margery Gill]] from 1946 until her death in 2008.

A major mercantile power and a military rival of the [[Roman Republic]], Carthage was [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|defeated]] by the Romans in 146 BC. The Romans occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years, introduced [[Christianity]] and left architectural legacies like the [[El Djem]] amphitheater. After several attempts starting in 647, [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslims conquered]] the whole of Tunisia by 697 and introduced [[Islam]]. After a series of campaigns beginning in 1534 to conquer and colonize the region, the [[Ottoman Empire]] established control in 1574 and held sway for over 300 years afterwards. [[French conquest of Tunisia|French colonization of Tunisia]] occurred in 1881. Tunisia gained independence with [[Habib Bourguiba]] and declared the Tunisian Republic in 1957.

According to the Roman historian [[Sallust]], the demigod Hercules died in Spain and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land, with some [[Human migration|migrating]] to Africa.

Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the 12th century BC ([[Bizerte]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]]). The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians. Legend says that [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] from Tyre, now in modern-day Lebanon, founded the city in 814 BC, as retold by the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus of Tauromenium]]. The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia, now present-day [[Lebanon]] and adjacent areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Administration/Committees/documents/TheCityofCarthage.pdf |title=The City of Carthage: From Dido to the Arab Conquest |date= |accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter the series of wars with Greek city-states of Sicily in the 5th century BC, Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western [[Mediterranean]]. The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]]. Tanit's symbol, a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress, is a popular icon found in ancient sites. The founders of Carthage also established a [[Tophet]], which was altered in Roman times.\n\nA Carthaginian invasion of Italy led by [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]], one of a series of wars with [[Roman Republic|Rome]], nearly crippled the rise of Roman power. From the conclusion of the Second Punic War in 202 BC, Carthage functioned as a client state of the Roman Republic for another 50 years.<ref>[https://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/appian-the-punic-wars/ Appian, The Punic Wars]. livius.org</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] which began in 149 BC during the [[Third Punic War]], Carthage was conquered by Rome in 146 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tunisia/history|title=History of Tunisia \u2013 Lonely Planet Travel Information|website=lonelyplanet.com|access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> Following its conquest, the Romans renamed Carthage to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], incorporating it as a province.\n\n[[File:Archaeological Site of Carthage-130238.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Carthage]]]]\n\nDuring the Roman period, the area of what is now Tunisia enjoyed a huge development. The economy, mainly during the Empire, boomed: the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture. Called the ''Granary of the Empire'', the area of actual Tunisia and coastal [[Tripolitania]], according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported to the Empire. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits.\n\nBy the 2nd century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivations and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals from the western mountains, the principal production and exports included the textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as [[African Red Slip]], and wool.\n[[File:Amphitheatre El Jem(js)1.jpg|thumb|The Roman amphitheater in [[El Djem]], built during the first half of the 3rd century AD]]\n\nThere was even a huge production of mosaics and ceramics, exported mainly to Italy, in the central area of [[El Djem]] (where there was the second biggest amphitheater in the Roman Empire).\n\nBerber bishop [[Donatus Magnus]] was the founder of a Christian group known as the [[Donatist]]s.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/169009/Donatist | title = Donatist | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> During the 5th and 6th centuries (from 430 to 533 AD), the Germanic [[Vandals]] invaded and ruled over a kingdom in Northwest Africa that included present-day Tripoli.

Under French colonization, European settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of [[French people|French]] colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945. In 1910 there were 105,000 [[Italian Tunisians|Italians in Tunisia]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Ion Smeaton Munro|title=Through fascism to world power: a history of the revolution in Italy|year=1933|publisher=A.

The antisemitic [[Vichy anti-Jewish legislation|Statute on Jews]] enacted by the Vichy was also implemented in Vichy Northwest Africa and overseas French territories. Thus, the persecution, and murder of the Jews from 1940 to 1943 was part of the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]] in France.\n\nFrom November 1942 until May 1943, Vichy Tunisia was occupied by Nazi Germany. SS Commander [[Walter Rauff]] continued to implement the Final Solution there. From 1942\u20131943, Tunisia was the scene of the [[Tunisia Campaign]], a series of battles between the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. The battle opened with initial success by the German and Italian forces, but the massive supply and numerical superiority of the Allies led to the [[Tunisian Campaign|Axis surrender]] on 13 May 1943.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gordon|last=Williamson|authorlink=Gordon Williamson (writer)|title=Afrikakorps 1941\u201343|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1c44ccxC_sC&pg=PA24|year= 1991|publisher=Osprey |isbn=978-1-85532-130-4|page=24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Palmer, Michael A. |title=The German Wars: A Concise History, 1859\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eHKE9NIwbMC&pg=PA199|year=2010|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-3780-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\n===Post-independence (1956\u20132011)===\n{{main|History of modern Tunisia}}\n\nTunisia achieved independence from France on 20 March 1956 with [[Habib Bourguiba]] as Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14107720|title=Tunisia profile|date=2017-11-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref>  20 March is celebrated annually as Tunisian Independence Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://allafrica.com/view/group/main/main/id/00016135.html|title=Tunisia Celebrates Independence Day|date=20 March 2012|accessdate=19 March 2019|website=[[AllAfrica.com]]}}</ref>  A year later, Tunisia was declared a republic, with Bourguiba as [[List of Presidents of Tunisia|the first President]].<ref name = BBC>{{cite news | title = Habib Bourguiba: Father of Tunisia | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/703907.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 6 April 2000}}</ref>  From independence in 1956 until the 2011 revolution, the government and the [[Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD), formerly [[Neo Destour]] and the [[Socialist Destourian Party]], were effectively one.

It is bordered by [[Algeria]] on the west and southwest and [[Libya]] on the south east. It lies between latitudes [[30th parallel north|30\u00b0]] and [[38th parallel north|38\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian east|7\u00b0]] and [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0E]]. An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west\u2013east in the north, and north\u2013south in the east.\n\nThough it is relatively small in size, Tunisia has great environmental diversity due to its north\u2013south extent. Its east\u2013west extent is limited. Differences in Tunisia, like the rest of the Maghreb, are largely north\u2013south environmental differences defined by sharply decreasing rainfall southward from any point. The Dorsal, the eastern extension of the Atlas Mountains, runs across Tunisia in a northeasterly direction from the Algerian border in the west to the Cape Bon peninsula in the east. North of the Dorsal is the Tell, a region characterized by low, rolling hills and plains, again an extension of mountains to the west in Algeria. In the [[Khroumire|Khroumerie]], the northwestern corner of the Tunisian Tell, elevations reach {{convert|1050|m|ft}} and snow occurs in winter.\n\nThe [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]], a broadening coastal plain along Tunisia's eastern Mediterranean coast, is among the world's premier areas of olive cultivation. Inland from the Sahel, between the Dorsal and a range of hills south of Gafsa, are the [[Steppes]]. Much of the southern region is [[semi-arid]] and [[desert]].\n\nTunisia has a coastline {{convert|1148|km|mi|}} long.

It was founded in 1949 and brings together French and Tunisian Muslims, Christians and Jews. Pierre Boucherle was its main instigator, along with [[Yahia Turki]], [[Abdelaziz Gorgi]], [[Moses Elias Levy|Moses Levy]], Ammar Farhat, and Jules Lellouche. Given its doctrine, some members have therefore turned to the sources of aesthetic Arab-Muslim art: such as miniature Islamic architecture, etc. Expressionist paintings by Amara Debbache, Jellal Ben Abdallah, and Ali Ben Salem are recognized while abstract art captures the imagination of painters like Edgar Naccache, Nello Levy, and [[Hedi Turki]].<ref name=\"tangka3\">{{cite web|url=http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040510/http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archivedate= 7 October 2011 |title=Un pays pour les peintres |publisher=Guide Tangka |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter independence in 1956, the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by the dynamics of nation building and by artists serving the state.

The Romans occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years, introduced [[Christianity]] and left architectural legacies like the [[El Djem]] amphitheater.

Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central Tunisia then were ancestors of today's [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes.\n\nIt was believed in ancient times that Africa was originally populated by [[Gaetuli]]ans and Libyans, both nomadic peoples.  According to the Roman historian [[Sallust]], the demigod Hercules died in Spain and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land, with some [[Human migration|migrating]] to Africa. Persians went to the West and intermarried with the Gaetulians and became the Numidians. The Medes settled and were known as Mauri, later Moors.<ref>Banjamin Isaac, The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity, Princeton University Press, 2013 p.147</ref>\n[[File:Carthage Holdings.png|alt=|thumb|[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]-held territory before the first First Punic War]]\nThe Numidians and Moors belonged to the race from which the Berbers are descended.

Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the 12th century BC ([[Bizerte]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]]). The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians. Legend says that [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] from Tyre, now in modern-day Lebanon, founded the city in 814 BC, as retold by the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus of Tauromenium]]. The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia, now present-day [[Lebanon]] and adjacent areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Administration/Committees/documents/TheCityofCarthage.pdf |title=The City of Carthage: From Dido to the Arab Conquest |date= |accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter the series of wars with Greek city-states of Sicily in the 5th century BC, Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western [[Mediterranean]]. The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]].

The climate is Mediterranean towards the coast in the north, while most of the country is desert.]]\n[[File:T\u00e9boursouk.jpg|thumb|left|View of the central Tunisian plateau at [[T\u00e9boursouk]]]]\nTunisia is situated on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of Northwest Africa, midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Nile Delta]]. It is bordered by [[Algeria]] on the west and southwest and [[Libya]] on the south east. It lies between latitudes [[30th parallel north|30\u00b0]] and [[38th parallel north|38\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian east|7\u00b0]] and [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0E]]. An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west\u2013east in the north, and north\u2013south in the east.\n\nThough it is relatively small in size, Tunisia has great environmental diversity due to its north\u2013south extent. Its east\u2013west extent is limited. Differences in Tunisia, like the rest of the Maghreb, are largely north\u2013south environmental differences defined by sharply decreasing rainfall southward from any point. The Dorsal, the eastern extension of the Atlas Mountains, runs across Tunisia in a northeasterly direction from the Algerian border in the west to the Cape Bon peninsula in the east. North of the Dorsal is the Tell, a region characterized by low, rolling hills and plains, again an extension of mountains to the west in Algeria. In the [[Khroumire|Khroumerie]], the northwestern corner of the Tunisian Tell, elevations reach {{convert|1050|m|ft}} and snow occurs in winter.\n\nThe [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]], a broadening coastal plain along Tunisia's eastern Mediterranean coast, is among the world's premier areas of olive cultivation. Inland from the Sahel, between the Dorsal and a range of hills south of Gafsa, are the [[Steppes]]. Much of the southern region is [[semi-arid]] and [[desert]].\n\nTunisia has a coastline {{convert|1148|km|mi|}} long. In maritime terms, the country claims a contiguous zone of {{convert|24|nmi|1|lk=in}}, and a territorial sea of {{convert|12|nmi|1}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ewan W.|first=Anderson|title=International Boundaries: Geopolitical Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7-menNPxREC&pg=PA816|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-375-0|page=816}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nTunisia's climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in the north, with mild rainy winters and hot, dry summers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209110533/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archivedate= 9 February 2011 |title=Climate of Tunisia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The south of the country is desert.

Pierre Boucherle was its main instigator, along with [[Yahia Turki]], [[Abdelaziz Gorgi]], [[Moses Elias Levy|Moses Levy]], Ammar Farhat, and Jules Lellouche. Given its doctrine, some members have therefore turned to the sources of aesthetic Arab-Muslim art: such as miniature Islamic architecture, etc. Expressionist paintings by Amara Debbache, Jellal Ben Abdallah, and Ali Ben Salem are recognized while abstract art captures the imagination of painters like Edgar Naccache, Nello Levy, and [[Hedi Turki]].<ref name=\"tangka3\">{{cite web|url=http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040510/http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archivedate= 7 October 2011 |title=Un pays pour les peintres |publisher=Guide Tangka |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter independence in 1956, the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by the dynamics of nation building and by artists serving the state.

This historic heart of the city became ''L'Enclos'', a site well suited to passive defence.\n\nThe east of the territory is the former commune of Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-L\u00f4, south of Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-L\u00f4, absorbed in 1964.\n\n{{Geographic Location 2\n | Centre     = Saint-L\u00f4<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/ |title= G\u00e9oportail (IGN), \"Limites administratives\" layer activated}}</ref>\n | North       = [[Saint-Georges-Montcocq]]<br />[[Le Mesnil-Rouxelin]]\n | Northeast   = [[La Luzerne]]<br />[[Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-l'\u00c9pine]]\n | East        = [[Saint-Pierre-de-Semilly]]<br />[[La Barre-de-Semilly]]\n | Southeast   = [[Cond\u00e9-sur-Vire]]\n | South       = [[Gourfaleur]]<br />[[Baudre]]\n | Southwest   = [[Saint-\u00c9bremond-de-Bonfoss\u00e9]]\n | West        = [[Saint-Gilles, Manche|Saint-Gilles]]<br />[[Agneaux]]\n | Northwest   = [[Saint-Georges-Montcocq]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Hydrographie Manche.svg|thumb|right|Hydrography of Manche]]\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 has a mild [[oceanic climate]] characterised by mild winters and temperate summers. It has an average annual rainfall of {{convert|800 to 900|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. Rainfall is quite frequent throughout the year but most abundant in autumn and winter, in connection with the disturbances coming from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Rarely intense, they often fall in the form of [[drizzle]]. The average temperature is {{convert|10|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meteofrance.com/FR/climat/dpt_tempsdumois.jsp?LIEUID=DEPT50|title=climat de la Manche|work=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France}}</ref> In winter, the average temperature ranges between {{convert|1|and|7|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. There are between 30 and 40 days of frost per year. In summer, the average temperature lies around {{convert|20|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Transport===\nSaint-L\u00f4 is located in the centre of the department of Manche and is therefore a node of communication between [[Cotentin Peninsula|Nord-Cotentin]] and southern Manche.\n\n====Road====\n[[File:R\u00e9seau routier de Manche.svg|thumb|left|Road network in the area of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]]]]\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 lies halfway along the [[Coutances]]\u2013[[Bayeux]] axis ({{Interlanguage link multi|Route nationale 172|fr|3=Route nationale 172|lt=RD 972}}). A bypass road was commissioned in the 1980s to allow the decongestion of the city from the south. To open up the port of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], the region and the department decided the construction of a [[dual carriageway]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Route nationale 174|fr|3=Route nationale 174|lt=RN 174}}. It is a part of the [[European route E03]] and enables direct connection to [[Rennes]] and Europe from the south, through the interchange at [[Guilberville]]. The southern section now connects Saint-L\u00f4 directly to the [[A84 autoroute]], allowing motorway access to [[Caen]] and Rennes. The commissioning of the northern section, which is currently under construction, will meanwhile allow access to Cherbourg and [[England]] via the [[Route nationale 13]]. The construction of the dual carriageway allowed the extension of the small South ring road heading west and its mutation into genuine urban bypass. It has also enabled the creation and expansion of new business zones which contribute strongly to the current growth of the agglomeration.\n\n====Rail====\n[[File:R\u00e9seau ferr\u00e9 de Manche.svg|thumb|right|Rail network in the area of the Cotentin Peninsula]]\n\nThe [[Gare de Saint-L\u00f4]] is served by [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]] trains on the {{Interlanguage link multi|Caen \u2013 Rennes railway line|fr|3=Ligne de Caen \u00e0 Rennes}}. It is in the majority of services for travellers in the direction of Caen via [[Lison]] or in the direction of [[Coutances]]. A few trains, two daily return trips, serve as far as [[Rennes]] via [[Avranches]].\n\nFollowing the electrification of the section of railway between Lison and Saint-L\u00f4 during 2006, the [[SNCF]] and local communities experienced a direct [[Intercit\u00e9s]] service (without change of train) to the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] in [[Paris]] for two years, between December 2008 and December 2010. This service was not sustained due to a lack a sufficient number of passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamanchelibre.fr/actualite-20463-bientot-plus-train-entre-saint-lo-et-paris.html|title=Bient\u00f4t plus de train entre Saint-L\u00f4 et Paris!|language=fr|trans-title=Soon more train between Paris and Saint-L\u00f4!|work=[[La Manche libre]]|date=29 September 2010}}</ref> There is also the disused former industrial line to [[Cond\u00e9-sur-Vire]].

In 2010, the network consisted of four lines (Odyss\u00e9e, Azur, Horizon and Aliz\u00e9) with 15 buses and one Ocitol\u00e0 transport on demand minibus. However, since 3 January 2011, it is composed of three lines (1, 2 and 3) still with 15 buses and one Ocitol\u00e0 transport on demand minibus.

It has attracted the covetousness of neighboring nations, including [[England]], resulting in many successive invasions. It lost its dominant position towards the end of the 19th century because it failed to take advantage of the first [[Industrial Revolution]], which instead affected much of the predominantly peasant population. However, the decentralisation policy allowed the city to return to the foreground.\n\n===Briov\u00e8re===\nOriginally called '''Briov\u00e8re''' (meaning \"Bridge on the [[Vire River]]\" in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]), the town is built on and around [[defensive wall|ramparts]]. The town started life as a [[Gaul|Gallic]] fortified settlement, occupied by the tribe of the [[Unelli]] of Cotentin. Briovere was conquered by the Romans led by [[Quintus Titurius Sabinus]] in 56&nbsp;BC, after the defeat of their leader [[Viridovix]] at {{Interlanguage link multi|Mont Castre|fr}}.<ref>{{citation|first=Julius|last=Caesar|title=Commentarii de Bello Gallico|title-link=Commentarii de Bello Gallico}}.

Then, the region was the scene of various [[Saxons|Saxon]] invasions during the 3rd century. The [[Franks]] didn't establish an administrative power there, although Briovera was nevertheless entitled to [[Hammered coinage|hammer coinage]]. Historian [[Claude Fauchet (historian)|Claude Fauchet]] said, \"the Coutentin, at the same time as our [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] kings, was inhabited by the Sesnes ([[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]]), pirates, and seems to have been abandoned by [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], as variable and too remote for correction by our kings, to the Normans and other plunderers of sea...\"\n\nSainte-Croix Church was built in 300, said to be on the ruins of a temple of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Annuaire du d\u00e9partement de la Manche|language=fr|trans-title=Directory of the D\u00e9partement de la Manche|id=12th year|year=1840}} p.275</ref> Christianity grew quite late. There were only four {{Interlanguage link multi|List of bishops of Coutances|fr|3=Liste des \u00e9v\u00eaques de Coutances|lt=bishops of Coutances}} before 511. [[Laud of Coutances]], bishop in 525\u2013565, had a residence here. After his death he was beatified and was particularly honoured by Briovera, which would have housed his tomb. A pilgrimage was conducted and the city took the name of ''Saint-Laud'', and then the name ''Saint-L\u00f4'' which has been known since the 8th century.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Remparts de Saint-L\u00f4 12.jpg|thumb|right|The main entrance to the town.]]\n\nThe Bretons, led by [[Salomon, King of Brittany|King Salomon]], began to occupy the west coast of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] from 836. Before their advances, in August 867, [[Charles the Bald]] gave Salomon the Comitatus Constantiensis, territory over which he had little influence. In 889, the [[Vikings]] travelled up the Vire and besieged Saint-L\u00f4. Protected by solid ramparts built, according to tradition, in the early 9th century by [[Charlemagne]], the town did not initially surrender. The attackers then cut the water supply, resulting in the surrender of the inhabitants. The Vikings massacred the inhabitants, including the Bishop of Coutances, and then razed the town. The seat of the diocese moved to [[Rouen]]. It was only in 1025 that Bishop Herbert decided to return to the walls of Saint-L\u00f4 and restore the episcopal see. Then, under [[Geoffrey de Montbray]], the town had a great economic development, taking advantage of the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman expedition in Sicily]]. [[Robert Guiscard]], a close associate of Geoffrey, brought important loot to [[County of Apulia and Calabria|Apulia and Calabria]], and it was thanks to this treasure that Geoffrey was able to rebuild Coutances Cathedral in 1056. Saint-L\u00f4 is famous for its goldsmiths and even [[Matilda of Flanders]], the wife of [[William the Conqueror]], ordered two candelabra for the {{Interlanguage link multi|Abbaye aux Dames, Caen|fr|3=Abbaye aux Dames (Caen)|lt=Abbaye aux Dames}}.\n\nThe population of the region participated in the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]]. [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], Count of Cotentin and since then King of England strengthened Saint-L\u00f4 in 1090. In 1091, Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances, had a lock and mills built on the River Vire. With the death of Henry I Beauclerc in 1135, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], Count of Mortain and [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] disputed the legitimacy of the realm. Saint-L\u00f4 sided with Stephen but was taken in 1139 by the Plantagenet army in just three days. The Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Becket]], passed through Saint-L\u00f4 and a church, of which there remains no trace except the name of the ''Rue Saint-Thomas'', was dedicated to him. In 1204, Saint-L\u00f4 submitted to [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] and became French. During this period of peace, the town prospered: It had the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu]] built on the edges of the town along with part of the Notre-Dame church and in 1234 a guild of tailors was established. [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] came to the city twice, in 1256 and 1269. Saint-L\u00f4 was then the third largest town in the [[Duchy of Normandy]] after [[Rouen]] and [[Caen]]. In 1275 it received the right to mint coins from King [[Philip III of France]], which it maintained until 1693. It specialised in [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] with the designation '' la vache de Saint-L\u00f4'' [the cowhide of Saint-L\u00f4].

In January 1538, the letter \"C\" was attributed to him. The coins minted in Saint-L\u00f4 in the [[Middle Ages]] are also characterised by a \"secret spot\" under the nineteenth letter of the legend. The city was robbed of its monetary title in September 1693 in favour of Caen. Then, it returned to conflict with the [[Hundred Years' War]]. [[Geoffroy de Harcourt]], a knight with franchises in Nord-Cotentin, betrayed the King of France and gave his homage to [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. In response, the barons Percy, Bacon and La Roche-Tesson were beheaded in Paris and their heads were exhibited in Saint-L\u00f4 for two years. The English landed at [[Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue]] on 12 July 1346 and then move upon Saint-L\u00f4 on 22 July.

Then the town was struck by the [[Black Death]] in 1347. Saint-L\u00f4 was reconquered in 1378 by [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] but it was again lost to English rule on 12 March 1418. During this period of political unrest, the lesser lords no longer knew where to place their allegiance. The French regained Saint-L\u00f4 on behalf of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] on 12 September 1449. The king confirming the status of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], it was the turn of the Duke of Brittany to occupy Manche, but Saint-L\u00f4 successfully repelled an attack in 1467, decimating a part of the Breton troops who were trapped by surprise in the ''Rue Torteron''. On 9 November 1469, the ducal ring was broken and Normandy was definitively integrated into the Kingdom of France.\n\n===16th to 20th centuries===\n\n[[File:Corot- La Vire \u00e0 Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|right|Jean-Baptiste Corot, ''La Vire \u00e0 Saint-L\u00f4'' (1850\u20131855), Museum of the Louvre.]]\n\nThe period of peace had returned but the Cotentin lost its importance. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] was acclaimed at the door of the Neufbourg in 1532. In the 16th century, Protestantism won the round. Saint-L\u00f4 had a [[Continental Reformed church|reformed church]] from 1555 and early printed books would be Protestant works. Saint-L\u00f4 suffered notably during the [[Wars of Religion (France)|Wars of Religion]]. The [[Huguenot]]s, holding Saint-L\u00f4 and [[Carentan]], ransacked Coutances in 1562 and seized the Bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Artus de Coss\u00e9-Brissac|fr}}, who was dragged in the town of Saint-L\u00f4 on a donkey. Although, while the [[Edict of Amboise|Edict of Pacification of Amboise]] had prompted the city to submit to [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] in February 1574, Norman Protestants made their headquarters in Saint-L\u00f4. Troops led by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon|fr|3=Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon|lt=Marshal de Matignon}} besieged the city on 1 May, assaulted it 10 days later and captured it on 10 June.<ref>{{citation|work=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Agriculture, d'Arch\u00e9ologie et d'Histoire Naturelle du D\u00e9partement de la Manche|title=Notices, m\u00e9moires et documents|language=fr|trans-title=Records, memoirs and documents|volume=1|publisher=Jacqueline|year=1857}}</ref> There were more than 500 deaths among those whose leader was Colombi\u00e8res, Lord of Bricqueville, but the Protestant Grand Captain [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery|Gabriel I of Montgomery]] escaped through the door of the Doll\u00e9e. The town was ceded to {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon|fr|3=Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon|lt=Jacques II de Matignon}} who built the citadel. Two years later the seigneury of the bishops of Coutances over the town ceased forever.\n\nAs a result of the war, in 1580, Saint-L\u00f4 lost the headquarters of the [[pr\u00e9sidial]], transferred to Coutances, capital of the bailiwick.<ref>{{cite journal|first=\u00c9douard|last=Lepingard|title=Une page de l'histoire de Saint-L\u00f4|journal=Annuaire du D\u00e9partement de la Manche|year=1866}}</ref> In the mid-17th century part of the walls were destroyed, and the town grew with a new borough known as ''Neufborg''. After the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1685), most craftsmen abandoned Saint-L\u00f4. The [[Revolt of the va-nu-pieds]] shook the area slightly in 1636, when the Government wanted to extend the [[Gabelle of salt|gabelle]] in Cotentin. The region flourished especially in the manufacture of so-called ''d'estame'' wool socks. In 1678, the relics of Saint Laud were brought back to Notre-Dame. The route between Paris and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], built to 1761, passes to Saint-L\u00f4, facilitating trade. The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 overthrew the administrative division of the France and the capital of the department was temporarily set at Coutances between 1794 and 1796. Saint-L\u00f4 took the {{Interlanguage link multi|List of French communes which changed their names during the Revolution|fr|3=Liste des communes fran\u00e7aises ayant chang\u00e9 de nom au cours de la R\u00e9volution|lt=Republican name}} ''\"Rocher de la Libert\u00e9\"'' [Rock of Freedom] and a tree was planted on the ''Champ de Mars''. The city was relatively untouched during the [[Reign of Terror]] although there were some clashes with the [[Chouannerie|Chouans]].\n\n[[File:Vestige de la papeterie de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|right|Only the chimney of the paper mill withstood the fire of 1930.]]\n\nThe Napoleonic period saw the creation of the national stud. In 1827, [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France]], Duchess of Angoul\u00eame, passed through Saint-L\u00f4 and she was struck by the beauty of the landscape. She then planned to bring the sea to Saint-L\u00f4 making the River Vire navigable. The creation of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Vire and Taute Canal|fr|3=Canal de Vire et Taute}} in 1833 allowed the establishment of the connection between [[Carentan]] and Saint-L\u00f4. Then, by order of 10 July 1835, the Vire was classified as navigable. Baron [[Alfred Mosselman]] built a port at Saint-L\u00f4 in recruiting nearly 250 military detainees and Spanish prisoners. A boatyard was created and traffic flowed at 50 tons in 1841 to more than 132 in 1846. {{Interlanguage link multi|Mosselman Family|fr|3=Famille Mosselman|lt=Mosselman}} then launched barges and introduced horse traction by arranging the towpaths of the waterway. Several goods were transported but mainly the {{Interlanguage link multi|Tangue (rock)|fr|3=Tangue (roche)|lt=tangue}} and the [[Lime (material)|lime]] from the quarries of [[Pont-H\u00e9bert]] and [[Cavigny]]. It thus passed from 1,233 tonnes of lime production in 1841 to 30,000 in 1858. In 1867, the paper mill of Valvire<ref group=Note>[[:File:Papeterie de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|Information board]] arranged in front of the chimney.</ref> was built near the spillway and manufactured packing paper. It was destroyed by fire in 1930 and little remains beyond the chimney of the plant.\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 ruled out the [[Mantes-la-Jolie\u2013Cherbourg railway]] because its inhabitants, having fear of industrial progress, refused a path linking them to Paris. It would be attached to the rail network in 1860. In the 19th century, Saint-L\u00f4, in the heart of a rich farming area, established itself as an important place for trade in animals, but the fear of the rural population towards the industrial revolution was blocking its development. River traffic transit saw 53,000 tonnes of goods, only 6% of which were foodstuffs. A leak was discovered in the canal and the River Vire was decommissioned in 1926. The region experienced a significant rural exodus and suffered casualties of the [[Franco-Prussian War|war of 1870]] and the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Valvire paper mill burned down in the 1930s and would never be rebuilt. The demographics of the department was very negative from 1850. The city covered [[World War II]] in a declining situation.\n\nIn 1914 and 1915, Saint-L\u00f4 welcomed the temporary hospital No. 2 of the 10th Army Corps.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe criminal case of Jean Philippe took place in Saint-L\u00f4, and was then judged by the Court of Assizes of Manche, at Coutances on 9 December 1940.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|last=Miniac|title=Les Nouvelles Affaires criminelles de la Manche|publisher=de Bor\u00e9e|location=Paris, France|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Remparts de Saint-L\u00f4 (grotte).jpg|thumb|right|The underground entrance to the ramparts.]]\n\nFrance was invaded in 1940 and the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]], commanded by [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]], entered [[Normandy]].

A lengthy clean-up began, including the corpses of residents and soldiers, which lasted until 15 October 1944. However, officials hesitated to rebuild Saint-L\u00f4. Indeed, some were willing to leave the ruins as a testament to the martyrdom of the city and later rebuild a new Saint-L\u00f4. The population declined, preferring to reinhabit its city.\n\n[[File:Baraques de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|left|Many traces of wooden barracks remain.]]\n\nIn April 1945, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Reconstruction in France after World War II|fr|3=Reconstruction en France apr\u00e8s la Seconde Guerre mondiale|lt=Reconstruction}} Minister [[Raoul Dautry]] advocated a provisional wooden barracks building. These huts are built through the generosity of the donations. Thus, the association of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Swiss donation for war victims|fr|3=Don suisse pour les victimes de la guerre|lt=Swiss grant}} unblocked an appropriation of 620,000 [[Swiss franc]]s to build homes and a community centre. On 10 October 1949, [[Switzerland]] offered a gold ingot to the city which yielded 649,490 francs. There were ten housing estates in 1948, some which contained over 70 houses. The barracks were delivered in kit form, and it was enough to build them on the spot. Each had different specifics according to their place of origin (Swedish, Finnish, Swiss, French, American, Canadian). The Irish [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|Red Cross]] participated in the construction of a hospital consisting of 25 buildings (located level with the Pasteur college) and landed 174 tons of equipment. The hospital was inaugurated on Sunday, 7 April 1946 and the Irish medical team left Saint-L\u00f4 at the beginning of January 1947. This hospital, consisting of wooden shacks, operated until 1956.\n\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 (premi\u00e8re pierre).jpg|thumb|right|The first stone of the reconstruction]]\n\nBy 1948, a more permanent Saint-L\u00f4 had to be rebuilt. This would be done on the basis of plans designed by the Chief Architect of the reconstruction Andr\u00e9 Hilt (died 1946), which had proposed to retain the general fabric of the town by adapting it to modern needs. President [[Vincent Auriol]] laid the first stone just four years after landing.\n\n[[File:Hopital memorial.jpg|thumb|right|The France \u2013 United States Memorial Hospital]]\n\nAs partial reparation for the destruction of the city, the Americans, behind the bombing, decided to build a modern hospital. The plans were made by the architect [[Paul Nelson (architect)|Paul Nelson]],<ref name=hopital-saint-lo>{{cite web|url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/1956-2014-lhopital-de-saint-lo-se-raconte-2024672|title=1956\u20132014 : l'h\u00f4pital de Saint-L\u00f4 se raconte|language=fr|trans-title=1956\u20132014 : The hospital of Saint-L\u00f4 is told|first=Nathalie|last=Lecornu-Baert|work=Ouest-France|date=19 March 2014|accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref> who decided to build a contemporary-style building. It is located on the ''Route de [[Villedieu-les-Po\u00eales|Villedieu]]''. Work began in 1949, and it was completed on 10 May 1956. A monumental [[mosaic]] was made by [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], which pays tribute to peace and Franco-American friendship: Both hands towards the Cotentin Peninsula symbolised with an apple tree branch in bloom. It was at that time the largest hospital in Europe. On 29 November 1949, the journalist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pottecher]] submitted a hypothesis to not move the prefecture of Manche from Saint-L\u00f4. Although, during the reconstruction, it was temporarily placed in Coutances. The whole of the population reacted and a petition collected more than 2,400 signatures: in the journal ''le R\u00e9veil'', an article quotes:\n\n{{quote|text=So come back to Saint-L\u00f4, Sir! Not for burial, but to see the prefecture, the building sites, the plans, the nerve of the victims. You will see how keenly the people of Saint-L\u00f4 will kick your backside.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}}}\n\nThe prefecture returned to Saint-L\u00f4 in 1953, into new premises.\n\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 (hall place).jpg|thumb|left|The belfry of the square]]\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 was rebuilt. The dominant style was a neo-regionalist functionalism which was dominated by concrete. Its dated and monotonous character was soon criticised. If this choice, dictated by the circumstances and the immediate problems of the housing of Saint-L\u00f4, leaves regrets today, it makes Saint-L\u00f4, on a smaller scale than [[Le Havre]] or [[Lorient]], one of the most striking testimonies of the reconstruction period. A few streets contain vestiges of the old Saint-L\u00f4: some houses on the ''Rue du Neufbourg'', ''Rue Croix-Canuet'' and ''Falourdel'', ''Rue Saint-Georges'' and ''Porte au Four''. This last street houses the last medieval way of Saint-L\u00f4. In 1964, Saint-L\u00f4 absorbed two neighbouring communes, Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-L\u00f4 (660 inhabitants in 1962,<ref name=\"ehess-scdsl\">{{cite web|url= http://cassini.ehess.fr/cassini/fr/html/fiche.php?select_resultat=31322 |title=Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-L\u00f4}}</ref> to the east of the territory) and Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-L\u00f4 (306 inhabitants<ref name=\"ehess-stdsl\">{{cite web|url= http://cassini.ehess.fr/cassini/fr/html/fiche.php?select_resultat=34828 |title=Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-L\u00f4}}</ref> to the south). The town benefitted from the economic growth of the [[Trente Glorieuses]] and the population grew by 30% between 1968 and 1975. It built neighbourhoods of buildings in the Valley of the Doll\u00e9e and Val Saint-Jean. The theatre, meanwhile, was inaugurated in 1963.\n\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau d'eau de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|right|The Des Ronchettes water tower]]\n\nThe square of the town hall was completely redeveloped in the 1990s. The city organised a large demonstration on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Normandy landings. The edges of the Vire were reconfigured with the rehabilitation of the towpath and the creation of a green beach, at the ''Place du Quai-\u00e0-Tangue''. A [[scow]] was rebuilt and crossed the river, in order to remember former river traffic. In 2004, the rural area of Bois-Jugan was urbanised, with the creation of housing within a framework of preservation of green spaces and a large aquatic centre. Later, the Des Ronchettes [[water tower]] was built following an unusual method for the time, since the tank (strongly resembling a [[flying saucer]]) was built at the ground level, then raised by a system of jacks, as the rings composing its body were manufactured. As such, its elevation allows a mounting point for [[telecommunication]] (mobile phone, [[WiMAX]], and FM radio) networks.\n\n==Politics and administration==\n\n===List of mayors===\n\n====During the Revolution====\nFor the [[French Revolution|revolutionary period]], the destruction of most of the archives does not allow a definitive result.\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of mayors of Saint-L\u00f4, 1784\u20131799\n!

A city of craftsmen and trade, which owes part of its prosperity to its status of prefecture, it has experienced a late industrialisation and attempts to assert its place, today, in the regional agri-food industry. Despite this, the Saint-L\u00f4 country became one of the less industrial areas of the region. Its unemployment rate of 6.7% also hides an exodus of young workers to the area of Caen and Rennes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-region/2007-01-17/economie-le-saint-lois-se-cherche-un-avenir/1556/0/31511|title=Le Saint-Lois se cherche un avenir|language=fr|trans-title=Economy \u2013 The Saint-Lois is in search of a future|work=[[Le Point]]|date=17 January 2007|access-date=2 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004193045/http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-region/2007-01-17/economie-le-saint-lois-se-cherche-un-avenir/1556/0/31511|archive-date=4 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The entry into service of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Route nationale 174|fr|3=Route nationale 174|lt=RN 174}} helped open up the centre of Manche and create a new industrial zone (ZAC Neptune).\n\nIn 2008, Saint-L\u00f4 was equipped with [[Optical fiber|fibre optic]] cable to allow companies and individuals to have very high speed internet (approximately 1 [[Bit rate|Gbps]] and 100 Mbit/s for individuals).

When the group went bankrupt in 2004, the factory was a subsidiary of SEB, and general company for electric motors was revived as Euromoteurs, with SEB as the only customer. Part of the production lines were dismantled, sold to China and resettled there by the Green de Gourfaleur company. The Saint-L\u00f4 site had 150 employees and manufactured small and medium power electric motors. Suffering from only having the single client SEB, Euromoteurs was put into liquidation in 2007.\n*Alios, production plant which manufactures smart cards and ''CEV'', a company that manages electronic transactions, grouped in the same building (80 employees) and subsidiaries of the [[Groupe Up|Group Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner]].

There are many jobs in administration related to its status of prefecture. Its location in the heart of the bocage allows it to sustain services connected historically with agriculture: It may be noted the presence of one of the seats of the {{Interlanguage link multi|List of regional funds of Cr\u00e9dit agricole|fr|3=Liste des caisses r\u00e9gionales de Cr\u00e9dit agricole|lt=Cr\u00e9dit agricole of Normandy}}, whose closure was announced in June 2010, but also the insurer [[Groupama]], clearly visible from the Major Howie roundabout, and {{Interlanguage link multi|Mutualit\u00e9 sociale agricole|fr}}.

Each week, a calf market took place in the market installed until 30 December 2008 near Les Ronchettes. From January 2009, it was removed and attached to the calf market at [[Torigni-sur-Vire]]. The city also has the Livestock Promotion Centre, located next to the stud farm, which hosts the equestrian competition of the Normandy horse show, each year in August. The agri-food cluster has developed since 1990 with the aim of hosting companies in this sector, several public or parapublic bodies are installed:\n\n*Adria normandie: technical advice centre for agro-processing.\n*The agri-food nursery.\n*Lilano: ''Laboratoire interprofessionnel laitier de Normandie'' [Inter-professional dairy laboratory of Normandy].\n*The Centre of agri-food formation of Saint-L\u00f4, an extension of the Th\u00e8re Farming School located at [[Le Hommet-d'Arthenay]].\n*Ardefa: ''Association r\u00e9gionale pour le d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019emploi et des formations dans les industries alimentaires'' [Regional Association for the development of employment and training in the food industries.]\n*Workshop of agri-food rotation.\n*The agri-food park of [[Saint-Georges-Montcocq]] / [[Le Mesnil-Rouxelin]] on which the master dairies are established; through lack of implementation, much remains undeveloped.\n\nIn 2008, the only success in the agri-food field was the success of the France Kebab enterprise,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamanchelibre.fr/actualite-9045-france-kebab-mise-tout-sur-les-nouveaux-gouts.html|date=2009|title=France Kebab mise tout sur les nouveaux go\u00fbts|language=fr|trans-title=France Kebab is all about new tastes|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref> which had won many prizes in 2007.\n\n===Media===\n[[File:Facade tendance ouest.JPG|thumb|right|The studio of Tendance Ouest.]]\n\nSeveral regional media are disseminated in Saint-L\u00f4 and have an office.\n\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|La Manche libre|fr|3=La Manche libre|lt=''La Manche libre''}} (weekly newspaper), headquarters\n*''[[Ouest-France]]'' (daily press), departmental daily\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|La Presse de la Manche|fr|3=La Presse de la Manche|lt=''La Presse de la Manche''}} (daily press)\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|Tendance Ouest|fr}}, formerly Radio Manche (radio)\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|France Bleu Cotentin|fr}} (radio)\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 - Coll\u00e8ge Louis Pasteur (2).jpg|thumb|Louis-Pasteur College]]\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 - \u00c9cole Raymond Brul\u00e9.JPG|thumb|Raymond-Brul\u00e9 School]]\n\nThe city of Saint-L\u00f4 falls within the {{Interlanguage link multi|Academy of Caen (education)|fr|3=Acad\u00e9mie de Caen (\u00e9ducation)|lt=Academy of Caen}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ac-caen.fr/orientation-insertion_209_centre-d-information-et-d-orientation-de-saint-lo.html|title=Centre d'information et d'orientation de Saint L\u00f4|language=fr|trans-title=Centre of information and orientation of Saint L\u00f4}}</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

If the stained-glass windows were saved, after being always present since temporary removal during the war, the [[nave]] was gutted following the collapse of the North Tower which was shelled by German artillery. Its roof and fa\u00e7ade were destroyed, as well as the top of the other tower. Instead of rebuilding the church identically, the architect of Historic Monuments decided to build a [[greenschist]] frontage to highlight the scar left by the war. The statue of ''Notre-Dame du Pilier'' is from 1467; having been destroyed and remade several times, it is now housed on a column in the [[apse]] chapel.\n\n====Church of Sainte-Croix====\n\nThe {{Interlanguage link multi|Church of Sainte-Croix of Saint-L\u00f4|fr|3=\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix de Saint-L\u00f4|lt=abbey church of ''Sainte-Croix''}} is, according to the tradition, the heir of a chapel built here by St. Helena in the 4th century and of an abbey founded by Charlemagne. More documented is the creation of an [[Augustinian]] abbey by the bishop of [[Coutances]] in 1132. The Romanesque church was consecrated in 1202, being largely remade in the following centuries with successive renovations. The choir was remade in the 16th century while the bell tower is from 1860\u20131863. During [[World War II]], the bell tower (located laterally) collapsed and it was on its ruins where the body of [[Thomas D. Howie|Major Howie]] was placed; a new bell tower was rebuilt in 1957 on the forecourt in a modern style. On the church square stands the departmental monument in memory of the victims of the wars of [[Algerian War|Algeria]] and [[First Indochina War|Indochina]], opened in 2005.\n\n====Cemetery of Saint-L\u00f4====\nThe cemetery of Saint-L\u00f4 is located between the Saint-Croix Church and the national stud, on the ''Route de Lison''. The cemetery is much marked by the Second World War with the plot of the civilian victims of the bombing of 1944, also the mausoleum of the Blanchet family, and Major Glover S. Johns Junior who installed the first command post before releasing the city. One can still find the tomb of the {{Interlanguage link multi|List of the generals of the French Revolution and the First Empire|fr|3=Liste des g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la R\u00e9volution et du Premier Empire|lt=French revolutionary general}} [[Luc Sim\u00e9on Auguste Dagobert|Dagobert]].

On the south side, the wartime disaster of 1944 had the paradoxical effect of clearing the base, where houses had grown around the ''Rue du Torteron''.\n\n====National Stud====\n[[File:Haras de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Haras National'' of Saint-L\u00f4.]]\n\n{{main|{{Interlanguage link multi|Haras National of Saint-L\u00f4|fr|3=Haras national de Saint-L\u00f4}}}}\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 is home to the largest of the 23 national stud farms in France. In 1806, [[Napoleon]] provided Saint-L\u00f4 with a deposit of stallions by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Haras under the First Empire|fr|3=Haras sous le Premier Empire|lt=Imperial Decree of 4 July 1806}}.<ref name=haras-nationaux>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifce.fr/haras-nationaux/nos-sites/haras-national-de-saint-lo/|title=Haras national de Saint L\u00f4|language=fr|trans-title=Haras National of Saint-L\u00f4|work=Haras nationaux}}</ref> From its origin, the deposit was installed on buildings and abandoned land of the old Abbey of Sainte-Croix ({{convert|3|ha|acre|abbr=on}} first leased and then owned from 22 September 1807). The stud then recruited from the breeding of the [[Haras national du Pin|Haras du Pin]].<ref name=haras-nationaux/>\n\nIn 1826, the military remount depot moved premises which the stud had given to it; most stallions were taken from the stud to provide cavalry. On 28 May 1874, the Boscher Law enabled supervision of the allocations of the regiments and allowed to provide the stud with over 230 horses. On 28 June 1881, the municipal council decided to transfer the stud to adjoin the ''Route de Bayeux''. Thus, the current stud farm buildings date from 1884 (the first stone was laid on 11 June 1884), and the transfer was finished three years later. During World War I, five mares out of six were requisitioned, but no stallions. [[Groom (profession)|Grooms]] fought at the front, and German prisoners dug a pond. In 1939, the old stable housed the staff of the Haras de [[Strasbourg]] (40 stallions and staff) at the time of the German breakthrough. Then, in 1944, fifty horses were killed by the bombing and other stallions were stolen by German soldiers in flight.<ref>{{citation|title=Le haras national de Saint-L\u00f4, l'univers d'un patrimoine normand|language=fr|trans-title=The National Stud of Saint-L\u00f4, the universe of a Norman heritage|year=1996}}</ref> The old stud was destroyed and claimed by the city. Thus, there only remains the street of the same name and the Normandy building which was previously the former riding school. The new stud was then built. [[Charles de Gaulle|General de Gaulle]] offered to the Sultan of Morocco ''Bois de Rose'', a [[thoroughbred]] which had been stationed at the stud for two years. The stud then grew gradually in the field of reproduction, by investing in an [[artificial insemination]] centre, a centre for the freezing of semen and an [[embryo transfer]] unit. Thus, the electoral district of Saint-L\u00f4 has the highest density of breeding deposits of France.\n\n====Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle====\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle.jpg|thumb|right|Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle]]\n\nLocated on the bank of the Vire, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle|fr}} belongs to the Saint-Lois descendants of the 17th century diarist Luc Duchemin. The Sainte-Pernelle Chapel is the work of a Lord of the Vaucelle Jean Boucart, confessor of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] and founder of the parish library of Saint-L\u00f4, which was at the time the second library of Normandy by importance. Three kings resided at the Vaucelle: [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1346, at the beginning of the [[Hundred Years' War]] the king found that it was not a safe city, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] during his visit in 1532 and [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]]. The dovecote and the northern wall niche are listed as protected elements.\n\n===Museums===\n\n====Museum of Fine Arts====\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Saint-L\u00f4 - Rotonde des tapisseries des amours de Gombaut et Mac\u00e9.JPG|thumb|right|Rotunda of the tapestries of the Amours de Gombault et Mac\u00e9e.]]\n\n{{main|{{Interlanguage link multi|Museum of Fine Arts of Saint-L\u00f4|fr|3=Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Saint-L\u00f4}}}}\n\nBuilt by the architect Eug\u00e8ne Leseney, the Jean-Lur\u00e7at Cultural Centre is situated on the ''Place du Champ-de-Mars'', opposite the Sainte-Croix Church.

It is a relic of a former [[Leper colony|leprosarium]] from the 14th century. It was classified as an historical monument on 3 August 1974 and was restored between 1988 and 1994. A memorial was inaugurated in May 1995 in honour of the soldiers of the 29th and 35th divisions who liberated Saint-L\u00f4 in 1944.

Howie|Major Thomas Howie]], Commander of the 3d Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army's 29th Division; the unit that liberated the city on 18 July 1944. Howie was killed just before his unit entered the city and was so highly respected that his men placed his flag-draped body on the hood of a jeep at the front of the column so he could be the first American to enter the city. He became famous as the \"Major of Saint-L\u00f4\".\n\n===Place de la Mairie===\n[[File:La laiti\u00e8re \u00e0 Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|right|''La Laiti\u00e8re normande'' [The Norman dairywoman], of Arthur Le Duc.]]\n\nRedesigned in 1990, the city square is all black asphalt lit by spotlights on the ground.

A few years later, the bronze arrived in Saint-L\u00f4. It is set on a round plinth, surrounded by a basin, on the ''Place des Beaux-Regards'' in front of the Notre-Dame church. She moved a little further when the [[Poilu]] of the [[World War I|Great War]] was installed. It was then unbolted and melted on 8 February 1942, by the Germans, to recover the bronze for the arms industry. In January 1984, Andr\u00e9 Leplanquais, a merchant of Saint-L\u00f4, wanted to create a replica of this statue. A fundraiser gained significant donations from residents. Once the money was together, the sculptor {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis Derbr\u00e9|fr}}, the famous sculptor of [[Ern\u00e9e]], fashioned a new statue based on the original plans. Moved several times, one can find it near stairs of the square. The base and the granite basin are the original.\n\n[[File:Statue de la laiti\u00e8re normande.jpg|thumb|right|''La Laiti\u00e8re normande'' of Louis Derbr\u00e9, from after Arthur Le Duc.]]\n\nThe Havin fountain<ref>{{cite web|url=http://e-monumen.net/patrimoine-monumental/monument-a-havin-ou-la-presse-guide-lenfance-a-la-verite-saint-lo/|title=Monument \u00e0 Havin, ou La Presse guide l'Enfance \u00e0 la V\u00e9rit\u00e9|language=fr|trans-title=Monument to Havin, or La Presse guide Children to the Truth|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref> also created by Arthur Le Duc in 1887<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/arcade_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=AR502239|title=Notice no AR502239|work=Base Arcade|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref> was located near the Museum of Saint-L\u00f4; its statue was also melted by the Germans, however no replica has been created. Nearby is the prison entrance, a remnant of the bombing in 1944. An urn containing the ashes of deportees is placed at the foot of it. A memorial in honour of the victims of Nazi repression, it became the departmental monument to the [[French Resistance|Resistance]]. The [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] can also be observed from the square, which seems to spring from the heart of the city. Built in 1954, it was once used to dry the hoses of firefighters. Renovated several times since 1990, it is the symbol of the reconstruction of the city. At the top are a weathervane in the shape of Unicorn and a viewpoint, from which one can admire the entire region. Previously open to the public by the tourist office, its access is now forbidden.\n\n===The Caisse d'\u00c9pargne squirrel===\nA granite statue representing a squirrel can be seen in Saint-L\u00f4, which is the logo of the [[Groupe Caisse d'\u00c9pargne|Caisse d'\u00c9pargne]] banking group; It is located in the ''Rue Saint-Thomas''. What may seem incongruous, it is that there's no bank of this group nearby. However, the bank did have a branch in front, but it was moved in the 1990s. Then arose the question of whether or not to keep the statue for advertising purposes. The people of Saint-L\u00f4 had become attached to the squirrel, and it was finally decided to leave it in place.\n\n==Quarters==\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 - Val Saint-Jean - d\u00e9molition d'immeuble.jpg|thumb|right|Quarter of Val Saint-Jean during restructuring (March 2010).]]\n\nThe town of Saint-L\u00f4 consists of a number of [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarter]]s:\n\n*The Val Saint-Jean, composed mainly of buildings and apartment towers.\n*The Aurore, composed mostly of single family homes and social housing.

The view is breathtaking on the Vire and ''Rue Torteron''.\n*The ''Plage Verte'' [Green Beach]: A green space created in 2001 on part of the old tangue wharf in the vicinity of the River Vire, between the ramparts and the railway station. The modern Henri Li\u00e9bard footbridge connects the two banks of the river roughly at the location of the former which had been destroyed during the bombing of June 1944. It is also the setting of the festival of the Vire which is held annually during the last weekend of June. It also allows access to the piers for [[boat tour]]s.\n*The islands of the river Vire: Lebroussois island and M\u00f6selman Island are separated by the weir. An arboretum has been planted at the foot of the brick chimney, only remnant of the paper mill which was burned in the 1930s.\n*The towpath: Between the station and the Rocreuil bridge, many Saint-L\u00f4 people walk, do their jogging and cycling there. One can see the Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle.\n*The Valley of the Doll\u00e9e: At the foot of the ''Route de [[Lison]]'', there is a [[mill race]] and a [[watermill]] and a fitness trail. It is also part of the festival of ''\"h\u00e9t\u00e9roclites\"''.\n*The Boisjugan Urban Park: A green area linking the new subdivisions, which border it, and the old farmland property of the city which borders the south ring road.

This historic heart of the city became ''L'Enclos'', a site well suited to passive defence.\n\nThe east of the territory is the former commune of Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-L\u00f4, south of Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-L\u00f4, absorbed in 1964.\n\n{{Geographic Location 2\n | Centre     = Saint-L\u00f4<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/ |title= G\u00e9oportail (IGN), \"Limites administratives\" layer activated}}</ref>\n | North       = [[Saint-Georges-Montcocq]]<br />[[Le Mesnil-Rouxelin]]\n | Northeast   = [[La Luzerne]]<br />[[Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-l'\u00c9pine]]\n | East        = [[Saint-Pierre-de-Semilly]]<br />[[La Barre-de-Semilly]]\n | Southeast   = [[Cond\u00e9-sur-Vire]]\n | South       = [[Gourfaleur]]<br />[[Baudre]]\n | Southwest   = [[Saint-\u00c9bremond-de-Bonfoss\u00e9]]\n | West        = [[Saint-Gilles, Manche|Saint-Gilles]]<br />[[Agneaux]]\n | Northwest   = [[Saint-Georges-Montcocq]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Hydrographie Manche.svg|thumb|right|Hydrography of Manche]]\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 has a mild [[oceanic climate]] characterised by mild winters and temperate summers. It has an average annual rainfall of {{convert|800 to 900|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. Rainfall is quite frequent throughout the year but most abundant in autumn and winter, in connection with the disturbances coming from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Rarely intense, they often fall in the form of [[drizzle]]. The average temperature is {{convert|10|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meteofrance.com/FR/climat/dpt_tempsdumois.jsp?LIEUID=DEPT50|title=climat de la Manche|work=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France}}</ref> In winter, the average temperature ranges between {{convert|1|and|7|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. There are between 30 and 40 days of frost per year. In summer, the average temperature lies around {{convert|20|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Transport===\nSaint-L\u00f4 is located in the centre of the department of Manche and is therefore a node of communication between [[Cotentin Peninsula|Nord-Cotentin]] and southern Manche.\n\n====Road====\n[[File:R\u00e9seau routier de Manche.svg|thumb|left|Road network in the area of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]]]]\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 lies halfway along the [[Coutances]]\u2013[[Bayeux]] axis ({{Interlanguage link multi|Route nationale 172|fr|3=Route nationale 172|lt=RD 972}}). A bypass road was commissioned in the 1980s to allow the decongestion of the city from the south. To open up the port of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], the region and the department decided the construction of a [[dual carriageway]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Route nationale 174|fr|3=Route nationale 174|lt=RN 174}}. It is a part of the [[European route E03]] and enables direct connection to [[Rennes]] and Europe from the south, through the interchange at [[Guilberville]]. The southern section now connects Saint-L\u00f4 directly to the [[A84 autoroute]], allowing motorway access to [[Caen]] and Rennes. The commissioning of the northern section, which is currently under construction, will meanwhile allow access to Cherbourg and [[England]] via the [[Route nationale 13]]. The construction of the dual carriageway allowed the extension of the small South ring road heading west and its mutation into genuine urban bypass. It has also enabled the creation and expansion of new business zones which contribute strongly to the current growth of the agglomeration.\n\n====Rail====\n[[File:R\u00e9seau ferr\u00e9 de Manche.svg|thumb|right|Rail network in the area of the Cotentin Peninsula]]\n\nThe [[Gare de Saint-L\u00f4]] is served by [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]] trains on the {{Interlanguage link multi|Caen - Rennes railway line|fr|3=Ligne de Caen \u00e0 Rennes}}. It is in the majority of services for travellers in the direction of Caen via [[Lison]] or in the direction of [[Coutances]]. A few trains, two daily return trips, serve as far as [[Rennes]] via [[Avranches]].\n\nFollowing the electrification of the section of railway between Lison and Saint-L\u00f4 during 2006, the [[SNCF]] and local communities experienced a direct [[Intercit\u00e9s]] service (without change of train) to the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] in [[Paris]] for two years, between December 2008 and December 2010. This service was not sustained due to a lack a sufficient number of passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamanchelibre.fr/actualite-20463-bientot-plus-train-entre-saint-lo-et-paris.html|title=Bient\u00f4t plus de train entre Saint-L\u00f4 et Paris!|language=fr|trans-title=Soon more train between Paris and Saint-L\u00f4!|work=[[La Manche libre]]|date=29 September 2010}}</ref> There is also the disused former industrial line to [[Cond\u00e9-sur-Vire]].

In 2010, the network consisted of four lines (Odyss\u00e9e, Azur, Horizon and Aliz\u00e9) with 15 buses and one Ocitol\u00e0 transport on demand minibus. However, since 3 January 2011, it is composed of three lines (1, 2 and 3) still with 15 buses and one Ocitol\u00e0 transport on demand minibus. In 2008, the company recorded more than 850,000 journeys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transports.manche.fr/reseau-routier-de-la-manche.asp|title=La Manche, carrefour de l'Arc Atlantique|language=fr|trans-title=Manche, crossroads of the Atlantic arc|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 May 2013, seven new vehicles were integrated with the fleet, namely five {{Interlanguage link multi|Vehixel|fr}} Cytios 4/44, and two [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] K BHNS.

It is no longer possible, due to lack of maintenance of the various equipment and the Vire.\n\n==History==\nSaint-L\u00f4 has long been an important centre of the economy of Normandy. It has attracted the covetousness of neighboring nations, including [[England]], resulting in many successive invasions. It lost its dominant position towards the end of the 19th century because it failed to take advantage of the first [[Industrial Revolution]], which instead affected much of the predominantly peasant population. However, the decentralisation policy allowed the city to return to the foreground.\n\n===Briov\u00e8re===\nOriginally called '''Briov\u00e8re''' (meaning \"Bridge on the [[Vire River]]\" in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]), the town is built on and around [[defensive wall|ramparts]]. The town started life as a [[Gaul|Gallic]] fortified settlement, occupied by the tribe of the [[Unelli]] of Cotentin. Briovere was conquered by the Romans led by [[Quintus Titurius Sabinus]] in 56&nbsp;BC, after the defeat of their leader [[Viridovix]] at {{Interlanguage link multi|Mont Castre|fr}}.<ref>{{citation|first=Julius|last=Caesar|title=Commentarii de Bello Gallico|title-link=Commentarii de Bello Gallico}}. III, 17.</ref> Roman peace led the development of Gallo-Roman rural areas, on the model of the Roman ''[[Villa rustica|villae rusticae]]'' as in [[Canisy]], [[Marigny, Manche|Marigny]] and [[Tessy-sur-Vire]], whose names are based on the suffix ''-i{{Interlanguage link multi|Suffix -acum|fr|3=Suffixe -acum|lt=-acum}}'', of location of Celtic origin ''*-i-\u0101ko-'', and often composed with a Latin personal name, carried by a Gallo-Roman native. Then, the region was the scene of various [[Saxons|Saxon]] invasions during the 3rd century. The [[Franks]] didn't establish an administrative power there, although Briovera was nevertheless entitled to [[Hammered coinage|hammer coinage]]. Historian [[Claude Fauchet (historian)|Claude Fauchet]] said, \"the Coutentin, at the same time as our [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] kings, was inhabited by the Sesnes ([[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]]), pirates, and seems to have been abandoned by [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], as variable and too remote for correction by our kings, to the Normans and other plunderers of sea...\"\n\nSainte-Croix Church was built in 300, said to be on the ruins of a temple of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Annuaire du d\u00e9partement de la Manche|language=fr|trans-title=Directory of the D\u00e9partement de la Manche|id=12th year|year=1840}} p.275</ref> Christianity grew quite late. There were only four {{Interlanguage link multi|List of bishops of Coutances|fr|3=Liste des \u00e9v\u00eaques de Coutances|lt=bishops of Coutances}} before 511. [[Laud of Coutances]], bishop in 525\u2013565, had a residence here. After his death he was beatified and was particularly honoured by Briovera, which would have housed his tomb. A pilgrimage was conducted and the city took the name of ''Saint-Laud'', and then the name ''Saint-L\u00f4'' which has been known since the 8th century.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Remparts de Saint-L\u00f4 12.jpg|thumb|right|The main entrance to the town.]]\n\nThe Bretons, led by [[Salomon, King of Brittany|King Salomon]], began to occupy the west coast of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] from 836. Before their advances, in August 867, [[Charles the Bald]] gave Salomon the Comitatus Constantiensis, territory over which he had little influence. In 889, the [[Vikings]] travelled up the Vire and besieged Saint-L\u00f4. Protected by solid ramparts built, according to tradition, in the early 9th century by [[Charlemagne]], the town did not initially surrender. The attackers then cut the water supply, resulting in the surrender of the inhabitants. The Vikings massacred the inhabitants, including the Bishop of Coutances, and then razed the town. The seat of the diocese moved to [[Rouen]]. It was only in 1025 that Bishop Herbert decided to return to the walls of Saint-L\u00f4 and restore the episcopal see. Then, under [[Geoffrey de Montbray]], the town had a great economic development, taking advantage of the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman expedition in Sicily]]. [[Robert Guiscard]], a close associate of Geoffrey, brought important loot to [[County of Apulia and Calabria|Apulia and Calabria]], and it was thanks to this treasure that Geoffrey was able to rebuild Coutances Cathedral in 1056. Saint-L\u00f4 is famous for its goldsmiths and even [[Matilda of Flanders]], the wife of [[William the Conqueror]], ordered two candelabra for the {{Interlanguage link multi|Abbaye aux Dames, Caen|fr|3=Abbaye aux Dames (Caen)|lt=Abbaye aux Dames}}.\n\nThe population of the region participated in the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]]. [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], Count of Cotentin and since then King of England strengthened Saint-L\u00f4 in 1090. In 1091, Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances, had a lock and mills built on the River Vire. With the death of Henry I Beauclerc in 1135, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], Count of Mortain and [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] disputed the legitimacy of the realm. Saint-L\u00f4 sided with Stephen but was taken in 1139 by the Plantagenet army in just three days. The Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Becket]], passed through Saint-L\u00f4 and a church, of which there remains no trace except the name of the ''Rue Saint-Thomas'', was dedicated to him. In 1204, Saint-L\u00f4 submitted to [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] and became French. During this period of peace, the town prospered: It had the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu]] built on the edges of the town along with part of the Notre-Dame church and in 1234 a guild of tailors was established. [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] came to the city twice, in 1256 and 1269. Saint-L\u00f4 was then the third largest town in the [[Duchy of Normandy]] after [[Rouen]] and [[Caen]].

The coins minted in Saint-L\u00f4 in the [[Middle Ages]] are also characterised by a \"secret spot\" under the nineteenth letter of the legend. The city was robbed of its monetary title in September 1693 in favour of Caen. Then, it returned to conflict with the [[Hundred Years' War]]. [[Geoffroy de Harcourt]], a knight with franchises in Nord-Cotentin, betrayed the King of France and gave his homage to [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. In response, the barons Percy, Bacon and La Roche-Tesson were beheaded in Paris and their heads were exhibited in Saint-L\u00f4 for two years. The English landed at [[Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue]] on 12 July 1346 and then move upon Saint-L\u00f4 on 22 July.

Then the town was struck by the [[Black Death]] in 1347. Saint-L\u00f4 was reconquered in 1378 by [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] but it was again lost to English rule on 12 March 1418. During this period of political unrest, the lesser lords no longer knew where to place their allegiance. The French regained Saint-L\u00f4 on behalf of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] on 12 September 1449. The king confirming the status of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], it was the turn of the Duke of Brittany to occupy Manche, but Saint-L\u00f4 successfully repelled an attack in 1467, decimating a part of the Breton troops who were trapped by surprise in the ''Rue Torteron''. On 9 November 1469, the ducal ring was broken and Normandy was definitively integrated into the Kingdom of France.\n\n===16th to 20th centuries===\n\n[[File:Corot- La Vire \u00e0 Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|right|Jean-Baptiste Corot, ''La Vire \u00e0 Saint-L\u00f4'' (1850\u20131855), Museum of the Louvre.]]\n\nThe period of peace had returned but the Cotentin lost its importance. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] was acclaimed at the door of the Neufbourg in 1532. In the 16th century, Protestantism won the round. Saint-L\u00f4 had a [[Continental Reformed church|reformed church]] from 1555 and early printed books would be Protestant works. Saint-L\u00f4 suffered notably during the [[Wars of Religion (France)|Wars of Religion]]. The [[Huguenot]]s, holding Saint-L\u00f4 and [[Carentan]], ransacked Coutances in 1562 and seized the Bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Artus de Coss\u00e9-Brissac|fr}}, who was dragged in the town of Saint-L\u00f4 on a donkey. Although, while the [[Edict of Amboise|Edict of Pacification of Amboise]] had prompted the city to submit to [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] in February 1574, Norman Protestants made their headquarters in Saint-L\u00f4. Troops led by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon|fr|3=Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon|lt=Marshal de Matignon}} besieged the city on 1 May, assaulted it 10 days later and captured it on 10 June.<ref>{{citation|work=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Agriculture, d'Arch\u00e9ologie et d'Histoire Naturelle du D\u00e9partement de la Manche|title=Notices, m\u00e9moires et documents|language=fr|trans-title=Records, memoirs and documents|volume=1|publisher=Jacqueline|year=1857}}</ref> There were more than 500 deaths among those whose leader was Colombi\u00e8res, Lord of Bricqueville, but the Protestant Grand Captain [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery|Gabriel I of Montgomery]] escaped through the door of the Doll\u00e9e. The town was ceded to {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon|fr|3=Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon|lt=Jacques II de Matignon}} who built the citadel. Two years later the seigneury of the bishops of Coutances over the town ceased forever.\n\nAs a result of the war, in 1580, Saint-L\u00f4 lost the headquarters of the [[pr\u00e9sidial]], transferred to Coutances, capital of the bailiwick.<ref>{{cite journal|first=\u00c9douard|last=Lepingard|title=Une page de l'histoire de Saint-L\u00f4|journal=Annuaire du D\u00e9partement de la Manche|year=1866}}</ref> In the mid-17th century part of the walls were destroyed, and the town grew with a new borough known as ''Neufborg''. After the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1685), most craftsmen abandoned Saint-L\u00f4. The [[Revolt of the va-nu-pieds]] shook the area slightly in 1636, when the Government wanted to extend the [[Gabelle of salt|gabelle]] in Cotentin. The region flourished especially in the manufacture of so-called ''d'estame'' wool socks. In 1678, the relics of Saint Laud were brought back to Notre-Dame. The route between Paris and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], built to 1761, passes to Saint-L\u00f4, facilitating trade. The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 overthrew the administrative division of the France and the capital of the department was temporarily set at Coutances between 1794 and 1796. Saint-L\u00f4 took the {{Interlanguage link multi|List of French communes which changed their names during the Revolution|fr|3=Liste des communes fran\u00e7aises ayant chang\u00e9 de nom au cours de la R\u00e9volution|lt=Republican name}} ''\"Rocher de la Libert\u00e9\"'' [Rock of Freedom] and a tree was planted on the ''Champ de Mars''. The city was relatively untouched during the [[Reign of Terror]] although there were some clashes with the [[Chouannerie|Chouans]].\n\n[[File:Vestige de la papeterie de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|right|Only the chimney of the paper mill withstood the fire of 1930.]]\n\nThe Napoleonic period saw the creation of the national stud. In 1827, [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France]], Duchess of Angoul\u00eame, passed through Saint-L\u00f4 and she was struck by the beauty of the landscape. She then planned to bring the sea to Saint-L\u00f4 making the River Vire navigable. The creation of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Vire and Taute Canal|fr|3=Canal de Vire et Taute}} in 1833 allowed the establishment of the connection between [[Carentan]] and Saint-L\u00f4. Then, by order of 10 July 1835, the Vire was classified as navigable. Baron [[Alfred Mosselman]] built a port at Saint-L\u00f4 in recruiting nearly 250 military detainees and Spanish prisoners. A boatyard was created and traffic flowed at 50 tons in 1841 to more than 132 in 1846. {{Interlanguage link multi|Mosselman Family|fr|3=Famille Mosselman|lt=Mosselman}} then launched barges and introduced horse traction by arranging the towpaths of the waterway. Several goods were transported but mainly the {{Interlanguage link multi|Tangue (rock)|fr|3=Tangue (roche)|lt=tangue}} and the [[Lime (material)|lime]] from the quarries of [[Pont-H\u00e9bert]] and [[Cavigny]]. It thus passed from 1,233 tonnes of lime production in 1841 to 30,000 in 1858. In 1867, the paper mill of Valvire<ref group=Note>[[:File:Papeterie de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|Information board]] arranged in front of the chimney.</ref> was built near the spillway and manufactured packing paper. It was destroyed by fire in 1930 and little remains beyond the chimney of the plant.\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 ruled out the [[Mantes-la-Jolie\u2013Cherbourg railway]] because its inhabitants, having fear of industrial progress, refused a path linking them to Paris. It would be attached to the rail network in 1860. In the 19th century, Saint-L\u00f4, in the heart of a rich farming area, established itself as an important place for trade in animals, but the fear of the rural population towards the industrial revolution was blocking its development. River traffic transit saw 53,000 tonnes of goods, only 6% of which were foodstuffs. A leak was discovered in the canal and the River Vire was decommissioned in 1926. The region experienced a significant rural exodus and suffered casualties of the [[Franco-Prussian War|war of 1870]] and the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Valvire paper mill burned down in the 1930s and would never be rebuilt. The demographics of the department was very negative from 1850. The city covered [[World War II]] in a declining situation.\n\nIn 1914 and 1915, Saint-L\u00f4 welcomed the temporary hospital No. 2 of the 10th Army Corps.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe criminal case of Jean Philippe took place in Saint-L\u00f4, and was then judged by the Court of Assizes of Manche, at Coutances on 9 December 1940.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|last=Miniac|title=Les Nouvelles Affaires criminelles de la Manche|publisher=de Bor\u00e9e|location=Paris, France|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Remparts de Saint-L\u00f4 (grotte).jpg|thumb|right|The underground entrance to the ramparts.]]\n\nFrance was invaded in 1940 and the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]], commanded by [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]], entered [[Normandy]].

In March 1943, the Germans decide to dig a tunnel under the rock. For the time being, no one is able to say what the usefulness of this tunnel would have been, though it was dug at the same time as the Agneaux Institute. Workers from the [[Service du travail obligatoire|STO]] would be required until the beginning of the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]].

This time the city was bombed by the Germans. As a main transport center, the city was a nexus of military activity starting [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]] and on to the breakout from Normandy, [[Operation Cobra]]. As a result of air and ground attacks, Saint-L\u00f4 was almost totally destroyed (90-95% according to common estimates). The city was dubbed \"[[The Capital of the Ruins]]\" by [[Samuel Beckett]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Le Reveil|issue=137}}</ref> Saint-L\u00f4 was one of the key cities to the opening of the [[Falaise Pocket|Falaise Gap]], which ultimately allowed Allied forces to expel the Germans from northern France.\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 received the {{Interlanguage link multi|List of towns decorated with the Legion of honour|fr|3=Liste des villes d\u00e9cor\u00e9es de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur|lt=Legion of Honour}} and the [[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)|Croix de Guerre 1939-1945]] on 2 June 1948 with a citation for \"capital of the Manche Department which has retained full confidence in the destiny of the country.

The two communes, now absorbed from Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-L\u00f4 and Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-L\u00f4, were also decorated with the Croix de Guerre 1939-1945 on 11 November 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://memorialdormans.free.fr/CommunesCroixDeGuerre39-45.pdf|title=Communes d\u00e9cor\u00e9es de la croix de guerre 1939-1945|language=fr|trans-title=Communes decorated with the Croix de Guerre 1939-1945|work=M\u00e9morial Dormans|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar period===\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 - Ancienne affiche Capitales des Ruines.JPG|thumb|right|Saint-L\u00f4, Capital of ruins]]\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 - Porte de la prison.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the former prison]]\n\nAfter the war the question arose as to whether the town should be rebuilt or left with its ruins intact as a testimony to the bombing.

It was the reason which compelled the prefect of the ruins {{Interlanguage link multi|\u00c9douard Lebas|fr}} to settle in Coutances. This ''Capital of Ruins'' was revived by [[Samuel Beckett]] in his text ''The Capital of Ruins'' of 10 June 1946, which he wrote for [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|Raidi\u00f3 \u00c9ireann]], proving how much it remained marked by what he had seen and done in Saint-L\u00f4.<ref>Knowlson James, ''Beckett'', Paris : Solin, Actes Sud, 1999, trad : Bonis Oristelle, p. 451 and 969</ref> The Notre-Dame church located on the ramparts still bears the scars of bombing and bloody clashes which took place. The population timidly returned to the city. There were 180 people on 12 August 1944, but U.S. authorities decided not to issue authorisation of residence and supplied tickets. A lengthy clean-up began, including the corpses of residents and soldiers, which lasted until 15 October 1944. However, officials hesitated to rebuild Saint-L\u00f4. Indeed, some were willing to leave the ruins as a testament to the martyrdom of the city and later rebuild a new Saint-L\u00f4. The population declined, preferring to reinhabit its city.\n\n[[File:Baraques de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|left|Many traces of wooden barracks remain.]]\n\nIn April 1945, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Reconstruction in France after World War II|fr|3=Reconstruction en France apr\u00e8s la Seconde Guerre mondiale|lt=Reconstruction}} Minister [[Raoul Dautry]] advocated a provisional wooden barracks building. These huts are built through the generosity of the donations. Thus, the association of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Swiss donation for war victims|fr|3=Don suisse pour les victimes de la guerre|lt=Swiss grant}} unblocked an appropriation of 620,000 [[Swiss franc]]s to build homes and a community centre. On 10 October 1949, [[Switzerland]] offered a gold ingot to the city which yielded 649,490 francs. There were ten housing estates in 1948, some which contained over 70 houses. The barracks were delivered in kit form, and it was enough to build them on the spot. Each had different specifics according to their place of origin (Swedish, Finnish, Swiss, French, American, Canadian). The Irish [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|Red Cross]] participated in the construction of a hospital consisting of 25 buildings (located level with the Pasteur college) and landed 174 tons of equipment. The hospital was inaugurated on Sunday, 7 April 1946 and the Irish medical team left Saint-L\u00f4 at the beginning of January 1947. This hospital, consisting of wooden shacks, operated until 1956.\n\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 (premi\u00e8re pierre).jpg|thumb|right|The first stone of the reconstruction]]\n\nBy 1948, a more permanent Saint-L\u00f4 had to be rebuilt. This would be done on the basis of plans designed by the Chief Architect of the reconstruction Andr\u00e9 Hilt (died 1946), which had proposed to retain the general fabric of the town by adapting it to modern needs. President [[Vincent Auriol]] laid the first stone just four years after landing.\n\n[[File:Hopital memorial.jpg|thumb|right|The France - United States Memorial Hospital]]\n\nAs partial reparation for the destruction of the city, the Americans, behind the bombing, decided to build a modern hospital.

It is located on the ''Route de [[Villedieu-les-Po\u00eales|Villedieu]]''. Work began in 1949, and it was completed on 10 May 1956. A monumental [[mosaic]] was made by [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], which pays tribute to peace and Franco-American friendship: Both hands towards the Cotentin Peninsula symbolised with an apple tree branch in bloom. It was at that time the largest hospital in Europe. On 29 November 1949, the journalist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pottecher]] submitted a hypothesis to not move the prefecture of Manche from Saint-L\u00f4. Although, during the reconstruction, it was temporarily placed in Coutances. The whole of the population reacted and a petition collected more than 2,400 signatures: in the journal ''le R\u00e9veil'', an article quotes:\n\n{{quote|text=So come back to Saint-L\u00f4, Sir! Not for burial, but to see the prefecture, the building sites, the plans, the nerve of the victims.

The dominant style was a neo-regionalist functionalism which was dominated by concrete. Its dated and monotonous character was soon criticised. If this choice, dictated by the circumstances and the immediate problems of the housing of Saint-L\u00f4, leaves regrets today, it makes Saint-L\u00f4, on a smaller scale than [[Le Havre]] or [[Lorient]], one of the most striking testimonies of the reconstruction period. A few streets contain vestiges of the old Saint-L\u00f4: some houses on the ''Rue du Neufbourg'', ''Rue Croix-Canuet'' and ''Falourdel'', ''Rue Saint-Georges'' and ''Porte au Four''. This last street houses the last medieval way of Saint-L\u00f4. In 1964, Saint-L\u00f4 absorbed two neighbouring communes, Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-L\u00f4 (660 inhabitants in 1962,<ref name=\"ehess-scdsl\">{{cite web|url= http://cassini.ehess.fr/cassini/fr/html/fiche.php?select_resultat=31322 |title=Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-L\u00f4}}</ref> to the east of the territory) and Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-L\u00f4 (306 inhabitants<ref name=\"ehess-stdsl\">{{cite web|url= http://cassini.ehess.fr/cassini/fr/html/fiche.php?select_resultat=34828 |title=Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-L\u00f4}}</ref> to the south). The town benefitted from the economic growth of the [[Trente Glorieuses]] and the population grew by 30% between 1968 and 1975. It built neighbourhoods of buildings in the Valley of the Doll\u00e9e and Val Saint-Jean. The theatre, meanwhile, was inaugurated in 1963.\n\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau d'eau de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|right|The Des Ronchettes water tower]]\n\nThe square of the town hall was completely redeveloped in the 1990s. The city organised a large demonstration on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Normandy landings. The edges of the Vire were reconfigured with the rehabilitation of the towpath and the creation of a green beach, at the ''Place du Quai-\u00e0-Tangue''. A [[scow]] was rebuilt and crossed the river, in order to remember former river traffic. In 2004, the rural area of Bois-Jugan was urbanised, with the creation of housing within a framework of preservation of green spaces and a large aquatic centre. Later, the Des Ronchettes [[water tower]] was built following an unusual method for the time, since the tank (strongly resembling a [[flying saucer]]) was built at the ground level, then raised by a system of jacks, as the rings composing its body were manufactured. As such, its elevation allows a mounting point for [[telecommunication]] (mobile phone, [[WiMAX]], and FM radio) networks.\n\n==Politics and administration==\n\n===List of mayors===\n\n====During the Revolution====\nFor the [[French Revolution|revolutionary period]], the destruction of most of the archives does not allow a definitive result.\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of mayors of Saint-L\u00f4, 1784-1799\n!

There are many jobs in administration related to its status of prefecture. Its location in the heart of the bocage allows it to sustain services connected historically with agriculture: It may be noted the presence of one of the seats of the {{Interlanguage link multi|List of regional funds of Cr\u00e9dit agricole|fr|3=Liste des caisses r\u00e9gionales de Cr\u00e9dit agricole|lt=Cr\u00e9dit agricole of Normandy}}, whose closure was announced in June 2010, but also the insurer [[Groupama]], clearly visible from the Major Howie roundabout, and {{Interlanguage link multi|Mutualit\u00e9 sociale agricole|fr}}. Finally, many businesses have developed along the ring road.\n\n===Agriculture and agro-food hub===\nThe city hosts activities associated with the rearing of [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s. Each week, a calf market took place in the market installed until 30 December 2008 near Les Ronchettes. From January 2009, it was removed and attached to the calf market at [[Torigni-sur-Vire]]. The city also has the Livestock Promotion Centre, located next to the stud farm, which hosts the equestrian competition of the Normandy horse show, each year in August. The agri-food cluster has developed since 1990 with the aim of hosting companies in this sector, several public or parapublic bodies are installed:\n\n*Adria normandie: technical advice centre for agro-processing.\n*The agri-food nursery.\n*Lilano: ''Laboratoire interprofessionnel laitier de Normandie'' [Inter-professional dairy laboratory of Normandy].\n*The Centre of agri-food formation of Saint-L\u00f4, an extension of the Th\u00e8re Farming School located at [[Le Hommet-d'Arthenay]].\n*Ardefa: ''Association r\u00e9gionale pour le d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019emploi et des formations dans les industries alimentaires'' [Regional Association for the development of employment and training in the food industries.]\n*Workshop of agri-food rotation.\n*The agri-food park of [[Saint-Georges-Montcocq]] / [[Le Mesnil-Rouxelin]] on which the master dairies are established; through lack of implementation, much remains undeveloped.\n\nIn 2008, the only success in the agri-food field was the success of the France Kebab enterprise,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamanchelibre.fr/actualite-9045-france-kebab-mise-tout-sur-les-nouveaux-gouts.html|date=2009|title=France Kebab mise tout sur les nouveaux go\u00fbts|language=fr|trans-title=France Kebab is all about new tastes|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref> which had won many prizes in 2007.\n\n===Media===\n[[File:Facade tendance ouest.JPG|thumb|right|The studio of Tendance Ouest.]]\n\nSeveral regional media are disseminated in Saint-L\u00f4 and have an office.\n\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|La Manche libre|fr|3=La Manche libre|lt=''La Manche libre''}} (weekly newspaper), headquarters\n*''[[Ouest-France]]'' (daily press), departmental daily\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|La Presse de la Manche|fr|3=La Presse de la Manche|lt=''La Presse de la Manche''}} (daily press)\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|Tendance Ouest|fr}}, formerly Radio Manche (radio)\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|France Bleu Cotentin|fr}} (radio)\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 - Coll\u00e8ge Louis Pasteur (2).jpg|thumb|Louis-Pasteur College]]\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 - \u00c9cole Raymond Brul\u00e9.JPG|thumb|Raymond-Brul\u00e9 School]]\n\nThe city of Saint-L\u00f4 falls within the {{Interlanguage link multi|Academy of Caen (education)|fr|3=Acad\u00e9mie de Caen (\u00e9ducation)|lt=Academy of Caen}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ac-caen.fr/orientation-insertion_209_centre-d-information-et-d-orientation-de-saint-lo.html|title=Centre d'information et d'orientation de Saint L\u00f4|language=fr|trans-title=Centre of information and orientation of Saint L\u00f4}}</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

It is located in the ''Enclos'' surrounded by ramparts and was listed on the register of [[Monument historique|historic monuments]] in 1840.

If the stained-glass windows were saved, after being always present since temporary removal during the war, the [[nave]] was gutted following the collapse of the North Tower which was shelled by German artillery. Its roof and fa\u00e7ade were destroyed, as well as the top of the other tower. Instead of rebuilding the church identically, the architect of Historic Monuments decided to build a [[greenschist]] frontage to highlight the scar left by the war. The statue of ''Notre-Dame du Pilier'' is from 1467; having been destroyed and remade several times, it is now housed on a column in the [[apse]] chapel.\n\n====Church of Sainte-Croix====\n\nThe {{Interlanguage link multi|Church of Sainte-Croix of Saint-L\u00f4|fr|3=\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix de Saint-L\u00f4|lt=abbey church of ''Sainte-Croix''}} is, according to the tradition, the heir of a chapel built here by St. Helena in the 4th century and of an abbey founded by Charlemagne. More documented is the creation of an [[Augustinian]] abbey by the bishop of [[Coutances]] in 1132. The Romanesque church was consecrated in 1202, being largely remade in the following centuries with successive renovations. The choir was remade in the 16th century while the bell tower is from 1860\u20131863. During [[World War II]], the bell tower (located laterally) collapsed and it was on its ruins where the body of [[Thomas D. Howie|Major Howie]] was placed; a new bell tower was rebuilt in 1957 on the forecourt in a modern style. On the church square stands the departmental monument in memory of the victims of the wars of [[Algerian War|Algeria]] and [[First Indochina War|Indochina]], opened in 2005.\n\n====Cemetery of Saint-L\u00f4====\nThe cemetery of Saint-L\u00f4 is located between the Saint-Croix Church and the national stud, on the ''Route de Lison''. The cemetery is much marked by the Second World War with the plot of the civilian victims of the bombing of 1944, also the mausoleum of the Blanchet family, and Major Glover S. Johns Junior who installed the first command post before releasing the city. One can still find the tomb of the {{Interlanguage link multi|List of the generals of the French Revolution and the First Empire|fr|3=Liste des g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la R\u00e9volution et du Premier Empire|lt=French revolutionary general}} [[Luc Sim\u00e9on Auguste Dagobert|Dagobert]]. Also note the weeping statue which has traces of shrapnel, a bronze sculpture of Cabet, who was a student of F. Rude.\n\n====Other buildings====\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 - Temple protestant.JPG|thumb|right|The Protestant temple]]\n\nThe parish of Saint-L\u00f4 has other [[Catholicism|Catholic]] buildings:\n\n*Church of Saint Jean-Eudes located in Val Saint-Jean\n*The chapel of the Memorial Hospital\n*The chapel of the Saint Jean clinic\n*The chapel of the Bon-Sauveur psychiatric hospital\n*The John XXIII Chapel in the Doll\u00e9e quarter\n\nThe city also has a temple of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Reformed Church of France]]. It was built by architect Verrey with the glazing of Max Ingrand and was inaugurated on 23 October 1955.\n\n===Historical civil heritage===\nSeveral sites are registered as historic monuments:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/inventai/patrimoine/|title=Pr\u00e9sentation des bases Architecture et Patrimoine|language=fr|trans-title=Presentation of the Architecture and Heritage databases|work=Ministry of Culture|accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n*The Madeleine Chapel.\n*The Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle, registered on 11 July 1975.\n*Notre-Dame church, recorded in 1840, contains ten objects registered in respect of objects classified as historical monuments.\n*The Sainte-Croix church.\n*The National Stud and its park, registered on 18 February 1993.\n*The wards and the lobby of the {{Interlanguage link multi|France-United States Memorial Hospital|fr|3=Centre hospitalier m\u00e9morial France - \u00c9tats-Unis}}.\n*The Manor of Bosdel, constructed between the 16th and 18th centuries, registered as an [[Monument historique|historic monument]] on 1 April 1946.\n*The remains of the walls recorded on 12 December 1945 but the ''Rue de la poterne'' and the ''Place des Beaux-Regards'' had been registered as early as 22 October 1937.\n\nThe Maison-Dieu [House of God] (not to be confused with the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu]]) located opposite the church and built in the second half of the 15th century was razed during the bombings of 1944. This bourgeois construction presented a half-timbered fa\u00e7ade with corbels and sculptures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saint-lo.maville.com/actu/actudet_-Une-visite-de-Saint-Lo-avec-un-guide-d-avant-guerre-_loc-1039351_actu.Htm|title=Une visite de Saint-L\u00f4 avec un guide d'avant-guerre|language=fr|trans-title=A visit to Saint- L\u00f4 with a prewar guide|work=Ouest-France|accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref> Another House, called ''Poids Royal'', located in the quad at 11 ''Rue Thiers'' in the ''Enclos'' had been included in historical monuments on 3 October 1929,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00110584|title=Monuments historiques|accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref> it was also destroyed.\n\n====Ramparts====\n[[File:Remparts de Saint-L\u00f4 (Tour Beaux-Regards).jpg|thumb|right|Ramparts of Saint-L\u00f4 and the Beaux-Regards Tower.]]\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 also has remains of its medieval line of walls. Ramparts still exist on three of the four sides of the ''Enclos''. The remains include: ''Tour des Beaux-Regards'' (\"Tower of Beautiful Glances\"), commanding the steepest part of the spur of the town, and the ''Tour de la Poudri\u00e8re'' (\"Tower of the Gunpowder Store\"), an impressive military relic of the old citadel, are the two most notable elements of the ramparts. On the south side, the wartime disaster of 1944 had the paradoxical effect of clearing the base, where houses had grown around the ''Rue du Torteron''.\n\n====National Stud====\n[[File:Haras de Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Haras National'' of Saint-L\u00f4.]]\n\n{{main|{{Interlanguage link multi|Haras National of Saint-L\u00f4|fr|3=Haras national de Saint-L\u00f4}}}}\n\nSaint-L\u00f4 is home to the largest of the 23 national stud farms in France. In 1806, [[Napoleon]] provided Saint-L\u00f4 with a deposit of stallions by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Haras under the First Empire|fr|3=Haras sous le Premier Empire|lt=Imperial Decree of 4 July 1806}}.<ref name=haras-nationaux>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifce.fr/haras-nationaux/nos-sites/haras-national-de-saint-lo/|title=Haras national de Saint L\u00f4|language=fr|trans-title=Haras National of Saint-L\u00f4|work=Haras nationaux}}</ref> From its origin, the deposit was installed on buildings and abandoned land of the old Abbey of Sainte-Croix ({{convert|3|ha|acre|abbr=on}} first leased and then owned from 22 September 1807). The stud then recruited from the breeding of the [[Haras national du Pin|Haras du Pin]].<ref name=haras-nationaux/>\n\nIn 1826, the military remount depot moved premises which the stud had given to it; most stallions were taken from the stud to provide cavalry. On 28 May 1874, the Boscher Law enabled supervision of the allocations of the regiments and allowed to provide the stud with over 230 horses. On 28 June 1881, the municipal council decided to transfer the stud to adjoin the ''Route de Bayeux''. Thus, the current stud farm buildings date from 1884 (the first stone was laid on 11 June 1884), and the transfer was finished three years later. During World War I, five mares out of six were requisitioned, but no stallions. [[Groom (profession)|Grooms]] fought at the front, and German prisoners dug a pond. In 1939, the old stable housed the staff of the Haras de [[Strasbourg]] (40 stallions and staff) at the time of the German breakthrough. Then, in 1944, fifty horses were killed by the bombing and other stallions were stolen by German soldiers in flight.<ref>{{citation|title=Le haras national de Saint-L\u00f4, l'univers d'un patrimoine normand|language=fr|trans-title=The National Stud of Saint-L\u00f4, the universe of a Norman heritage|year=1996}}</ref> The old stud was destroyed and claimed by the city. Thus, there only remains the street of the same name and the Normandy building which was previously the former riding school. The new stud was then built. [[Charles de Gaulle|General de Gaulle]] offered to the Sultan of Morocco ''Bois de Rose'', a [[thoroughbred]] which had been stationed at the stud for two years. The stud then grew gradually in the field of reproduction, by investing in an [[artificial insemination]] centre, a centre for the freezing of semen and an [[embryo transfer]] unit. Thus, the electoral district of Saint-L\u00f4 has the highest density of breeding deposits of France.\n\n====Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle====\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle.jpg|thumb|right|Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle]]\n\nLocated on the bank of the Vire, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle|fr}} belongs to the Saint-Lois descendants of the 17th century diarist Luc Duchemin. The Sainte-Pernelle Chapel is the work of a Lord of the Vaucelle Jean Boucart, confessor of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] and founder of the parish library of Saint-L\u00f4, which was at the time the second library of Normandy by importance. Three kings resided at the Vaucelle: [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1346, at the beginning of the [[Hundred Years' War]] the king found that it was not a safe city, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] during his visit in 1532 and [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]]. The dovecote and the northern wall niche are listed as protected elements.\n\n===Museums===\n\n====Museum of Fine Arts====\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Saint-L\u00f4 - Rotonde des tapisseries des amours de Gombaut et Mac\u00e9.JPG|thumb|right|Rotunda of the tapestries of the Amours de Gombault et Mac\u00e9e.]]\n\n{{main|{{Interlanguage link multi|Museum of Fine Arts of Saint-L\u00f4|fr|3=Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Saint-L\u00f4}}}}\n\nBuilt by the architect Eug\u00e8ne Leseney, the Jean-Lur\u00e7at Cultural Centre is situated on the ''Place du Champ-de-Mars'', opposite the Sainte-Croix Church.

Is also exposed the tapestries of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Amours de Gombault et Mac\u00e9e|fr}} (16th century), composed of eight tapestries from the [[Bruges]] workshops<ref>{{citation|id=Plaquette informative|title=Les Amis des Mus\u00e9es et la ville de Saint-L\u00f4|language=fr|trans-title=The friends of the museums and the city of Saint-L\u00f4|year=2006|work=Office du tourisme de Saint-L\u00f4}}</ref> including a draft with the theme of the ''[[Lai d'Aristote]]''.\n\n====Museum of the Norman Bocage====\n{{main|{{Interlanguage link multi|Museum of the Norman Bocage|fr|3=Mus\u00e9e du bocage normand}}}}\n\nBoisjugan farm is a farmhouse from the 17th century which was in use until 1970. Converted into a museum, it traces the history and ethnography of agriculture in the Norman bocage since the 18th century with agricultural practices, horse and cattle breeding. Typical sites are reconstructed (workshop, stable, barn and creamery).<ref>{{citation|id=Informative leaflet|title=Mus\u00e9e du Bocage Normand ; red\u00e9couvrez le bocage|language=fr|trans-title=Museum of the Bocage Normand; rediscover the bocage|year=2006|work=Office du tourisme de Saint-L\u00f4}}</ref>\n\n====Chapel of Madeleine====\n[[File:Chapelle de la Madeleine de Saint-L\u00f4, 2013.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial of La Madeleine and the chapel]]\n\nThe {{Interlanguage link multi|Chapelle de la Madeleine of Saint-L\u00f4|fr|3=Chapelle de la Madeleine de Saint-L\u00f4|lt=Chapelle de la Madeleine}} is located right next to the national stud, on the road to Bayeux. It is a relic of a former [[Leper colony|leprosarium]] from the 14th century. It was classified as an historical monument on 3 August 1974 and was restored between 1988 and 1994. A memorial was inaugurated in May 1995 in honour of the soldiers of the 29th and 35th divisions who liberated Saint-L\u00f4 in 1944. Photos, commemorative plaques, tables and flags are on display.<ref>{{citation|id=Plaquette informative|title=Itin\u00e9raire de la Lib\u00e9ration, 15 sites \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir|language=fr|trans-title=Route of the Liberation, 15 sites to discover|year=2006|work=Office du tourisme de Saint-L\u00f4}}</ref>\n\n===Other notable places===\nA memorial in the city honours [[Thomas D. Howie|Major Thomas Howie]], Commander of the 3d Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army's 29th Division; the unit that liberated the city on 18 July 1944. Howie was killed just before his unit entered the city and was so highly respected that his men placed his flag-draped body on the hood of a jeep at the front of the column so he could be the first American to enter the city. He became famous as the \"Major of Saint-L\u00f4\".\n\n===Place de la Mairie===\n[[File:La laiti\u00e8re \u00e0 Saint-L\u00f4.jpg|thumb|right|''La Laiti\u00e8re normande'' [The Norman dairywoman], of Arthur Le Duc.]]\n\nRedesigned in 1990, the city square is all black asphalt lit by spotlights on the ground.

A few years later, the bronze arrived in Saint-L\u00f4. It is set on a round plinth, surrounded by a basin, on the ''Place des Beaux-Regards'' in front of the Notre-Dame church. She moved a little further when the [[Poilu]] of the [[World War I|Great War]] was installed. It was then unbolted and melted on 8 February 1942, by the Germans, to recover the bronze for the arms industry. In January 1984, Andr\u00e9 Leplanquais, a merchant of Saint-L\u00f4, wanted to create a replica of this statue. A fundraiser gained significant donations from residents. Once the money was together, the sculptor {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis Derbr\u00e9|fr}}, the famous sculptor of [[Ern\u00e9e]], fashioned a new statue based on the original plans. Moved several times, one can find it near stairs of the square. The base and the granite basin are the original.\n\n[[File:Statue de la laiti\u00e8re normande.jpg|thumb|right|''La Laiti\u00e8re normande'' of Louis Derbr\u00e9, from after Arthur Le Duc.]]\n\nThe Havin fountain<ref>{{cite web|url=http://e-monumen.net/patrimoine-monumental/monument-a-havin-ou-la-presse-guide-lenfance-a-la-verite-saint-lo/|title=Monument \u00e0 Havin, ou La Presse guide l'Enfance \u00e0 la V\u00e9rit\u00e9|language=fr|trans-title=Monument to Havin, or La Presse guide Children to the Truth|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref> also created by Arthur Le Duc in 1887<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/arcade_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=AR502239|title=Notice no AR502239|work=Base Arcade|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref> was located near the Museum of Saint-L\u00f4; its statue was also melted by the Germans, however no replica has been created. Nearby is the prison entrance, a remnant of the bombing in 1944. An urn containing the ashes of deportees is placed at the foot of it. A memorial in honour of the victims of Nazi repression, it became the departmental monument to the [[French Resistance|Resistance]]. The [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] can also be observed from the square, which seems to spring from the heart of the city. Built in 1954, it was once used to dry the hoses of firefighters. Renovated several times since 1990, it is the symbol of the reconstruction of the city. At the top are a weathervane in the shape of Unicorn and a viewpoint, from which one can admire the entire region. Previously open to the public by the tourist office, its access is now forbidden.\n\n===The Caisse d'\u00c9pargne squirrel===\nA granite statue representing a squirrel can be seen in Saint-L\u00f4, which is the logo of the [[Groupe Caisse d'\u00c9pargne|Caisse d'\u00c9pargne]] banking group; It is located in the ''Rue Saint-Thomas''. What may seem incongruous, it is that there's no bank of this group nearby. However, the bank did have a branch in front, but it was moved in the 1990s. Then arose the question of whether or not to keep the statue for advertising purposes. The people of Saint-L\u00f4 had become attached to the squirrel, and it was finally decided to leave it in place.\n\n==Quarters==\n[[File:Saint-L\u00f4 - Val Saint-Jean - d\u00e9molition d'immeuble.jpg|thumb|right|Quarter of Val Saint-Jean during restructuring (March 2010).]]\n\nThe town of Saint-L\u00f4 consists of a number of [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarter]]s:\n\n*The Val Saint-Jean, composed mainly of buildings and apartment towers.\n*The Aurore, composed mostly of single family homes and social housing. One can discover, the ''Rue des Sycamores'' open school of Aurore.

The view is breathtaking on the Vire and ''Rue Torteron''.\n*The ''Plage Verte'' [Green Beach]: A green space created in 2001 on part of the old tangue wharf in the vicinity of the River Vire, between the ramparts and the railway station. The modern Henri Li\u00e9bard footbridge connects the two banks of the river roughly at the location of the former which had been destroyed during the bombing of June 1944. It is also the setting of the festival of the Vire which is held annually during the last weekend of June. It also allows access to the piers for [[boat tour]]s.\n*The islands of the river Vire: Lebroussois island and M\u00f6selman Island are separated by the weir. An arboretum has been planted at the foot of the brick chimney, only remnant of the paper mill which was burned in the 1930s.\n*The towpath: Between the station and the Rocreuil bridge, many Saint-L\u00f4 people walk, do their jogging and cycling there. One can see the Ch\u00e2teau de la Vaucelle.\n*The Valley of the Doll\u00e9e: At the foot of the ''Route de [[Lison]]'', there is a [[mill race]] and a [[watermill]] and a fitness trail. It is also part of the festival of ''\"h\u00e9t\u00e9roclites\"''.\n*The Boisjugan Urban Park: A green area linking the new subdivisions, which border it, and the old farmland property of the city which borders the south ring road.
