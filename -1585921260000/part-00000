The TIEA was intended to move beyond traditional [[market access]] issues, to include areas such as trade and investment facilitation, competition, mutual recognition of professional qualifications, financial services, e-commerce, temporary entry, small- and medium-sized enterprises, [[sustainable development]], and sharing science and technology.\nThe TIEA was also to build on a Canada-EU regulatory co-operation framework for promoting bilateral co-operation on approaches to regulatory governance, advancing good regulatory practices and facilitating trade and investment. In addition to lowering barriers, the TIEA was meant to heighten Canadian and European interest in each other's markets.<ref name=\"TIEA\"/> The TIEA continued until 2006 when Canada and the EU decided to pause negotiations.

The TIEA was intended to move beyond traditional [[market access]] issues, to include areas such as trade and investment facilitation, competition, mutual recognition of professional qualifications, financial services, e-commerce, temporary entry, small- and medium-sized enterprises, [[sustainable development]], and sharing science and technology.\nThe TIEA was also to build on a Canada-EU regulatory co-operation framework for promoting bilateral co-operation on approaches to regulatory governance, advancing good regulatory practices and facilitating trade and investment. In addition to lowering barriers, the TIEA was meant to heighten Canadian and European interest in each other's markets.<ref name=\"TIEA\"/> The TIEA continued until 2006 when Canada and the EU decided to pause negotiations.

He was known especially for his war poetry, but also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic.

He was known especially for his war poetry, but also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

award.\n\nIn 2012 Attenborough was portrayed by [[Simon Callow]] in the [[BBC Four]] biopic ''The Best Possible Taste'', about [[Kenny Everett]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of oldest and youngest

Attenborough is portrayed by [[Eric Idle]] as effusive and simpering. A portrayal similar to that seen in Monty Python can be seen in the early series of ''[[Spitting Image]]'', when Attenborough's caricature would regularly appear to thank others for an imaginary award.\n\nIn 2012 Attenborough was portrayed by [[Simon Callow]] in the [[BBC Four]] biopic ''The Best Possible Taste'', about [[Kenny Everett]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of oldest and youngest

He was a [[Welsh Labour]] MP for nearly 30 years, noted for promoting [[private member's bill]]s to decriminalise male [[homosexuality|homosexual relations]] and liberalise the [[divorce]] laws. During his parliamentary career, Abse introduced more private member's bills than any other parliamentarian in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Guardian obit\" /> After his retirement from Parliament he wrote several books about politics, based on his interest in [[psychoanalysis]].\n\n==Family and background==\nLeo Abse was one of the sons of Rudolf Abse, a [[Jews|Jewish]] solicitor and cinema owner who lived in [[Cardiff]]. His maternal grandfather, Tobias, had emigrated to Wales from [[Siemiatycze]], a Polish town then located within the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"Guardian obit\" /> His grandmother came from Germany. Abse's younger brother [[Dannie Abse]] (1923\u20132014) was a poet, and his older brother [[Wilfred Abse]] (1915\u20132005) a psychoanalyst. He also had a sister, Hulda.<ref name=\"Guardian obit\" /> Abse attended [[Howard Gardens High School]] in Cardiff and then the [[London School of Economics]], where he studied law. Having joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1934, he clandestinely visited [[Spain]] during the closing months of the [[Spanish Civil War]], in 1939.<ref name=\"Times obit\" />\n\nAbse married Marjorie Davies in 1955. They had two children: [[Tobias Abse|Tobias]] (now a [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian) and Bathsheba. Marjorie died in 1996. His second marriage was to Ania Czepulkowska, in 2000, when Abse was 83 and Czepulkowska 33. Abse died on 19 August 2008. According to a newspaper report, he left his \u00a31.2m estate to his second wife, with no financial provision for his children or grandchildren.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1289930/Family-s-fury-Labour-MP-leaves-1m-Polish-wife.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |location=London |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |work=[[Mail Online]] |first1=George |last1=Arbuthnott |first2=Jonathan |last2=Petre |title=Family's fury as Labour MP leaves \u00a31m to Polish wife |date=26 June 2010 |archivedate=25 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140425033502/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1289930/Family-s-fury-Labour-MP-leaves-1m-Polish-wife.html?ito=feeds-news.xml |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some 10 years after her husband died, Mrs Czepulkowska-Abse broke her silence and spoke to the ''[[South Wales Argus]]'' and paid tribute to her husband.

He was in [[Cairo]] in 1944 when some of the British military personnel stationed there set up a \"[[Forces Parliament]]\" in which they debated the structure of society they wanted to see in the post-war world. Abse's idealistic left-wing views were fully in tune with the majority opinion among the lower ranks at its meetings, but the existence of the \"Parliament\" disturbed the senior officers. When Abse moved a motion supporting [[nationalization]] of the [[Bank of England]] he was arrested and the Forces Parliament was forcibly dissolved.\n\nAfter the end of the war Abse set up in practice as a solicitor in Cardiff. In 1951 he established his own law firm, Leo Abse & Cohen, which eventually grew to be the biggest in the city. He was also elected as Chairman of Cardiff Labour Party for two years from 1951, relinquishing the post when he was elected to Cardiff City Council.<ref>{{cite news |title=Leo Abse |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 August 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2590828/Leo-Abse.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820222718/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2590828/Leo-Abse.html |archivedate=20 August 2008 }}</ref> Abse fought the safe Conservative seat of [[Cardiff North (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff North]] in the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], and was defeated.\n\n==In Parliament==\n[[Granville West, Baron Granville-West|Granville West]], the Labour MP for [[Pontypool (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontypool]] and, like Abse, a solicitor, was awarded one of the first [[life peerage]]s in 1958. Unusually for a town in the South Wales valleys at that time, the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] was not in control of the nomination of West's successor as Labour candidate, since Pontypool was a centre of the railway industry. Abse won the candidature and then won the seat at the [[1958 Pontypool by-election|by-election]].\n\nIn the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Abse swiftly acquired a reputation for independence of spirit. He made a point of dressing flamboyantly on Budget day, and liked to drop references from [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychotherapy]] into his speeches. Although his abilities might have taken him to high office, Abse remained a backbench MP. This factor, together with the fact that he had a safe seat, freed him from the restrictions that prevented most other MPs from taking up controversial subjects.\n\nIn 1963, Abse was selected in third place in the ballot for [[Private Member's Bill]]s and introduced the [[Matrimonial Causes Bill]], which simplified and made easier the legal process of [[divorce]].\n\nIn 1957 the [[Wolfenden Report]] had recommended that the law be changed to decriminalise consenting male [[homosexuality|homosexual]] sex, but the government had taken no action. Abse began to promote [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|a Bill]] to put Wolfenden's recommendations into law in February 1962. He kept pressing the issue and, after [[Humphry Berkeley]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancaster]]) lost his seat in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]], Abse became the main sponsor for the legalisation. Although with the Labour landslide of 1966 there was a majority for the bill, it was still vulnerable but Abse persuaded [[Roy Jenkins]] to give the measure government time, which eventually saw the bill through onto the statute book.<ref>{{cite news |author=Patricia Brent and Leo Abse |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12005.shtml |title=Why should homosexuality be decriminalised? |date=20 December 1966 |publisher=[[BBC Archives]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818134241/http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12005.shtml |archivedate=18 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 he was appointed to a [[Home Office]] advisory committee on the penal system. He was elected Chairman of the group of Welsh Labour MPs in 1971.\n\nIn 1973, Abse requested that the government ban the rock singer [[Alice Cooper]] and his group from performing in England, stating that Cooper was \"peddling the culture of the [[concentration camp]]\". Abse said: \"Pop is one thing, anthems of [[necrophilia]] are quite another\".<ref>Source: booklet of \"The life and crimes of [[Alice Cooper]]\" 4 CD box set.</ref>\n\nAbse was chosen as chairman of a [[select committee]] on [[abortion]] from 1975 to 1977. His report advocated restrictions on abortion, including a lowering of the time limit within which abortion was legal from 28 weeks. He fought in the House of Commons for the enactment of his committee's recommendations, and continued the fight in 1980 when the Conservative MP [[John Corrie]] proposed a bill along similar lines: Abse refused to compromise on a limit of 24 weeks.\n\nAbse was an opponent of [[devolution]] when it was proposed in the late 1970s. He also proposed a separate referendum on whether the [[Shetland Islands]] ought to be part of a devolved [[Scotland]]. Abse was briefly chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee when it was first set up, but resigned in November 1981. One of the reasons he opposed devolution was that he thought some in Wales, whom he called \"fanatics\", wanted to use it to promote the use of the [[Welsh language]].\n\nAbse added to his reputation for taking maverick stances by strongly urging that British forces be withdrawn from [[Northern Ireland]]. He opposed [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear weapons]], and criticised [[Margaret Thatcher]] for insisting that [[Argentina]] unconditionally surrender over the [[Falkland Islands]]. He supported British membership of the [[European Union|European Communities]]. His support for liberal divorce laws led him to propose a new 'child-centred' divorce reform in the early 1980s; the bill was piloted by [[Martin Stevens]], Conservative MP for [[Fulham (UK Parliament constituency)|Fulham]].\n\nAbse was elected for the renamed seat of [[Torfaen (UK Parliament constituency)|Torfaen]] in 1983, but retired from Parliament in 1987. His nomination for a seat in the House of Lords was vetoed by Margaret Thatcher.<ref name=\"Guardian obit\">{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Geoffrey|title=Leo Abse |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/21/labour.houseofcommons |website=The Guardian |accessdate=16 June 2017 |date=20 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement and later writings==\nThe first of the books Abse wrote following retirement, ''Margaret, Daughter of Beatrice'' (1989), is a \"psycho-biography\" of Margaret Thatcher, taking its title from the observation that while Mrs Thatcher frequently referred to her father, she claimed not to have had anything to say to her mother from the age of 15.\n\nIn ''Wotan, My Enemy'' (1994) Abse took a psychoanalytic approach to explaining the origin of British hostility to Germany and the idea of the European Union. In ''The Man behind the Smile: Tony Blair and the Politics of Perversion'' (1996), Abse highlighted some of the aspects of [[Tony Blair]] that were later to be cited by Blair's opponents on the left. A revised edition, ''Tony Blair: The Man who Lost His Smile'' (2003), was published in the United States). In this edition Abse took the opportunity to claim that he had paid off a [[blackmail]]er who had been targeting a fellow Welsh MP [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]] (Speaker of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1983), on the basis of Thomas's (closeted) homosexuality.\n\nFinally, in ''Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love'' (1997), Abse drew attention to the fact that fellatio had been unspoken of a generation before but had since come to be seen as an essential part of casual sexual relationships. He analysed the tendency for men to engage in risky behaviour by placing their trust in women whom they barely knew and linked it to political developments.\n\n==Memorial==\nA bust of Abse was unveiled at the [[National Museum of Wales]] in Cardiff on 22 October 2009. The sculpture was funded by the firm of solicitors he founded, Leo Abse and Cohen, and was made by Abse's second cousin, Luke Shepherd.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/8320344.stm |title=Bust of radical MP Abse unveiled |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=22 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025235012/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/8320344.stm |archivedate=25 October 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nAbse was played by actor Anthony O'Donnell in the TV series ''A Very English Scandal''.\n\n==Publications==\n*''Private Member'' (MacDonald, London, 1973)\n*''Margaret, Daughter of Beatrice'' (Jonathan Cape, London, 1989)\n*''Wotan, My Enemy'' (Robson Books, London, 1994)\n*''Tony Blair: The Man behind the Smile'' (Robson Books, London, 1996)\n*''Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love'' (Robson Books, London, 1997)\n*''Tony Blair: The Man who Lost his Smile'' (Robson Books, London, 2003)\n*''The Bi-sexuality of Daniel Defoe: a psychoanalytic survey of the man and his works'' (Karnac Books, London, 2006)\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Leo Abse\" in ''Parliamentary Profiles A\u2013D'' by [[Andrew Roth]] (Parliamentary Profiles Services Ltd, London, 1984)\n*''Peers, Queers and Commons'' by Stephen Jeffery-Poulter (Routledge, London, 1991)\n*''Quest for Justice: Towards Homosexual Emancipation'' by Antony Grey ([[Sinclair-Stevenson]], London, 1992)\n*\"The Troublemakers...\" by Stephen Cretney, in ''The Continuing Evolution of Family Law'', edited by N.

He was in [[Cairo]] in 1944 when some of the British military personnel stationed there set up a \"[[Forces Parliament]]\" in which they debated the structure of society they wanted to see in the post-war world. Abse's idealistic left-wing views were fully in tune with the majority opinion among the lower ranks at its meetings, but the existence of the \"Parliament\" disturbed the senior officers. When Abse moved a motion supporting [[nationalization]] of the [[Bank of England]] he was arrested and the Forces Parliament was forcibly dissolved.\n\nAfter the end of the war Abse set up in practice as a solicitor in Cardiff. In 1951 he established his own law firm, Leo Abse & Cohen, which eventually grew to be the biggest in the city. He was also elected as Chairman of Cardiff Labour Party for two years from 1951, relinquishing the post when he was elected to Cardiff City Council.<ref>{{cite news |title=Leo Abse |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 August 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2590828/Leo-Abse.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820222718/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2590828/Leo-Abse.html |archivedate=20 August 2008 }}</ref> Abse fought the safe Conservative seat of [[Cardiff North (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff North]] in the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], and was defeated.\n\n==In Parliament==\n[[Granville West, Baron Granville-West|Granville West]], the Labour MP for [[Pontypool (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontypool]] and, like Abse, a solicitor, was awarded one of the first [[life peerage]]s in 1958. Unusually for a town in the South Wales valleys at that time, the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] was not in control of the nomination of West's successor as Labour candidate, since Pontypool was a centre of the railway industry. Abse won the candidature and then won the seat at the [[1958 Pontypool by-election|by-election]].\n\nIn the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Abse swiftly acquired a reputation for independence of spirit. He made a point of dressing flamboyantly on Budget day, and liked to drop references from [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychotherapy]] into his speeches. Although his abilities might have taken him to high office, Abse remained a backbench MP. This factor, together with the fact that he had a safe seat, freed him from the restrictions that prevented most other MPs from taking up controversial subjects.\n\nIn 1963, Abse was selected in third place in the ballot for [[Private Member's Bill]]s and introduced the [[Matrimonial Causes Bill]], which simplified and made easier the legal process of [[divorce]].\n\nIn 1957 the [[Wolfenden Report]] had recommended that the law be changed to decriminalise consenting male [[homosexuality|homosexual]] sex, but the government had taken no action. Abse began to promote [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|a Bill]] to put Wolfenden's recommendations into law in February 1962. He kept pressing the issue and, after [[Humphry Berkeley]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancaster]]) lost his seat in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]], Abse became the main sponsor for the legalisation. Although with the Labour landslide of 1966 there was a majority for the bill, it was still vulnerable but Abse persuaded [[Roy Jenkins]] to give the measure government time, which eventually saw the bill through onto the statute book.<ref>{{cite news |author=Patricia Brent and Leo Abse |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12005.shtml |title=Why should homosexuality be decriminalised? |date=20 December 1966 |publisher=[[BBC Archives]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818134241/http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12005.shtml |archivedate=18 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 he was appointed to a [[Home Office]] advisory committee on the penal system. He was elected Chairman of the group of Welsh Labour MPs in 1971.\n\nIn 1973, Abse requested that the government ban the rock singer [[Alice Cooper]] and his group from performing in England, stating that Cooper was \"peddling the culture of the [[concentration camp]]\". Abse said: \"Pop is one thing, anthems of [[necrophilia]] are quite another\".<ref>Source: booklet of \"The life and crimes of [[Alice Cooper]]\" 4 CD box set.</ref>\n\nAbse was chosen as chairman of a [[select committee]] on [[abortion]] from 1975 to 1977. His report advocated restrictions on abortion, including a lowering of the time limit within which abortion was legal from 28 weeks. He fought in the House of Commons for the enactment of his committee's recommendations, and continued the fight in 1980 when the Conservative MP [[John Corrie]] proposed a bill along similar lines: Abse refused to compromise on a limit of 24 weeks.\n\nAbse was an opponent of [[devolution]] when it was proposed in the late 1970s. He also proposed a separate referendum on whether the [[Shetland Islands]] ought to be part of a devolved [[Scotland]]. Abse was briefly chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee when it was first set up, but resigned in November 1981. One of the reasons he opposed devolution was that he thought some in Wales, whom he called \"fanatics\", wanted to use it to promote the use of the [[Welsh language]].\n\nAbse added to his reputation for taking maverick stances by strongly urging that British forces be withdrawn from [[Northern Ireland]]. He opposed [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear weapons]], and criticised [[Margaret Thatcher]] for insisting that [[Argentina]] unconditionally surrender over the [[Falkland Islands]]. He supported British membership of the [[European Union|European Communities]]. His support for liberal divorce laws led him to propose a new 'child-centred' divorce reform in the early 1980s; the bill was piloted by [[Martin Stevens]], Conservative MP for [[Fulham (UK Parliament constituency)|Fulham]].\n\nAbse was elected for the renamed seat of [[Torfaen (UK Parliament constituency)|Torfaen]] in 1983, but retired from Parliament in 1987. His nomination for a seat in the House of Lords was vetoed by Margaret Thatcher.<ref name=\"Guardian obit\">{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Geoffrey|title=Leo Abse |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/21/labour.houseofcommons |website=The Guardian |accessdate=16 June 2017 |date=20 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement and later writings==\nThe first of the books Abse wrote following retirement, ''Margaret, Daughter of Beatrice'' (1989), is a \"psycho-biography\" of Margaret Thatcher, taking its title from the observation that while Mrs Thatcher frequently referred to her father, she claimed not to have had anything to say to her mother from the age of 15.\n\nIn ''Wotan, My Enemy'' (1994) Abse took a psychoanalytic approach to explaining the origin of British hostility to Germany and the idea of the European Union. In ''The Man behind the Smile: Tony Blair and the Politics of Perversion'' (1996), Abse highlighted some of the aspects of [[Tony Blair]] that were later to be cited by Blair's opponents on the left. A revised edition, ''Tony Blair: The Man who Lost His Smile'' (2003), was published in the United States). In this edition Abse took the opportunity to claim that he had paid off a [[blackmail]]er who had been targeting a fellow Welsh MP [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]] (Speaker of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1983), on the basis of Thomas's (closeted) homosexuality.\n\nFinally, in ''Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love'' (1997), Abse drew attention to the fact that fellatio had been unspoken of a generation before but had since come to be seen as an essential part of casual sexual relationships. He analysed the tendency for men to engage in risky behaviour by placing their trust in women whom they barely knew and linked it to political developments.\n\n==Memorial==\nA bust of Abse was unveiled at the [[National Museum of Wales]] in Cardiff on 22 October 2009. The sculpture was funded by the firm of solicitors he founded, Leo Abse and Cohen, and was made by Abse's second cousin, Luke Shepherd.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/8320344.stm |title=Bust of radical MP Abse unveiled |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=22 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025235012/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/8320344.stm |archivedate=25 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nAbse was played by actor Anthony O'Donnell in the TV series ''A Very English Scandal''.\n\n==Publications==\n*''Private Member'' (MacDonald, London, 1973)\n*''Margaret, Daughter of Beatrice'' (Jonathan Cape, London, 1989)\n*''Wotan, My Enemy'' (Robson Books, London, 1994)\n*''Tony Blair: The Man behind the Smile'' (Robson Books, London, 1996)\n*''Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love'' (Robson Books, London, 1997)\n*''Tony Blair: The Man who Lost his Smile'' (Robson Books, London, 2003)\n*''The Bi-sexuality of Daniel Defoe: a psychoanalytic survey of the man and his works'' (Karnac Books, London, 2006)\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Leo Abse\" in ''Parliamentary Profiles A\u2013D'' by [[Andrew Roth]] (Parliamentary Profiles Services Ltd, London, 1984)\n*''Peers, Queers and Commons'' by Stephen Jeffery-Poulter (Routledge, London, 1991)\n*''Quest for Justice: Towards Homosexual Emancipation'' by Antony Grey ([[Sinclair-Stevenson]], London, 1992)\n*\"The Troublemakers...\" by Stephen Cretney, in ''The Continuing Evolution of Family Law'', ed. by N.

From the 14th century onwards, it developed as the provincial town of Vaslui, with a population that fluctuated considerably in the following centuries. The name of Vaslui appears first in a Polish document from 1375, referring to [[Karijotas|Koriat]]'s son [[Yuri Koriatovich]]. The name ''Vaslui'' was also mentioned in 1435, in connection with the accession of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Ilia\u015f of Moldavia|Ilia\u0219]] to the [[Moldavia]]n throne. The town was burned to the ground in 1439 and 1440 when [[Tatars in Romania|Tatars]] invaded Moldavia.\n\n[[File:Cl\u0103dire Vaslui.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Building from the medieval Princely Court historical ensemble in Vaslui]]\n\nThe peak of Vaslui's importance was in the 15th century, when it was a second-rank capital of Moldavia, during the reign of [[Stephen the Great]] (r. 1457-1504) and its population approached that of the neighbouring [[Ia\u0219i]]. In 1475, Prince Stephen won his [[Battle of Vaslui|greatest battle]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the Vaslui area. Once the Moldavian capital was moved from [[Suceava]] to Ia\u0219i and the southern town of [[B\u00e2rlad]] became an administrative center of southern Moldavia, Vaslui declined for the next three centuries to eventually become a local [[borough]] (''[[t\u00e2rg]]'').\n \nThere once was a fairly large [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] community in the city of Vaslui. Its arrival from [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] during the second half of the 19th century gave a new impetus to local economic development. In 1899, Jews formed 37% of the population, and Vaslui was home to the ''[[Vasloi (Hasidic dynasty)|Vasloi]]'' [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] dynasty. However, waves of [[pogrom]]s, associated with the [[Holocaust]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]] and [[Holocaust in Romania]]'') as well as [[Aliyah|emigration]] to [[Israel]] during Romania's [[Communist Romania|communist period]] decimated this population.\n\n[[Romania during World War II|During World War II]], the [[Stephen the Great Monument]] was relocated from [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] to Vaslui. On 22 August 1944, Vaslui was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[2nd Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]].\n\nThe population of Vaslui grew steadily again after 1968, when the town was proclaimed as the administrative center of Vaslui County, with immigration from the neighbouring countryside, attracted by the industries set up by the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]].\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the last census, from 2011, there were 55,407 people living within the city of Vaslui,<ref name=\"census\">{{cite web | url = http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rpl_2011_populatia-pe-categorii-de-localitati.xls | title = Population at 20 October 2011 | date = January 2014 | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | publisher = [[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|INSSE]] | language = Romanian}}</ref> making it the 40th largest city in Romania.

She was a co-founder of the [[Fraternity of the Inner Light]], an occult organisation that promoted philosophies which she claimed had been taught to her by spiritual entities known as the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]]. A prolific writer, she produced a large number of articles and books on her occult ideas and also authored seven novels, several of which expound occult themes.\n\nFortune was born in [[Llandudno]], North Wales, to a wealthy [[upper middle-class]] English family, although little is known of her early life. By her teenage years she was living in England's [[West Country]], where she wrote two books of poetry. After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying [[psychology]] and [[psychoanalysis]] at the [[University of London]] before working as a counsellor in a psychotherapy clinic. During the [[First World War]] she joined the [[Women's Land Army]] and established a company selling [[soy milk]] products. She became interested in [[Western esotericism|esotericism]] through the teachings of the [[Theosophical Society]], before joining an occult lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the [[Alpha et Omega]] occult organisation.\n\nShe came to believe that she was being contacted by the Ascended Masters, including \"[[Jesus Christ|the Master Jesus]]\", and underwent [[Mediumship|trance mediumship]] to channel the Masters' messages. In 1922 Fortune and Charles Loveday claimed that during one of these ceremonies they were contacted by Masters who provided them with a text, ''The Cosmic Doctrine''. Although she became the president of the Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society, she believed the society to be uninterested in Christianity, and split from it to form the Community of the Inner Light, a group later renamed the Fraternity of the Inner Light. With Loveday she established bases in both [[Glastonbury]] and [[Bayswater]], London, began issuing a magazine, gave public lectures, and promoted the growth of their society. During the [[Second World War]] she organised a project of meditations and visualisations designed to protect Britain. She began planning for what she believed was a coming post-war [[Age of Aquarius]], although she died of [[leukemia]] shortly after the war's end.\n\nFortune is recognised as one of the most significant occultists and ceremonial magicians of the early 20th century. The Fraternity she founded survived her and in later decades spawned a variety of related groups based upon her teachings. Her novels in particular proved an influence on later occult and [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] groups such as [[Wicca]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life: 1890&ndash;1913===\n\n[[File:Llandudno, from the parade.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|An illustration of Fortune's hometown, Llandudno, in 1860]]\n\nFortune was born Violet Mary Firth on 6 December 1890 at her family home on Bryn-y-Bia Road in [[Llandudno]], North Wales.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=13|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3pp=21, 40}} Her background was [[upper middle-class]];{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=9}} the Firths were a wealthy English family who had gained their money through the steel industry in [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]], where they had specialised in the production of guns.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=23, 27&ndash;28}} Fortune's paternal grandfather John Firth had devised a family motto, \"Deo, non Fortuna\" (\"God, not Luck\"), to mark out their ''[[nouveau riche]]'' status; she would later make use of it in creating her pseudonym.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=53|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=28}}\n\nOne of John's sons &ndash; and Fortune's uncle &ndash; was the historian [[Charles Harding Firth]], while her father, Arthur, had run a Sheffield law firm prior to establishing a [[Hydrotherapy|hydropathic establishment]] in [[Limpley Stoke]], [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=30, 33}} In August 1886 Arthur Firth married Sarah Jane Smith,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=36&ndash;37}} before they relocated to Llandudno where Arthur established the new Craigside Hydrotherapeutic Establishment.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=14|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3pp=43&ndash;44}} Sarah was keenly interested in [[Christian Science]],{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=181|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=51}} and while biographer [[Gareth Knight]] suggested that both of Firth's parents were active practitioners of the religion,{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=17}} fellow biographer Alan Richardson argued that there was insufficient evidence to support this idea.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=51}}\n\nLittle is known about Fortune's time in Wales,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=45}} in part because throughout her life she was deliberately elusive when providing biographical details about herself.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=xvii|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=24}} In later life she reported that from the age of four she had experienced [[Vision (religion)|visions]] of [[Atlantis]], something which she believed were [[Past life regression|past life memories]].{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=14&ndash;15|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=47}} The Firths were still in Llandudno in 1900,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=50}} although by 1904 Fortune was living in [[Somerset]], south-west England.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=15|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=52}} That year, she authored a book of poetry, titled ''Violets'', which was likely published by her family.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=16|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=52&ndash;53}} It was reviewed in the May 1905 volume of ''The Girls' Room'', in which it was accompanied by the only known photograph of Fortune as a girl.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=16|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=54}} In 1906, her second book of poetry, ''More Violets'', was published.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=16|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=53}}\n\nAfter John Firth's death, Arthur moved with his family to London.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=17|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=59}} According to Richardson they lived in the area around [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] in the east of the city,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=59}} although Knight gives a different account, stating that they lived first in [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]] and then [[Kensington]], both in the west of the city.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=17}} From January 1911 to December 1912 Fortune studied at [[Studley Agricultural College]] in [[Warwickshire]], a horticultural institution which advertised itself as being ideal for girls with psychological problems. Her proficiency with poultry led her to become a staff member at the college from January to April 1913.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1pp=4&ndash;5|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=21, 22, 24|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=65}} She later claimed that at the college she was the victim of mental manipulation from her employer, the college warden Lillias Hamilton, resulting in a [[mental breakdown]] that made her abandon the institution and return to her parental home.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1pp=3&ndash;4, 172\u2013173|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=21&ndash;22, 24&ndash;27|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3pp=63&ndash;64}}\n\n===Psychotherapy and esotericism: 1913\u201322===\n\nTo recover from her experience at Studley, Fortune began studying [[psychotherapy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=29|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=70&ndash;71}} Her initial interest was in the work of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]], though she later moved on to that of [[Carl Jung]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=5|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=77}} She studied [[psychology]] and [[psychoanalysis]] under [[John Fl\u00fcgel]] at the [[University of London]],{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=5|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=72}} before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's [[Brunswick Square]], which was likely run under the jurisdiction of the [[London School of Medicine for Women]].{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=72}} Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=6|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=29, 31|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=72}} Through her affiliation with the [[Society for the Study of Orthopsychics]], she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as ''The Machinery of the Mind''.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=30|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=73}} While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the [[Theosophical Society]] and reading some of the organisation's literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=6|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=33}} With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=35|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=72&ndash;73}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"The Order [of the Golden Dawn] suffered severely during the First World War, and Mathers himself died in Paris from influenza during the epidemic. When I came in touch with his organisation, it was manned mainly by widows and grey-bearded ancients, and did not appear to be a very promising field of occult endeavour. But I had considerable experience of practical occultism before I made its acquaintance, and I immediately recognised power of a degree and kind I had never met before, and had not the slightest doubt but that I was on the trail of the genuine tradition, despite its inadequate exposition.\"|source=&ndash; Dion Fortune.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=56}}}}\n\nAfter the United Kingdom entered the [[First World War]], Fortune joined the [[Women's Land Army]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=6|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=35|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=93}} She was initially stationed on a farm near to [[Bishop's Stortford]] on the borders between [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]],{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=36|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=98}} before later being relocated to an experimental base for the Food Production Department.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1pp=6&ndash;7|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=37&ndash;38|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3pp=93, 100}} There she carried out experiments in the production of [[soy milk]], subsequently founding the Letchworth-based Garden City Pure Food Company to sell her products and publishing ''The Soya Bean: An Appeal to Humanitarians'' in 1925.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=7|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=38|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=100}} It was while working at the base that she underwent a spiritual experience and subsequently further immersed herself in Theosophical literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=39|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=93&ndash;94}} After doing so, she became preoccupied by the idea of the '[[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]]' or 'Secret Chiefs', claiming to have had visions of two such entities, the [[Jesus Christ|Master Jesus]] and the Master Rakoczi.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=39&ndash;40|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=94&ndash;97}}\n\nHer first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and [[Freemason]] [[Theodore Moriarty]].{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=103&ndash;110}} She had befriended him while still involved in psychotherapy, believing that he could help one of her patients, a young man who had been fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an [[exorcism]], claiming that the young man was the victim of the soul of a deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=33&ndash;34}} Fortune became an [[acolyte]] of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in [[Hammersmith]],{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=127&ndash;128}} and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=128}} Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of [[Atlantis]], a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=44|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=131|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2008|3p=206}} Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as ''The Secrets of Dr. Taverner'' in 1926.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=121|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=42&ndash;43|3a1=Fanger|3y=2006|3p=378}} Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of [[Etheric body|etheric]] [[vampire]]s.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=115&ndash;118}}\n\nIn tandem with her studies under Moriarty, in 1919 Fortune had been initiated into the London Temple of the [[Alpha et Omega]], an occult group that had developed from the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Here, her primary teacher was [[Maiya Curtis-Webb]],{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=49, 52|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=148}} a longstanding friend of the Firth family.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=19}} Fortune later claimed that in the period after the First World War, the Order had been \"manned mainly by widows and grey-bearded ancients\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=149}} She was not enamoured with the [[ceremonial magic]] system that had been developed by the Golden Dawn,{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=54|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=149}} however it did provide her with the grounding in the study of the [[Hermetic Qabalah]] which would exert a great influence over her esoteric world-view.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=154}} It was also through her involvement in the group that she embraced her family's \"Deo, non Fortuna\" as her personal magical motto.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=8|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=53|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=151}} In January and March 1921 Fortune and Curtis-Webb embarked on a series of experiments in trance mediumship.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=57}} This culminated in an act of trance mediumship that Fortune conducted in the Somerset town of [[Glastonbury]] with her mother and [[Frederick Bligh Bond]]. She claimed that in doing so, she had contacted spirit-entities known as \"the Watchers of Avalon\" who informed her that Glastonbury had once been the site of an ancient [[druid]]ic college.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=61&ndash;65}} Bond subsequently commissioned Fortune to write an article, \"Psychology and Occultism\", which was published in the transactions of the [[College of Psychic Science]] in 1922.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=66}}\n\n===Glastonbury and ''The Cosmic Doctrine'': 1922\u201326===\n\n[[File:Glastonbury Tor from north east showing terraces.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Glastonbury Tor]]\n\nIn September 1922, Fortune returned to Glastonbury to visit her friend [[Charles Loveday]]. Along with an anonymous woman known only as \"E. P.\", the pair carried out acts of trance mediumship, claiming that in doing so they entered into psychic contact with the Ascended Masters; Fortune later identified these as [[Socrates]], [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]], and a young military officer named David Carstairs who had died at the [[Battle of Ypres]].{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=77\u201390|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=177, 183}} Fortune and Loveday characterised their method of communication as \"inspirational mediumship\", believing that in this process the Masters communicated through the medium's subconscious mind; they contrasted this with \"automatic mediumship\", which they believed involved the medium becoming completely dissociated from their own body.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=105}}\n\nIt was in this manner that Fortune and Loveday claimed that they received a text, ''The Cosmic Doctrine'', which was dictated to them in segments by the Masters between July 1923 and February 1925.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=94\u201395, 97}} These communications discussed the existence of seven planes of the universe,{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=77}} and were very similar to the ideas promoted in Moriarty's writings, in particular his ''Aphorism of Creation'' and ''Cosmic Principles''.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=94|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=191}} The cosmology present in this book was also similar to that presented in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=206}} In the following years, Fortune distributed this material among her senior students, before publishing an edited version of ''The Cosmic Doctrine'' in 1949.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=98|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=191}}\n\nIn August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune\u2014who had never been particularly popular among his followers{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=155}}\u2014tried to convince them that she should be their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=109|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=139, 153&ndash;154}} Meanwhile, Fortune's parents relocated to the [[Garden city movement|garden city]] of [[Letchworth]], [[Hertfordshire]] in 1922,{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=18|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=80}} and it was here that Fortune carried out what she deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=99}}\n\nOn 20 August 1924, Fortune, Loveday, and others established themselves as a formal occult group.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=109}} Fortune appointed herself as the group's \"Adeptus\", while five acolytes also joined.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=109}} Loveday\u2014who had inherited a number of properties from his father\u2014sold some of them to fund the group's acquisitions.{{sfn|Chapman|1993|pp=109\u2013110}} That year, they purchased a house on Queensborough Terrace in [[Bayswater]], [[Central London]] to use as a temple and headquarters, renting out some of the rooms to tenants to finance their operation.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=106|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=168}} While the top floors were used as living quarters, the middle floor contained the temple space, and the lower floors held an office and private library.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=75|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=222}} The group soon grew; it admitted four initiates in 1925, six in 1926, and ten in 1927.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=113}} In November 1926, a second degree was established into which these initiates could progress.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=113}} In 1924, the group also obtained an old orchard at the foot of [[Glastonbury Tor]], there erecting a hut and eventually a veranda and series of chalets.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=115}} At [[Whitsun]] 1926, Fortune and several other members of her group were on Glastonbury Tor when they underwent a spiritual experience that produced a feeling of [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] among them. They later came to believe that this experience was a result of a messenger from the Elemental Kingdoms, and it greatly influenced their developing beliefs.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=116}}\n\nFortune's activities\u2014including her leadership of the new group and a series of articles that she wrote for ''[[The Occult Review]]''\u2014raised concerns for Alpha et Omega leader [[Moina Mathers]].{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=123}} After Fortune suggested that her own organisation could serve as a feeder group to Mathers's Alpha et Omega, Mathers expelled her from the order, claiming that this was necessitated by Fortune having the wrong signs in her [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=8|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=123\u2013124|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=155}} Fortune later claimed that she subsequently came under psychic attack from Mathers, during which she was confronted and assaulted by both real and etheric cats.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=124\u2013125|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=158&ndash;161}}\n\n===The Theosophical Society and the Community of the Inner Light: 1927\u201330 ===\n\nLater claiming that she was acting under instruction from the Ascended Masters,{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=8|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=163}} Fortune and Loveday joined the [[Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society]], which was run by Daisy M.

I. Wedgwood]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], alleging that it was not concerned with the Master Jesus and was instead preoccupied with the [[Maitreya|Master Maitreya]]. One of the prominent figures in the Church, Bishop Piggott, accused her of attributing false claims to him in ''The Occult Review''.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=133\u2013138}}\n\nAmid these arguments with other sectors of the Theosophical movement, she resigned from the Theosophical Society in October.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=8|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=138|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=164}} Her Christian Mystic Lodge abandoned its affiliation with the Society and renamed itself the Community of the Inner Light.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=139|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=221}} Within this Community was established a group called the Guild of the Master Jesus, which held regular [[church service]]s on Sundays at their Queensborough Terrace base from 1928 until 1939; in 1936 this group renamed itself the Church of the Graal.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=141|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=228\u2013230}} Fortune directed many seekers who lacked the self-discipline for ceremonial magical activity to the Guild, whose members were known by one senior Community member as the \"teeny-weenies\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=230}}\n\n[[File:Emb logo.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Fortune joined the Theosophical Society (logo pictured) but split from them on believing that they undermined the importance of Jesus as an Ascended Master]]\n\nWhen [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] abandoned Theosophy, causing problems for the Theosophical movement, Fortune endorsed the 'Back to Blavatsky' faction, attacking Leadbeater in print by accusing him of being a practitioner of [[black magic]].{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=170}} She then involved herself with [[B. P. Wadia|Bomanji Wadia]] and his [[United Lodge of Theosophists]], through which she claimed to have contacted the Himalayan Masters.

Beginning in August 1927, the channelled messages focused around issues of [[alternative medicine]] and diagnostics and were later assembled as ''The Principles of Esoteric Medicine'', which was privately circulated among Fortune's senior students.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=149, 157}} Some members of Fortune's group believed that the \"Master of Medicine\" was actually [[Paracelsus]], although a later channelled message claimed that this Master's earthly identity had been [[Ignaz Semmelweis]].{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nIn 1927 Fortune published her first occult novel, ''The Demon Lover'',{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=168}} which received a brief but positive review in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=48}}\nThe following year she published ''The Problem of Purity'', her final book to appear under the name of \"Violet Firth\".{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=168}} In 1928 she published a textbook on her esoteric beliefs, ''The Esoteric Orders and their Work'', which she followed with a companion work in 1930, ''The Training and Work of an Initiate''.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=168, 169\u2013170}}\nIn 1930 this was followed by ''Psychic Self-Defense'', which contained many autobiographical elements and which was probably her most commercially popular book.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=178|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=168, 189}} According to the historian Claire Fanger, this book was \"part anecdotal evidence, part do-it-yourself exorcism manual, part autobiography, and some part no doubt fiction.\"{{sfn|Fanger|2006|p=378}}\n\nFortune and her group focused on 'Outer Court' work, which entailed engaging in publicity to boost membership.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=158\u2013159}} They held regular lectures at their Bayswater premises, with Fortune herself lecturing there twice a week for much of 1928.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=170\u2013171}} At their Glastonbury property, which they called the Chalice Orchard, they established a guest house and a social centre which was open in the summer, and where lectures were also carried out.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=181\u2013182}} In October 1927 they began production of a magazine, ''The Inner Light'', with the initial print-run of 500 selling out in a fortnight.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=160|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=223}} The magazine gained a wide readership, with many subscribers located outside of Britain.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=179}} Within the group they formulated a three degree system, through which the initiate could progress as they gained a better knowledge and understanding of the group, its teachings, and its rituals.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=161}} Progress through these degrees could be fairly rapid, with the only requirement being that an individual remain in one degree for at least three months before entering the next.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=183}} Training in these three degrees was referred to as the 'Lesser Mysteries', allowing a practitioner to ascend into the 'Greater Mysteries'.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=113}} The membership that they attracted was largely female, with 21 women to only 5 men being members in this period.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=160}} All members, whether male or female, were initially referred to as \"Brother\", although this system later gave way to the term \"Server Brother\".{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=13}} At Midwinter 1928, they ritually established the Fraternity of the Inner Light\u2014a sector of the group concerned with the 'Lesser Mysteries' that they could present to their membership\u2014with Fortune, Evans, and Loveday as its principal officers.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=167}}\n\n===Declining activity: 1930\u201338===\n\n[[File:Former headquarters of the Society of Inner Light, Queensborough Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|Number 3 Queensborough Terrace, Bayswater: headquarters of the Society of Inner Light from 1924]]\n\nAt the vernal equinox of 1930, Fortune declared that\u2014with the 'Lesser Mysteries' and three degree system now properly established\u2014she wanted to turn away from public work and focus on personal spiritual development.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=184}} At the vernal equinox of 1931, Fortune stepped down as leader of the Fraternity, with Loveday being appointed Magus of the Lodge in her place.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=196}} During the 1930s, Fortune's emphasis moved away from mediumship and towards ritual, while at the same time other Fraternity members embraced mediumship in order to channel the messages of the Masters.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=192\u2013193}} In late 1931, Fortune began mooting the idea of the construction of a permanent base, or Sanctuary, at the Chalice Orchard, and despite the economic obstacles of the [[Great Depression]] was able to raise sufficient funds.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=216}} The group experienced a growth in the numbers attending its lectures, subscribing to its correspondence course, and using their private library; conversely, their Sunday services were not very popular, with a move from the morning to the evening seeing no effect.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=217\u2013218}} One significant individual who joined the Fraternity was [[Christine Campbell Thomson]], who had been Fortune's [[literary agent]] since 1926.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=168|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=186}} Fortune subsequently aided Thomson in separating from her abusive husband,{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=208\u2013209}} after which she grew close to another Fraternity member, Colonel C. R. F. Seymour, in 1937.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=209|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=290}} Although Seymour became a senior member of the Fraternity, relations between him and Fortune were strained,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=295\u2013296}} and during the Second World War he left London and settled in [[Liverpool]], terminating his involvement with Fortune's Bayswater temple.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=298}}\n\nBy 1933, tensions in Fortune's marriage were tearing it apart.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=217}} There were rumours that Evans was having extra-marital affairs with other women,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=235}} while Fortune confided in female members of the Fraternity that she had married him for magical reasons rather than because she loved him.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=234}} Evans eventually asked for a divorce in order to marry another woman; Fortune was appalled, but did not contest it.{{sfnm|1a1=Fanger|1y=2006|1p=379|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=281}} Fortune had begun renting The Belfry, a converted [[Presbyterian]] chapel in West Halkin Street, where she then took up residence.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=235|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=255\u2014258}} It was here, during the latter 1930s, that she produced a number of rituals, among them the Rite of Isis and the Rite of Pan.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=235}} As these and other aspects of her work testify, during the latter half of the decade Fortune had moved in what Richardson described as \"an increasingly pagan orientation\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=261}}\n\nFortune published many articles in ''Inner Light'' magazine, a number of which were collected together and published in books.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=170}} In 1930, the first such collection was published as ''Mystical Meditations upon the Collects'', in which Fortune emphasised her Christian commitments.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=170}} In 1931 a number of her ''Inner Light'' articles on [[Spiritualism]] appeared as ''Spiritualism in the Light of Occult Science''. In this book Fortune expressed reservations about Spiritualism. She drew a distinction between normal Spiritualist mediums and 'cosmic mediums' such as herself who contacted the Ascended Masters, also arguing that the spirits of the dead should not be contacted without good reason, a view that generated controversy among the occult milieu.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=191, 194\u2013195}} In 1934, she assembled a number of her ''Inner Light'' articles on Glastonbury as ''Avalon of the Heart'',{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=115}} while further ''Inner Light'' articles were assembled as ''Practical Occultism in Daily Life'', a book aimed at a general reader.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=219}}\nA number of Fortune's articles from ''The Occult Review'' were also collected to produce the book ''Sane Occultism''.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=182}}\n\nOver four years, Fortune also published a number of articles in ''Inner Light'' that discussed the Hermetic Qabalah. These articles were then assembled as the book ''The Mystical Qabalah'', which is widely perceived as a milestone in her esoteric career.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=212}} While lambasting most of Fortune's works as \"rather vulgar pot-boiling journalism\", the writer [[Francis X. King]] characterised ''The Mystical Qabalah'' as \"undoubtedly a classic of the Western Tradition\".{{sfn|King|1972|p=124}} The work constituted a theoretical discussion based in the Golden Dawn system of correspondences to the Qabalic [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]] which she had obtained through her membership of the Alpha et Omega group.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=212}} However, it was also rooted in her own personal experiences and visions; while meditating, she believed that she had visited the various [[Sephiroth]] of the Qabalic tree.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=212\u2013215}}\n\nIn 1935 she published her second occult novel, ''The Winged Bull''\u2014which was again reviewed in ''The Times Literary Review''\u2014and in 1936 her third, ''The Goat-Foot God''.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=48}} In 1938 Fortune wrote a fourth occult novel, ''The Sea Priestess'', which was eventually self-published through the Fraternity after being declined by [[Williams and Norgate]], who had published the previous two.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=148|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2p=185|3a1=Knight|3y=2000|3p=221|4a1=Richardson|4y=2007|4pp=272, 275}} Her final novel, ''Moon Magic'', was apparently left unfinished prior to the outbreak of the Second World War; a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 later completed it, claiming to have done so through channeling Blavatsky's disembodied spirit, and it was published posthumously.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=185|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=280|3a1=Graf|3y=2007|3p=48}}\n\nFortune corresponded with a number of prominent occultists in this period. One of these was [[Israel Regardie]], whose book ''The Tree of Life'' was regarded by Fortune as \"quite the best book on magic\" that she had read.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=198\u2013200}} Regardie later publicly criticised her for misrepresenting his works in her reviews of them; she had claimed that his works bolstered her beliefs about the Masters, although Regardie insisted that he was sceptical about the existence of such entities.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=203}} Fortune also corresponded with [[Olga Fr\u00f6be-Kapteyn]], the Dutch esotericist who founded [[Eranos]] in Switzerland.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=217}} She also renewed her interest in Jungian psychology, which was then growing in influence among the esoteric milieu,{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=217}} and was influenced by her reading of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=226}}\n\n===Later life: 1939\u201346===\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939 saw some of the Fraternity's members enlist in the armed forces, putting a stop to many of the group's activities.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=244}} From October 1939 through to October 1942, Fortune organised group meditations every Sunday with the intent of focusing Fraternity members towards the cause of peace.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=244\u2013247|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=302\u2013304}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Dave |title=The Magical Battle of Britain.

Rider Haggard]], [[Algernon Blackwood]], [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]], and [[Arthur Machen]].{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=47}} The other three were romantic thrillers published under the pseudonym of \"V. M. Steele\": ''The Scarred Wrists'', ''Hunters of Humans'', and ''Beloved of Ishmael''.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=220, 232\u2013233|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=261}} Writing thrillers was one of few activities Fortune took part in unconnected to her magical work, and was something she did not publicise.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=261}} Knight believed these three novels testified to the idea that \"she must really have loved writing for writing's sake\".{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=233}} An eighth novel, ''Moon Magic'', was left unfinished but completed by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and published posthumously.\n\nFortune saw her occult novels as an important part of her Fraternity work, initiating readers into the realms of occultism by speaking to their subconscious, even when their conscious mind rejects occult teachings.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=223}} She thus perceived them as a means of disseminating her teachings to a wider audience.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=90}} Each was related to one of the Sephirah on the Qabalic Tree of Life: ''The Winged Bull'' was associated with [[Tiphareth]], ''The Goat-Foot God'' with [[Malkuth]], and ''The Sea Priestess'' with [[Yesod]].{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=224}}\n\nFortune's first novel was ''The Demon Lover'', which tells the story of Veronica Mainwaring, a young virgin woman who becomes the secretary to a malevolent magician, Justin Lucas, who seeks to exploit her latent mediumistic powers for his own purposes. Although she falls in love with him, she eventually escapes his entrapments through her devotion to Christianity.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=222|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=207}} Her next work, ''The Winged Bull'', focuses on Ursula Brangwyn, who had been harmed by her involvement in an unscrupulous occult group but meets with Ted Murchison, whom she subsequently marries.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=222}} The characters in ''The Winged Bull'' are based upon real people in Fortune's life; Murchison is based on her husband, for example, and she modeled Brangwyn after herself.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=262}} The character of Hugo Astley has been interpreted as a \"barely veiled fictional portrait\" of Aleister Crowley.{{sfn|Radford|2018|p=167}} Richardson felt that ''The Winged Bull'' was \"in many ways the worst of her books\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=261}} The scholar Andrew Radford suggested that the novel reflected a \"zeal in promoting a socially responsible occultism rooted in orthodox gender roles\" and demonstrated her growing concern that occultism was increasingly being associated with what she regarded as an immoral cosmopolitan elite synonymous with Crowley and his activities.{{sfn|Radford|2018|p=167}}\n\n''The Goat-Foot God'' revolves around a wealthy widower, Hugh Patson, who teams up with an esoteric bookseller to seek out the ancient Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. They achieve this with the aid of a poverty-stricken artist, Mona Wilton, who becomes close to Patson as the novel progresses.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=266\u2013269}} Richardson described ''The Goat-Foot God'' as \"a masterpiece&nbsp;... the finest occult novel ever written\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=272}} ''The Sea Priestess'' is about Wilfred Maxwell, a man living with his mother and sister who learns to commune with the Moon after an [[asthma]] attack. He meets with Le Fay Morgan, a spiritual adept, and together they enter an obsessive (on Wilfred's part) but platonic relationship while establishing a temple to the sea gods.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nFortune's novels all follow the same basic theme: a heroine \u2014 a priestess and initiatrix who is magically experienced and assertive \u2014 who meets a man and saves him from himself.{{sfnm|1a1=Fanger|1y=2006|1p=379|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=222}} In her later novels this entails the duos reconstructing or revitalising a ritual space and working magical rituals to channel cosmic forces and bring them into balance.{{sfn|Fanger|2006|p=379}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"As a writer, Fortune's gifts are generally more practical than philosophical. Above all she was a deft synthesizer of ideas, and her continued influence derives largely from her ability to bring difficult esoteric concepts into a lucid and readily accessible prose.\"|source=&ndash; Historian Claire Fanger.{{sfn|Fanger|2006|p=379}}}}\n\nIn her discussion of Fortune's work, Sonja Sadovsky stated that the \"unique element\" of Fortune's fiction was \"the recurring plotline of esoteric romance told from the priestess's viewpoint\", suggesting that her female characters provided a template from which female readers could build upon in their own spiritual practice.{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|pp=37\u201338}} Sadovsky further suggested that there were two types of priestess who appeared in Fortune's novels, the \"Earth Mother\" and the \"Moon Mistress\".{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=42}} According to Sadovsky, the \"Earth Mother\" was represented by the character of Mona WIlkins in ''The Goat-Foot God'' and that of Molly Coke in ''The Sea Priestess''. She suggested that these characters derived their power from the masculine/feminine polarity and the creative power of sex, and that they also required a male priest in order to initiate them into their spiritual mysteries and to reach their full potential.{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=24}} The second type of priestess, the \"Moon Mistress\", appeared as Vivien/Lilith le Fay Morgan in ''The Sea Priestess'' and then becomes more dominant in ''Moon Magic''. According to Sadovsky, this is a celibate figure who concentrates her creative powers on training priestesses and dealing with occult matters.{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=48}}\n\n==Belief and teachings==\n\n===Religion and race===\n\nFortune identified her beliefs as being part of what she termed \"the Western Mystery Tradition\".{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=11}} \nShe adhered to a form of esoteric Christianity,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=206}} and has been described both as a [[Christian Kabbalah|Christian Qabalist]],{{sfn|Drury|2012|p=184}} and as \"a devout mystical Christian\", albeit \"a very unorthodox one\".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} She expressed the opinion that \"in any school of Western mysticism the author and finisher of our faith must be Christ Jesus, the Great Initiator of the West\",{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}} and treated \"the Master Jesus\" as her personal spiritual guide.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} She believed that the teachings passed down from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn served the purpose of recovering \"sacred mysteries\" or ''[[gnosis]]'' that had been overlooked by mainstream Christianity.{{sfn|Drury|2012|p=183}} Accordingly, she had no allegiance to any established Christian churches and was often critical of mainstream clergy.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} Moreover, she rejected a number of traditional Christian doctrines, such as that surrounding [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]] and [[Christian views on hell|Hell]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}}\n\nThere is no evidence that Fortune considered herself to be a \"Pagan\".{{sfn|Pearson|2002|p=29}} However, by the late 1930s, Fortune had developed some interest in the religion of ancient Egypt, but treated it as a preparation for the higher truth of Christianity.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|pp=182\u2013183}} In the 1930s her attitude began to change as she became more favourable to pre-Christian religion, likely under the influence of her husband, Seymour, and [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[The Rainbow]]'', of which she was a fan.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=183}} By ''The Winged Bull'', she was declaring that pre-Christian gods were just as valid as facets of the divine as the Christian God,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=184}} and around this time she began to adopt an increasingly critical attitude to Christianity, stating that it had been greatly degraded since its origins and distorted by \"those two crusty old bachelors\", [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=184}} In her next novel, ''The Goat-Foot God'', Fortune had fully embraced the idea of a modern Paganism reviving the belief systems of pre-Christian Europe, referring to this as \"Vitamin P\" and declaring that it was needed to heal the modern world.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=185}} Around this time she began promoting the claim that \"All the gods are one god, and all the goddesses are one goddess\".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=185}} However, during the Second World War her writings became more pronouncedly Christian once again.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=186}}\n\nFortune believed in the existence of an underlying commonality between the teachings of Western esoteric orders and Asian religious traditions.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=75}} Nevertheless, she believed that particular spiritual traditions were allotted to specific racial groups,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}} stating that \"the Great White Lodge gives to each race the religion suited to its needs\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=88}} Writing in ''The Occult Review'', Fortune stated: \"Do not let it be forgotten that our traditions are racial. What that great initiate [[Rudolf Steiner]] did for the German-speaking races someone must do for those who use a Latin-root language and the Anglo-Saxon tongue.\"{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=173}}\nShe did not agree with allowing spiritual and magical techniques to transmit between different cultures, believing that to do so caused damage; she for instance cautioned against allowing Western esoteric teachings to be practiced in India because \"the Hindu dies readily from shock\".{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=184}} Equally she strongly opposed the adoption of Asian religious techniques into Western esotericism,{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=184}} distancing herself from occultists who did so.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=73}} In her words, she must \"recommend to the white races the traditional Western system, which is admirably adapted to their psychic constitution\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=73}} She nevertheless perceived value in Westerners studying Asian disciplines like [[Yoga]] on a theoretical level, so long as they eschewed any attempt to put these teachings into practice.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=74}}\nThe religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic highlighted that 21st century readers would likely deem there to be \"a strong cultural essentialism and even racial prejudice in her writings\", but that ideas regarding the close relationship between \"culture, race, and religion\" were \"a part of everyday discourse\" in Britain during her lifetime.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=87}}\n\n===Magic===\n\nFortune was a ceremonial magician.{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=31}} The magical principles on which her Fraternity was based were adopted from the late nineteenth century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with other influences coming from Theosophy and Christian Science.{{sfn|Fanger|2006|pp=377, 378}} The magical ceremonies performed by Fortune's Fraternity were placed into two categories: initiations, in which the candidate was introduced to magical forces, and evocation, in which these forces were manipulated for a given purpose.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=224}}\n\nThe Fraternity's rituals at their Bayswater temple were carried out under a dim light, with Fortune claiming that bright light disperses etheric forces.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=224}} An altar was placed in the centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually [[frankincense]], was burned.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=224}} The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers\u2014who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces\u2014were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=224\u2013225}} Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in [[Astral body|astral]] form and interact with the chosen officers.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=224\u2013225}}\n\nFortune was particularly concerned with the issue of sex.{{sfn|Urban|2006|p=167}} In her early works she displayed a prudish attitude regarding sexuality, warning her readers about the perceived perils of masturbation, extra-marital sex, same-sex sexual activity, abortion, and [[free love]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=182|2a1=Urban|2y=2006|2p=167|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=198}} The only form of sexual expression that she considered appropriate was that between a heterosexual married couple,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}} and she promoted a form of 'psychic masturbation' to quell any sexual urges that a celibate individual may have.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=182|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=197}} According to Richardson, she was \"a prude, at least by today's standards\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=198}} In her later works she exhibited a more positive attitude toward sexuality, describing the sexual union between a man and woman as the most powerful expression of a \"life-force\" which flows throughout the universe.{{sfn|Urban|2006|p=167}} She believed that this erotic attraction between men and women could be harnessed for use in magic.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}} She urged her followers to be naked under their robes when carrying out magical rituals, for this would increase the creative sexual tension between the men and women present.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=231}} Although sex features in her novels, it is never described in graphic detail.{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=147}} Nevertheless, her later occult novels entail depictions of heterosexual sex outside of marriage, suggesting that by this point Fortune no longer believed that sex must be restrained to wedlock.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=52}} The scholar Andrew Radford noted that Fortune's \"reactionary and highly heteronormative\" view of \"sacralised sexuality\" should be seen as part of a wider tradition among esoteric currents, going back to the ideas of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] and also being found in the work of occultists like [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] and [[Ida Craddock]].{{sfn|Radford|2018|p=166}}\n\nFortune was among those who popularised the idea of a division between the [[left-hand path and right-hand path]] which had been introduced to Western esotericism by the Theosophist [[Helena Blavatsky]].{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=222}} In doing so Fortune connected her disparaging views on what she considered to be the left hand path to the [[moral panic]] surrounding homosexuality in British society.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=222}} Her works contained commentaries in which she condemned the \"homosexual techniques\" of malevolent male magicians, and she claimed that the acceptance of homosexuality was the cause of the downfall of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=183}} The manner in which she sought to demonise the left hand path has been compared to that found in the work of English novelist [[Dennis Wheatley]].{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=189}}\n\n==Personality and personal life==\n\nThe historian Claire Fanger noted that Fortune exhibited a \"dynamic personality and confident leadership\".{{sfn|Fanger|2006|p=378}} Janine Chapman, an esotericist who researched Fortune's life, stated that \"in her prime\", Fortune was \"a strong, magnetic personality\" with \"an active, intellectually curious mind\" who was also \"physically imposing\".{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=11}} Chapman noted that while studying at horticultural college, Fortune had earned a reputation for having a \"keen sense of humor\", being particularly fond of [[practical jokes]].{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=167}} Richardson characterised Fortune as being \"honest, and other ruthless with her honesty\",{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=74}} adding that she was \"an essentially good woman who had strands of darkness within\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=22}} Chapman noted that she \"set an example of super-achievement, self-sacrifice, and personal integrity\" and that \"sexually, she was modest, faithful, and chaste\".{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=xvi}} In her later years, she earned a nickname among her friends in the Fraternity; \"The Fluff\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=318}}\n\nRichardson believed that while \"sex was all important to Dion, there is the constant impression that actual coitus was distasteful\" to her.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=196}} This was in keeping with the view of many esotericists at the time that \"stainless-steel purity\" free from sex was necessary for one to be a spiritual adept.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=196}} Chapman characterised Fortune's marriage as \"rocky\",{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=158}} and the marriage produced no children.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=266}} In later life, there were unsubstantiated rumours that Fortune had sexual relationships with both men and women,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=149}} and in particular that she had a relationship with Tranchall-Hayes.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=200}} Richardson nevertheless noted that there was no good evidence that Fortune had \"actively lesbian tendencies\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=200}}\n\nFortune did not involve herself or her group in any explicitly political movement or party.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=50}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that in her political and social views, Fortune was likely a [[High Tory]],{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=360}} with Richardson noting that politically, she was \"somewhat aligned\" to the ideas of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Winston Churchill]].{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=304}} Graf noted that although Fortune was not involved in the feminist movement and did not associate with feminists, she \"thought herself every bit as powerful, capable, independent, and discerning as any man, and she worked to spiritually empower women.\"{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=49}} When staying at Queensborough, Fortune kept a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=222}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\nAccording to Richardson, Fortune fell into \"relative obscurity\" after her death, having been overshadowed by her more famous contemporary, Aleister Crowley.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=17}} The historian of esotericism Dave Evans agreed, stating that Fortune had been \"somewhat less\" influential than Crowley.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=41}}\nHutton nevertheless considered her to be the \"foremost female figure\" of early 20th century British occultism,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} while historian Alex Owen referred to her as \"one of the most significant clairvoyants and occultists of the postwar period\".{{sfn|Owen|2004|p=227}} Similarly, Knight termed her \"one of the leading occultists of her generation\",{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=27}} and the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann]] referred to her as \"one of the most influential twentieth-century magicians\".{{sfn|Luhrmann|1989|p=56}} Another esotericism scholar, [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], said Fortune was an \"important heir of the Golden Dawn, and she had a significant influence on modern Western esotericism\".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=206}} Religious studies scholar Stephen Sutcliffe described her as having \"played a key role in the cult of Glastonbury in the interwar years\",{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003|p=94}} while anthropologist Susan Greenwood thought Fortune's emphasis on a masculine/feminine polarity as the basis for magical working was a significant influence on both later ceremonial magic and Wicca.{{sfn|Greenwood|2000|p=143}}\n\n[[File:St johns glastonbury arp.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|right|The church of St. John the Baptist, Glastonbury; Fortune's funeral was performed here by the Reverend L. S. Lewis, and her body interred in the Wells Road cemetery nearby]]\n\nFortune's Fraternity survived her, and was renamed the Society of the Inner Light in 1946;{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=207}} the change was a legal refinement to help the group achieve charitable status.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=295}} It continues to operate into the early 21st century.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2008|1p=207|2a1=Djurdjevic|2y=2014|2p=87}} The Society sold the Chalice Orchard, which was eventually purchased by [[Geoffrey Ashe]],{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=307}} and in 1959 sold their Bayswater headquarters after the socio-economic decline of the area, instead establishing a base in North London.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=308}} While retaining its basis in Fortune's original teachings, the Society has changed its emphasis according to who has led it over the years. At various points it has been heavily influenced by [[Alice Bailey]]'s ideas about the Ascended Masters, the ideas of [[Subud]], and the use of [[Scientology]]'s [[E-meter]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=1972|1p=125|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=300|3a1=Barrett|3y=2011|3p=227}} In 1961, the Society adopted a new approach which further emphasised and foregrounded its Christian identity. This generated controversy in the group, with [[Gareth Knight]] leaving to form his own lodge based on Fortune's teachings, known as the Gareth Knight Group.{{sfn|Barrett|2011|pp=227\u2013228}} From 1999 the Gareth Knight Group was known as the Avalon Group before returning to its original name in 2018.  In 1973 one of Fortune's students, [[W. E. Butler]], likewise split with the Fraternity to found his own group in [[Jersey]], the [[Servants of the Light]], which would later be taken over by [[Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki]] and remains one of the world's largest esoteric organizations in the early 21st century maintaining about 1000 active students.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2008|1p=207|2a1=Barrett|2y=2011|2p=235}} In 1975, another member of the Society, Alan Adams, departed to start the London Group, which was initially based in outer London but later moved to the [[East Midlands]].{{sfn|Barrett|2011|p=242}}\n\nBy the late 1990s the Society's membership had dropped to a few dozen, and under the control of a new warden it invited Knight to return to the group in order to help promote it. Knight agreed, leaving his own lodge to publish two works by Fortune based on her material in the Society's archive, and authoring a biography of her.{{sfn|Barrett|2011|p=230}} The 1990s saw a number of pioneering biographical studies of Fortune, including Alan Richardson's in 1991 and Janine Chapman's in 1993.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} Richardson's book relied heavily on the recollections of Christine Hartley,{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=xviii}} while the publication of Fielding and Carr was based upon the authors' interactions with older members of the Society.{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=xviii}} However, in 2007 Graf noted that Fortune had yet to receive much scholarly attention.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=47}}\n\nIn the early 21st century, Evans noted that Fortune's work was \"still influential in some magical quarters\",{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=183}} highlighting that in his experience she was one of only three female ceremonial magicians\u2014alongside [[Leah Hirsig]] and [[Jaq Hawkins]]\u2014that modern esotericists could readily name.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=225}}\n\n===Fortune's literary influence on modern Paganism===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"Through her novels and her theoretical occult works, Dion Fortune has left a legacy that is rich and potent for those who choose to adopt a goddess-centered religion.

She was a co-founder of the [[Fraternity of the Inner Light]], an occult organisation that promoted philosophies which she claimed had been taught to her by spiritual entities known as the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]]. A prolific writer, she produced a large number of articles and books on her occult ideas and also authored seven novels, several of which expound occult themes.\n\nFortune was born in [[Llandudno]], North Wales, to a wealthy [[upper middle-class]] English family, although little is known of her early life. By her teenage years she was living in England's [[West Country]], where she wrote two books of poetry. After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying [[psychology]] and [[psychoanalysis]] at the [[University of London]] before working as a counsellor in a psychotherapy clinic. During the [[First World War]] she joined the [[Women's Land Army]] and established a company selling [[soy milk]] products. She became interested in [[Western esotericism|esotericism]] through the teachings of the [[Theosophical Society]], before joining an occult lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the [[Alpha et Omega]] occult organisation.\n\nShe came to believe that she was being contacted by the Ascended Masters, including \"[[Jesus Christ|the Master Jesus]]\", and underwent [[Mediumship|trance mediumship]] to channel the Masters' messages. In 1922 Fortune and Charles Loveday claimed that during one of these ceremonies they were contacted by Masters who provided them with a text, ''The Cosmic Doctrine''. Although she became the president of the Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society, she believed the society to be uninterested in Christianity, and split from it to form the Community of the Inner Light, a group later renamed the Fraternity of the Inner Light. With Loveday she established bases in both [[Glastonbury]] and [[Bayswater]], London, began issuing a magazine, gave public lectures, and promoted the growth of their society. During the [[Second World War]] she organised a project of meditations and visualisations designed to protect Britain. She began planning for what she believed was a coming post-war [[Age of Aquarius]], although she died of [[leukemia]] shortly after the war's end.\n\nFortune is recognised as one of the most significant occultists and ceremonial magicians of the early 20th century. The Fraternity she founded survived her and in later decades spawned a variety of related groups based upon her teachings. Her novels in particular proved an influence on later occult and [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] groups such as [[Wicca]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life: 1890&ndash;1913===\n\n[[File:Llandudno, from the parade.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|An illustration of Fortune's hometown, Llandudno, in 1860]]\n\nFortune was born Violet Mary Firth on 6 December 1890 at her family home on Bryn-y-Bia Road in [[Llandudno]], North Wales.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=13|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3pp=21, 40}} Her background was [[upper middle-class]];{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=9}} the Firths were a wealthy English family who had gained their money through the steel industry in [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]], where they had specialised in the production of guns.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=23, 27&ndash;28}} Fortune's paternal grandfather John Firth had devised a family motto, \"Deo, non Fortuna\" (\"God, not Luck\"), to mark out their ''[[nouveau riche]]'' status; she would later make use of it in creating her pseudonym.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=53|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=28}}\n\nOne of John's sons &ndash; and Fortune's uncle &ndash; was the historian [[Charles Harding Firth]], while her father, Arthur, had run a Sheffield law firm prior to establishing a [[Hydrotherapy|hydropathic establishment]] in [[Limpley Stoke]], [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=30, 33}} In August 1886 Arthur Firth married Sarah Jane Smith,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=36&ndash;37}} before they relocated to Llandudno where Arthur established the new Craigside Hydrotherapeutic Establishment.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=14|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3pp=43&ndash;44}} Sarah was keenly interested in [[Christian Science]],{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=181|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=51}} and while biographer [[Gareth Knight]] suggested that both of Firth's parents were active practitioners of the religion,{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=17}} fellow biographer Alan Richardson argued that there was insufficient evidence to support this idea.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=51}}\n\nLittle is known about Fortune's time in Wales,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=45}} in part because throughout her life she was deliberately elusive when providing biographical details about herself.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=xvii|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=24}} In later life she reported that from the age of four she had experienced [[Vision (religion)|visions]] of [[Atlantis]], something which she believed were [[Past life regression|past life memories]].{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=14&ndash;15|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=47}} The Firths were still in Llandudno in 1900,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=50}} although by 1904 Fortune was living in [[Somerset]], south-west England.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=15|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=52}} That year, she authored a book of poetry, titled ''Violets'', which was likely published by her family.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=16|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=52&ndash;53}} It was reviewed in the May 1905 volume of ''The Girls' Room'', in which it was accompanied by the only known photograph of Fortune as a girl.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=16|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=54}} In 1906, her second book of poetry, ''More Violets'', was published.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=16|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=53}}\n\nAfter John Firth's death, Arthur moved with his family to London.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=17|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=59}} According to Richardson they lived in the area around [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] in the east of the city,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=59}} although Knight gives a different account, stating that they lived first in [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]] and then [[Kensington]], both in the west of the city.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=17}} From January 1911 to December 1912 Fortune studied at [[Studley Agricultural College]] in [[Warwickshire]], a horticultural institution which advertised itself as being ideal for girls with psychological problems. Her proficiency with poultry led her to become a staff member at the college from January to April 1913.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1pp=4&ndash;5|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=21, 22, 24|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=65}} She later claimed that at the college she was the victim of mental manipulation from her employer, the college warden Lillias Hamilton, resulting in a [[mental breakdown]] that made her abandon the institution and return to her parental home.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1pp=3&ndash;4, 172\u2013173|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=21&ndash;22, 24&ndash;27|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3pp=63&ndash;64}}\n\n===Psychotherapy and esotericism: 1913\u201322===\n\nTo recover from her experience at Studley, Fortune began studying [[psychotherapy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=29|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=70&ndash;71}} Her initial interest was in the work of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]], though she later moved on to that of [[Carl Jung]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=5|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=77}} She studied [[psychology]] and [[psychoanalysis]] under [[John Fl\u00fcgel]] at the [[University of London]],{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=5|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=72}} before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's [[Brunswick Square]], which was likely run under the jurisdiction of the [[London School of Medicine for Women]].{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=72}} Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=6|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=29, 31|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=72}} Through her affiliation with the [[Society for the Study of Orthopsychics]], she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as ''The Machinery of the Mind''.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=30|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=73}} While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the [[Theosophical Society]] and reading some of the organisation's literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=6|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=33}} With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=35|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=72&ndash;73}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"The Order [of the Golden Dawn] suffered severely during the First World War, and Mathers himself died in Paris from influenza during the epidemic. When I came in touch with his organisation, it was manned mainly by widows and grey-bearded ancients, and did not appear to be a very promising field of occult endeavour.

Moriarty performed an [[exorcism]], claiming that the young man was the victim of the soul of a deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=33&ndash;34}} Fortune became an [[acolyte]] of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in [[Hammersmith]],{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=127&ndash;128}} and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=128}} Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of [[Atlantis]], a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=44|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=131|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2008|3p=206}} Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as ''The Secrets of Dr. Taverner'' in 1926.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=121|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=42&ndash;43|3a1=Fanger|3y=2006|3p=378}} Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of [[Etheric body|etheric]] [[vampire]]s.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=115&ndash;118}}\n\nIn tandem with her studies under Moriarty, in 1919 Fortune had been initiated into the London Temple of the [[Alpha et Omega]], an occult group that had developed from the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Here, her primary teacher was [[Maiya Curtis-Webb]],{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=49, 52|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=148}} a longstanding friend of the Firth family.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=19}} Fortune later claimed that in the period after the First World War, the Order had been \"manned mainly by widows and grey-bearded ancients\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=149}} She was not enamoured with the [[ceremonial magic]] system that had been developed by the Golden Dawn,{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=54|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=149}} however it did provide her with the grounding in the study of the [[Hermetic Qabalah]] which would exert a great influence over her esoteric world-view.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=154}} It was also through her involvement in the group that she embraced her family's \"Deo, non Fortuna\" as her personal magical motto.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=8|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=53|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=151}} In January and March 1921 Fortune and Curtis-Webb embarked on a series of experiments in trance mediumship.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=57}} This culminated in an act of trance mediumship that Fortune conducted in the Somerset town of [[Glastonbury]] with her mother and [[Frederick Bligh Bond]]. She claimed that in doing so, she had contacted spirit-entities known as \"the Watchers of Avalon\" who informed her that Glastonbury had once been the site of an ancient [[druid]]ic college.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=61&ndash;65}} Bond subsequently commissioned Fortune to write an article, \"Psychology and Occultism\", which was published in the transactions of the [[College of Psychic Science]] in 1922.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=66}}\n\n===Glastonbury and ''The Cosmic Doctrine'': 1922\u201326===\n\n[[File:Glastonbury Tor from north east showing terraces.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Glastonbury Tor]]\n\nIn September 1922, Fortune returned to Glastonbury to visit her friend [[Charles Loveday]]. Along with an anonymous woman known only as \"E. P.\", the pair carried out acts of trance mediumship, claiming that in doing so they entered into psychic contact with the Ascended Masters; Fortune later identified these as [[Socrates]], [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]], and a young military officer named David Carstairs who had died at the [[Battle of Ypres]].{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=77\u201390|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=177, 183}} Fortune and Loveday characterised their method of communication as \"inspirational mediumship\", believing that in this process the Masters communicated through the medium's subconscious mind; they contrasted this with \"automatic mediumship\", which they believed involved the medium becoming completely dissociated from their own body.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=105}}\n\nIt was in this manner that Fortune and Loveday claimed that they received a text, ''The Cosmic Doctrine'', which was dictated to them in segments by the Masters between July 1923 and February 1925.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=94\u201395, 97}} These communications discussed the existence of seven planes of the universe,{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=77}} and were very similar to the ideas promoted in Moriarty's writings, in particular his ''Aphorism of Creation'' and ''Cosmic Principles''.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=94|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=191}} The cosmology present in this book was also similar to that presented in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=206}} In the following years, Fortune distributed this material among her senior students, before publishing an edited version of ''The Cosmic Doctrine'' in 1949.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=98|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=191}}\n\nIn August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune\u2014who had never been particularly popular among his followers{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=155}}\u2014tried to convince them that she should be their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=109|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=139, 153&ndash;154}} Meanwhile, Fortune's parents relocated to the [[Garden city movement|garden city]] of [[Letchworth]], [[Hertfordshire]] in 1922,{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=18|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=80}} and it was here that Fortune carried out what she deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=99}}\n\nOn 20 August 1924, Fortune, Loveday, and others established themselves as a formal occult group.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=109}} Fortune appointed herself as the group's \"Adeptus\", while five acolytes also joined.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=109}} Loveday\u2014who had inherited a number of properties from his father\u2014sold some of them to fund the group's acquisitions.{{sfn|Chapman|1993|pp=109\u2013110}} That year, they purchased a house on Queensborough Terrace in [[Bayswater]], [[Central London]] to use as a temple and headquarters, renting out some of the rooms to tenants to finance their operation.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=106|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=168}} While the top floors were used as living quarters, the middle floor contained the temple space, and the lower floors held an office and private library.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=75|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=222}} The group soon grew; it admitted four initiates in 1925, six in 1926, and ten in 1927.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=113}} In November 1926, a second degree was established into which these initiates could progress.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=113}} In 1924, the group also obtained an old orchard at the foot of [[Glastonbury Tor]], there erecting a hut and eventually a veranda and series of chalets.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=115}} At [[Whitsun]] 1926, Fortune and several other members of her group were on Glastonbury Tor when they underwent a spiritual experience that produced a feeling of [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] among them. They later came to believe that this experience was a result of a messenger from the Elemental Kingdoms, and it greatly influenced their developing beliefs.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=116}}\n\nFortune's activities\u2014including her leadership of the new group and a series of articles that she wrote for ''[[The Occult Review]]''\u2014raised concerns for Alpha et Omega leader [[Moina Mathers]].{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=123}} After Fortune suggested that her own organisation could serve as a feeder group to Mathers's Alpha et Omega, Mathers expelled her from the order, claiming that this was necessitated by Fortune having the wrong signs in her [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=8|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=123\u2013124|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=155}} Fortune later claimed that she subsequently came under psychic attack from Mathers, during which she was confronted and assaulted by both real and etheric cats.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=124\u2013125|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=158&ndash;161}}\n\n===The Theosophical Society and the Community of the Inner Light: 1927\u201330 ===\n\nLater claiming that she was acting under instruction from the Ascended Masters,{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=8|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=163}} Fortune and Loveday joined the [[Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society]], which was run by Daisy M.

I. Wedgwood]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], alleging that it was not concerned with the Master Jesus and was instead preoccupied with the [[Maitreya|Master Maitreya]]. One of the prominent figures in the Church, Bishop Piggott, accused her of attributing false claims to him in ''The Occult Review''.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=133\u2013138}}\n\nAmid these arguments with other sectors of the Theosophical movement, she resigned from the Theosophical Society in October.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=8|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=138|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=164}} Her Christian Mystic Lodge abandoned its affiliation with the Society and renamed itself the Community of the Inner Light.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=139|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=221}} Within this Community was established a group called the Guild of the Master Jesus, which held regular [[church service]]s on Sundays at their Queensborough Terrace base from 1928 until 1939; in 1936 this group renamed itself the Church of the Graal.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=141|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=228\u2013230}} Fortune directed many seekers who lacked the self-discipline for ceremonial magical activity to the Guild, whose members were known by one senior Community member as the \"teeny-weenies\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=230}}\n\n[[File:Emb logo.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Fortune joined the Theosophical Society (logo pictured) but split from them on believing that they undermined the importance of Jesus as an Ascended Master]]\n\nWhen [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] abandoned Theosophy, causing problems for the Theosophical movement, Fortune endorsed the 'Back to Blavatsky' faction, attacking Leadbeater in print by accusing him of being a practitioner of [[black magic]].{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=170}} She then involved herself with [[B. P. Wadia|Bomanji Wadia]] and his [[United Lodge of Theosophists]], through which she claimed to have contacted the Himalayan Masters.

Beginning in August 1927, the channelled messages focused around issues of [[alternative medicine]] and diagnostics and were later assembled as ''The Principles of Esoteric Medicine'', which was privately circulated among Fortune's senior students.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=149, 157}} Some members of Fortune's group believed that the \"Master of Medicine\" was actually [[Paracelsus]], although a later channelled message claimed that this Master's earthly identity had been [[Ignaz Semmelweis]].{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nIn 1927 Fortune published her first occult novel, ''The Demon Lover'',{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=168}} which received a brief but positive review in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=48}}\nThe following year she published ''The Problem of Purity'', her final book to appear under the name of \"Violet Firth\".{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=168}} In 1928 she published a textbook on her esoteric beliefs, ''The Esoteric Orders and their Work'', which she followed with a companion work in 1930, ''The Training and Work of an Initiate''.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=168, 169\u2013170}}\nIn 1930 this was followed by ''Psychic Self-Defense'', which contained many autobiographical elements and which was probably her most commercially popular book.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=178|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2pp=168, 189}} According to the historian Claire Fanger, this book was \"part anecdotal evidence, part do-it-yourself exorcism manual, part autobiography, and some part no doubt fiction.\"{{sfn|Fanger|2006|p=378}}\n\nFortune and her group focused on 'Outer Court' work, which entailed engaging in publicity to boost membership.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=158\u2013159}} They held regular lectures at their Bayswater premises, with Fortune herself lecturing there twice a week for much of 1928.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=170\u2013171}} At their Glastonbury property, which they called the Chalice Orchard, they established a guest house and a social centre which was open in the summer, and where lectures were also carried out.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=181\u2013182}} In October 1927 they began production of a magazine, ''The Inner Light'', with the initial print-run of 500 selling out in a fortnight.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=160|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=223}} The magazine gained a wide readership, with many subscribers located outside of Britain.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=179}} Within the group they formulated a three degree system, through which the initiate could progress as they gained a better knowledge and understanding of the group, its teachings, and its rituals.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=161}} Progress through these degrees could be fairly rapid, with the only requirement being that an individual remain in one degree for at least three months before entering the next.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=183}} Training in these three degrees was referred to as the 'Lesser Mysteries', allowing a practitioner to ascend into the 'Greater Mysteries'.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=113}} The membership that they attracted was largely female, with 21 women to only 5 men being members in this period.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=160}} All members, whether male or female, were initially referred to as \"Brother\", although this system later gave way to the term \"Server Brother\".{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=13}} At Midwinter 1928, they ritually established the Fraternity of the Inner Light\u2014a sector of the group concerned with the 'Lesser Mysteries' that they could present to their membership\u2014with Fortune, Evans, and Loveday as its principal officers.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=167}}\n\n===Declining activity: 1930\u201338===\n\n[[File:Former headquarters of the Society of Inner Light, Queensborough Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|Number 3 Queensborough Terrace, Bayswater: headquarters of the Society of Inner Light from 1924]]\n\nAt the vernal equinox of 1930, Fortune declared that\u2014with the 'Lesser Mysteries' and three degree system now properly established\u2014she wanted to turn away from public work and focus on personal spiritual development.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=184}} At the vernal equinox of 1931, Fortune stepped down as leader of the Fraternity, with Loveday being appointed Magus of the Lodge in her place.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=196}} During the 1930s, Fortune's emphasis moved away from mediumship and towards ritual, while at the same time other Fraternity members embraced mediumship in order to channel the messages of the Masters.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=192\u2013193}} In late 1931, Fortune began mooting the idea of the construction of a permanent base, or Sanctuary, at the Chalice Orchard, and despite the economic obstacles of the [[Great Depression]] was able to raise sufficient funds.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=216}} The group experienced a growth in the numbers attending its lectures, subscribing to its correspondence course, and using their private library; conversely, their Sunday services were not very popular, with a move from the morning to the evening seeing no effect.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=217\u2013218}} One significant individual who joined the Fraternity was [[Christine Campbell Thomson]], who had been Fortune's [[literary agent]] since 1926.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=168|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=186}} Fortune subsequently aided Thomson in separating from her abusive husband,{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=208\u2013209}} after which she grew close to another Fraternity member, Colonel C. R. F. Seymour, in 1937.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=209|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=290}} Although Seymour became a senior member of the Fraternity, relations between him and Fortune were strained,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=295\u2013296}} and during the Second World War he left London and settled in [[Liverpool]], terminating his involvement with Fortune's Bayswater temple.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=298}}\n\nBy 1933, tensions in Fortune's marriage were tearing it apart.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=217}} There were rumours that Evans was having extra-marital affairs with other women,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=235}} while Fortune confided in female members of the Fraternity that she had married him for magical reasons rather than because she loved him.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=234}} Evans eventually asked for a divorce in order to marry another woman; Fortune was appalled, but did not contest it.{{sfnm|1a1=Fanger|1y=2006|1p=379|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=281}} Fortune had begun renting The Belfry, a converted [[Presbyterian]] chapel in West Halkin Street, where she then took up residence.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=235|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=255\u2014258}} It was here, during the latter 1930s, that she produced a number of rituals, among them the Rite of Isis and the Rite of Pan.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=235}} As these and other aspects of her work testify, during the latter half of the decade Fortune had moved in what Richardson described as \"an increasingly pagan orientation\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=261}}\n\nFortune published many articles in ''Inner Light'' magazine, a number of which were collected together and published in books.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=170}} In 1930, the first such collection was published as ''Mystical Meditations upon the Collects'', in which Fortune emphasised her Christian commitments.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=170}} In 1931 a number of her ''Inner Light'' articles on [[Spiritualism]] appeared as ''Spiritualism in the Light of Occult Science''. In this book Fortune expressed reservations about Spiritualism. She drew a distinction between normal Spiritualist mediums and 'cosmic mediums' such as herself who contacted the Ascended Masters, also arguing that the spirits of the dead should not be contacted without good reason, a view that generated controversy among the occult milieu.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=191, 194\u2013195}} In 1934, she assembled a number of her ''Inner Light'' articles on Glastonbury as ''Avalon of the Heart'',{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=115}} while further ''Inner Light'' articles were assembled as ''Practical Occultism in Daily Life'', a book aimed at a general reader.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=219}}\nA number of Fortune's articles from ''The Occult Review'' were also collected to produce the book ''Sane Occultism''.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=182}}\n\nOver four years, Fortune also published a number of articles in ''Inner Light'' that discussed the Hermetic Qabalah. These articles were then assembled as the book ''The Mystical Qabalah'', which is widely perceived as a milestone in her esoteric career.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=212}} While lambasting most of Fortune's works as \"rather vulgar pot-boiling journalism\", the writer [[Francis X. King]] characterised ''The Mystical Qabalah'' as \"undoubtedly a classic of the Western Tradition\".{{sfn|King|1972|p=124}} The work constituted a theoretical discussion based in the Golden Dawn system of correspondences to the Qabalic [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]] which she had obtained through her membership of the Alpha et Omega group.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=212}} However, it was also rooted in her own personal experiences and visions; while meditating, she believed that she had visited the various [[Sephiroth]] of the Qabalic tree.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=212\u2013215}}\n\nIn 1935 she published her second occult novel, ''The Winged Bull''\u2014which was again reviewed in ''The Times Literary Review''\u2014and in 1936 her third, ''The Goat-Foot God''.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=48}} In 1938 Fortune wrote a fourth occult novel, ''The Sea Priestess'', which was eventually self-published through the Fraternity after being declined by [[Williams and Norgate]], who had published the previous two.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=1993|1p=148|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2p=185|3a1=Knight|3y=2000|3p=221|4a1=Richardson|4y=2007|4pp=272, 275}} Her final novel, ''Moon Magic'', was apparently left unfinished prior to the outbreak of the Second World War; a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 later completed it, claiming to have done so through channeling Blavatsky's disembodied spirit, and it was published posthumously.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=185|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=280|3a1=Graf|3y=2007|3p=48}}\n\nFortune corresponded with a number of prominent occultists in this period. One of these was [[Israel Regardie]], whose book ''The Tree of Life'' was regarded by Fortune as \"quite the best book on magic\" that she had read.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=198\u2013200}} Regardie later publicly criticised her for misrepresenting his works in her reviews of them; she had claimed that his works bolstered her beliefs about the Masters, although Regardie insisted that he was sceptical about the existence of such entities.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=203}} Fortune also corresponded with [[Olga Fr\u00f6be-Kapteyn]], the Dutch esotericist who founded [[Eranos]] in Switzerland.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=217}} She also renewed her interest in Jungian psychology, which was then growing in influence among the esoteric milieu,{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=217}} and was influenced by her reading of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=226}}\n\n===Later life: 1939\u201346===\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939 saw some of the Fraternity's members enlist in the armed forces, putting a stop to many of the group's activities.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=244}} From October 1939 through to October 1942, Fortune organised group meditations every Sunday with the intent of focusing Fraternity members towards the cause of peace.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1pp=244\u2013247|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2pp=302\u2013304}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Dave |title=The Magical Battle of Britain.

The literary scholar Susan Johnson Graf categorises these alongside the work of [[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Algernon Blackwood]], [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]], and [[Arthur Machen]].{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=47}} The other three were romantic thrillers published under the pseudonym of \"V. M.

Although she falls in love with him, she eventually escapes his entrapments through her devotion to Christianity.{{sfnm|1a1=Knight|1y=2000|1p=222|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=207}} Her next work, ''The Winged Bull'', focuses on Ursula Brangwyn, who had been harmed by her involvement in an unscrupulous occult group but meets with Ted Murchison, whom she subsequently marries.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=222}} The characters in ''The Winged Bull'' are based upon real people in Fortune's life; Murchison is based on her husband, for example, and she modeled Brangwyn after herself.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=262}} The character of Hugo Astley has been interpreted as a \"barely veiled fictional portrait\" of Aleister Crowley.{{sfn|Radford|2018|p=167}} Richardson felt that ''The Winged Bull'' was \"in many ways the worst of her books\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=261}} The scholar Andrew Radford suggested that the novel reflected a \"zeal in promoting a socially responsible occultism rooted in orthodox gender roles\" and demonstrated her growing concern that occultism was increasingly being associated with what she regarded as an immoral cosmopolitan elite synonymous with Crowley and his activities.{{sfn|Radford|2018|p=167}}\n\n''The Goat-Foot God'' revolves around a wealthy widower, Hugh Patson, who teams up with an esoteric bookseller to seek out the ancient Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. They achieve this with the aid of a poverty-stricken artist, Mona Wilton, who becomes close to Patson as the novel progresses.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=266\u2013269}} Richardson described ''The Goat-Foot God'' as \"a masterpiece&nbsp;... the finest occult novel ever written\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=272}} ''The Sea Priestess'' is about Wilfred Maxwell, a man living with his mother and sister who learns to commune with the Moon after an [[asthma]] attack. He meets with Le Fay Morgan, a spiritual adept, and together they enter an obsessive (on Wilfred's part) but platonic relationship while establishing a temple to the sea gods.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nFortune's novels all follow the same basic theme: a heroine \u2014 a priestess and initiatrix who is magically experienced and assertive \u2014 who meets a man and saves him from himself.{{sfnm|1a1=Fanger|1y=2006|1p=379|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=222}} In her later novels this entails the duos reconstructing or revitalising a ritual space and working magical rituals to channel cosmic forces and bring them into balance.{{sfn|Fanger|2006|p=379}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"As a writer, Fortune's gifts are generally more practical than philosophical. Above all she was a deft synthesizer of ideas, and her continued influence derives largely from her ability to bring difficult esoteric concepts into a lucid and readily accessible prose.\"|source=&ndash; Historian Claire Fanger.{{sfn|Fanger|2006|p=379}}}}\n\nIn her discussion of Fortune's work, Sonja Sadovsky stated that the \"unique element\" of Fortune's fiction was \"the recurring plotline of esoteric romance told from the priestess's viewpoint\", suggesting that her female characters provided a template from which female readers could build upon in their own spiritual practice.{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|pp=37\u201338}} Sadovsky further suggested that there were two types of priestess who appeared in Fortune's novels, the \"Earth Mother\" and the \"Moon Mistress\".{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=42}} According to Sadovsky, the \"Earth Mother\" was represented by the character of Mona WIlkins in ''The Goat-Foot God'' and that of Molly Coke in ''The Sea Priestess''. She suggested that these characters derived their power from the masculine/feminine polarity and the creative power of sex, and that they also required a male priest in order to initiate them into their spiritual mysteries and to reach their full potential.{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=24}} The second type of priestess, the \"Moon Mistress\", appeared as Vivien/Lilith le Fay Morgan in ''The Sea Priestess'' and then becomes more dominant in ''Moon Magic''. According to Sadovsky, this is a celibate figure who concentrates her creative powers on training priestesses and dealing with occult matters.{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=48}}\n\n==Belief and teachings==\n\n===Religion and race===\n\nFortune identified her beliefs as being part of what she termed \"the Western Mystery Tradition\".{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=11}} \nShe adhered to a form of esoteric Christianity,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=206}} and has been described both as a [[Christian Kabbalah|Christian Qabalist]],{{sfn|Drury|2012|p=184}} and as \"a devout mystical Christian\", albeit \"a very unorthodox one\".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} She expressed the opinion that \"in any school of Western mysticism the author and finisher of our faith must be Christ Jesus, the Great Initiator of the West\",{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}} and treated \"the Master Jesus\" as her personal spiritual guide.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} She believed that the teachings passed down from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn served the purpose of recovering \"sacred mysteries\" or ''[[gnosis]]'' that had been overlooked by mainstream Christianity.{{sfn|Drury|2012|p=183}} Accordingly, she had no allegiance to any established Christian churches and was often critical of mainstream clergy.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} Moreover, she rejected a number of traditional Christian doctrines, such as that surrounding [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]] and [[Christian views on hell|Hell]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}}\n\nThere is no evidence that Fortune considered herself to be a \"Pagan\".{{sfn|Pearson|2002|p=29}} However, by the late 1930s, Fortune had developed some interest in the religion of ancient Egypt, but treated it as a preparation for the higher truth of Christianity.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|pp=182\u2013183}} In the 1930s her attitude began to change as she became more favourable to pre-Christian religion, likely under the influence of her husband, Seymour, and [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[The Rainbow]]'', of which she was a fan.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=183}} By ''The Winged Bull'', she was declaring that pre-Christian gods were just as valid as facets of the divine as the Christian God,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=184}} and around this time she began to adopt an increasingly critical attitude to Christianity, stating that it had been greatly degraded since its origins and distorted by \"those two crusty old bachelors\", [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=184}} In her next novel, ''The Goat-Foot God'', Fortune had fully embraced the idea of a modern Paganism reviving the belief systems of pre-Christian Europe, referring to this as \"Vitamin P\" and declaring that it was needed to heal the modern world.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=185}} Around this time she began promoting the claim that \"All the gods are one god, and all the goddesses are one goddess\".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=185}} However, during the Second World War her writings became more pronouncedly Christian once again.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=186}}\n\nFortune believed in the existence of an underlying commonality between the teachings of Western esoteric orders and Asian religious traditions.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=75}} Nevertheless, she believed that particular spiritual traditions were allotted to specific racial groups,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}} stating that \"the Great White Lodge gives to each race the religion suited to its needs\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=88}} Writing in ''The Occult Review'', Fortune stated: \"Do not let it be forgotten that our traditions are racial. What that great initiate [[Rudolf Steiner]] did for the German-speaking races someone must do for those who use a Latin-root language and the Anglo-Saxon tongue.\"{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=173}}\nShe did not agree with allowing spiritual and magical techniques to transmit between different cultures, believing that to do so caused damage; she for instance cautioned against allowing Western esoteric teachings to be practiced in India because \"the Hindu dies readily from shock\".{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=184}} Equally she strongly opposed the adoption of Asian religious techniques into Western esotericism,{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=184}} distancing herself from occultists who did so.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=73}} In her words, she must \"recommend to the white races the traditional Western system, which is admirably adapted to their psychic constitution\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=73}} She nevertheless perceived value in Westerners studying Asian disciplines like [[Yoga]] on a theoretical level, so long as they eschewed any attempt to put these teachings into practice.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=74}}\nThe religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic highlighted that 21st century readers would likely deem there to be \"a strong cultural essentialism and even racial prejudice in her writings\", but that ideas regarding the close relationship between \"culture, race, and religion\" were \"a part of everyday discourse\" in Britain during her lifetime.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=87}}\n\n===Magic===\n\nFortune was a ceremonial magician.{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=31}} The magical principles on which her Fraternity was based were adopted from the late nineteenth century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with other influences coming from Theosophy and Christian Science.{{sfn|Fanger|2006|pp=377, 378}} The magical ceremonies performed by Fortune's Fraternity were placed into two categories: initiations, in which the candidate was introduced to magical forces, and evocation, in which these forces were manipulated for a given purpose.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=224}}\n\nThe Fraternity's rituals at their Bayswater temple were carried out under a dim light, with Fortune claiming that bright light disperses etheric forces.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=224}} An altar was placed in the centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually [[frankincense]], was burned.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=224}} The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers\u2014who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces\u2014were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=224\u2013225}} Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in [[Astral body|astral]] form and interact with the chosen officers.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|pp=224\u2013225}}\n\nFortune was particularly concerned with the issue of sex.{{sfn|Urban|2006|p=167}} In her early works she displayed a prudish attitude regarding sexuality, warning her readers about the perceived perils of masturbation, extra-marital sex, same-sex sexual activity, abortion, and [[free love]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=182|2a1=Urban|2y=2006|2p=167|3a1=Richardson|3y=2007|3p=198}} The only form of sexual expression that she considered appropriate was that between a heterosexual married couple,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}} and she promoted a form of 'psychic masturbation' to quell any sexual urges that a celibate individual may have.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=182|2a1=Richardson|2y=2007|2p=197}} According to Richardson, she was \"a prude, at least by today's standards\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=198}} In her later works she exhibited a more positive attitude toward sexuality, describing the sexual union between a man and woman as the most powerful expression of a \"life-force\" which flows throughout the universe.{{sfn|Urban|2006|p=167}} She believed that this erotic attraction between men and women could be harnessed for use in magic.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=182}} She urged her followers to be naked under their robes when carrying out magical rituals, for this would increase the creative sexual tension between the men and women present.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=231}} Although sex features in her novels, it is never described in graphic detail.{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=147}} Nevertheless, her later occult novels entail depictions of heterosexual sex outside of marriage, suggesting that by this point Fortune no longer believed that sex must be restrained to wedlock.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=52}} The scholar Andrew Radford noted that Fortune's \"reactionary and highly heteronormative\" view of \"sacralised sexuality\" should be seen as part of a wider tradition among esoteric currents, going back to the ideas of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] and also being found in the work of occultists like [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] and [[Ida Craddock]].{{sfn|Radford|2018|p=166}}\n\nFortune was among those who popularised the idea of a division between the [[left-hand path and right-hand path]] which had been introduced to Western esotericism by the Theosophist [[Helena Blavatsky]].{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=222}} In doing so Fortune connected her disparaging views on what she considered to be the left hand path to the [[moral panic]] surrounding homosexuality in British society.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=222}} Her works contained commentaries in which she condemned the \"homosexual techniques\" of malevolent male magicians, and she claimed that the acceptance of homosexuality was the cause of the downfall of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=183}} The manner in which she sought to demonise the left hand path has been compared to that found in the work of English novelist [[Dennis Wheatley]].{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=189}}\n\n==Personality and personal life==\n\nThe historian Claire Fanger noted that Fortune exhibited a \"dynamic personality and confident leadership\".{{sfn|Fanger|2006|p=378}} Janine Chapman, an esotericist who researched Fortune's life, stated that \"in her prime\", Fortune was \"a strong, magnetic personality\" with \"an active, intellectually curious mind\" who was also \"physically imposing\".{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=11}} Chapman noted that while studying at horticultural college, Fortune had earned a reputation for having a \"keen sense of humor\", being particularly fond of [[practical jokes]].{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=167}} Richardson characterised Fortune as being \"honest, and other ruthless with her honesty\",{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=74}} adding that she was \"an essentially good woman who had strands of darkness within\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=22}} Chapman noted that she \"set an example of super-achievement, self-sacrifice, and personal integrity\" and that \"sexually, she was modest, faithful, and chaste\".{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=xvi}} In her later years, she earned a nickname among her friends in the Fraternity; \"The Fluff\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=318}}\n\nRichardson believed that while \"sex was all important to Dion, there is the constant impression that actual coitus was distasteful\" to her.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=196}} This was in keeping with the view of many esotericists at the time that \"stainless-steel purity\" free from sex was necessary for one to be a spiritual adept.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=196}} Chapman characterised Fortune's marriage as \"rocky\",{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=158}} and the marriage produced no children.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=266}} In later life, there were unsubstantiated rumours that Fortune had sexual relationships with both men and women,{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=149}} and in particular that she had a relationship with Tranchall-Hayes.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=200}} Richardson nevertheless noted that there was no good evidence that Fortune had \"actively lesbian tendencies\".{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=200}}\n\nFortune did not involve herself or her group in any explicitly political movement or party.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=50}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that in her political and social views, Fortune was likely a [[High Tory]],{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=360}} with Richardson noting that politically, she was \"somewhat aligned\" to the ideas of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Winston Churchill]].{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=304}} Graf noted that although Fortune was not involved in the feminist movement and did not associate with feminists, she \"thought herself every bit as powerful, capable, independent, and discerning as any man, and she worked to spiritually empower women.\"{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=49}} When staying at Queensborough, Fortune kept a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=222}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\nAccording to Richardson, Fortune fell into \"relative obscurity\" after her death, having been overshadowed by her more famous contemporary, Aleister Crowley.{{sfn|Richardson|2007|p=17}} The historian of esotericism Dave Evans agreed, stating that Fortune had been \"somewhat less\" influential than Crowley.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=41}}\nHutton nevertheless considered her to be the \"foremost female figure\" of early 20th century British occultism,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} while historian Alex Owen referred to her as \"one of the most significant clairvoyants and occultists of the postwar period\".{{sfn|Owen|2004|p=227}} Similarly, Knight termed her \"one of the leading occultists of her generation\",{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=27}} and the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann]] referred to her as \"one of the most influential twentieth-century magicians\".{{sfn|Luhrmann|1989|p=56}} Another esotericism scholar, [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], said Fortune was an \"important heir of the Golden Dawn, and she had a significant influence on modern Western esotericism\".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=206}} Religious studies scholar Stephen Sutcliffe described her as having \"played a key role in the cult of Glastonbury in the interwar years\",{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003|p=94}} while anthropologist Susan Greenwood thought Fortune's emphasis on a masculine/feminine polarity as the basis for magical working was a significant influence on both later ceremonial magic and Wicca.{{sfn|Greenwood|2000|p=143}}\n\n[[File:St johns glastonbury arp.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|right|The church of St. John the Baptist, Glastonbury; Fortune's funeral was performed here by the Reverend L. S. Lewis, and her body interred in the Wells Road cemetery nearby]]\n\nFortune's Fraternity survived her, and was renamed the Society of the Inner Light in 1946;{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=207}} the change was a legal refinement to help the group achieve charitable status.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=295}} It continues to operate into the early 21st century.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2008|1p=207|2a1=Djurdjevic|2y=2014|2p=87}} The Society sold the Chalice Orchard, which was eventually purchased by [[Geoffrey Ashe]],{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=307}} and in 1959 sold their Bayswater headquarters after the socio-economic decline of the area, instead establishing a base in North London.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=308}} While retaining its basis in Fortune's original teachings, the Society has changed its emphasis according to who has led it over the years. At various points it has been heavily influenced by [[Alice Bailey]]'s ideas about the Ascended Masters, the ideas of [[Subud]], and the use of [[Scientology]]'s [[E-meter]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=1972|1p=125|2a1=Knight|2y=2000|2p=300|3a1=Barrett|3y=2011|3p=227}} In 1961, the Society adopted a new approach which further emphasised and foregrounded its Christian identity. This generated controversy in the group, with [[Gareth Knight]] leaving to form his own lodge based on Fortune's teachings, known as the Gareth Knight Group.{{sfn|Barrett|2011|pp=227\u2013228}} In 1973 one of Fortune's students, [[W. E. Butler]], likewise split with the Fraternity to found his own group in [[Jersey]], the [[Servants of the Light]], which would later be taken over by [[Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki]] and remains one of the world's largest esoteric organizations in the early 21st century maintaining about 1000 active students.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2008|1p=207|2a1=Barrett|2y=2011|2p=235}} In 1975, another member of the Society, Alan Adams, departed to start the London Group, which was initially based in outer London but later moved to the [[East Midlands]].{{sfn|Barrett|2011|p=242}}\n\nBy the late 1990s the Society's membership had dropped to a few dozen, and under the control of a new warden it invited Knight to return to the group in order to help promote it. Knight agreed, leaving his own lodge to publish two works by Fortune based on her material in the Society's archive, and authoring a biography of her.{{sfn|Barrett|2011|p=230}} The 1990s saw a number of pioneering biographical studies of Fortune, including Alan Richardson's in 1991 and Janine Chapman's in 1993.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=181}} Richardson's book relied heavily on the recollections of Christine Hartley,{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=xviii}} while the publication of Fielding and Carr was based upon the authors' interactions with older members of the Society.{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=xviii}} However, in 2007 Graf noted that Fortune had yet to receive much scholarly attention.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=47}}\n\nIn the early 21st century, Evans noted that Fortune's work was \"still influential in some magical quarters\",{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=183}} highlighting that in his experience she was one of only three female ceremonial magicians\u2014alongside [[Leah Hirsig]] and [[Jaq Hawkins]]\u2014that modern esotericists could readily name.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=225}}\n\n===Fortune's literary influence on modern Paganism===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"Through her novels and her theoretical occult works, Dion Fortune has left a legacy that is rich and potent for those who choose to adopt a goddess-centered religion. Fortune laid the groundwork that has been followed by later neo-pagans and goddess-centered practitioners who want to find a religion that is not patriarchal and offers divine images other than that of a male god or a passive, human, mother of god. The practices and beliefs that Fortune found, and has passed on, offer a balance of power, a kind a partnership model for the divine.\"|source=&ndash; Literary scholar Susan Johnston Graf.{{sfn|Graf|2007|pp=55\u201356}}}}\n\nThe religious studies scholar [[Hugh Urban]] noted that Fortune was \"one of the key links\" between early twentieth-century ceremonial magic and the developing Pagan religion of [[Wicca]].{{sfn|Urban|2006|p=167}} Similarly, the Wiccan high priestess [[Vivianne Crowley]] characterised Fortune as a \"proto-Pagan\".{{sfn|Pearson|2002|p=29}} The scholar and esotericist [[Nevill Drury]] stated that Fortune \"in many ways anticipated feminist ideas in contemporary Wicca\", particularly through her belief that all goddesses were a manifestation of a single Great Goddess.{{sfn|Drury|2003|p=179}} Graf agreed, adding that Fortune's works found \"resonance\" in the work of the later feminist Wiccan [[Starhawk]], and in particular in the latter's 1979 book, ''[[The Spiral Dance]]''.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=50}}\n\nIn researching ceremonial magic orders and other esoteric groups active in the London area during the 1980s, Luhrmann found that within them, Fortune's novels were treated as \"fictionalized ideals\" and that they were recommended to newcomers as the best way to understand magic.{{sfn|Luhrmann|1989|p=88}} The [[Pagan studies]] scholar Joanne Pearson added that Fortune's books, and in particular the novels ''The Sea Priestess'' and ''Moon Magic'', were owned by many Wiccans and other Pagans.{{sfn|Pearson|2002|p=29}} The religious studies scholar Graham Harvey compared ''The Sea Priestess'' to the Wiccan [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s 1949 novel ''High Magic's Aid'', stating that while neither were \"great literature\", they \"evoke Paganism better than later more didactic works\".{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=179}}\n\nFortune's priestesses were an influence on the characters of [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'',{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=88}} and her ideas were adopted as the basis for the [[Aquarian Order of the Restoration]], a ceremonial magic group led by Bradley.{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=86}} Her works also influenced Bradley's collaborator and fellow Order member [[Diana Paxson]].{{sfn|Sadovsky|2014|p=120}} As of 2007, Fortune's latter three novels remained in print and had a wide readership.{{sfn|Graf|2007|p=48}} Evans nevertheless believed that her writings were \"stuck in their era\" in many places; as evidence, he highlighted passages in which Fortune warns her readers that their Indian servants may steal their body waste products for use in the worship of the Hindu goddess [[Kali]].{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Non-fiction===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning $109.3 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=|195x195px]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=Interview: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.

Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning \u00a373 million (US$109.3 million) worldwide on a \u00a33 million budget (US$5 million). At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father is visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=Interview: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.
