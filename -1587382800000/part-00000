(born 31 May 1938) is a British [[politician]] who was the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1997 to 2007 and [[First Secretary of State]] from 2001 to 2007. Born in [[Prestatyn]], [[Wales]], he represented [[Kingston upon Hull East (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingston upon Hull East]] as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] to [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]]. In the [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|1994 leadership election]], he stood for both [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader]] and [[Deputy Leader of the British Labour Party|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]], winning election to the latter office. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister after Labour's victory in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]], with an expanded brief as [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions]].\n\nA former ship's steward and trade union activist, by the 1990s he was presented as the political link to the working class in a Labour party increasingly led by modernising, middle-class professionals such as [[Tony Blair]] and [[Peter Mandelson]]. In his youth he failed the [[eleven-plus]] exam entrance examination for [[grammar school]], but went on to graduate from [[Ruskin College]] and the [[University of Hull]]. Prescott also developed a reputation as a key conciliator in the often stormy relationship between [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] Tony Blair and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]].\n\nOn 27 June 2007 he resigned as Deputy Prime Minister, coinciding with Blair's resignation as Prime Minister. Following an election within the Labour party, he was replaced as Deputy Leader by [[Harriet Harman]]. Prescott retired as an MP at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]]. On 8 July 2010, he entered the [[House of Lords]] as a [[life peer]] with the title Baron Prescott, of [[Kingston upon Hull]] in the County of [[East Yorkshire]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/lp1958%20p.htm |title=Life Peerages \u2013 P |publisher=Cracroft's Peerage |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823041922/http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/lp1958%20p.htm |archive-date=23 August 2018 |access-date=21 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nPrescott stood as the Labour candidate in the [[2012 England and Wales Police and Crime Commissioner elections|election]] to be the first [[Police and Crime Commissioner]] for [[Humberside Police]],<ref name=\"BBCPolice\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18490964 |title=Lord Prescott aims for Humberside police job |date=18 June 2012 |work=BBC News |access-date=19 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619055244/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18490964 |archive-date=19 June 2012 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> but lost to Conservative [[Matthew Grove]].<ref name=\"BBCresultsPCC\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20354044 |title=Police election results |date=16 November 2012 |work=BBC News |access-date=16 November 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116170955/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20354044 |archive-date=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 February 2015, it was announced that Prescott would return to politics as an adviser to then-Labour leader, [[Ed Miliband]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31570861 |title=John Prescott set to return to front-line politics |date=22 February 2015 |work=BBC News |access-date=23 February 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222110244/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31570861 |archive-date=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nThe son of John Herbert Prescott, a [[signalman (rail)|railway signalman]] and Labour councillor, and Phyllis, and the grandson of a miner, Prescott was born in [[Prestatyn]], [[Wales]], on 31 May 1938.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/john-prescott-a-streetfighting-man-685220.html |title=John Prescott: A street-fighting man |last=O'Grady |first=Sean |date=19 May 2001 |work=The Independent |access-date=7 September 2011 |location=London}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name=\"Pauline\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7316296/Smile-Though-Your-Heart-is-Breaking-by-Pauline-Prescott-review.html |title=Smile Though Your Heart is Breaking by Pauline Prescott: review |last=Lewis |first=Roger |date=27 February 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=7 September 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104005404/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7316296/Smile-Though-Your-Heart-is-Breaking-by-Pauline-Prescott-review.html |archive-date=4 November 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/public_life/john_prescott.shtml |title=BBC-North East Wales public life -John Prescott |date=February 2009 |website=BBC-North East Wales website |publisher=BBC |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228165613/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/public_life/john_prescott.shtml |archive-date=28 December 2009 |access-date=7 September 2011}}</ref> In 2009, he said: \"I've always felt very proud of Wales and being Welsh...I was born in Wales, went to school in Wales and my mother was Welsh.

The Deputy Prime Minister stands in when the Prime Minister is unavailable, most visibly at [[Prime Minister's Questions|Prime minister's questions]], and Prescott had attended various Heads of Government meetings on behalf of then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kprm.gov.pl/english/2130_7446.htm |title=Bilateral Meeting of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland with the Deputy Prime Minister of Great Britain |publisher=The Chancellery of the Prime Minister (Poland) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307210057/http://www.kprm.gov.pl/english/2130_7446.htm |archive-date=7 March 2006 |access-date=9 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nSince the position of Deputy Prime Minister draws no salary, Prescott's remuneration was based on his position as [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions]] until [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. This \"super department\" was then broken up, with the [[Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] and the [[Department for Transport]] established as separate entities.

The subsequent debate on [[road pricing]] evolved from his policy. A contrast was highlighted between Prescott's transport brief and an incident, in 1999, when an official chauffeur-driven car was used to transport Prescott and his wife {{Convert|250|yd|m}} from their hotel to the venue of the Labour Party Conference, where Prescott gave a speech on how to encourage the use of public transport.

He had vigorously opposed the privatisation of the industry while the Labour Party was in opposition, and disliked the party's policy, established in 1996 just before the [[Initial public offering|flotation]] of [[Railtrack]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]], of committing to [[nationalisation|renationalise]] the industry only when resources allowed, which he saw as meaning that it would never be done.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Reluctantly, he supported the alternative policy, produced by then shadow transport secretary [[Clare Short]], that the industry should be subjected to closer regulation by the to-be-created [[Strategic Rail Authority]] (in the case of the passenger train operators) and the [[Rail Regulator]] (in the case of the monopoly and dominant elements in the industry, principally Railtrack). The policy was spelled out in some detail in the Labour Party's statement in the June 1996 prospectus for the sale of Railtrack shares, and was widely regarded as having depressed the price of the shares.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn 1998, Prescott was criticised by Transport Minister [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] for his statement \u2013 at the Labour Party conference that year \u2013 that the privatised railway was a \"national disgrace\", despite receiving a standing ovation from the Labour Party audience.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/183627.stm |title=Trains a 'national disgrace' |date=1 October 1998 |work=BBC |access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref> The companies felt that they had had some considerable successes in cutting costs and generating new revenues in the short time since their transfer to private sector hands, and that the criticisms were premature and unfair.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Glaister |first=Stephen |title=OCCASIONAL PAPER 23: BRITISH RAIL PRIVATISATION ~ COMPETITION DESTROYED BY POLITICS |url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/management/cri/pubpdf/Occasional_Papers/23_Glaister.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Centre for the Study of Regulated Industries |publisher=University of Bath |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219064837/http://www.bath.ac.uk/management/cri/pubpdf/Occasional_Papers/23_Glaister.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2016 |access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn that speech, Prescott also announced that he would be taking a far tougher line with the companies, and to that end he would be having a \"spring clean\" of the industry.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/archive/prescott-gives-signal-for-rail-improvement-08-10-1998/ |title=Prescott gives signal for rail improvement |last=Anderson |first=Graham |date=8 October 1998 |work=Construction News |access-date=19 February 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113124643/https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/archive/prescott-gives-signal-for-rail-improvement-08-10-1998/ |archive-date=13 January 2020}}</ref> This meant that the incumbent [[Director of Passenger Rail Franchising]] \u2013 John O'Brien \u2013 and the Rail Regulator [[John Swift QC]] \u2013 both appointed by the previous [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, would have to make way for new Labour appointees.\n\nIn July 1998, Prescott, published a transport White Paper stating that the rail industry needed an element of stability and certainty if it was to plan its activities effectively.<ref>Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, ''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090224114933/http://www.dft.gov.uk/162259/187604/A_new_deal_for_transport_be1.pdf A new deal for transport: better for everyone]'', Cm 3950, July 1998, para 4.22</ref>\n\nIn February 1999, the regulation of the passenger rail operators fell to Sir [[Alastair Morton]],<ref name=\"regulators\">Sir Alastair Morton left office, early, in October 2001.

The new system included a nationally agreed Code of Conduct laid down by [[Statutory Instrument]] which all local authorities were required to adopt; the Code of Conduct gives guidance on when councillors have an interest in a matter under discussion and when that interest is prejudicial so that the councillor may not speak or vote on the matter. Although on many areas councillors had previously been expected to withdraw where they had declared an interest, the new system made the system more formal and introduced specific sanctions for breaches; it was criticised for preventing councillors from representing the views of their local communities.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511467/Christopher-Booker%27s-notebook.html |title=Christopher Booker's notebook |last=Booker |first=Christopher |date=26 February 2006 |work=Daily Telegraph |access-date=1 October 2008 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nPrescott supported regional government in England. Early in his term, he introduced [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]] (consisting of delegates from local authorities and other regional stakeholders) to oversee the work of new Regional Development Agencies in the regions of England. Following Labour's second election victory, he pressed for the introduction of elected regional assemblies, which would have seen about 25 to 35 members elected under a similar electoral system to that used for the [[London Assembly]]. However, because of opposition, the government was forced to hold regional referendums on the change. The first three were intended to be in the North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and the Humber. The [[2004 Northern England devolution referendums|North-East referendum]] in November 2004 was first (where support was felt to be strongest) but resulted in an overwhelming vote of 78% against. As a consequence, the plan for elected regional assemblies was shelved.\n\n=== Housing ===\nA rising number of households (especially in the south-east) were putting added pressure on housing during Prescott's tenure as the minister responsible. An increase in the housebuilding was proposed, primarily on ''[[brownfield land|brownfield]]'' sites, but also on some undeveloped ''[[greenfield land|greenfield]]'' areas and as a result he was accused of undermining the [[green belt (UK)|Green Belt]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/50935.stm |title=Labour homes policy comes under fire |date=27 January 1998 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908154837/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/50935.stm |archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/142260.stm |title=MPs criticise Prescott's 'vague' building policy |date=30 July 1998 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040721150143/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/142260.stm |archive-date=21 July 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/473394.stm |title=Prescott under pressure over housing |date=13 October 1999 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908153808/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/473394.stm |archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1305209.stm |title=Tories pledge to protect greenbelt |date=30 April 2001 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908153625/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1305209.stm |archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref> During a radio interview in January 1998, Prescott was asked about housing development on the green belt; intending to convey that the government would enlarge green belt protection, Prescott replied: \"It's a Labour achievement, and we mean to build on it\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Passing comment \u2013 Quote |date=31 January 1998 |work=The Times |page=8}}</ref> He had not intended to make a joke and was distressed when it prompted laughter.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Deputy Prescott, a son of a gun but one of a dangerous breed |last=Oppenheim |first=Phillip |date=11 July 1999 |work=The Sunday Times |page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn the north of England, Prescott approved the demolition of some 200,000 homes that were judged to be in \"failing areas\" as part of his ''[[Neighbourhood Management Pathfinder Programme|Pathfinder]]'' regeneration scheme.

(born 31 May 1938) is a British [[politician]] who was the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1997 to 2007 and [[First Secretary of State]] from 2001 to 2007. Born in [[Prestatyn]], [[Wales]], he represented [[Kingston upon Hull East (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingston upon Hull East]] as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] to [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]]. In the [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|1994 leadership election]], he stood for both [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader]] and [[Deputy Leader of the British Labour Party|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]], winning election to the latter office. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister after Labour's victory in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]], with an expanded brief as [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions]].\n\nA former ship's steward and trade union activist, by the 1990s he was presented as the political link to the working class in a Labour party increasingly led by modernising, middle-class professionals such as [[Tony Blair]] and [[Peter Mandelson]]. In his youth he failed the [[eleven-plus]] exam entrance examination for [[grammar school]], but went on to graduate from [[Ruskin College]] and the [[University of Hull]]. Prescott also developed a reputation as a key conciliator in the often stormy relationship between [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] Tony Blair and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]].\n\nOn 27 June 2007 he resigned as Deputy Prime Minister, coinciding with Blair's resignation as Prime Minister. Following an election within the Labour party, he was replaced as Deputy Leader by [[Harriet Harman]]. Prescott retired as an MP at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]]. On 8 July 2010, he entered the [[House of Lords]] as a [[life peer]] with the title Baron Prescott, of [[Kingston upon Hull]] in the County of [[East Yorkshire]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/lp1958%20p.htm |title=Life Peerages \u2013 P |publisher=Cracroft's Peerage |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823041922/http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/lp1958%20p.htm |archive-date=23 August 2018 |access-date=21 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nPrescott stood as the Labour candidate in the [[2012 England and Wales Police and Crime Commissioner elections|election]] to be the first [[Police and Crime Commissioner]] for [[Humberside Police]],<ref name=\"BBCPolice\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18490964 |title=Lord Prescott aims for Humberside police job |date=18 June 2012 |work=BBC News |access-date=19 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619055244/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18490964 |archive-date=19 June 2012 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> but lost to Conservative [[Matthew Grove]].<ref name=\"BBCresultsPCC\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20354044 |title=Police election results |date=16 November 2012 |work=BBC News |access-date=16 November 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116170955/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20354044 |archive-date=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 February 2015, it was announced that Prescott would return to politics as a special adviser to then-Labour leader, [[Ed Miliband]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31570861 |title=John Prescott set to return to front-line politics |date=22 February 2015 |work=BBC News |access-date=23 February 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222110244/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31570861 |archive-date=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nThe son of John Herbert Prescott, a [[signalman (rail)|railway signalman]] and Labour councillor, and Phyllis, and the grandson of a miner, Prescott was born in [[Prestatyn]], [[Wales]], on 31 May 1938.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/john-prescott-a-streetfighting-man-685220.html |title=John Prescott: A street-fighting man |last=O'Grady |first=Sean |date=19 May 2001 |work=The Independent |access-date=7 September 2011 |location=London}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name=\"Pauline\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7316296/Smile-Though-Your-Heart-is-Breaking-by-Pauline-Prescott-review.html |title=Smile Though Your Heart is Breaking by Pauline Prescott: review |last=Lewis |first=Roger |date=27 February 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=7 September 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104005404/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7316296/Smile-Though-Your-Heart-is-Breaking-by-Pauline-Prescott-review.html |archive-date=4 November 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/public_life/john_prescott.shtml |title=BBC-North East Wales public life -John Prescott |date=February 2009 |website=BBC-North East Wales website |publisher=BBC |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228165613/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/public_life/john_prescott.shtml |archive-date=28 December 2009 |access-date=7 September 2011}}</ref> In 2009, he said: \"I've always felt very proud of Wales and being Welsh...I was born in Wales, went to school in Wales and my mother was Welsh.

The subsequent debate on [[road pricing]] evolved from his policy. A contrast was highlighted between Prescott's transport brief and an incident, in 1999, when an official chauffeur-driven car was used to transport Prescott and his wife {{Convert|250|yd|m}} from their hotel to the venue of the Labour Party Conference, where Prescott gave a speech on how to encourage the use of public transport.

He had vigorously opposed the privatisation of the industry while the Labour Party was in opposition, and disliked the party's policy, established in 1996 just before the [[Initial public offering|flotation]] of [[Railtrack]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]], of committing to [[nationalisation|renationalise]] the industry only when resources allowed, which he saw as meaning that it would never be done.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Reluctantly, he supported the alternative policy, produced by then shadow transport secretary [[Clare Short]], that the industry should be subjected to closer regulation by the to-be-created [[Strategic Rail Authority]] (in the case of the passenger train operators) and the [[Rail Regulator]] (in the case of the monopoly and dominant elements in the industry, principally Railtrack). The policy was spelled out in some detail in the Labour Party's statement in the June 1996 prospectus for the sale of Railtrack shares, and was widely regarded as having depressed the price of the shares.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn 1998, Prescott was criticised by Transport Minister [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] for his statement \u2013 at the Labour Party conference that year \u2013 that the privatised railway was a \"national disgrace\", despite receiving a standing ovation from the Labour Party audience.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/183627.stm |title=Trains a 'national disgrace' |date=1 October 1998 |work=BBC |access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref> The companies felt that they had had some considerable successes in cutting costs and generating new revenues in the short time since their transfer to private sector hands, and that the criticisms were premature and unfair.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Glaister |first=Stephen |title=OCCASIONAL PAPER 23: BRITISH RAIL PRIVATISATION ~ COMPETITION DESTROYED BY POLITICS |url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/management/cri/pubpdf/Occasional_Papers/23_Glaister.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Centre for the Study of Regulated Industries |publisher=University of Bath |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219064837/http://www.bath.ac.uk/management/cri/pubpdf/Occasional_Papers/23_Glaister.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2016 |access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn that speech, Prescott also announced that he would be taking a far tougher line with the companies, and to that end he would be having a \"spring clean\" of the industry.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/archive/prescott-gives-signal-for-rail-improvement-08-10-1998/ |title=Prescott gives signal for rail improvement |last=Anderson |first=Graham |date=8 October 1998 |work=Construction News |access-date=19 February 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113124643/https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/archive/prescott-gives-signal-for-rail-improvement-08-10-1998/ |archive-date=13 January 2020}}</ref> This meant that the incumbent [[Director of Passenger Rail Franchising]] \u2013 John O'Brien \u2013 and the Rail Regulator [[John Swift QC]] \u2013 both appointed by the previous [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, would have to make way for new Labour appointees.\n\nIn July 1998, Prescott, published a transport White Paper stating that the rail industry needed an element of stability and certainty if it was to plan its activities effectively.<ref>Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, ''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090224114933/http://www.dft.gov.uk/162259/187604/A_new_deal_for_transport_be1.pdf A new deal for transport: better for everyone]'', Cm 3950, July 1998, para 4.22</ref>\n\nIn February 1999, the regulation of the passenger rail operators fell to Sir [[Alastair Morton]],<ref name=\"regulators\">Sir Alastair Morton left office, early, in October 2001.

In July 1999, the new Rail Regulator appointed by Prescott was [[Tom Winsor]].<ref name=\"regulators\" /> They shared Prescott's view that the railway industry needed a considerable shake-up in its institutional, operational, engineering and economic matrix to attract and retain private investment and enable the companies within it to become strong, competent and successful.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1999/jul/19/railways-bill |title=Railways Bill (Hansard, 19 July 1999), House of Commons Debate cc789-893 |website=hansard.millbanksystems.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604150341/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1999/jul/19/railways-bill |archive-date=4 June 2016 |access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Local and regional government ===\nResponsible for local government, Prescott introduced a new system guiding members' conduct after 2001. The new system included a nationally agreed Code of Conduct laid down by [[Statutory Instrument]] which all local authorities were required to adopt; the Code of Conduct gives guidance on when councillors have an interest in a matter under discussion and when that interest is prejudicial so that the councillor may not speak or vote on the matter. Although on many areas councillors had previously been expected to withdraw where they had declared an interest, the new system made the system more formal and introduced specific sanctions for breaches; it was criticised for preventing councillors from representing the views of their local communities.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511467/Christopher-Booker%27s-notebook.html |title=Christopher Booker's notebook |last=Booker |first=Christopher |date=26 February 2006 |work=Daily Telegraph |access-date=1 October 2008 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nPrescott supported regional government in England. Early in his term, he introduced [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]] (consisting of delegates from local authorities and other regional stakeholders) to oversee the work of new Regional Development Agencies in the regions of England. Following Labour's second election victory, he pressed for the introduction of elected regional assemblies, which would have seen about 25 to 35 members elected under a similar electoral system to that used for the [[London Assembly]]. However, because of opposition, the government was forced to hold regional referendums on the change. The first three were intended to be in the North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and the Humber. The [[2004 Northern England devolution referendums|North-East referendum]] in November 2004 was first (where support was felt to be strongest) but resulted in an overwhelming vote of 78% against. As a consequence, the plan for elected regional assemblies was shelved.\n\n=== Housing ===\nA rising number of households (especially in the south-east) were putting added pressure on housing during Prescott's tenure as the minister responsible. An increase in the housebuilding was proposed, primarily on ''[[brownfield land|brownfield]]'' sites, but also on some undeveloped ''[[greenfield land|greenfield]]'' areas and as a result he was accused of undermining the [[green belt (UK)|Green Belt]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/50935.stm |title=Labour homes policy comes under fire |date=27 January 1998 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908154837/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/50935.stm |archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/142260.stm |title=MPs criticise Prescott's 'vague' building policy |date=30 July 1998 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040721150143/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/142260.stm |archive-date=21 July 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/473394.stm |title=Prescott under pressure over housing |date=13 October 1999 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908153808/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/473394.stm |archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1305209.stm |title=Tories pledge to protect greenbelt |date=30 April 2001 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908153625/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1305209.stm |archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref> During a radio interview in January 1998, Prescott was asked about housing development on the green belt; intending to convey that the government would enlarge green belt protection, Prescott replied: \"It's a Labour achievement, and we mean to build on it\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Passing comment \u2013 Quote |date=31 January 1998 |work=The Times |page=8}}</ref> He had not intended to make a joke and was distressed when it prompted laughter.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Deputy Prescott, a son of a gun but one of a dangerous breed |last=Oppenheim |first=Phillip |date=11 July 1999 |work=The Sunday Times |page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn the north of England, Prescott approved the demolition of some 200,000 homes that were judged to be in \"failing areas\" as part of his ''[[Neighbourhood Management Pathfinder Programme|Pathfinder]]'' regeneration scheme.

House [of] Jacob) is a [[genericized]] name for full-time [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] elementary and secondary schools for Jewish girls throughout the world. \n\nBais Yaakov, started by [[Sarah Schenirer]] in post-World War I\n[[Krak\u00f3w]], was at the time a revolutionary approach to Jewish women's education. It has since achieved mainstream status within Orthodox Judaism, with branches located worldwide in every Jewish community with a significant population. \n\nWhile many of these schools carry the Bais Yaakov name, they are not necessarily affiliated, though they may be for other reasons.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|300px|The second graduating class of the Bais Ya'akov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nThe Bais Yaakov movement was started by seamstress [[Sarah Schenirer]] in 1917 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Carry Me In Your Heart|last = Benisch|first = Pearl|publisher = Feldheim|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> The first school building survives as apartments, and is marked with a bronze plaque.\n\nWhile boys attended [[cheder]] and [[Talmud Torah]] schools (and in some cases [[yeshiva]]s), at that time there was no formalized system of Jewish education for girls and young Jewish women.\n\nSchenirer saw that there was a high rate of assimilation among girls due to the vast secular influences of the non-Jewish schools that the girls were then attending. Sarah Schenirer concluded that only providing young Jewish women with a thorough, school-based Jewish education would effectively combat this phenomenon. She started a school of her own, trained other women to teach, and set up similar schools in other cities throughout [[Europe]].\n\nShe obtained the approval of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (author of ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]''), who issued a [[responsum]] holding that contemporary conditions required departing from traditional prohibitions on teaching women Torah and accepting the view that it was permitted. Following the Chofetz Chaim's approbation, the Bais Yaakov Movement in Poland was taken under the wing of [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]]. Additionally, she sought and received approbation from [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] rabbis as well, most notably the [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer rebbe)|Belzer Rebbe]] and the [[Avraham Mordechai Alter|Gerrer Rebbe]].<ref>\"From Sarah to Sarah\" by S. Feldbrand1976</ref> The original Bais Yaakov was a seminary of sorts, intended to train girls to themselves become teachers and spread the Bais Yaakov movement.\n\nGirls who were taught in the Bais Yaakov movement used their education as psychological support to survive World War II and [[the Holocaust]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=To Vanquish the Dragon|last=Benisch|first=Pearl|publisher=Feldheim|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Jews who came to [[North America]], [[Israel]], and other places established girls' schools of the same name, although some{{who|date=July 2019}} claim that the educational philosophy differs slightly from that of the original Bais Yaakov schools.\n\nBesides elementary and high schools, there are also post-secondary schools in the Bais Yaakov system, usually referred to as seminaries. These run various courses generally lasting between one and three years. There are also post-secondary schools that combine Torah education with practical workforce skills, such as computer programming, education, and graphic arts.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Bais Yaakov comes from a verse in the [[Book of Exodus]] in which the term \"House of Jacob\" is understood by [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] to refer to the female segment of the Jewish nation.<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus|19:3}}</ref>\n\n== Current ==\n=== Educational approach ===\nThe educational policies of most Bais Yaakov schools worldwide is generally that of [[Haredi Judaism]] and the [[Agudath Israel movement]]. In accordance with the differences between the Israeli and Diaspora Haredi communities, there are slight variations in outlook and philosophy between Israeli, American and European Bais Yaakov schools. Israeli Bais Yaakov schools tend to de-emphasize the secular content of the [[curriculum]], whereas in North America and Europe the girls frequently receive a more diverse secular education. Large cities may have several Bais Yaakov schools, each with small variations in philosophy, typically over the importance placed on secular studies and/or accommodations made to secular values.\n\nStudents are required to uphold a dress code or wear uniforms which conform to the rules of ''[[tzniut|tznius]]'' (modesty). Uniforms differ from school to school but typically consist of a long pleated skirt, [[oxford shirt]], and sweater or sweatshirt.\n\nThe schools' primary purpose is to prepare students to be contributors to family and community, as good [[Jew]]s, wives, professionals, and mothers. \n\nSecular studies sometimes reflect government proficiency requirements in such subjects as math, science, literature and history in their respective countries.\n\n=== Curriculum ===\nMost non-Hasidic Bais Yaakov schools in America teach Judaic studies in the mornings and a college preparatory program of secular studies in the afternoons. Judaic studies usually include study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] ([[Pentateuch]]), [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets), and other parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]]; and instruction in [[Hebrew language]], [[Jewish history]] and the study of practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), sometimes directly from the text, and other times as a summary of classic ''halakha'' sources.\n\nOne of the tenets of [[Orthodox Judaism]] is that it is impossible to fully understand the written Torah without the Jewish commentaries, so Bais Yaakov girls are taught the [[Tanakh]] through this approach. A major focus is on [[Rashi]], considered the foremost Torah commentator.\n\nThe curriculum of Bais Yaakov differs from that of male-only [[yeshiva]]s, where the core component of study is the [[Talmud]]. Girls in Bais Yaakov schools do not learn law from the text of the Talmud itself, but may study its non-legal portions of ''[[aggadah]]'' (homiletics). This contrasts with the approach of many [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] [[Jewish day school]]s, which increasingly teach Talmud to women.\n\n=== Locations ===\n[[Image:\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \"\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1\" \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, \u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1 (1).jpg|thumb|250px|Beit Yaakov teachers' Seminary, [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.]]\nBranches exist in most North American cities with large [[:Category:Orthodox Jewish communities|populations of Orthodox Jews]] such as New York City, Montreal, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Toronto, [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], and in most Israeli cities. Bais Yaakov-type schools are also found in major Jewish centers in Europe, such as London, [[Manchester]], [[Antwerp]] and Moscow, and in other Jewish centers around the world, Including [[Johannesburg, South Africa|Johannesburg]].\n\nPre-war locations included over 260 towns and cities in Poland, with its central teachers' seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n\n== Hasidic schools ==\nSchools for girls within the Hasidic world share the same values, outlook, methodology, and aims of the non-Hasidic Haredi schools. However, they may place a greater emphasis on the teachings of their individual Hasidic [[Rebbe]]s and much of the instruction may be conducted in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], which is still the home language for most Hasidic families in the world today. Also, in many Hasidic Beis Yaakov schools in Israel, English is often not taught, which is not the case in other Bais Yaakov schools.\n\nSchools for young Hasidic girls which are not part of the Bais Yaakov movement take names such as:\n\n* [[Beth Rivkah|Bais Rivkah]], Bnos Menachem, Bnos Rabbeinu, Bais [[Chaya Mushka Schneerson|Chaya Mushka]], or [[Bais Chana Women International|Bais Chana]] for the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] girls' schools.\n*  Bnos Zion for the [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]] girls' schools.\n*  Bnos Belz or Beis Malka for [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]] girls' schools.\n*  Bnos Vizhnitz for [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]] girls' schools.\n*  Beis Rochel schools for girls of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] community, as well as some girls' schools of related Hasidic groups (often of Hungarian background). \n\nThese schools follow a different curriculum of Judaic studies, which is less text-based and more focused on practical knowledge than the curriculum in other schools. Within their communities, these schools are usually referred to as offering education ''al pi taharas kodesh'', roughly translating as \"holy, pure education\".\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Mesivta]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/schenirer-sarah/ Jewish Women's Archive: Sarah Schenirer]\n*[https://thebaisyaakovproject.com/ The Bais Yaakov Project]\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n\n[[Category:Orthodox Jewish schools for women]]\n[[Category:Jewish organizations established in 1917]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=May 2011}}\n:''For the neighborhood in Jerusalem, see [[Beit Ya'akov, Jerusalem|Beit Ya'akov]].''\n[[Image:Beit yaaaak.JPG|thumb|300px|Beit Yaacov students praying at the Western Wall.]]\n'''Bais Yaakov''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1}} also Beis Yaakov, Beit Yaakov or Beth Jacob; lit.
