He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref> \n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]].

The duchies of Saxony and Lorraine were in opposition to his rule, as well as his cousin Conrad of Carinthia. To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]. The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Conrad was crowned as Emperor on March 26, 1027, by [[Pope John XIX]].]]\nOn March 26, 1027, [[Pope John XIX]] crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and Empress, respectively, in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=102}} The coronation was attended by [[Cnut the Great|Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway]], [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and 70 high-ranking clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan, and Ravenna.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}} Conrad's son and heir [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] also  attended. Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=209}}\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.<ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 71\">Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref>\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary. Under Conrad, however, relations quickly turned hostile as Conrad pursued a more aggressive policy regarding eastern Europe.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p = 90}} Conrad II expelled Venetian Doge [[Otto Orseolo]], the husband of Stephen's sister [[Grimelda of Hungary]], from Venice in 1026.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p = 90}}{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 148}} Conrad also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], as their duke in 1027, although Stephen's son, [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric of Hungary]], had a strong claim to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] through his mother.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 187}}\n\nEmperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Werner of Strasbourg]], to Constantinople.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp = 197-198}} The bishop seemingly traveled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country in the autumn of 1027.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp = 197-198}} Conrad's biographer, [[Wipo of Burgundy]] recorded that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common Imperial-Hungarian border in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149}}{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|2003|p = 74}} In 1030, open conflict erupted. Conrad launched an invasion of Hungary, but had to retreat when the Hungarians successfully used [[scorched earth tactics]]. Conrad left matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he could address his problems with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II. In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}}\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass window, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|280px|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]]. Henry married [[Gunhilda of Denmark]], daughter of King [[Canute the Great]] of [[England]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]] by [[Emma of Normandy]]. This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.<ref name=\"Bolton2017\">{{cite book|author=Timothy Bolton|title=Cnut the Great p. 162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ssCDgAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-20833-7}}</ref> Henry, who would later become Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], became his father's chief counselor.\n<!-- likely redundant paragraphs:\n\nConrad campaigned unsuccessfully against [[Poland]] in 1028\u20131030. In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\n-->\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans. Thus he effectively elevates the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority. By this assignment only, one reserves the rights for the office of Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\"/>\n\n===Second Italian expedition===\n\nIn 1038, Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over [[Capua]] with its Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf]], whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|150px|Conrad II's tomb in the [[Speyer Cathedral]]]]\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops. Conrad's daughter-in-law and stepson died. Conrad himself returned home safely and held court on important occasions in [[Solothurn]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Goslar]]. His son Henry was invested with the duchies of Swabia and Carinthia.{{sfn|North|2001|p=143}}\n\nA year later in 1039 Conrad fell ill and died of [[gout]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345}} His heart and bowels are buried at the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345-346}} His body was transferred to Speyer via [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], where the funeral procession made stops. His body is buried at Speyer Cathedral, which was still under construction at this time. During a major excavation in 1900 his sarcophagus was relocated from his original resting place in front of the altar to the crypt, where it is still visible today along with those of seven of his successors.\n\nA biography of Conrad II in chronicle form, ''Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris'', was written by his chaplain [[Wipo of Burgundy]], and presented to Henry III in 1046, not long after he was crowned.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Family and children==\n{{see also|Kings of Germany family tree}}\nConrad married Gisela of Swabia in 1016, the daughter of Duke Herman II of Swabia.

The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role of the Church and the status and affairs of Italy. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref> \n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The duchies of Saxony and Lorraine were in opposition to his rule, as well as his cousin Conrad of Carinthia. To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]. The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=209}}\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.<ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 71\">Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref>\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

[[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute.

This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.<ref name=\"Bolton2017\">{{cite book|author=Timothy Bolton|title=Cnut the Great p. 162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ssCDgAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-20833-7}}</ref> Henry, who would later become Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], became his father's chief counselor.\n<!-- likely redundant paragraphs:\n\nConrad campaigned unsuccessfully against [[Poland]] in 1028\u20131030. In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\n-->\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans. Thus he effectively elevates the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority. By this assignment only, one reserves the rights for the office of Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\"/>\n\n===Second Italian expedition===\n\nIn 1038, Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over [[Capua]] with its Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf]], whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|150px|Conrad II's tomb in the [[Speyer Cathedral]]]]\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops. Conrad's daughter-in-law and stepson died. Conrad himself returned home safely and held court on important occasions in [[Solothurn]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Goslar]]. His son Henry was invested with the duchies of Swabia and Carinthia.{{sfn|North|2001|p=143}}\n\nA year later in 1039 Conrad fell ill and died of [[gout]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345}} His heart and bowels are buried at the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345-346}} His body was transferred to Speyer via [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], where the funeral procession made stops. His body is buried at Speyer Cathedral, which was still under construction at this time. During a major excavation in 1900 his sarcophagus was relocated from his original resting place in front of the altar to the crypt, where it is still visible today along with those of seven of his successors.\n\nA biography of Conrad II in chronicle form, ''Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris'', was written by his chaplain [[Wipo of Burgundy]], and presented to Henry III in 1046, not long after he was crowned.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Family and children==\n{{see also|Kings of Germany family tree}}\nConrad married Gisela of Swabia in 1016, the daughter of Duke Herman II of Swabia.

The proposed station was sited where the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|Newcastle bypass road]] was ultimately built.\n* '''High Lane Row''' (between Hebburn and Jarrow): Construction to go ahead if the current single track is dualled. Both track dualling and this station are included in the latest proposals to central government.\n* '''Pallion Bridge''' (between South Hylton and Pallion): Proposed to be built when Ford Estate and the former Grove Cranes site are redeveloped for business and residential use, and the [[New Wear Bridge]] is completed, opening up new areas of patronage in the [[Castletown, Sunderland|Castletown]], [[Ford Estate]], Hylton Riverside and Alexandra Park areas.\n* '''Stotts Road''' (between Walkergate and Wallsend): Proposed in the mid-1980s.\n* '''Victoria Road West''' (between Pelaw and Hebburn): Mooted by [[South Tyneside]] government officials in 2008.

The proposed station was sited where the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|Newcastle bypass road]] was ultimately built.\n* '''High Lane Row''' (between Hebburn and Jarrow): Construction to go ahead if the current single track is dualled. Both track dualling and this station are included in the latest proposals to central government.\n* '''Pallion Bridge''' (between South Hylton and Pallion): Proposed to be built when Ford Estate and the former Grove Cranes site are redeveloped for business and residential use, and the [[New Wear Bridge]] is completed, opening up new areas of patronage in the [[Castletown, Sunderland|Castletown]], [[Ford Estate]], Hylton Riverside and Alexandra Park areas.\n* '''Stotts Road''' (between Walkergate and Wallsend): Proposed in the mid-1980s.\n* '''Victoria Road West''' (between Pelaw and Hebburn): Mooted by [[South Tyneside]] government officials in 2008.

The 26th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film was directed by [[Burny Mattinson]], David Michener, and the team of [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]], who later directed ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992). The film was also known as '''''The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective''''' for its 1992 theatrical re-release and '''''Basil the Great Mouse Detective''''' in some countries. The main characters are all [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s living in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London.\n\nBased on the children's book series ''[[Basil of Baker Street]]'' by [[Eve Titus]], it draws heavily on the tradition of [[Sherlock Holmes]] with a heroic mouse who consciously emulates the detective; Titus named the main character after actor [[Basil Rathbone]], who is best remembered for [[Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes#Film|playing Holmes in film]] (and whose voice, sampled from a 1966 reading of \"[[The Red-Headed League]]\"<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> was the voice of Holmes in this film, 19 years after his death). Sherlock Holmes also mentions \"Basil\" as one of his aliases in the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] story \"[[The Adventure of Black Peter]]\".\n\n''The Great Mouse Detective'' was released to theaters on July 2, 1986 to positive reviews and financial success, in sharp contrast to the box office under-performance of Disney's previous animated feature film ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985). As such, the new senior management of the company were convinced that their animation department was still a viable enterprise and this set the stage for the [[Disney Renaissance]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 694 words. -->\nIn London in June 1897, a young mouse named Olivia Flaversham is celebrating her birthday with her [[wikt:toymaker|toymaker]] father, Hiram. Suddenly, a bat with a crippled wing and a [[peg leg]] bursts into the Flaversham's workshop, kidnapping Hiram. Olivia searches to find the famed Great Mouse Detective named Basil of Baker Street, but gets lost. A surgeon named Dr. David Q. Dawson, who has just returned from a lengthy service of the Mouse Queen's 66th Regiment in Afghanistan, meets Olivia, and escorts her to Basil's residence. Upon their arrival, Basil is initially indifferent, but when Olivia mentions the peg-legged bat that kidnapped her father, Basil realizes that Olivia saw Fidget, a henchman of Professor Ratigan, a villain that Basil has attempted to arrest for years. It is then revealed that Ratigan kidnapped Hiram to create a [[clockwork]] [[robot]], which mimics the Queen of the Mice so that Ratigan can rule England. Hiram initially refuses to participate in the scheme, but capitulates when Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia. Ratigan then announces his plans to kill the Queen and become \"supreme ruler of all mousedom\" to his henchmen.\n\nMeanwhile, Fidget appears through the window, and they give chase. Basil, along with Dawson and Olivia, take Toby, [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s pet [[Basset Hound]], to track down Fidget's scent, where they locate him in a toyshop stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers' uniforms. Fidget ambushes Olivia and kidnaps her. Basil and Dawson pursue Fidget, but become entangled and fall behind. While searching the shop, Dawson discovers Fidget's checklist, to which Basil does some chemical tests to discover the list came from a riverfront near the [[Thames]]. Basil and Dawson disguise themselves as sailors and head to a tavern called the \"Rat Trap\". They find Fidget and follow him to Ratigan's headquarters, but they're caught in an ambush by Ratigan. Ratigan has them tied to a spring-loaded mousetrap connected with a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] laid out to kill them both. Ratigan sets out for [[Buckingham Palace]], where his henchman kidnap the queen. Basil deduces the trap's weakness and escapes along with Dawson and Olivia just in time.\n\nAt Buckingham Palace, Ratigan forces Hiram to operate the toy Queen, while the real one is taken to be fed to Felicia, Ratigan's pet cat. The toy Queen declares Ratigan the ruler of all Mousedom, and he announces his tyrannical plans for his new \"subjects\". After Basil, Dawson, and Olivia save Hiram and the real Queen, they restrain Fidget and Ratigan's other henchmen. Basil seizes control of the mechanical queen, making it denounce Ratigan as a fraud and tyrant while breaking it into pieces. The crowd, enraged by Ratigan's [[treason]], turns on him, and he escapes on his [[dirigible]] with Fidget, holding Olivia hostage. Basil, Dawson, and Hiram create their own craft with a matchbox and some small [[helium]]-filled balloons, held together by the [[Union Jack]]. Ratigan tosses Fidget overboard to lighten the load, and he attempts to drive the dirigible himself. Basil jumps onto the dirigible to confront Ratigan, causing it to crash straight into the [[Big Ben]] clocktower.\n\nInside the clocktower, Basil manages to get Ratigan's cape stuck on some gears. He rescues Olivia and safely delivers her to Hiram. Ratigan breaks free and attacks Basil, eventually knocking him to the dirigible. When the [[striking clock|clock strikes 10:00]], the bell hits for the loudest sound, and Ratigan falls to his death, taking Basil with him. However, Basil grabs a part of Ratigan's dirigible and saves himself. Back at Baker Street, Basil and Dawson recount their adventures. After the Flavershams leave the house, a distraught new client arrives and solicits Basil and Dawson's help, with Basil noting that Dawson is his trusted associate, prompting Dawson to remain and assist Basil.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Barrie Ingham]] as Basil, a Mouse detective. \n* [[Vincent Price]] as Professor Ratigan, Basil's nemesis. He and Basil are long-established arch-enemies.\n* [[Val Bettin]] as Major Dr. David Q. Dawson, previously of the Queen's [[66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot|66th Regiment]] in [[Afghanistan]]. He eventually becomes Basil's associate, friend, and personal biographer. Dawson also serves as the film's narrator.\n* [[Susanne Pollatschek]] as Olivia Flaversham, an eight-year-old Scottish mouse who seeks Basil's help in finding her toymaker father.\n* [[Candy Candido]] as Fidget, Ratigan's bumbling [[bat]] right-hand henchman. He has a crippled wing and a peg leg, and, as a result, he cannot fly.

The 26th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film was directed by [[Burny Mattinson]], David Michener, and the team of [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]], who later directed ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992). The film was also known as '''''The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective''''' for its 1992 theatrical re-release and '''''Basil the Great Mouse Detective''''' in some countries. The main characters are all [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s living in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London.\n\nBased on the children's book series ''[[Basil of Baker Street]]'' by [[Eve Titus]], it draws heavily on the tradition of [[Sherlock Holmes]] with a heroic mouse who consciously emulates the detective; Titus named the main character after actor [[Basil Rathbone]], who is best remembered for [[Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes#Film|playing Holmes in film]] (and whose voice, sampled from a 1966 reading of \"[[The Red-Headed League]]\"<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> was the voice of Holmes in this film, 19 years after his death). Sherlock Holmes also mentions \"Basil\" as one of his aliases in the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] story \"[[The Adventure of Black Peter]]\".\n\n''The Great Mouse Detective'' was released to theaters on July 2, 1986 to positive reviews and financial success, in sharp contrast to the box office under-performance of Disney's previous animated feature film ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985). As such, the new senior management of the company were convinced that their animation department was still a viable enterprise and this set the stage for the [[Disney Renaissance]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 694 words. -->\nIn London in June 1897, a young mouse named Olivia Flaversham is celebrating her birthday with her [[wikt:toymaker|toymaker]] father, Hiram. Suddenly, a bat with a crippled wing and a [[peg leg]] bursts into the Flaversham's workshop, kidnapping Hiram. Olivia searches to find the famed Great Mouse Detective named Basil of Baker Street, but gets lost. A surgeon named Dr. David Q. Dawson, who has just returned from a lengthy service of the Mouse Queen's 66th Regiment in Afghanistan, meets Olivia, and escorts her to Basil's residence. Upon their arrival, Basil is initially indifferent, but when Olivia mentions the peg-legged bat that kidnapped her father, Basil realizes that Olivia saw Fidget, a henchman of Professor Ratigan, a villain that Basil has attempted to arrest for years. It is then revealed that Ratigan kidnapped Hiram to create a [[clockwork]] [[robot]], which mimics the Queen of the Mice so that Ratigan can rule England. Hiram initially refuses to participate in the scheme, but capitulates when Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia. Ratigan then announces his plans to kill the Queen and become \"supreme ruler of all mousedom\" to his henchmen.\n\nMeanwhile, Fidget appears through the window, and they give chase. Basil, along with Dawson and Olivia, take Toby, [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s pet [[Basset Hound]], to track down Fidget's scent, where they locate him in a toyshop stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers' uniforms. Fidget ambushes Olivia and kidnaps her. Basil and Dawson pursue Fidget, but become entangled and fall behind. While searching the shop, Dawson discovers Fidget's checklist, to which Basil does some chemical tests to discover the list came from a riverfront near the [[Thames]]. Basil and Dawson disguise themselves as sailors and head to a tavern called the \"Rat Trap\". They find Fidget and follow him to Ratigan's headquarters, but they're caught in an ambush by Ratigan. Ratigan has them tied to a spring-loaded mousetrap connected with a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] laid out to kill them both. Ratigan sets out for [[Buckingham Palace]], where his henchman kidnap the queen. Basil deduces the trap's weakness and escapes along with Dawson and Olivia just in time.\n\nAt Buckingham Palace, Ratigan forces Hiram to operate the toy Queen, while the real one is taken to be fed to Felicia, Ratigan's pet cat. The toy Queen declares Ratigan the ruler of all Mousedom, and he announces his tyrannical plans for his new \"subjects\". After Basil, Dawson, and Olivia save Hiram and the real Queen, they restrain Fidget and Ratigan's other henchmen. Basil seizes control of the mechanical queen, making it denounce Ratigan as a fraud and tyrant while breaking it into pieces. The crowd, enraged by Ratigan's [[treason]], turns on him, and he escapes on his [[dirigible]] with Fidget, holding Olivia hostage. Basil, Dawson, and Hiram create their own craft with a matchbox and some small [[helium]]-filled balloons, held together by the [[Union Jack]]. Ratigan tosses Fidget overboard to lighten the load, and he attempts to drive the dirigible himself. Basil jumps onto the dirigible to confront Ratigan, causing it to crash straight into the [[Big Ben]] clocktower.\n\nInside the clocktower, Basil manages to get Ratigan's cape stuck on some gears. He rescues Olivia and safely delivers her to Hiram. Ratigan breaks free and attacks Basil, eventually knocking him to the dirigible. When the [[striking clock|clock strikes 10:00]], the bell hits for the loudest sound, and Ratigan falls to his death, taking Basil with him. However, Basil grabs a part of Ratigan's dirigible and saves himself. Back at Baker Street, Basil and Dawson recount their adventures. After the Flavershams leave the house, a distraught new client arrives and solicits Basil and Dawson's help, with Basil noting that Dawson is his trusted associate, prompting Dawson to remain and assist Basil.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Barrie Ingham]] as Basil, a Mouse detective. \n* [[Vincent Price]] as Professor Ratigan, Basil's nemesis. He and Basil are long-established arch-enemies.\n* [[Val Bettin]] as Major Dr. David Q. Dawson, previously of the Queen's [[66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot|66th Regiment]] in [[Afghanistan]]. He eventually becomes Basil's associate, friend, and personal biographer.

He has a crippled wing and a peg leg, and, as a result, he cannot fly. Ratigan throws him off the side of his flying machine and he falls into the [[Thames]]. He is revealed to have survived the fall in the book. Candido also voices a reprobate in the pub.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Toby, Basil's loyal [[basset hound]]. He technically belongs to [[Sherlock Holmes]], who lives above Basil. (In the Sherlock Holmes canon, Toby (who is not a basset but \"half [[spaniel]] and half [[lurcher]]\") is owned by a [[Minor Sherlock Holmes characters#Toby|Mr. Sherman]], a \"[[Taxidermy|bird-stuffer]]\" and owner of a menagerie, who willingly lends him to Holmes whenever requested.)\n* [[Alan Young]] as Hiram Flaversham, Olivia's affectionate Scottish father. He works as a toymaker, and is kidnapped by Fidget to make the Queen Mousetoria robot for the evil Ratigan.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Felicia, Ratigan's large and pompous pet cat. Ratigan calls upon her by ringing a special bell to dispose of traitors or anyone who makes him angry. She is chased by Toby, only to be mauled by Royal Guard Dogs during the climax of the film.\n* Diana Chesney as Mrs. Judson, Basil's housekeeper. She adores Basil, but gets very annoyed when he mistreats her good pillows by shooting them with a [[pistol]]. \n* Eve Brenner as Queen Mousetoria, the mouse queen of England, whom Ratigan attempts to depose. \n* [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]], the famous human detective who lives above Basil. His voice is taken from the 1966 Caedmon Records recording of the Sherlock Holmes story \"[[The Red-Headed League]]\".<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> \n* [[Laurie Main]] as [[Doctor Watson|Dr. Watson]], the medical associate/partner of Sherlock Holmes, who also lives above Basil.

Veteran layout artist Joe Hale is credited with suggesting to adapt the children's book series ''[[Basil of Baker Street]]'' by [[Eve Titus]], but the project fell into development limbo because of the similarities to ''The Rescuers''.<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> In 1982, Ron Clements proposed adapting the children's book series into an animated feature and, along with story artist Pete Young, it was pitched to Disney President and CEO [[Ron W.

Miller became the producer for the film. The first idea for the victim was for Olivia\u2014then an older and potential love interest whom Dawson falls for, but Miller suggested the character to be \"a little girl, someone they [the audience] can feel sorry for.\" One of the dropped characters was a stool pigeon who always hung around Buckingham Palace and tipped Basil off about the skullduggery. The writers dropped the characters deciding for Basil to figure it out for himself.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=176}}\n  \nWith the departure of Miller in 1984, the board of directors appointed [[Michael Eisner]], who had resigned from [[Paramount Pictures]], to become the new CEO. Eisner recruited former production head [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] to become studio chairman over Disney's film division. Following a story reel screening of ''Basil'', Eisner and Katzenberg complained about the slow pacing of the story and ordered for rewrites before animation would commence.

Chief among these was the concern that the construction of excess hospital capacity would cause competitors in an oversaturated field to cover the costs of a diluted patient pool by overcharging, or by convincing patients to accept hospitalization unnecessarily.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The U.S. healthcare certificate of need sourcebook|last=Cimasi|first=Robert James|publisher=Beard Books|year=2005|isbn=9781587982750|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2|oclc=63110526}}</ref>\n\nIn some instances where state and federal authorities overlap, federal regulations may defer authority from the federal agency to the state agency with concurrent authority as to the issuance of a certificate of need. However, deferment of this authority is not required. For example, the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD ) issued the following determination:\n\n{{quote|HUD conducts the same analysis of need whether or not the state has a CON process. There is wide variation in the methods CON states use to decide whether or not to issue a certificate. HUD believes that the Act's required need assessment is best performed using a method that is applied consistently to hospitals in all states. Should the state's CON process and HUD's assessment of need reach differing conclusions on the need for a proposed project, HUD will review the case closely to determine if its conclusion should be changed.<ref>[[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing \u2013 Federal Housing Commissioner, [[Federal Register]], Vol. 72, No. 228 (72 FR 67524, 67531), issued November 28, 2007.</ref>}}\n\nCONs are sometimes sold in bankruptcy as an asset,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1992-01-30-9201290992-story.html|title=ORMC VYING FOR DELTONA SPOT|last=Straight|first=Harry|date=1992-01-30|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502022040/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1992-01-30-9201290992-story.html|archive-date=2019-05-02|url-status=live|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> and the CON requirement is sometimes used by competitors to block the reopening of existing hospitals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/court-upholds-certificate-of-need-issued-to-humc-at-pascack-valley-1.338668|title=North Jersey News and Information &#124; NorthJersey.com}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nSince new hospitals cannot be constructed without proving a \"need\", the certificate-of-need system grants monopoly privileges to already existing hospitals.
