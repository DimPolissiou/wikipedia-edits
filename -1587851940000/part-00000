[[Barry Bostwick]] and [[Patricia Richardson]] portray Jeffrey Wyatt, a struggling widowed father with identical triplet teenage daughters, and Cassie McGuire, his snobbish, jealous girlfriend. Leanna, Monica, and Joy Creel portray Lisa, Jessie, and Megan Wyatt.\n\n==Plot==\nJeffrey Wyatt is the widowed father of identical triplet teenage daughters, Lisa, Jessie, and Megan. As he picks his daughters up from the airport, he neglects to tell them over the summer he has become engaged to Cassie McGuire. Cassie wants to redesign their California beach house with the help of house designer Susan Evers. Jeffrey initially doesn't like Susan's ideas, but comes around to allowing them due to Cassie.\n\nLisa, who is dating David, has invited a boy she met in Paris named Hawk, a \"bad boy\" to eat at their house. She doesn't know how to break it to him that she finds Hawk \"more unpredictable\". She asks Jessie to pretend to be Lisa on a date with David, so Lisa can go on a date with Hawk while their father goes on a date with Cassie, Susan, and Nick (Ray Baker) his best friend. As the adults are getting ready for their double date, Susan compliments Jessie going out with David, almost exposing the ruse until Jeffrey innocently jokes he confuses the girls occasionally. At their date, Jessie is bewildered to be at a \"Welcome Home Lisa\" party with all of their friends. She embarrasses herself during a karaoke dance skit called \"The Jackson Three\" (a parody of the [[Jackson Five]]), singing the [[Janet Jackson]] song \"[[What Have You Done for Me Lately]]\". \n\nHawk is not wanting to settle down and be Lisa's boyfriend. He asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. Later that night, Jeffrey figures out the switch and grounds the girls for three weeks, with David disappointed in Lisa and Jessie. Lisa unleashes her feelings and tells Jeffrey that she doesn't like the jealous, snobbish Cassie, and neither do her sisters. The next morning, Susan speaks with Jessie and Megan, saying her earlier compliment was not an honest mistake, but that she suspected Lisa and Jessie were switching identities, and even shows them a picture of herself with her twin sister, Sharon Grand.\n\nLisa runs away with Hawk on his motorcycle only to break down at a diner. Jessie and Megan, using David's car, find her. Jeffrey, Susan, and David also do so. Hawk and David fight in the diner, causing the police to be called, and Hawk breaks up with Lisa. David begins to like Jessie better than Lisa. Cassie becomes angry that Susan went with Jeffrey to the diner. The girls begin to befriend and like Susan. They set up a date for her and Jeffrey by not telling Nick and Cassie to come. Jeffrey expresses his admiration for Susan, who refuses because he is engaged. She quits working on the Wyatts' house and continues with Nick's condo and Cassie moves the date to two days away. The girls go to Susan's apartment and meet Sharon Grand, Susan's twin sister. Sharon agrees to help them set up Jeffrey and Susan.\n\nOn the wedding day, Sharon and the girls lock Jeffrey and Susan in the garage shed, resulting in Jeffrey missing the wedding. Cassie, devastated, hooks up with Nick and drives away. David and Jessie become a couple.  Jeffrey and Susan realize their love for each other after playing the piano and singing to the music box she bought and then gave to him.  Sharon and the girls take down the shed wall, revealing Jeffrey and Susan about to kiss.\n\n===Continuity===\nIn ''[[The Parent Trap II]]'', Sharon Ferris married Bill Grand ([[Tom Skerritt]]), creating a family with their daughters, Nikki Ferris ([[Carrie Kei Heim]]) and Mary Grand ([[Bridgette Andersen]]). Susan was married to Brian Carey (Alex Harvey).  They divorced prior to the events of ''Parent Trap III'', and Susan reverted to using her maiden name, Evers.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hayley Mills]] as Susan Evers and Sharon Grand\n*[[Barry Bostwick]] as Jeffrey Wyatt\n*[[Patricia Richardson]] as Cassie McGuire\n*[[Leanna Creel]] as Lisa Wyatt\n*[[Monica Lacy|Monica Creel]] as Jessie Wyatt\n*Joy Creel as Megan Wyatt\n*[[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Nick\n*[[Loretta Devine]] as Thelma\n*Jon Pennell as Hawk\n*[[Chris Gartin]] as David\n\n==History==\nHayley Mills returned in 1986 to the [[Disney Channel]] when she filmed ''[[The Parent Trap II]]''. She expressed no interest in returning for more sequels. In 1989, Mollie Miller soon began production on the next sequel, ''Parent Trap III''.{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}\n\nMills returned after her Disney series, ''[[Good Morning, Miss Bliss]]'' had ended. Barry Bostwick was cast as Jeffrey Wyatt and Patricia Richardson as his jealous, snobbish girlfriend, Cassie McGuire. Richardson would soon be popular for her ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' fame. Joy, Leanna, and Monica Creel were cast to play the identical teenage triplet daughters with different personalities: Megan, the private one, Lisa, the outgoing teen rebel, and Jessie, the sweet one.\n\nThe film debuted on NBC-TV's ''The Magical World of Disney'' on April 9, 1989. It was previewed on Disney's films released that spring next to [[Davy Crocket]] and ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]''. Mollie Miller, the film's director, would later direct the last sequel, ''[[Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon]]''.\n\n==Music==\n* The popular standard \"[[I'm Always Chasing Rainbows]]\" plays on a jukebox. It is also sung by Susan and Jeffrey.\n* The 1987 hit single \"You Don't Know\" by [[Scarlett and Black]] appears in the first half hour of the film, listened to by the Wyatt sisters in a bedroom.\n* Jessie and two of Lisa's friends dance to \"[[What Have You Done for Me Lately]]\". This version is either by [[Janet Jackson]], or a cover of her recording.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0098066}}\n*{{amg movie|128088}}\n*{{tcmdb title|473267}}\n\n{{Lottie and Lisa}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parent Trap III}}\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:The Parent Trap films|3]]\n[[Category:1989 television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:NBC network original films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Television sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films about weddings]]\n[[Category:Films about twin sisters]]\n[[Category:Films about families]]\n[[Category:Films about widowhood]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Joel McNeely]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name      = Parent Trap III\n| image          = The Parent Trap III.jpg\n| caption        =\n| genre          = {{hlist|Comedy|Family}}\n| director       = Mollie Miller\n| executive_producer = \n| producer       = Jill Donner<br>Henry Colman\n| based_on       = {{based on|Characters created|[[Erich K\u00e4stner]]}}\n| screenplay       = Jill Donner\n| story          = Deborah Amelon<br>Jill Donner\n| starring       = [[Hayley Mills]]<br>[[Barry Bostwick]]<br>[[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]]<br>[[Patricia Richardson]]\n| music          = [[Joel McNeely]]\n| cinematography = [[Isidore Mankofsky]]\n| editor         = Howard Kunin<br>Duane Hartzell\n| location       =\n| company        = [[The Walt Disney Company]]\n| distributor    = [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]]\n| network        = [[NBC]]\n| first_aired    = April 9, 1989\n| runtime        = 85 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         =\n| preceded_by    = ''[[The Parent Trap II]]''\n| followed_by    = ''[[Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon]]''\n}}\n\n'''''Parent Trap III''''' is a 1989 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[comedy film]] and a [[sequel]] to ''[[The Parent Trap II]]'' (1986) and the third installment in [[The Parent Trap (film series)|''The Parent Trap'' series]].

Sharon and the girls take down the shed wall, revealing Jeffrey and Susan about to kiss.\n\n===Continuity===\nIn ''[[The Parent Trap II]]'', Sharon Ferris married Bill Grand ([[Tom Skerritt]]), creating a family with their daughters, Nikki Ferris ([[Carrie Kei Heim]]) and Mary Grand ([[Bridgette Andersen]]). Susan was married to Brian Carey (Alex Harvey).  They divorced prior to the events of ''Parent Trap III'', and Susan reverted to using her maiden name, Evers.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hayley Mills]] as Susan Evers and Sharon Grand\n*[[Barry Bostwick]] as Jeffrey Wyatt\n*[[Patricia Richardson]] as Cassie McGuire\n*[[Leanna Creel]] as Lisa Wyatt\n*[[Monica Lacy|Monica Creel]] as Jessie Wyatt\n*Joy Creel as Megan Wyatt\n*[[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Nick\n*[[Loretta Devine]] as Thelma\n*Jon Pennell as Hawk\n*[[Chris Gartin]] as David\n\n==History==\nHayley Mills returned in 1986 to the [[Disney Channel]] when she filmed ''[[The Parent Trap II]]''. She expressed no interest in returning for more sequels. In 1989, Mollie Miller soon began production on the next sequel, ''Parent Trap III''.{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}\n\nMills returned after her Disney series, ''[[Good Morning, Miss Bliss]]'' had ended. Barry Bostwick was cast as Jeffrey Wyatt and Patricia Richardson as his jealous, snobbish girlfriend, Cassie McGuire. Richardson would soon be popular for her ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' fame. Joy, Leanna, and Monica Creel were cast to play the identical teenage triplet daughters with different personalities: Megan, the private one, Lisa, the outgoing teen rebel, and Jessie, the sweet one.\n\nThe film debuted on NBC-TV's ''The Magical World of Disney'' on April 9, 1989. It was previewed on Disney's films released that spring next to [[Davy Crocket]] and ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]''. Mollie Miller, the film's director, would later direct the last sequel, ''[[Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon]]''.\n\n==Music==\n* The popular standard \"[[I'm Always Chasing Rainbows]]\" plays on a jukebox. It is also sung by Susan and Jeffrey.\n* The 1987 hit single \"You Don't Know\" by [[Scarlett and Black]] appears in the first half hour of the film, listened to by the Wyatt sisters in a bedroom.\n* Jessie and two of Lisa's friends dance to \"[[What Have You Done for Me Lately]]\". This version is either by [[Janet Jackson]], or a cover of her recording.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0098066}}\n*{{amg movie|128088}}\n*{{tcmdb title|473267}}\n\n{{Lottie and Lisa}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parent Trap III}}\n[[Category:The Parent Trap films|3]]\n[[Category:1989 television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:NBC network original films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Television sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films about weddings]]\n[[Category:Films about twin sisters]]\n[[Category:Films about families]]\n[[Category:Films about widowhood]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Joel McNeely]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent_Trap_III"}

The [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|plantation house]] is a [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]- and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate-styled]] [[mansion]] built by John Hampden Randolph in 1859, and is the largest extant [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] plantation house in the South with {{convert|53000|sqft|m2}} of floor space.\n\n==Mansion and grounds==\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation House.jpg|thumb|left|250px|North Front of Nottoway]]\nJohn Randolph commissioned renowned architect [[Henry Howard (architect)|Henry Howard]] of [[New Orleans]] with the task of designing the grand mansion with the intention that no expense would be spared in the construction. Howard sited the three-story wooden frame house, that includes a one-story rusticated stucco-covered brick base on a concrete foundation, to face east towards the [[Mississippi River]]. The entrance facade is asymmetrically balanced with a projecting bedroom wing to the left side and a large curved bay with galleries on the right. The main five-bay structure, with a central projecting portico, emphasizes height rather than width with the main living areas on the second and third-stories both being {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} in height above the one-story basement, scored to appear as stone, and featuring an arched niche flanked with narrow [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestrations]]. The galleries are embellished with custom ornamental iron railings made in New Orleans, capped with molded wooden handrails. Double curved [[granite]] staircases, installed by skilled mason, Newton Richards, rise to the second-story. These steps were built with the left side intended for ladies and the right side for gentlemen. The steps for the men can also be identified by the boot scraper at the bottom. The separate staircases were so that the men would not see the women's ankles beneath their skirts as they climbed, which was considered a severe breach of social [[etiquette]] at the time. The close spacing and angularity of the gallery's 22 square columns and their elongated capitals also emphasize the vertical qualities of the house. Above the capitals, small brackets branch out to carry a tall [[entablature]] decorated with [[modillions]], supporting a projecting [[cornice]] that nearly covers the hipped roof that is pierced with six chimneys. In the rear of the house is a two-story [[studio apartment|gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re]] wing where the Randolph sons resided.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway Plantation|url=http://www.knowla.org/entry/1727/|publisher=Knowla.org|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of Nottoway was completed in 1859 at an estimated cost of $80,000; to prevent any duplicate homes being built, Randolph destroyed the architect's plans after completion.\n\n===Interiors===\n[[File:Nottoway Interior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The White Ballroom]][[File:Nottoway Dining Room.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Dining Room]]\nNottoway has over an acre of floor space spread out over three floors, and a total of 64 rooms with 165 doors and 200 windows, most of which can also double as doors.  The house enjoyed 19th-century novelties such as a bathroom located on each floor with flushing toilets and hot and cold running water, gas lighting throughout the house and a complex servant call bell system. The principal rooms of the house are located on the second floor. The entrance hall runs the length of the house and is 12 feet wide and 40 feet long. Large [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] and brass chandeliers hang from the {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} high ceilings and the doors with hand-painted German Dresden porcelain doorknobs and matching keyhole covers, leading to the adjacent rooms are {{convert|11|ft|m}} tall. Above the doors and along the ceilings are plaster frieze moldings, with modillions interspersed with [[paterae]], that are made from mud, clay, horse hair and Spanish moss. To the right of the entrance hall is the most unusual, and reportedly John Randolph's most favorite room in the house, the White Ballroom. With [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, hand-cast archways and an L-shaped extension into a curved bay, Randolph had it painted completely white, including the flooring, to show off the natural beauty of his seven daughters, six of whom would be married there. Featuring two fireplaces with hand-carved [[rococo]] white marble mantles, there is also an original mirror placed so that the women could see if their ankles or [[Hoop skirt|hoops]] were showing beneath their skirts. Over one of the fireplaces, there is a painting of Mary Henshaw (no relation to the family), whose eyes are said to follow the viewer around the room. Flanking the entrance hall to the left is a gentleman's study, a stair hall and the formal dining room. Both the study and the dining room feature black Italian hand-carved marble mantles on their coal burning fireplaces, and the rooms are filled with period antique furniture. The dining room plasterwork showcases pink camellias, Emily Randolph's favorite flower, and is the only plasterwork in the house to have color.\n\nThe main staircase of Honduran mahogany is covered in green velvet and ascends to the Ancestral Hall on the third-floor. The hall was used by the Randolphs as a family parlor, being a central thoroughfare to many of the adjacent bedrooms, and gave access to the third-floor gallery with views of the Mississippi River. Nearby, is the master bedroom, with one of the three original bathrooms, as well as a small room that was used as a [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] for Julia Marceline, the Randolph's last and only child born at Nottoway. During the Civil War, Emily Randolph utilized a bedpost at the end of the bed to hide valuable jewelry. Though originally bedrooms, one has been made into a music room displaying musical instruments from the 19th-century, and another known as the Wicker Room features wicker furniture originally owned by the Randolph family.\n\nThe first floor basement has been transformed into a restaurant and a small museum about the Randolph family, and the history of the plantation. Originally the space held the laundry, dairy, wine cellar and servants quarters, as well as a 10-pin bowling alley for the amusement of the children.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe landscape for Nottoway was designed by John Nelson of New Orleans whose plan included 120 fruit and citrus trees, 12 magnolia trees, poplar and live oak trees, 75 rose bushes, 150 strawberry plants and a variety of flower and vegetable gardens. However, due to neglect and the erosion of six and a half acres of land by the Mississippi River, the gardens designed by Nelson no longer exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway's Architectural History|url=https://nottowayplantation.wordpress.com/|publisher=Nottoway Plantation's Blog|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Today, the house sits only 200 feet behind a river levee and the grounds include a small formal hedge garden adjacent to the gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re where the detached kitchen once stood, and a fountain courtyard in front of the southern bedroom wing. Surrounding the house are modern ancillary buildings that house offices and event facilities. The owners expanded the property in 2008 by building a carriage house, ballroom and nine Acadian-style cottages modeled after the property's original slave quarters, while the plantation was closed to the public for repairs, as a result of damage incurred by [[Hurricane Gustav]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Louisiana plantation to be auctioned|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/02/historic-louisiana-plantation-to-be-auctioned/|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> To the north of the house is the reconstructed stables, now re-purposed as a ballroom, and the Randolph cemetery where the remains of the family were reinterred in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nJohn Hampden Randolph was born in [[Virginia]] in 1813, a member of the prominent [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph family]]. He migrated with his family to Mississippi when his father, [[Peter Randolph|Peter Randolph Jr.]], was appointed a federal judge in [[Woodville, Mississippi]], by [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] in 1820.\n\nJohn Randolph married Emily Jane Liddell in 1837 and went on to have eleven children with her. Randolph devoted most of his time to his [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], but believing sugar production would be more lucrative he decided to move his family to southern Louisiana in 1842 where he purchased a {{convert|1650|acre|km2}} cotton plantation that he named Forest Home. Converting the plantation to [[sugar cane]] production two years later and constructing [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish's]] first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[sugar cane mill|sugar mill]], he was able to triple his earnings over his cotton production. Within ten years he had increased his holdings to {{convert|7116|acre|km2}} and owned 176 [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved people]] making Randolph one of the larger slaveholders in the South. In 1855 he purchased an additional {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of highland, and {{convert|620|acre|km2}} of [[swamp]] and Mississippi River-front land where he sought to build a more prestigious home that he named \"Nottoway\", after [[Nottoway County, Virginia|Nottoway County]] in the part of Virginia where he was born.\n\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation-022.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Painting by Cornelia Randolph showing original garden landscape]]\nHe selected Henry Howard, a very popular architect of the time, considered to have been one of the finest architects of 19th-century [[New Orleans]]. Many of his Greek Revival and Italianate style buildings, churches, and homes can still be found in the city.  He also designed the neighboring [[Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)|Belle Grove]], now destroyed.  Randolph and the owner of Belle Grove, John Andrews, are known to have had a rivalry of sorts that even extended to their homes.<ref name=\"lostplan\">{{cite book |title=Lost Plantations of the South |last=Matrana |first=Marc R. |year=2009 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1-57806-942-2 |pages=184\u2013192 }}</ref> Compiling the materials for his [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation home]], cypress logs were cut and cured under water for six years, then cut into planks and dried into what is called virgin cypress. The wood's most notable feature is not its durability, but its resistance to termites. Handmade bricks were baked in kilns by enslaved workers and 40 carpenters, brick masons and plumbers were hired by Howard, who lived in tents at the site of construction while doing their work. The massive home was completed in 1859 along with a variety of other buildings including quarters for enslaved workers, a schoolhouse, greenhouse, stable, steam-powered sugar house, wood cisterns, and other necessary buildings for an agricultural operation.<ref name=\"Nottoway\">{{cite book |title=Nottoway Plantation: The South's Largest Antebellum Mansion |last=Sommers Castaldi |first=Robin |year=2013 |publisher=Nottoway Properties, Inc |isbn=978-0-9891285-0-6 |pages=26\u201369 }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the house was completed the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began. Randolph did not support secession from the Union, but once the war began, backed the war financially and sent his three sons to fight for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], losing his oldest son, Algernon Sidney Randolph, at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. With the war coming ever closer to Nottoway, it was decided that Randolph would take 200 enslaved people to [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], and grow cotton there while his wife, Emily, stayed at Nottoway with the youngest children, hoping that their presence would save it from destruction. The plantation was occupied by both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate troops and though the grounds were damaged and the animals taken, Nottoway survived the war with only a single [[grapeshot]] to the far left column that did not fall out until 1971.\n\nWith the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] of the slaves, John Randolph contracted with 53 of his former bond people to continue working as laborers. When he returned to Nottoway after the Civil War, most, having few other choices, returned with him. The sugar business was not as profitable after the war and by 1875, Nottoway was reduced to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. John Randolph died at Nottoway on September 8, 1883, leaving the plantation to his wife.\n\nEmily Randolph sold the plantation in 1889 for [[$]]50,000, which she divided equally among her nine surviving children and herself. She died in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1904.<ref>Fisher, C. (1996). ''The Nottoway Plantation, Restaurant, and Inn: The White Castle of Louisiana''. North American Case Research Association (NACRA), 16(3).</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe new owners of Nottoway were D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Pierre Landry and his father-in-law, Jean Baptiste Dugas, whose family owned the plantation until 1909, when Landry's widow sold Nottoway to sugar [[Planter (American South)|planter]] Alfonse Hanlon. Soon after, Hanlon lost Nottoway to foreclosure in 1913 due to crop failures the previous two years that resulted in tax problems and accrued medical bills by his wife's failing health. Dr. Whyte G. Owen purchased the plantation out of foreclosure in the amount of $10,000.\n\nDr. Owen, one-time Surgeon General of Louisiana, attempted to run the estate as a sugar plantation, but was not successful.  He sold off {{convert|1193|acre|ha}}, keeping the house and surrounding property. After his death in 1949, Nottoway was inherited by his son Stanford who lived with his wife Odessa in the house until his death in 1974. Thereafter, Odessa Owen lived alone in the massive house, trying to maintain it with her limited resources. Knowing she was unable to adequately care for the house, Owen sold the plantation to Arlin K. Dease in 1980, who had restored three other antebellum mansions, including the [[Myrtles Plantation]] in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]] with the caveat that she be allowed to live in house until her death. After she died in 2003, the house ceased to be a private home. Dease restored Nottoway, working a crew of 40 to 60 men for 12 hours a day, and opened the house to the public three months after his purchase. Arlin Dease sold Nottoway to [[Paul Ramsay]] of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1985, after he had stayed at the property while in the area for business.<ref name=Nottoway/>\n\n===21st century===\nUnder Ramsay's tenure, Nottoway has become a resort destination.

With the war coming ever closer to Nottoway, it was decided that Randolph would take 200 enslaved people to [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], and grow cotton there while his wife, Emily, stayed at Nottoway with the youngest children, hoping that their presence would save it from destruction. The plantation was occupied by both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate troops and though the grounds were damaged and the animals taken, Nottoway survived the war with only a single [[grapeshot]] to the far left column that did not fall out until 1971.\n\nWith the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] of the slaves, John Randolph contracted with 53 of his former bond people to continue working as laborers. When he returned to Nottoway after the Civil War, most, having few other choices, returned with him. The sugar business was not as profitable after the war and by 1875, Nottoway was reduced to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. John Randolph died at Nottoway on September 8, 1883, leaving the plantation to his wife.\n\nEmily Randolph sold the plantation in 1889 for [[$]]50,000, which she divided equally among her nine surviving children and herself. She died in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1904.<ref>Fisher, C. (1996). ''The Nottoway Plantation, Restaurant, and Inn: The White Castle of Louisiana''.

Soon after, Hanlon lost Nottoway to foreclosure in 1913 due to crop failures the previous two years that resulted in tax problems and accrued medical bills by his wife's failing health. Dr. Whyte G. Owen purchased the plantation out of foreclosure in the amount of $10,000.\n\nDr. Owen, one-time Surgeon General of Louisiana, attempted to run the estate as a sugar plantation, but was not successful.  He sold off {{convert|1193|acre|ha}}, keeping the house and surrounding property. After his death in 1949, Nottoway was inherited by his son Stanford who lived with his wife Odessa in the house until his death in 1974. Thereafter, Odessa Owen lived alone in the massive house, trying to maintain it with her limited resources. Knowing she was unable to adequately care for the house, Owen sold the plantation to Arlin K. Dease in 1980, who had restored three other antebellum mansions, including the [[Myrtles Plantation]] in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]] with the caveat that she be allowed to live in house until her death. Dying in 2003, it was at this time the house ceased to be a private home. Dease restored Nottoway, working a crew of 40 to 60 men 12 hours a day, and opened the house to the public three months after his purchase. Arlin Dease sold Nottoway to [[Paul Ramsay]] of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1985, after he had stayed at the property while in the area for business.<ref name=Nottoway/>\n\n===21st century===\nUnder Ramsay's tenure, Nottoway has become a resort destination.

While identifying these [[small RNAs]], her lab discovered that some of these small RNAs encode small proteins that had previously been overlooked because they are not detected in many traditional biochemical assays and the corresponding genes are poorly annotated. Her research group demonstrated that one such small protein, AcrZ, binds to the multidrug efflux pump protein [[Acriflavine resistance protein family|AcrB]] to affect its ability to export certain classes of antibiotics.
