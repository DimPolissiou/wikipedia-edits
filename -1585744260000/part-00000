Both principles, hard and soft, come from the famous martial arts book used by Okinawan masters during the 19th and 20th centuries, the ''[[Bubishi]]'' ({{zh|c=\u6b66\u5099\u5fd7|p=W\u01d4b\u00e8i Zh\u00ec}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.japan-karate.com/goju-ryu%20karate%20history.html |title=Gojuryu Karatedo Kobudo GIKKU YUZENKAI \u525b\u67d4\u6d41 \u7a7a\u624b\u9053 \u53e4\u6b66\u9053 \u52c7\u5584\u4f1a Japan international karatedo kobudo union \u539a\u6728\u5e02 \u7a7a\u624b\u9053\u5834<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2015-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124030/http://www.japan-karate.com/goju-ryu%20karate%20history.html |archive-date=2015-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  '''G\u014d''', which means hard, refers to closed hand techniques or straight linear attacks; '''j\u016b''', which means soft, refers to open hand techniques and circular movements. G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b incorporates both circular and linear movements into its curriculum, combining hard striking attacks such as kicks and close hand punches with softer open hand circular techniques for attacking, blocking, and controlling the opponent, including joint locks, grappling, takedowns, and throws.\n\nMajor emphasis is given to breathing correctly in all of the kata but particularly in the [[Sanchin]] [[kata]] which is one of two core kata of this style.  The second kata is called [[Tensho (kata)|Tensho]], meant to teach the student about the soft style of the system. G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b practices methods that include body strengthening and conditioning, its basic approach to fighting (distance, stickiness, power generation, etc.), and partner drills.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b goes back to [[Higaonna Kanry\u014d]], (1853\u20131916), a native of [[Naha, Okinawa]]. Higaonna began studying [[Okinawan martial arts#Shuri-te|Shuri-te]] as a child. He was first exposed to martial arts in 1867 when he began training in [[Luohan (martial arts)|Luohan]] or \"Arhat boxing\" under [[Arakaki Seish\u014d]], a fluent Chinese speaker and translator for the court of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Arakai Seisho|url=http://www.tjska.com/seisho_arakaki.html|website=Traditional Japan Shotokan Karate academy|accessdate=15 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Arakaki went to [[Beijing]] to translate for Ryukyuan officials. It was then that he recommended Higaonna to Kojo Taitei, under whom Higaonna began training.\n\nWith the help of Taitei and a family friend, Yoshimura Chomei (who was an Udun or Prince) Higaonna eventually managed to set up safe passage to China, lodging, and martial arts instruction. In 1873 he left for [[Fuzhou]] in [[Fujian]], [[China]], where he began studying Chinese martial arts under various teachers.<ref>McCarthy, 1995: [https://books.google.com/books?id=lkQsW6DF2owC&pg=PA36 p. 36]</ref><ref name=\"p. 14\">Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA14 p. 14]</ref>\n[[File:Higaonna Kanryo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Higaonna Kanry\u014d]], c. early 1900s]]\n\nIn 1877 he began to study under [[Ry\u016b Ry\u016b Ko]]. Tokashiki Iken has identified him as Xie Zhongxiang, founder of Whooping Crane Kung Fu. Zhongxiang taught several Okinawan students who went on to become karate legends.<ref>McCarthy, 1995: [https://books.google.com/books?id=lkQsW6DF2owC&pg=PA35 p. 35]</ref> However, since Ryu Ryu Ko had died by 1915 when Chojun Miyagi went to Fuzhou in search of him, and Xie Zhong Xiang died in 1926, the two may not be the same person.\n\nHigaonna returned to Okinawa in 1882 and continued in the family business of selling firewood, while teaching a new school of martial arts, distinguished by its integration of ''g\u014d-no'' (hard) and ''j\u016b-no'' (soft) [[kenp\u014d]] into one system. Higaonna's style was known as a type of Naha-te. Naha-te included other earlier teachers such as Arakaki Seisho and the Kojo family style. However, after Japan annexed Okinawa and defeated China in the Sino-Japanese War, the Patron of Naha-te, Yoshimura Udun, and his pro-China faction lost power in Okinawan politics, they migrated to Fuzhou, Taiwan or Hawaii and the older schools of Naha-te were largely lost. Through this period until 1905 when karate was openly taught in Okinawan schools, Kanryo Higaonna kept Naha-te alive by giving students private lessons at his home.\n\nG\u014dj\u016b-kai history considers that [[Shaolin Nam Pai Chuan|''Chinese Nanpa Shorin-ken'']] was the strain of [[kung fu]] that influenced this style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karatedo.co.jp/gojukai/english/e-about.html|title=\u525b\u67d4\u4f1a\u3068\u306f|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHigaonna Morio (no relation with Kanryo's family) noted that in 1905, Higaonna Kanry\u014d taught martial arts in two different ways, according to the type of student: At home, he taught Naha-te as a martial art whose ultimate goal was to be able to kill the opponent; however, at Naha Commercial High School, he taught [[karate]] as a form of physical, intellectual and moral education.<ref>Higaonna, 2001: p. 22</ref>\n\nHigaonna Kanryo's most prominent student was [[Ch\u014djun Miyagi]] (1888\u20131953), the son of a wealthy shop owner in Naha, who began training under Higaonna at the age of 14. Miyagi had begun his martial arts training under Ryuko Arakaki at age 11, and it was through Ryuko Arakaki that he was introduced to Higaonna. Miyagi trained under Higaonna for 15 years until Higaonna's death in 1916.<ref>McCarthy and Lee, 1987: [https://books.google.com/books?id=nquhgEQhVC0C&pg=PA39 p. 39]</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Miyagi and a friend, Gokenki, went to Fuzhou in search of Higaonna's teacher. They stayed for a year and studied under several masters but the old school was gone due to the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Shortly after their return, Higaonna died. In 1917 Chojun Miyagi once again went to Fuzhou for a short visit to explore local martial arts schools. After he returned, many of Higaonna's students continued to train with Miyagi and he introduced a kata called Tensho around 1918, which he had adapted from Rokkishu of [[Fujian White Crane]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |pages = 28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1929 delegates from around Japan were meeting in Kyoto for the All Japan Martial Arts Demonstration. Miyagi was unable to attend, and so he in turn asked his top student Jin\u2019an Shinzato to go. While Shinzato was there, one of the other demonstrators asked him the name of the martial art he practiced. At this time, Miyagi had not yet named his style. Not wanting to be embarrassed, Shinzato improvised the name ''hanko-ryu'' (\"half-hard style\"). On his return to [[Okinawa Prefecture]], he reported this incident to Ch\u014djun Miyagi, who decided on the name ''G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b'' (\"hard soft style\") as a name for his style.<ref>Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA14 p.14]</ref><ref>Higaonna, 2001: pp. 67\u201368</ref> Chojun Miyagi took the name from a line of the poem ''Hakku Kenpo'', which roughly means: \"The eight laws of the fist,\" and describes the eight precepts of the martial arts. This poem was part of the ''Bubishi'' and reads, ''Ho wa G\u014dj\u016b wa Donto su'' \"the way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness,\" or \"everything in the universe inhales soft and exhales hard.\"<ref>McCarthy, 1995: p. 160</ref>\n\nIn March 1934, Miyagi wrote ''Karate-do Gaisetsu'' (\"Outline of ''Karate-do'' (Chinese Hand Way)\"), to introduce karate-do and to provide a general explanation of its history, philosophy, and application. This handwritten monograph is one of the few written works composed by Miyagi himself.<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA43 pp. 43-44]</ref>\n\nMiyagi's house was destroyed during [[World War II]]. In 1950, several of his students began working to build a house and dojo for him in Naha, which they completed in 1951. In 1952, they came up with the idea of creating an organization to promote the growth of G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b. This organization was called ''G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b Shinkokai'' (\"Association to Promote G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b\"). The founding members were Seko Higa, Keiyo Matanbashi, Jinsei Kamiya, and Genkai Nakaima.<ref>Toguchi, 2001: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zfFaPBlINPwC&pg=PA23 p. 23]</ref>\n\nIn 1940 Chojun Miyagi created the kata Geki-Sai-dai-Ichi and Geki-Sai-dai-ni. Geki-sai-dai-Ichi was also incorporated into the Okinawan Karate tradition as Fukyugata-Dai-Ni. Fukyugata-Dai-Ni is practiced by other schools such as Kobayashi Shorin-Ryu and Matsubayashi Shorin-Ryu.\n\nThere are two years that define the way G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b has been considered by the Japanese establishment: the first, 1933, is the year G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b was officially recognized as a [[bud\u014d]] in Japan by the DNBK [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]], in other words, it was recognized as a modern martial art, or [[gendai bud\u014d]] by the Japanese Government. The second year, 1998, is the year the semi-governmental Nippon Kobudo Kyokai (Japan Traditional Martial Arts Association), under the Cultural Ministry of Japan, recognized G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b Karate-do as an ancient form of traditional martial art (''[[kory\u016b]]'') and as a [[Bud\u014d#Bujutsu|bujutsu]].<ref name=\"All Goju Ryu Network\">[http://gojuryu.net/viewpage.php?page_id=33 Kanryo Higaonna \u6771\u6069\u7d0d \u5bdb\u91cf]</ref> This recognition as a ''kory\u016b bujutsu'' shows a change in how [[culture of Japan|Japanese society]] sees [[Sino-Japanese relations|the relationships between Japan, Okinawa and China]].\n\nAfter Miyagi's death (1953), the family communicated that the founder of the style wanted [[Eiichi Miyazato]] to succeed him. the Goju Ryu committee (formed by major students of Miyagi) at a meeting in February 1954 voted almost unanimously Eiichi Myzato \u200b\u200bas the official successor to Chojun Miyagi.\n\nUntil 1998, the only karate styles recognized as Koryu Bujutsu were newer styles founded in mainland Japan such as Wado Ryu and Itosu Ryu. Goju Ryu was the first style recognized by the NKK(Nippon Kobudo Kyokai), and Goju-Ryu's official representative with the NKK was Morio Higaonna, and the organization he founded, the IOGKF was Goju Ryu's representative organization in the NKK.\n\n==Philosophy==\nMiyagi believed that \"the ultimate aim of karate-do was to build character, conquer human misery, and find spiritual freedom\".<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA41 p. 41]</ref>\n\nHe stated that it was important to balance training for self-defense with \"training the mind, or cultivating the precept ''karate-do ni sente nashi'' ('there is no first strike in karate')\"; he also emphasized the importance of \"cultivating intellect before strength\".<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA50 p. 50]</ref>\n\nMiyagi chose the name Goju-ryu (\"''go''\" meaning \"hard\" and \"''ju''\" meaning \"soft\"), to emphasize that his style integrated both \"hard\" and \"soft\" styles. ''Goju'' applies not just to karate, but to life in general; only hardness or only softness will not enable one \"to deal effectively with the fluctuations of life\". When blocking, \"the body is soft and inhaling\"; when striking, the body is \"hard and exhaling\".<ref name=\"p. 14\"/>\n\n== Kata ==\nG\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b has 12 core [[karate kata|kata]] in its standard curriculum. In some schools, practitioners are required to know all of these kata before reaching ''sandan'' (3rd degree black belt)<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\">Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA241 p. 241]</ref> or, more commonly, for ''godan'' (5th degree black belt).\n\n[[Morio Higaonna]] writes that \"Karate begins and ends with ''kata''. ''Kata'' is the essence and foundation of karate and it represents the accumulation of more than 1000 years of knowledge. Formed by numerous masters throughout the ages through dedicated training and research, the ''kata'' are like a map to guide us, and as such should never be changed or tampered with.\"<ref>quoted in Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA15 p. 12]</ref>\n\nAlmost all of the ''kata'' have a corresponding ''bunkai oyo'', a prearranged two-person fighting drill. These drills help the student to understand the applications of the ''kata'', establish proper rhythm/flow, to practice constant attack/defense, and to safely practice dangerous moves on a partner.<ref>Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA14 pp. 14-15]</ref>\n\n=== Kihongata ===\nKihongata means a \"kata of basics.\" In G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b, Sanchin kata is the foundation to all other G\u014dj\u016b kata because it teaches basic movements, basic techniques, power generation and breathing techniques from [[qigong]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. It is also the foundation of body conditioning. The more the karateka practices this kata, the more his Heishugata will change. First variation of Sanchin-kata (sanchin kata dai-ichi) serves as Kihongata. See more on [[Sanchin]] kata below.\n\n====Gekisai====\n''Gekisai'' (kanji: \u6483\u7815; katakana: \u30b2\u30ad\u30b5\u30a4)<ref name=\"kugekai.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kugekai.com/kata.html|title=Okinawa Gojuryu Karatedo Kugekai|publisher=}}</ref> means \"attack and destroy\". These kata were created around 1940 by Chojun Miyagi and Nagamine Shoshin as beginners' kata, to introduce the basic forms of karate (''kihon'') to middle school students in Okinawa, to help bring about the standardization of karate, and to teach a basic set of techniques for self-defense.<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\" /><ref name=\"kane-wilder-226\">Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA226 p. 226]</ref> ''Gekisai'' kata were strongly influenced by the Shuri-te techniques that Miyagi learned from [[Anko Itosu]].<ref>Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA16 p. 16]</ref>\n\nStudents first learn ''gekisai dai ichi'' and then ''gekisai dai ni''. The main difference between ''dai ichi'' and ''dai ni'' is that ''dai ni'' introduces open handed techniques and new stances.<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\" /> It is in ''gekesai dai ni'' that students are introduced to the ''neko ashi dachi'' stance, and to the wheel block(mawashe uke).<ref name=\"kane-wilder-226\" />\n\n====Saifa====\n''Saifa'' (Kanji: \u7815\u7834; Katakana: \u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1)<ref name=\"kugekai.com\"/> means \"smash and tear\" or \"smash and destroy\".<ref name=\"toguchi-2001-16\">Toguchi, 2001: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zfFaPBlINPwC&pg=PA16 p. 16]</ref> ''Saifa'' has its origins in China, and was brought to Okinawa by Higashionna. It contains quick whipping motions, hammerfists, and back fist strikes; it particularly emphasizes moving off-line from an opponent's main force, while simultaneously closing distance and exploding through them.<ref>Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA15 p. 15]</ref> This is usually the first advanced G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b kata the students learn in most G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b dojos after gekisai dai ichi and gekisai dai ni.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n====Sanchin====\n''Sanchin'' (Kanji: \u4e09\u6226; Katakana: \u30b5\u30f3\u30c1\u30f3) means \"three battles\". This ''kata'' is a sort of moving [[meditation]], whose purpose is to unify the mind, body and spirit.

He would make them train very hard, and many of them quit before learning ''sanchin''. Those that remained would focus almost exclusively on ''sanchin'' for two to three years.

G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b incorporates both circular and linear movements into its curriculum, combining hard striking attacks such as kicks and close hand punches with softer open hand circular techniques for attacking, blocking, and controlling the opponent, including joint locks, grappling, takedowns, and throws.\n\nMajor emphasis is given to breathing correctly in all of the kata but particularly in the [[Sanchin]] [[kata]] which is one of two core kata of this style.  The second kata is called [[Tensho (kata)|Tensho]], meant to teach the student about the soft style of the system. G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b practices methods that include body strengthening and conditioning, its basic approach to fighting (distance, stickiness, power generation, etc.), and partner drills.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b goes back to [[Higaonna Kanry\u014d]], (1853\u20131916), a native of [[Naha, Okinawa]]. Higaonna began studying [[Okinawan martial arts#Shuri-te|Shuri-te]] as a child. He was first exposed to martial arts in 1867 when he began training in [[Luohan (martial arts)|Luohan]] or \"Arhat boxing\" under [[Arakaki Seish\u014d]], a fluent Chinese speaker and translator for the court of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Arakai Seisho|url=http://www.tjska.com/seisho_arakaki.html|website=Traditional Japan Shotokan Karate academy|accessdate=15 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Arakaki went to [[Beijing]] to translate for Ryukyuan officials. It was then that he recommended Higaonna to Kojo Taitei, under whom Higaonna began training.\n\nWith the help of Taitei and a family friend, Yoshimura Chomei (who was an Udun or Prince) Higaonna eventually managed to set up safe passage to China, lodging, and martial arts instruction. In 1873 he left for [[Fuzhou]] in [[Fujian]], [[China]], where he began studying Chinese martial arts under various teachers.<ref>McCarthy, 1995: [https://books.google.com/books?id=lkQsW6DF2owC&pg=PA36 p. 36]</ref><ref name=\"p. 14\">Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA14 p. 14]</ref>\n[[File:Higaonna Kanryo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Higaonna Kanry\u014d]], c. early 1900s]]\n\nIn 1877 he began to study under [[Ry\u016b Ry\u016b Ko]]. Tokashiki Iken has identified him as Xie Zhongxiang, founder of Whooping Crane Kung Fu. Zhongxiang taught several Okinawan students who went on to become karate legends.<ref>McCarthy, 1995: [https://books.google.com/books?id=lkQsW6DF2owC&pg=PA35 p. 35]</ref> However, since Ryu Ryu Ko had died by 1915 when Chojun Miyagi went to Fuzhou in search of him, and Xie Zhong Xiang died in 1926, the two may not be the same person.\n\nHigaonna returned to Okinawa in 1882 and continued in the family business of selling firewood, while teaching a new school of martial arts, distinguished by its integration of ''g\u014d-no'' (hard) and ''j\u016b-no'' (soft) [[kenp\u014d]] into one system. Higaonna's style was known as a type of Naha-te. Naha-te included other earlier teachers such as Arakaki Seisho and the Kojo family style. However, after Japan annexed Okinawa and defeated China in the Sino-Japanese War, the Patron of Naha-te, Yoshimura Udun, and his pro-China faction lost power in Okinawan politics, they migrated to Fuzhou, Taiwan or Hawaii and the older schools of Naha-te were largely lost. Through this period until 1905 when karate was openly taught in Okinawan schools, Kanryo Higaonna kept Naha-te alive by giving students private lessons at his home.\n\nG\u014dj\u016b-kai history considers that [[Shaolin Nam Pai Chuan|''Chinese Nanpa Shorin-ken'']] was the strain of [[kung fu]] that influenced this style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karatedo.co.jp/gojukai/english/e-about.html|title=\u525b\u67d4\u4f1a\u3068\u306f|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHigaonna Morio (no relation with Kanryo's family) noted that in 1905, Higaonna Kanry\u014d taught martial arts in two different ways, according to the type of student: At home, he taught Naha-te as a martial art whose ultimate goal was to be able to kill the opponent; however, at Naha Commercial High School, he taught [[karate]] as a form of physical, intellectual and moral education.<ref>Higaonna, 2001: p. 22</ref>\n\nHigaonna Kanryo's most prominent student was [[Ch\u014djun Miyagi]] (1888\u20131953), the son of a wealthy shop owner in Naha, who began training under Higaonna at the age of 14. Miyagi had begun his martial arts training under Ryuko Arakaki at age 11, and it was through Ryuko Arakaki that he was introduced to Higaonna. Miyagi trained under Higaonna for 15 years until Higaonna's death in 1916.<ref>McCarthy and Lee, 1987: [https://books.google.com/books?id=nquhgEQhVC0C&pg=PA39 p. 39]</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Miyagi and a friend, Gokenki, went to Fuzhou in search of Higaonna's teacher. They stayed for a year and studied under several masters but the old school was gone due to the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Shortly after their return, Higaonna died. In 1917 Chojun Miyagi once again went to Fuzhou for a short visit to explore local martial arts schools. After he returned, many of Higaonna's students continued to train with Miyagi and he introduced a kata called Tensho around 1918, which he had adapted from Rokkishu of [[Fujian White Crane]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |pages = 28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1929 delegates from around Japan were meeting in Kyoto for the All Japan Martial Arts Demonstration. Miyagi was unable to attend, and so he in turn asked his top student Jin\u2019an Shinzato to go. While Shinzato was there, one of the other demonstrators asked him the name of the martial art he practiced. At this time, Miyagi had not yet named his style. Not wanting to be embarrassed, Shinzato improvised the name ''hanko-ryu'' (\"half-hard style\"). On his return to [[Okinawa Prefecture]], he reported this incident to Ch\u014djun Miyagi, who decided on the name ''G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b'' (\"hard soft style\") as a name for his style.<ref>Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA14 p.14]</ref><ref>Higaonna, 2001: pp. 67\u201368</ref> Chojun Miyagi took the name from a line of the poem ''Hakku Kenpo'', which roughly means: \"The eight laws of the fist,\" and describes the eight precepts of the martial arts. This poem was part of the ''Bubishi'' and reads, ''Ho wa G\u014dj\u016b wa Donto su'' \"the way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness,\" or \"everything in the universe inhales soft and exhales hard.\"<ref>McCarthy, 1995: p. 160</ref>\n\nIn March 1934, Miyagi wrote ''Karate-do Gaisetsu'' (\"Outline of ''Karate-do'' (Chinese Hand Way)\"), to introduce karate-do and to provide a general explanation of its history, philosophy, and application. This handwritten monograph is one of the few written works composed by Miyagi himself.<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA43 pp. 43-44]</ref>\n\nMiyagi's house was destroyed during [[World War II]]. In 1950, several of his students began working to build a house and dojo for him in Naha, which they completed in 1951. In 1952, they came up with the idea of creating an organization to promote the growth of G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b. This organization was called ''G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b Shinkokai'' (\"Association to Promote G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b\"). The founding members were Seko Higa, Keiyo Matanbashi, Jinsei Kamiya, and Genkai Nakaima.<ref>Toguchi, 2001: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zfFaPBlINPwC&pg=PA23 p. 23]</ref>\n\nIn 1940 Chojun Miyagi created the kata Geki-Sai-dai-Ichi and Geki-Sai-dai-ni. Geki-sai-dai-Ichi was also incorporated into the Okinawan Karate tradition as Fukyugata-Dai-Ni. Fukyugata-Dai-Ni is practiced by other schools such as Kobayashi Shorin-Ryu and Matsubayashi Shorin-Ryu.\n\nThere are two years that define the way G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b has been considered by the Japanese establishment: the first, 1933, is the year G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b was officially recognized as a [[bud\u014d]] in Japan by the DNBK [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]], in other words, it was recognized as a modern martial art, or [[gendai bud\u014d]] by the Japanese Government. The second year, 1998, is the year the semi-governmental Nippon Kobudo Kyokai (Japan Traditional Martial Arts Association), under the Cultural Ministry of Japan, recognized G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b Karate-do as an ancient form of traditional martial art (''[[kory\u016b]]'') and as a [[Bud\u014d#Bujutsu|bujutsu]].<ref name=\"All Goju Ryu Network\">[http://gojuryu.net/viewpage.php?page_id=33 Kanryo Higaonna \u6771\u6069\u7d0d \u5bdb\u91cf]</ref> This recognition as a ''kory\u016b bujutsu'' shows a change in how [[culture of Japan|Japanese society]] sees [[Sino-Japanese relations|the relationships between Japan, Okinawa and China]].\n\nAfter Miyagi's death (1953), the family communicated that the founder of the style wanted [[Eiichi Miyazato]] to succeed him. the Goju Ryu committee (formed by major students of Miyagi) at a meeting in February 1954 voted almost unanimously Eiichi Myzato \u200b\u200bas the official successor to Chojun Miyagi.\n\nUntil 1998, the only karate styles recognized as Koryu Bujutsu were newer styles founded in mainland Japan such as Wado Ryu and Itosu Ryu. Goju Ryu was the first style recognized by the NKK(Nippon Kobudo Kyokai), and Goju-Ryu's official representative with the NKK was Morio Higaonna, and the organization he founded, the IOGKF was Goju Ryu's representative organization in the NKK.\n\n==Philosophy==\nMiyagi believed that \"the ultimate aim of karate-do was to build character, conquer human misery, and find spiritual freedom\".<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA41 p. 41]</ref>\n\nHe stated that it was important to balance training for self-defense with \"training the mind, or cultivating the precept ''karate-do ni sente nashi'' ('there is no first strike in karate')\"; he also emphasized the importance of \"cultivating intellect before strength\".<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA50 p. 50]</ref>\n\nMiyagi chose the name Goju-ryu (\"''go''\" meaning \"hard\" and \"''ju''\" meaning \"soft\"), to emphasize that his style integrated both \"hard\" and \"soft\" styles. ''Goju'' applies not just to karate, but to life in general; only hardness or only softness will not enable one \"to deal effectively with the fluctuations of life\". When blocking, \"the body is soft and inhaling\"; when striking, the body is \"hard and exhaling\".<ref name=\"p. 14\"/>\n\n== Kata ==\nG\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b has 12 core [[karate kata|kata]] in its standard curriculum. In some schools, practitioners are required to know all of these kata before reaching ''sandan'' (3rd degree black belt)<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\">Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA241 p. 241]</ref> or, more commonly, for ''godan'' (5th degree black belt).\n\n[[Morio Higaonna]] writes that \"Karate begins and ends with ''kata''. ''Kata'' is the essence and foundation of karate and it represents the accumulation of more than 1000 years of knowledge. Formed by numerous masters throughout the ages through dedicated training and research, the ''kata'' are like a map to guide us, and as such should never be changed or tampered with.\"<ref>quoted in Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA15 p. 12]</ref>\n\nAlmost all of the ''kata'' have a corresponding ''bunkai oyo'', a prearranged two-person fighting drill. These drills help the student to understand the applications of the ''kata'', establish proper rhythm/flow, to practice constant attack/defense, and to safely practice dangerous moves on a partner.<ref>Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA14 pp. 14-15]</ref>\n\n=== Kihongata ===\nKihongata means a \"kata of basics.\" In G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b, Sanchin kata is the foundation to all other G\u014dj\u016b kata because it teaches basic movements, basic techniques, power generation and breathing techniques from [[qigong]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. It is also the foundation of body conditioning. The more the karateka practices this kata, the more his Heishugata will change. First variation of Sanchin-kata (sanchin kata dai-ichi) serves as Kihongata. See more on [[Sanchin]] kata below.\n\n====Gekisai====\n''Gekisai'' (kanji: \u6483\u7815; katakana: \u30b2\u30ad\u30b5\u30a4)<ref name=\"kugekai.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kugekai.com/kata.html|title=Okinawa Gojuryu Karatedo Kugekai|publisher=}}</ref> means \"attack and destroy\". These kata were created around 1940 by Chojun Miyagi and Nagamine Shoshin as beginners' kata, to introduce the basic forms of karate (''kihon'') to middle school students in Okinawa, to help bring about the standardization of karate, and to teach a basic set of techniques for self-defense.<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\" /><ref name=\"kane-wilder-226\">Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA226 p. 226]</ref> ''Gekisai'' kata were strongly influenced by the Shuri-te techniques that Miyagi learned from [[Anko Itosu]].<ref>Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA16 p. 16]</ref>\n\nStudents first learn ''gekisai dai ichi'' and then ''gekisai dai ni''. The main difference between ''dai ichi'' and ''dai ni'' is that ''dai ni'' introduces open handed techniques and new stances.<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\" /> It is in ''gekesai dai ni'' that students are introduced to the ''neko ashi dachi'' stance, and to the wheel block(mawashe uke).<ref name=\"kane-wilder-226\" />\n\n====Saifa====\n''Saifa'' (Kanji: \u7815\u7834; Katakana: \u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1)<ref name=\"kugekai.com\"/> means \"smash and tear\" or \"smash and destroy\".<ref name=\"toguchi-2001-16\">Toguchi, 2001: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zfFaPBlINPwC&pg=PA16 p. 16]</ref> ''Saifa'' has its origins in China, and was brought to Okinawa by Higashionna. It contains quick whipping motions, hammerfists, and back fist strikes; it particularly emphasizes moving off-line from an opponent's main force, while simultaneously closing distance and exploding through them.<ref>Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA15 p. 15]</ref> This is usually the first advanced G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b kata the students learn in most G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b dojos after gekisai dai ichi and gekisai dai ni.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n====Sanchin====\n''Sanchin'' (Kanji: \u4e09\u6226; Katakana: \u30b5\u30f3\u30c1\u30f3) means \"three battles\". This ''kata'' is a sort of moving [[meditation]], whose purpose is to unify the mind, body and spirit. The techniques are performed very slowly so that the student masters precise movements, breathing, stance/posture, internal strength, and stability of both mind and body.<ref name=\"wilder-xi\">Wilder, 2007: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtOsnB9AVjAC&pg=PR11 pp. xi-xiii]</ref><ref name=\"p. 242\">Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA242 p. 242]</ref>\n\n''Sanchin'' is the foundation for all other ''kata'', and is generally considered to be the most important ''kata'' to master.<ref>Wilder, 2007: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtOsnB9AVjAC&pg=PR11 p. xi]</ref> When new students came to Miyagi, he would often train them for three to five years before introducing them to ''sanchin''. He would make them train very hard, and many of them quit before learning ''sanchin''. Those that remained would focus almost exclusively on ''sanchin'' for two to three years. Miyagi's ''sanchin'' training was very harsh, and students would often leave practice with bruises from him checking their stance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Babladelis|first=Paul|date=December 1992|title=The Sensei Who Received Chojun Miyagi's Belt: Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate is in Good Hands with Meitoku Yagi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8M8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA41|journal=|volume=|page=41|pages=|via=|work=[[Black Belt Magazine]]}}</ref>\n\n====[[Tensho (kata)|Tensho]]====\n''[[Tensho (kata)|Tensho]]'' (Kanji: \u8ee2\u638c; Katakana: \u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30a6) means \"revolving hands\".<ref name=\"kugekai.com\"/> Like ''sanchin'', ''tensho'' is a form of moving meditation; ''tensho'' combines hard dynamic tension with soft flowing hand movements, and concentrates strength in the ''tanden''.<ref name=\"p. 242\"/> ''Tensho'' can be considered the ''ju'' (soft) counterpart of the ''sanchin'''s ''go'' (hard) style.<ref>[http://students.washington.edu/gojuryu/kata.html Kata], ''University of Washington Goju-Ryu Karate Club''</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Clark|first=Mike|title=Six winds hands of Tensho|url=http://www.gojukarate.co.uk/sodokan030.htm|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Kaishukata ===\nKaishukata means a \"kata with open hands\".

In 2005 Vandenhaute was nominated for ''Manager of the Year'' by the financial-economic magazine '''Trends'''. The prize eventually went to [[Jan Callewaert]].\n\nIn 2010, the exclusivity contract between [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] and Woestijnvis was not renewed.<ref>[http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/929/TV-Gids/article/detail/1130949/2010/07/09/Woestijnvis-niet-meer-uitsluitend-bij-de-VRT.dhtml Woestijnvis niet meer uitsluitend bij de VRT] Het Laatste Nieuws, 29 January 2017</ref> That year Vandenhaute was made CEO of ''De Vijver'', the holding company whose properties included Woestijnvis, 49 percent of the Humo magazine.<ref>[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF14012010_023 Woestijnvis verwerft deel Humo] Het Nieuwsblad, 28 January 2017</ref>\n\nIn 2011, ''De Vijver'' purchased with ''[[Mediahaus|Corelio]]'' and ''Sanoma Media'' TV channels '''VT4''' and '''VIJFtv''' for an amount estimated between 100 and 150 million. After the acquisition VT4 was renamed [[VIER]] [Four] and VIJFtv to [[VIJF]] [Five]. In 2012 with purchase complete, Woestijnvis on air talent and programs were transferred to ''VIER''. In 2014, Sanoma share in ''De Vijver'' was sold to [[Telenet (Belgium)|Telenet]], which became one of the three shareholders of the holding company.<ref>[http://trends.knack.be/economie/bedrijven/telenet-wordt-mede-eigenaar-van-vier-en-vijf/article-normal-220107.html Telenet wordt mede-eigenaar van VIER en VIJF] Trends, 28 January 2017</ref> As a term of the deal, the weekly magazine Humo again became wholly owned by Sanoma.<ref>[http://www.humo.be/actua/290656/ding-dong-dienstmededeling-humo-komt-weer-in-handen-van-sanoma Ding-dong-dienstmededeling!

He enjoys a flamboyant life with girlfriend Sandra Valookaran ([[Meena Durairaj|Meena]]). His business rival, Mohammad Ali, was a partner who left after he was found embezzling company funds.\n\nSunny discloses his past to Sandra: his family was a happy one, until Pappan ([[Rajan P. Dev]]) framed Sunny's father Ittichan ([[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]]) in a fraud case. Shortly after, Ittichan died of a heart attack, and Sunny's engagement with fianc\u00e9e Nancy ([[Divya Unni]]) was called off. Sunny fled to [[Mumbai]], and then to Singapore with Kuruvilla's help.\n\nLater, Sunny learns that Sandra, who he plans to marry, is actually a [[call girl]] hired by Mohammad Ali, to spy on Sunny and foil his business plans. To fulfill his marriage commitment to his family, he and Sandra pretend they are still engaged when they go to visit Sunny's family in [[Kerala]]. In his hometown, he meets the old enemies who falsely accused his father of theft and thus ruined the family reputation.\n\nSunny plans to take revenge on Pappan, Tonychan ([[Ganesh Kumar]]) and company, aided by Paily ([[Jagadish]]). In the meantime, he meets Nancy who is now married to Paulachan ([[Dileep]]), Tonychan's younger brother. When Tony tries to sexually assault Nancy, Paulachan is humiliated and commits suicide.\n\nMohammad Ali arrives with a gang from Singapore to reveal Sunny's \"false marriage\" ploy in an attempt to destroy him. Sunny pleads with Mohammad Ali to forget everything so that he can live a happy life and offers all his assets to Mohammad Ali, but Mohammad Ali has a change of heart and leaves Sunny and his family alone. In the end Sunny and Sandra appear with a happy family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Mohanlal]] as Sunny Palamatom\n*[[Meena (actress)|Meena]] as Sandra / Alina (Voice dubbed by [[Bhagyalakshmi]] )\n*[[Divya Unni]] as Nancy (Voice dubbed by [[Sreeja Ravi]] )\n*[[Jagadish]] as Paily,Sunny's Friend\n*[[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]] as Palamattom Ittichan, Sunny's Father\n*[[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]] as Paulachan\n*[[Rajan P.

He enjoys a flamboyant life with girlfriend Sandra Valookaran ([[Meena Durairaj|Meena]]). His business rival, Mohammad Ali, was a partner who left after he was found embezzling company funds.\n\nSunny discloses his past to Sandra: his family was a happy one, until Pappan ([[Rajan P. Dev]]) framed Sunny's father Ittichan ([[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]]) in a fraud case. Shortly after, Ittichan died of a heart attack, and Sunny's engagement with fianc\u00e9e Nancy ([[Divya Unni]]) was called off. Sunny fled to [[Mumbai]], and then to Singapore with Kuruvilla's help.\n\nLater, Sunny learns that Sandra, who he plans to marry, is actually a [[call girl]] hired by Mohammad Ali, to spy on Sunny and foil his business plans. To fulfill his marriage commitment to his family, he and Sandra pretend they are still engaged when they go to visit Sunny's family in [[Kerala]]. In his hometown, he meets the old enemies who falsely accused his father of theft and thus ruined the family reputation.\n\nSunny plans to take revenge on Pappan, Tonychan ([[Ganesh Kumar]]) and company, aided by Paily ([[Jagadish]]). In the meantime, he meets Nancy who is now married to Paulachan ([[Dileep]]), Tonychan's younger brother. When Tony tries to sexually assault Nancy, Paulachan is humiliated and commits suicide. \n\nMohammad Ali arrives with a gang from Singapore to reveal Sunny's \"false marriage\" ploy in an attempt to destroy him. Sunny pleads with Mohammad Ali to forget everything so that he can live a happy life and offers all his assets to Mohammad Ali, but Mohammad Ali has a change of heart and leaves Sunny and his family alone. In the end Sunny and Sandra appear with a happy family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Mohanlal]] as Sunny Palamatom\n*[[Meena (actress)|Meena]] as Sandra / Alina (Voice dubbed by [[Bhagyalakshmi]] )\n*[[Divya Unni]] as Nancy (Voice dubbed by [[Sreeja Ravi]] )\n*[[Jagadish]] as Paily,Sunny's Friend\n*[[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]] as Palamattom Ittichan, Sunny's Father\n*[[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]] as Paulachan\n*[[Rajan P.
