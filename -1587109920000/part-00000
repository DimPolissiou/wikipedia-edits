He wrote it in May 1927 and first published it on December 2, 1929.{{sfn|Kimball|Emmet|2001|p=262}} It was registered as an unpublished song August 24, 1927 and again on July 27, 1928.{{sfn|Kimball|Emmet|2001|p=262}} It was introduced by [[Harry Richman]] and chorus in the musical film ''[[Puttin' On the Ritz (film)|Puttin' On the Ritz]]'' (1930). According to ''The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin'', this was the first song in film to be sung by an interracial ensemble.{{sfn|Kimball|Emmet|2001|p=262}} The title derives from the [[slang]] expression \"to put on the Ritz\", meaning to dress very fashionably.

Every other record label had their own version of this popular song (Columbia, Brunswick, Victor, and all of the dime store labels).

Taco's version was accompanied by a music video, which aired on [[MTV]] and other music video networks and programs.\n\n==Musical structure==\nThe song is in [[Thirty-two-bar form|AABA form]], with a verse.{{sfn|Mueller|1986|p=267}} According to [[John Mueller]], the central device in the A section is the \"use of delayed rhythmic resolution: a staggering, off-balance passage, emphasized by the unorthodox stresses in the lyric, suddenly resolves satisfyingly on a held note, followed by the forceful assertion of the title phrase.\" The marchlike B section, which is only barely [[Syncopation|syncopated]], acts as a contrast to the previous rhythmic complexities.{{sfn|Mueller|1986|p=267}} According to [[Alec Wilder]], in his study of American popular song, for him, the rhythmic pattern in \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" is \"the most complex and provocative I have ever come upon.\"{{sfn|Mueller|1986|p=267}}\n\n==Lyrics and race==\nThe original version of Berlin's song included references to the then-popular fad of flashily dressed but poor [[Black people|black]] [[Harlem]]ites parading up and down [[Lenox Avenue]], \"Spending ev'ry dime / For a wonderful time\".

It was featured in the 8th episode of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' where Will and Carlton were battling over a girl. The lyrics \"nothing but trouble\" were rerecorded by Jazzy Jeff in \"Deep, Deep, Trouble\" from ''[[The Simpsons Sing the Blues]]''.

After leaving Millennium Pharmaceutical, from 1995- August 1997 Fu worked for Darwin Molecular Corporation for two years and took part in the search for the mutations responsible for premature aging (Werner Syndrome) and early onset Alzheimer's Disease (Presinilin 2).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Recent career ===\nIn 1997, Fu returned to academia, taking the position of associate professor of research at the [[University of Utah]]. Fu was then recruited to the University of California, San Francisco in 2002, where she is a co-principal investigator (PI) with her collaborator, Louis Ptacek.<ref name=\":0\" /> The lab's current projects include: locating human sleep genes, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of human sleep regulation and human circadian rhythms, investigating mouse models with de/dys-myelinating disease, and classifying miRNAs that contribute to healthy myelin.\n\n==Research interests==\n\n=== Human sleep behaviors ===\n\n==== Circadian rhythms and metabolism ====\nFu had her training in molecular biology and human genetics, but she became interested in circadian rhythms in 1996 when a woman came into a sleep clinic at the University of Utah, complaining that she had to go to bed very early and would wake up very early. This woman and her family would become the subject of study for Fu and her collaborator Louis Ptacek for [[Advanced sleep phase disorder#Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome|familial advanced sleep phase]] syndrome (FASPS). They cloned the causative gene/mutation and studied the ''in vitro'' biochemical consequences of the mutation, culminating in a 2001 paper<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11232563 | doi=10.1126/science.1057499 | volume=291 | title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome | date=February 2001 | journal=Science | pages=1040\u20133  | last1 = Toh | first1 = KL | last2 = Jones | first2 = CR | last3 = He | first3 = Y | display-authors = etal}}</ref> An h''Per2'' phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome, reporting the first circadian gene mutation in humans.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Scientists Search for the Best Sleepers|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-search-for-the-best-sleepers-1402354792|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|date = June 9, 2014|access-date = April 21, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Sumathi|last = Reddy}}</ref>\n\n====Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome====\nIn 2001, Fu and her collaborator's labs published a paper that explained a phenotype of extremely early risers in humans called Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Toh|first=KL|date=2001|title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome|journal=Science|volume=291|issue=5506|pages=1040\u20133|doi=10.1126/science.1057499|pmid=11232563|bibcode=2001Sci...291.1040T|citeseerx=10.1.1.722.460}}</ref> Humans with this [[autosomal dominant]] disease typically go to bed around 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and wake up at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. The lab studied the genomes of people with this trait and found a point mutation in the [[PER2]] gene that likely causes the behavioral phenotype.\n\n====Short sleep phenotype====\nIn 2009, Fu's group published a paper that explained the mechanisms of a short sleep phenotype in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Y|date=2009|title=Transcriptional suppressor DEC2 is a Regulator for Human Sleep Homeostasis|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5942|pages=866\u2013870|doi=10.1126/science.1174443|pmc=2884988|pmid=19679812}}</ref> In one family, carriers of the  [[autosomal dominant]] phenotype sleep 6.25 hours compared to non-carrying family members, who sleep more than 8 hours per night. Fu traced the phenotype back to a point mutation in a gene called [[DEC2]] that is associated with short sleep phenotype in humans. The mutant DEC2 has a [[proline]]-to-[[arginine]] switch at amino acid position 384, which causes the short sleep phenotype. [[Transgenic]] mice and flies with the mutant DEC2 showed similar phenotypes. It is not currently known what other molecules DEC2 interacts with to produce the short sleep phenotype.\n\n===Neurodegeneration===\n\n==== Trinucleotide repeat expansions and neurological diseases ====\nWhen Fu did her post-doctoral work in Baylor College, she was part of the team that was positional cloning the Fragile-X syndrome gene. There, she studied the trinucleotide repeat sequence expansions, the mutations responsible for the Fragile-X Syndrome, and their correlation with disease severity and age of onset. This work led to the discovery of underlying molecular mechanism for genetic anticipation.  Following this work, she cloned the gene responsible for Myotonic dystrophy based on the hypothesis that genetic anticipation in Myotonic dystrophy is also caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion on patient DNA. This mutational mechanism is now known to cause not only Fragile X syndrome and Myotonic dystrophy, but also Huntington's disease and many of the spinocerebellar ataxias. Thus, it is a common mutational mechanism in inherited neurological diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington's disease chromosomes.

After studying the mutation, Fu demonstrated that the mutated cys-3 was unable to bind DNA.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = http://scienceofsleep.org/bio-eng/|title = Science of Sleep - Biography|date = |accessdate = |website = Science of Sleep|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Fu transferred to the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] as a post-doctoral fellow to study human genetics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Neurogenetics: Ying-Hui Fu|url = http://www.neugenes.org/yinghuifu.htm|website = www.neugenes.org|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}</ref> While there, she was part of the team that identified the [[Fragile X syndrome|fragile-X]] syndrome gene. The gene contains a polymorphic CGG trinucleotide repeat in their DNA sequence; the repeat ranged from 6 to 54 in individuals with normal X chromosomes.

She worked first for two years from January 1993 - 1995 at [[Millennium Pharmaceuticals|Millennium Pharmaceutical Corporation]], a biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology and inflammation (later acquired by [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]]). After leaving Millennium Pharmaceutical, from 1995- August 1997 Fu worked for Darwin Molecular Corporation for two years and took part in the search for the mutations responsible for premature aging (Werner Syndrome) and early onset Alzheimer's Disease (Presinilin 2).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Recent career ===\nIn 1997, Fu returned to academia, taking the position of associate professor of research at the [[University of Utah]]. Fu was then recruited to the University of California, San Francisco in 2002, where she is a co-principal investigator (PI) with her collaborator, Louis Ptacek.<ref name=\":0\" /> The lab's current projects include: locating human sleep genes, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of human sleep regulation and human circadian rhythms, investigating mouse models with de/dys-myelinating disease, and classifying miRNAs that contribute to healthy myelin.\n\n==Research interests==\n\n=== Human sleep behaviors ===\n\n==== Circadian rhythms and metabolism ====\nFu had her training in molecular biology and human genetics, but she became interested in circadian rhythms in 1996 when a woman came into a sleep clinic at the University of Utah, complaining that she had to go to bed very early and would wake up very early. This woman and her family would become the subject of study for Fu and her collaborator Louis Ptacek for [[Advanced sleep phase disorder#Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome|familial advanced sleep phase]] syndrome (FASPS). They cloned the causative gene/mutation and studied the ''in vitro'' biochemical consequences of the mutation, culminating in a 2001 paper<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11232563 | doi=10.1126/science.1057499 | volume=291 | title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome | date=February 2001 | journal=Science | pages=1040\u20133  | last1 = Toh | first1 = KL | last2 = Jones | first2 = CR | last3 = He | first3 = Y | display-authors = etal}}</ref> An h''Per2'' phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome, reporting the first circadian gene mutation in humans.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Scientists Search for the Best Sleepers|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-search-for-the-best-sleepers-1402354792|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|date = June 9, 2014|access-date = April 21, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Sumathi|last = Reddy}}</ref>\n\n====Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome====\nIn 2001, Fu and her collaborator's labs published a paper that explained a phenotype of extremely early risers in humans called Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Toh|first=KL|date=2001|title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome|journal=Science|volume=291|issue=5506|pages=1040\u20133|doi=10.1126/science.1057499|pmid=11232563|bibcode=2001Sci...291.1040T|citeseerx=10.1.1.722.460}}</ref> Humans with this [[autosomal dominant]] disease typically go to bed around 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and wake up at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. The lab studied the genomes of people with this trait and found a point mutation in the [[PER2]] gene that likely causes the behavioral phenotype.\n\n====Short sleep phenotype====\nIn 2009, Fu's group published a paper that explained the mechanisms of a short sleep phenotype in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Y|date=2009|title=Transcriptional suppressor DEC2 is a Regulator for Human Sleep Homeostasis|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5942|pages=866\u2013870|doi=10.1126/science.1174443|pmc=2884988|pmid=19679812}}</ref> In one family, carriers of the  [[autosomal dominant]] phenotype sleep 6.25 hours compared to non-carrying family members, who sleep more than 8 hours per night. Fu traced the phenotype back to a point mutation in a gene called [[DEC2]] that is associated with short sleep phenotype in humans. The mutant DEC2 has a [[proline]]-to-[[arginine]] switch at amino acid position 384, which causes the short sleep phenotype. [[Transgenic]] mice and flies with the mutant DEC2 showed similar phenotypes. It is not currently known what other molecules DEC2 interacts with to produce the short sleep phenotype.\n\n===Neurodegeneration===\n\n==== Trinucleotide repeat expansions and neurological diseases ====\nWhen Fu did her post-doctoral work in Baylor College, she was part of the team that was positional cloning the Fragile-X syndrome gene. There, she studied the trinucleotide repeat sequence expansions, the mutations responsible for the Fragile-X Syndrome, and their correlation with disease severity and age of onset. This work led to the discovery of underlying molecular mechanism for genetic anticipation.  Following this work, she cloned the gene responsible for Myotonic dystrophy based on the hypothesis that genetic anticipation in Myotonic dystrophy is also caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion on patient DNA. This mutational mechanism is now known to cause not only Fragile X syndrome and Myotonic dystrophy, but also Huntington's disease and many of the spinocerebellar ataxias. Thus, it is a common mutational mechanism in inherited neurological diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington's disease chromosomes.

[[AllMusic]] noted \"The first, a cover of a song by Ma Rainey, is a straightforward blues garnished with traditional references to interpersonal relationships and straight-edged razor blades. The two unissued takes could never have been put before the public in the '30s because of the outrageously pornographic lyrics, but were most likely quite popular on the private party circuit. Stash Records made an obscene take available to an appreciative new generation in 1976 on their Copulatin' Blues collection. The sexual imagery is every bit as extreme as the smuttiest outbursts of Jelly Roll Morton's 1938 Library of Congress sessions. After bragging about nipples as stiff as thumbs and seemingly Olympic bouts of frenzied copulation, Bogan (or Bessie Jackson, as she was then called) conjures up a weird architectural edifice as the man's erect penis poses as a church steeple and his sphincter becomes the portal, through which \"...the crabs walks in like people!\" After describing this bizarre hallucination... she busts out laughing and has to struggle to contain herself in order to finish her wild performance\".<ref name=\"Album\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/complete-recorded-works-vol-3-1934-1935-mw0000619527|title=Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 3 (1934-1935) - Lucille Bogan &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> The track was also included on ''Shave 'Em Dry: The Best of Lucille Bogan'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shave-em-dry-the-best-of-lucille-bogan-mw0000698060|title=Shave 'Em Dry: The Best of Lucille Bogan - Lucille Bogan &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> issued in May 2004 by [[Columbia Records]].\n\n==Other versions==\nThe [[Asylum Street Spankers]] recorded a version of the song on their 1996 album, ''Spanks for the Memories''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/spanks-for-the-memories-mw0000039656|title=Spanks for the Memories - Asylum Street Spankers &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> Others who have recorded versions of the track include; [[Jimmy Yancey]], [[Donald Harrison]], [[Brett Marvin]], [[Dr. John]], [[Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs]], [[Miraculous Mule]] (on ''Two Tonne Testimony'' (2017)), [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], and [[The Dinner Is Ruined]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nSome sources claim a lyrical connection between \"Shave' Em Dry\" and [[the Rolling Stones]] song, \"[[Start Me Up]]\", specifically to the closing line in the Stones track which is \"you make a dead man come\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/sample/62318/The-Rolling-Stones-Start-Me-Up-Lucille-Bogan-Shave-%27Em-Dry/|title=The Rolling Stones's 'Start Me Up' - Discover the Sample Source|website=WhoSampled.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://begonias.typepad.com/srubio/2011/09/music-friday-lucille-bogan-shave-em-dry.html|title=music friday: lucille bogan, &ldquo;shave &lsquo;em dry&rdquo;|website=Begonias.typepad.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/SOStartMe.html|title=Start Me Up|website=Timeisonourside.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djmjd.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/%e2%80%9cshave-%e2%80%98em-dry%e2%80%9d-%e2%80%94-lucille-bogan/|title=\u201cShave \u2018Em Dry\u201d \u2014 Lucille Bogan|date=4 May 2010|website=Djmjd.wordpress.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbboots.com/bootlegs.php?op=showBysong&songkey=645|title=The Rolling Stones Bootlegs database|website=Dbboots.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cbriansmith.com/tag/c-brian-smith/|title=C.

[[AllMusic]] noted \"The first, a cover of a song by Ma Rainey, is a straightforward blues garnished with traditional references to interpersonal relationships and straight-edged razor blades. The two unissued takes could never have been put before the public in the '30s because of the outrageously pornographic lyrics, but were most likely quite popular on the private party circuit. Stash Records made an obscene take available to an appreciative new generation in 1976 on their Copulatin' Blues collection. The sexual imagery is every bit as extreme as the smuttiest outbursts of Jelly Roll Morton's 1938 Library of Congress sessions. After bragging about nipples as stiff as thumbs and seemingly Olympic bouts of frenzied copulation, Bogan (or Bessie Jackson, as she was then called) conjures up a weird architectural edifice as the man's erect penis poses as a church steeple and his sphincter becomes the portal, through which \"...the crabs walks in like people!\" After describing this bizarre hallucination... she busts out laughing and has to struggle to contain herself in order to finish her wild performance\".<ref name=\"Album\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/complete-recorded-works-vol-3-1934-1935-mw0000619527|title=Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 3 (1934-1935) - Lucille Bogan &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> The track was also included on ''Shave 'Em Dry: The Best of Lucille Bogan'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shave-em-dry-the-best-of-lucille-bogan-mw0000698060|title=Shave 'Em Dry: The Best of Lucille Bogan - Lucille Bogan &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> issued in May 2004 by [[Columbia Records]].\n\n==Other versions==\nThe [[Asylum Street Spankers]] recorded a version of the song on their 1996 album, ''Spanks for the Memories''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/spanks-for-the-memories-mw0000039656|title=Spanks for the Memories - Asylum Street Spankers &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> Others who have recorded versions of the track include; [[Jimmy Yancey]], [[Donald Harrison]], [[Brett Marvin]], [[Dr. John]], [[Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs]], [[Miraculous Mule]] (on ''Two Tonne Testimony'' (2017)), [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], and [[The Dinner Is Ruined]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nSome sources claim a lyrical connection between \"Shave' Em Dry\" and [[the Rolling Stones]] song, \"[[Start Me Up]]\", specifically to the closing line in the Stones track which is \"you make a dead man come\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/sample/62318/The-Rolling-Stones-Start-Me-Up-Lucille-Bogan-Shave-%27Em-Dry/|title=The Rolling Stones's 'Start Me Up' - Discover the Sample Source|website=WhoSampled.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://begonias.typepad.com/srubio/2011/09/music-friday-lucille-bogan-shave-em-dry.html|title=music friday: lucille bogan, &ldquo;shave &lsquo;em dry&rdquo;|website=Begonias.typepad.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/SOStartMe.html|title=Start Me Up|website=Timeisonourside.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djmjd.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/%e2%80%9cshave-%e2%80%98em-dry%e2%80%9d-%e2%80%94-lucille-bogan/|title=\u201cShave \u2018Em Dry\u201d \u2014 Lucille Bogan|date=4 May 2010|website=Djmjd.wordpress.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbboots.com/bootlegs.php?op=showBysong&songkey=645|title=The Rolling Stones Bootlegs database|website=Dbboots.com|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cbriansmith.com/tag/c-brian-smith/|title=C.
