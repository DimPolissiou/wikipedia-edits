In 1910, she became the first woman to be accepted at another of the ''Grandes \u00e9coles'', the highly selective and prestigious [[\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris)|\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure of Rue d'Ulm Street]] (ENS) after her case was discussed and her enrolment confirmed by the [[:fr:Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'Instruction publique]]. On her behalf, her egalitarian father had asked the director of the ENS - the celebrated historian [[Ernest Lavisse]] - to allow her entry. It was agreed, the administration having discussed prior successes of two other young women in mathematics and natural sciences, Liouba Bortniker and Marie Robert respectively (Rouvi\u00e8re's sister, Jeanne, enrolled two years later). In 1913, she followed this by becoming the first female winner of the ''[[:fr:Agr\u00e9gation de sciences physiques]]'', a competition for the recruitment of teachers for schools and universities: successful students of the school are regarded as civil servants. She undertook a doctoral scholarship for two years, unencumbered by the wartime obligations of the male students.<ref name=\"Brasseur\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/clio/613|title=Le genre de concours: r\u00e9sum\u00e9|website=journals.openedition.org|access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{https://www.ens.fr/node/1217}</ref>\n\nHer studentship at the ENS had been reported nationally with contrary attitudes. The front page of ''Le Matin'' - illustrated with a photograph of Rouvi\u00e8re - bore the headline, \"''La premi\u00e8re'' taupine ''de France.''\" [''[[:fr:Argot normalien|Taupe]]'' is ENS argot for a student of preparatory science courses, hence the feminine form, ''taupine'']. It stated that here was a young woman whose drive bypassed the expected frivolities of youth towards \"transcendental mathematics.\" Conversely, she was scoffed at in ''Femina'' - a conservative and bourgeois-leaning women's magazine - which clamed that out of over a thousand women interviewed, most did not approve of her presence there. ''Femina'' included a photograph of the three Rouvi\u00e8re sisters - Marguerite, Jeanne and Madeleine - and commented on her sister, Jeanne, who was aiming to go to the [[Lyc\u00e9e Buffon]], that \"more than one pupil would find 'the teacher' more attractive than the subjects.\" (Jeanne spent two years at Lyc\u00e9e Buffon and afterwards published a translation of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general]] theories of relativity). At the ENS itself, initial surprise among many gave way to curiosity and interest towards a \"balanced and intelligent girl.\" She was supported by practising [[Catholic church|catholics]] there. However, as an ENS existed for young women at [[:fr:\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles|S\u00e8vres]], some considered that she was therefore taking the place of a young man, without having to do [[National service|national service]]. A number of teaching staff bemoaned Rouvi\u00e8re's inclusion, including [[Henri Abraham]], the professor of Physics (later to be killed in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]) who excoriated her about a [quite accurate] statement she made on a difficult topic, leaving her in tears. In this environment, she was helped by her colleague, Jean Rivi\u00e8re, whom she later married.<ref name=\"Leonore1\"/><ref name=\"Girard\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Cosnier|first=Colette |title=Les Dames de Femina.

She translated into French the work of father-and-son [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel-prize winners]] [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]], ''X-Rays and Crystal Structure'', and that of the discoverer of the eponymous [[Lyman series]] of [[ultraviolet]] [[emission lines]] [[Theodore Lyman IV|Theodore Lyman]], ''The Spectroscopy of the Extreme Ultra-Violet''.

He was the son of a librarian from [[Douai]] and became a naval engineer and then a researcher for the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS). She gave up teaching during motherhood. She had three children, Jacques (1918), Michel (1924) and Danielle (1927). Jacques enrolled at ENS in 1939 but became ill. Rouvi\u00e8re asked to be reassigned from the [[Lyc\u00e9e F\u00e9nelon, Paris]], to [[Marseille]] or [[Grenoble]] during his recovery (he'd gone to Marseille, where his father worked) and was finally employed at [[Aix-en-Provence]]. When Jacques got better he resumed his studies in Marseille, and Rouvi\u00e8re was reinstated in her Paris job. However, Jacques died in July 1943, and she was assigned a less demanding role at the [[Lyc\u00e9e et coll\u00e8ge Victor-Duruy]].<ref name=\"Leonore1\"/><ref name=\"Brasseur\"/>\n\nAs a teacher, from April to July 1915, she worked at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)]] for eight hours per week. Through the remainder of 1915 and 1916 she taught Physics without full teaching status for six hours weekly at [[Lyc\u00e9e Carnot]] in Paris. She was a teacher for [[:fr:Classes pr\u00e9paratoires scientifiques|scientific preparatory work]] - that is for the same competitive state scientific environment she succeeded in - at the boys' high school in [[Toulon]] for entry to the naval school (from January 1930, at the request of the management).

In 1910, she became the first woman to be accepted at another of the ''Grandes \u00e9coles'', the highly selective and prestigious [[\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris)|\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure of Rue d'Ulm Street]] (ENS) after her case was discussed and her enrolment confirmed by the [[:fr:Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'Instruction publique]]. On her behalf, her egalitarian father had asked the director of the ENS - the celebrated historian [[Ernest Lavisse]] - to allow her entry. It was agreed, the administration having discussed prior successes of two other young women in mathematics and natural sciences, Liouba Bortniker and Marie Robert respectively (Rouvi\u00e8re's sister, Jeanne, enrolled two years later). In 1913, she followed this by becoming the first female winner of the ''[[:fr:Agr\u00e9gation de sciences physiques]]'', a competition for the recruitment of teachers for schools and universities: successful students of the school are regarded as civil servants. She undertook a doctoral scholarship for two years, unencumbered by the wartime obligations of the male students.<ref name=\"Brasseur\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/clio/613|title=Le genre de concours: r\u00e9sum\u00e9|website=journals.openedition.org|access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{https://www.ens.fr/node/1217}</ref>\n\nHer studentship at the ENS had been reported nationally with contrary attitudes. The front page of ''Le Matin'' - illustrated with a photograph of Rouvi\u00e8re - bore the headline, \"''La premi\u00e8re'' taupine ''de France.''\" [''[[:fr:Argot normalien|Taupe]]'' is ENS argot for a student of preparatory science courses, hence the feminine form, ''taupine'']. It stated that here was a young woman whose drive bypassed the expected frivolities of youth towards \"transcendental mathematics.\" Conversely, she was scoffed at in ''Femina'' - a conservative and bourgeois-leaning women's magazine - which clamed that out of over a thousand women interviewed, most did not approve of her presence there. ''Femina'' included a photograph of the three Rouvi\u00e8re sisters - Marguerite, Jeanne and Madeleine - and commented on her sister, Jeanne, who was aiming to go to the [[Lyc\u00e9e Buffon]], that \"more than one pupil would find 'the teacher' more attractive than the subjects.\" (Jeanne spent two years at Lyc\u00e9e Buffon and afterwards published a translation of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general]] theories of relativity). At the ENS itself, initial surprise among many gave way to curiosity and interest towards a \"balanced and intelligent girl.\" She was supported by practising [[Catholic church|catholics]] there. However, as an ENS existed for young women at [[:fr:\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles|S\u00e8vres]], some considered that she was therefore taking the place of a young man, without having to do [[National service|national service]]. A number of teaching staff bemoaned Rouvi\u00e8re's inclusion, including [[Henri Abraham]], the professor of Physics (later to be killed in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]) who excoriated her about a [quite accurate] statement she made on a difficult topic, leaving her in tears. In this environment, she was helped by her colleague, Jean Rivi\u00e8re, whom she later married.<ref name=\"Leonore1\"/><ref name=\"Girard\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Cosnier|first=Colette |title=Les Dames de Femina.

She translated into French the work of father-and-son [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel-prize winners]] [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]], ''X-Rays and Crystal Structure'', and that of the discoverer of the eponymous [[Lyman series]] of [[ultraviolet]] [[emission lines]] [[Theodore Lyman IV|Theodore Lyman]], ''The Spectroscopy of the Extreme Ultra-Violet''.

He was the son of a librarian from [[Douai]] and became a naval engineer and then a researcher for the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS). She gave up teaching during motherhood. She had three children, Jacques (1918), Michel (1924) and Danielle (1927). Jacques enrolled at ENS in 1939 but became ill. Rouvi\u00e8re asked to be reassigned from the [[Lyc\u00e9e F\u00e9nelon, Paris]], to [[Marseille]] or [[Grenoble]] during his recovery (he'd gone to Marseille, where his father worked) and was finally employed at [[Aix-en-Provence]]. When Jacques got better he resumed his studies in Marseille, and Rouvi\u00e8re was reinstated in her Paris job. However, Jacques died in July 1943, and she was assigned a less demanding role at the [[Lyc\u00e9e et coll\u00e8ge Victor-Duruy]].<ref name=\"Leonore1\"/><ref name=\"Brasseur\"/>\n\nAs a teacher, from April to July 1915, she worked at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)]] for eight hours per week. Through the remainder of 1915 and 1916 she taught Physics without full teaching status for six hours weekly at [[Lyc\u00e9e Carnot]] in Paris. She was a teacher for [[:fr:Classes pr\u00e9paratoires scientifiques|scientific preparatory work]] - that is for the same competitive state scientific environment she succeeded in - at the boys' high school in [[Toulon]] for entry to the naval school (from January 1930, at the request of the management).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Crew / detail\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Crew / detail\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

In July 2012, A&E ordered 10 episodes of the series, skipping the initial pilot stage. The series takes place in the modern day and stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as young Norman Bates and [[Vera Farmiga]] as Mrs. Bates. The series premiered on March 18, 2013 and produced five seasons for a total of 50 episodes. The series was shot in [[Vancouver]] with a replica of the Psycho house from Universal Studio Hollywood and a recreation of the original Bates Motel from the first movie.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Continuity===\nWhile ''Bates Motel'' (1987) was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where ''Psycho'' left off, it ignored the continuity of ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'', and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in ''Psycho II''. ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O. Philippe]] running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Karyn Kusama]], [[Eli Roth]], [[Oz Perkins]], [[Leigh Whannell]], [[Walter Murch]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Richard Stanley (director)|Richard Stanley]] and [[Neil Marshall]].<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

The university's history dates back to the emergence of dental schools in Russia in the [[19th century in Russia|19th century]].\n\n= History =\n== Establishment ==\nThe history of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) dates back to the 19th century, when the first dental school was opened in [[Moscow]] by I.M. Kovarsky. Later, when the [[Soviet-Russia|Soviets came to power in Russia]], it was turned into the House of Soviet Dentistry, and was called upon to tackle a tremendous task of organizing dental health services for the population. The main purpose of MSUMD has always been to train highly qualified medical professionals. Several prominent Russian health care figures who had played a prominent role in establishing the university made a point of including dentistry in the curriculum of the medical school, including [[N.A. Semashko]], [[P.G. Dauge]], [[M.\u0412. Yankovsky]] and [[A.I. Yevdokimov]].\n\n== Early Soviet years==\n\nIn February 1920, when the Kovarsky dental school went under the jurisdiction of Narkomzdrav ([[People's Commissariat of Health|the People's Commissariat of Health]]), the Kovarsky school was transformed into a dental research center by the decision of Narkomzdrav's dental health division in order to bring together all dental care units that existed at the time in different parts of Moscow \u2014 a demonstration dispensary, a chemical laboratory, and the Kovarsky institution itself. The center was named the House of Soviet Dentistry (HSD) and among its main purposes were the retraining of former dentists into oral care consultants, and the preparation of secondary dental personnel, such as dental mechanics, filling and prosthetic specialists, and chair side assistants. \n\nFirst renamed in December, 1920, the HSD's official opening took place two years later in April 1922, when again it was given a different name. This time it was the State Institute of Dentistry (SID), which was to be headed by M.\u0412. Yankovsky, who directed his staff in an in-depth study of Dentistry and [[Odontology]] before anything else; the two major problems to be solved were [[tooth decay]] and [[periodontal disease]]. Among those who joined efforts in the study of these problems were scientists such as professors Ya.S. Utshtem, M.S. Nemenov, M.\u041e. Kovarsky, N.M.  Vilnik, and A.I. Yevdokimov, who replaced M.\u0412. Yankovsky at the post after his death in January 1923. A.I. Yevdokimov made large contributions of his own in the SID's development and that earned him the titles of [[Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation]], a corresponding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR and of [[Hero of Socialist Labor]]. Another new name, that of the State Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SISO) was given in April 1927 by decree of the [[Sovnarkom]] (the Soviet government). The SISO was to continue the job of training dentists through a specially organized refresher course for dental professionals and a dental specialization course for general medicine faculties. This helped to streamline the public dental health care as well as carry on with scientific research in the fields of dental and oral pathology and therapy, [[maxillofacial surgery]], [[orthodontics]], and [[prosthodontics]].\n\nIn 1932, the SISO was renamed yet again, this time to the State Research Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SRISO) and from then on it was concerned mostly with scientific research problems. There were no educational departments in it at the time, those having been replaced by newly formed divisions for pathological [[physiology]], morphology, [[surgery]] and social dentistry instead, to which a steel prosthetics laboratory was added. Another, central, laboratory for prosthetics research was set up a year later in 1933 to manufacture steel dentures on a large scale.\n\n== Years as Moscow Stomatological Institute ==\n\nThe Moscow Stomatological Institute (MSI) as a higher dental school was established under the Narkomzdrav's order dated June 9, 1935, as a subdivision within the SRISO's framework. Both institutions were housed in one building, sharing administration, finances and facilities. Thus, the MSI became the only institution in the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic (RSFSR) that was to conduct scientific research in dentistry, translate the results obtained into everyday dental care practices and train dental professionals as well. Since 1935 a whole number of departments were being added to the institute those of normal anatomy, biology, general chemistry, histology, embryology, and, finally, in 1937 the departments of oral therapy, oral surgery and prosthodontics.\n\nIn line with the resolution of the RSFSR Narkomzdrav of September 1, 1939, the SRISO and MSI were united to become the Moscow State Stomatology Institute (MSSI) with associate professor D. S. Dyshlis as Director. That year witnessed the first batch of 79 graduates trained by the new institution. By the time World War II broke out, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute included 25 departments involved in the studies of dental caries, [[periodontitis]], oral mucous membrane lesions, and maxillofacial injuries.\n\nIn the first days of the war, the MSSI's 1941 graduates were called up to serve in the Red Army or Navy. Among the graduates were V.I. Zausaev who operated on an open heart in a field hospital and who later became a professor and a department head, G.M. Ivaschenko who joined the Army as Chief Dentist, A.I. Doimkov and V.F. Rudko who also gained professorship after the war. To provide the front with dentists, the MSSI put up a special crash course in October, 1941. The MSSI's director, associate professor D.S. Dyshlis, was sent to Izhevsk to make all the necessary arrangements for evacuating the institute to that town, but then the idea was given up. Instead, the MSSI premises in Dolgorukovskaya Street were used to lay out a 50-bed maxillofacial hospital staffed with the institute's polyclinical personnel and the Dentistry department undergraduates. Because of this, over 85% of soldiers with maxillofacial wounds were able to return to the front unscathed. On October 1, 1943, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute opened its doors to students again and about a year later, in February, 1944, A.I.  Yevdokimov was appointed its director.\n\n== After [[World War II]] and [[Khrushchev Thaw]] ==\n\nAfter the war the training of dental care professionals became vital again. So on October 15, 1949, by decision of the USSR Council of Ministers, former dental schools were reorganized into general medicine and dentistry institutes with a 5-year course of studies. The Moscow State Stomatology Institute was again renamed to become the Moscow Medical Stomatology Institute (MMSI), which became famous as the country's research and consulting center on all dentistry-related issues.\n\nIn 1950, associate professor G.N. Beletskiy, a prominent public health worker, was appointed as MMSI director Under his leadership, a student enrollment to the institution went up significantly, the existing clinical medicine facilities were enlarged and new teaching hospitals went under construction, the standards of training research and teaching staff also having much improved. Moreover, two more faculties were launched, part-time and correspondence ones.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1965, the institute was headed by Prof A.I. Doimkov. For many years professor he acted as Chief Dentist of the USSR Ministry of Health administration division No 4 that was in charge of providing dental services to members of the Soviet government and top officials from other countries.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1968, the post of Rector of the MMSI was held by Professor S.I. Babichev, head of the institute's Surgical Disease department. It was he who initiated the idea of incorporating a General Medicine Faculty into the MMSI. On the basis of the Eye Disease department led by Prof S.N. Fyodorov an ophthalmologic research laboratory was created in 1967. The research staff under Prof S.N. Fyodorv looked into a wide range of scientific and practical problems of eye disorders and that, having eventually crowned with success, allowed him to turn the laboratory into what is now known internationally as the Microsurgery of the Eye scientific research institute.\n\n== [[Brezhnev era|Brezhnev years]] and [[Perestroika]] ==\n\nDuring the period of time from 1968 to 1974 when the institute was headed by Prof A.Z. Belousov, the proposal of setting up a general medicine faculty won his support and was realized in 1968. The emergence of the new faculty that was to cater for the need in medical professionals by the city of Moscow and its surroundings called for employment of more teaching staff for a number of the existing departments (those of Foreign Languages, Anatomy, Physiology, Biology, Histology, Physics and General Chemistry, Microbiology and Pharmacology and others) as well as for putting up new courses and departments. These were launched a year later, staffed with qualified specialists and office workers that helped improve the work of the Faculty's administration and dean's offices. That same year, the MMSI opened an advanced training faculty for medical professionals with departments for dental and general practitioners which was followed by opening in 1975 of a faculty for advanced training of teaching staff.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1982, Professor \u041a.M. Lakin, corresponding member of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]], headed the institution. He proved very successful with his studies of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic disease prevention and treatment, the results of which have been widely applied in medical practice. Working in this field he virtually laid the foundation of the hemostasis pharmacology school. His time at the MMSI is marked by putting into operation a Clinical Dentistry Center in Moscow in 1976. It was designed to cater for 2 000 out-patients and 50 in-patients a day and housed a number of the Institute's dental teaching hospital departments.\n\n== In [[Russian federation|modern Russia]] ==\n\nThe decades that followed (1982 to 2002) saw Professor Ye.I. Sokolov as the Rector.

The university's history dates back to the emergence of dental schools in Russia in the [[19th century in Russia|19th century]].\n\n= History =\n== Establishment ==\nThe history of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) dates back to the 19th century, when the first dental school was opened in [[Moscow]] by I.M. Kovarsky. Later, when the [[Soviet-Russia|Soviets came to power in Russia]], it was turned into the House of Soviet Dentistry, and was called upon to tackle a tremendous task of organizing dental health services for the population. The main purpose of MSUMD has always been to train highly qualified medical professionals. Several prominent Russian health care figures who had played a prominent role in establishing the university made a point of including dentistry in the curriculum of the medical school, including [[N.A. Semashko]], [[P.G. Dauge]], [[M.\u0412. Yankovsky]] and [[A.I. Yevdokimov]].\n\n== Early Soviet years==\n\nIn February 1920, when the Kovarsky dental school went under the jurisdiction of Narkomzdrav ([[People's Commissariat of Health|the People's Commissariat of Health]]), the Kovarsky school was transformed into a dental research center by the decision of Narkomzdrav's dental health division in order to bring together all dental care units that existed at the time in different parts of Moscow \u2014 a demonstration dispensary, a chemical laboratory, and the Kovarsky institution itself. The center was named the House of Soviet Dentistry (HSD) and among its main purposes were the retraining of former dentists into oral care consultants, and the preparation of secondary dental personnel, such as dental mechanics, filling and prosthetic specialists, and chair side assistants. \n\nFirst renamed in December, 1920, the HSD's official opening took place two years later in April 1922, when again it was given a different name. This time it was the State Institute of Dentistry (SID), which was to be headed by M.\u0412. Yankovsky, who directed his staff in an in-depth study of Dentistry and [[Odontology]] before anything else; the two major problems to be solved were [[tooth decay]] and [[periodontal disease]]. Among those who joined efforts in the study of these problems were scientists such as professors Ya.S. Utshtem, M.S. Nemenov, M.\u041e. Kovarsky, N.M.  Vilnik, and A.I. Yevdokimov, who replaced M.\u0412. Yankovsky at the post after his death in January 1923. A.I. Yevdokimov made large contributions of his own in the SID's development and that earned him the titles of [[Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation]], a corresponding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR and of [[Hero of Socialist Labor]]. Another new name, that of the State Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SISO) was given in April 1927 by decree of the [[Sovnarkom]] (the Soviet government). The SISO was to continue the job of training dentists through a specially organized refresher course for dental professionals and a dental specialization course for general medicine faculties. This helped to streamline the public dental health care as well as carry on with scientific research in the fields of dental and oral pathology and therapy, [[maxillofacial surgery]], [[orthodontics]], and [[prosthodontics]].\n\nIn 1932, the SISO was renamed yet again, this time to the State Research Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SRISO) and from then on it was concerned mostly with scientific research problems. There were no educational departments in it at the time, those having been replaced by newly formed divisions for pathological [[physiology]], morphology, [[surgery]] and social dentistry instead, to which a steel prosthetics laboratory was added. Another, central, laboratory for prosthetics research was set up a year later in 1933 to manufacture steel dentures on a large scale.\n\n== Years as Moscow Stomatological Institute ==\n\nThe Moscow Stomatological Institute (MSI) as a higher dental school was established under the Narkomzdrav's order dated June 9, 1935, as a subdivision within the SRISO's framework. Both institutions were housed in one building, sharing administration, finances and facilities. Thus, the MSI became the only institution in the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic (RSFSR) that was to conduct scientific research in dentistry, translate the results obtained into everyday dental care practices and train dental professionals as well. Since 1935 a whole number of departments were being added to the institute those of normal anatomy, biology, general chemistry, histology, embryology, and, finally, in 1937 the departments of oral therapy, oral surgery and prosthodontics.\n\nIn line with the resolution of the RSFSR Narkomzdrav of September 1, 1939, the SRISO and MSI were united to become the Moscow State Stomatology Institute (MSSI) with associate professor D. S. Dyshlis as Director. That year witnessed the first batch of 79 graduates trained by the new institution. By the time World War II broke out, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute included 25 departments involved in the studies of dental caries, [[periodontitis]], oral mucous membrane lesions, and maxillofacial injuries.\n\nIn the first days of the war, the MSSI's 1941 graduates were called up to serve in the Red Army or Navy. Among the graduates were V.I. Zausaev who operated on an open heart in a field hospital and who later became a professor and a department head, G.M. Ivaschenko who joined the Army as Chief Dentist, A.I. Doimkov and V.F. Rudko who also gained professorship after the war. To provide the front with dentists, the MSSI put up a special crash course in October, 1941. The MSSI's director, associate professor D.S. Dyshlis, was sent to Izhevsk to make all the necessary arrangements for evacuating the institute to that town, but then the idea was given up. Instead, the MSSI premises in Dolgorukovskaya Street were used to lay out a 50-bed maxillofacial hospital staffed with the institute's polyclinical personnel and the Dentistry department undergraduates. Because of this, over 85% of soldiers with maxillofacial wounds were able to return to the front unscathed. On October 1, 1943, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute opened its doors to students again and about a year later, in February, 1944, A.I.  Yevdokimov was appointed its director.\n\n== After [[World War II]] and [[Khrushchev Thaw]] ==\n\nAfter the war the training of dental care professionals became vital again. So on October 15, 1949, by decision of the USSR Council of Ministers, former dental schools were reorganized into general medicine and dentistry institutes with a 5-year course of studies. The Moscow State Stomatology Institute was again renamed to become the Moscow Medical Stomatology Institute (MMSI), which became famous as the country's research and consulting center on all dentistry-related issues.\n\nIn 1950, associate professor G.N. Beletskiy, a prominent public health worker, was appointed as MMSI director Under his leadership, a student enrollment to the institution went up significantly, the existing clinical medicine facilities were enlarged and new teaching hospitals went under construction, the standards of training research and teaching staff also having much improved. Moreover, two more faculties were launched, part-time and correspondence ones.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1965, the institute was headed by Prof A.I. Doimkov. For many years professor he acted as Chief Dentist of the USSR Ministry of Health administration division No 4 that was in charge of providing dental services to members of the Soviet government and top officials from other countries.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1968, the post of Rector of the MMSI was held by Professor S.I. Babichev, head of the institute's Surgical Disease department. It was he who initiated the idea of incorporating a General Medicine Faculty into the MMSI. On the basis of the Eye Disease department led by Prof S.N. Fyodorov an ophthalmologic research laboratory was created in 1967. The research staff under Prof S.N. Fyodorv looked into a wide range of scientific and practical problems of eye disorders and that, having eventually crowned with success, allowed him to turn the laboratory into what is now known internationally as the Microsurgery of the Eye scientific research institute.\n\n== [[Brezhnev era|Brezhnev years]] and [[Perestroika]] ==\n\nDuring the period of time from 1968 to 1974 when the institute was headed by Prof A.Z. Belousov, the proposal of setting up a general medicine faculty won his support and was realized in 1968. The emergence of the new faculty that was to cater for the need in medical professionals by the city of Moscow and its surroundings called for employment of more teaching staff for a number of the existing departments (those of Foreign Languages, Anatomy, Physiology, Biology, Histology, Physics and General Chemistry, Microbiology and Pharmacology and others) as well as for putting up new courses and departments. These were launched a year later, staffed with qualified specialists and office workers that helped improve the work of the Faculty's administration and dean's offices. That same year, the MMSI opened an advanced training faculty for medical professionals with departments for dental and general practitioners which was followed by opening in 1975 of a faculty for advanced training of teaching staff.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1982, Professor \u041a.M. Lakin, corresponding member of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]], headed the institution. He proved very successful with his studies of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic disease prevention and treatment, the results of which have been widely applied in medical practice. Working in this field he virtually laid the foundation of the hemostasis pharmacology school. His time at the MMSI is marked by putting into operation a Clinical Dentistry Center in Moscow in 1976. It was designed to cater for 2 000 out-patients and 50 in-patients a day and housed a number of the Institute's dental teaching hospital departments.\n\n== In [[Russian federation|modern Russia]] ==\n\nThe decades that followed (1982 to 2002) saw Professor Ye.I. Sokolov as the Rector. As head of the Internal Disease department, he became known for his research into the problems of ischemic heart disease, correction of hemostasis disturbances, and clinical psychophysiology, which brought him success and were immediately put to medical use. Under Professor Ye.I. Sokolov's leadership, the Dentistry faculty premises were greatly enlarged and new departments added to both Dentistry and General Medicine faculties, as well as output of graduates increased. In 1986 \u0430 part-time faculty for dental students was opened, in 1995 - that for post-graduate students, and, in 1998, a secondary medical education faculty was launched to train dental mechanics. Two more to come were a refresher course for dental specialists and the Clinical Psychology faculty, in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Towards the end of the decade, another change of name was in store for the Institution, this time by the orders of the Ministries for General and Vocational Education and that for Public Health of the Russian Federation (RF) dated June 10, 1999. These granted the MMSI a university status with a full name from then on of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) under the RF Ministry of Public Health.\n\n= Rector of the University =\n\nDuring the five years after Professor Ye.I.

The theory of these figures was developed extensively by the ancient Greek mathematicians, surviving especially in works such as those of Apollonius of Perga. The conic sections pervade modern mathematics.]]\n\n'''Apollonius of Perga''' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2}}; {{lang-la|Apollonios hoe Pergaios}}; late 3rd{{snd}}early 2nd centuries BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[geometer]] and [[astronomer]] known for his theories on the topic of [[conic sections]]. Beginning from the theories of [[Euclid]] and [[Archimedes]] on the topic, he brought them to the state they were in just before the invention of [[analytic geometry]]. His definitions of the terms [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], and [[hyperbola]] are the ones in use today.\n\nApollonius worked on many other topics, including astronomy. Most of the work has not survived except in fragmentary references in other authors. His hypothesis of eccentric orbits to explain the apparently aberrant motion of the planets, commonly believed until the Middle Ages, was superseded during the Renaissance.\n\n==Life==\nFor such an important contributor to the field of mathematics, scant biographical information remains. The 6th century Palestinian commentator, [[Eutocius of Ascalon]], on Apollonius\u2019 major work, ''Conics'', states:<ref>Eutocius, ''Commentary on Conica'', Book I, Lines 5-10, to be found translated in {{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Thomas|1953|p=277}}</ref> \n<blockquote>\u201cApollonius, the geometrician, ...  came from Perga in Pamphylia in the times of Ptolemy Euergetes, so records Herakleios the biographer of Archimedes ....\u201d</blockquote>\n\n[[Perga]] at the time was a Hellenized city of [[Pamphylia]] in [[Anatolia]]. The ruins of the city yet stand. It was a center of Hellenistic culture. Euergetes, \u201cbenefactor,\u201d identifies [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], third Greek dynast of Egypt in the diadochi succession. Presumably, his \u201ctimes\u201d are his regnum, 246-222/221 BC. Times are always recorded by ruler or officiating magistrate, so that if Apollonius was born earlier than 246, it would have been the \u201ctimes\u201d of Euergetes\u2019 father. The identity of Herakleios is uncertain. The approximate times of Apollonius are thus certain, but no exact dates can be given.<ref>Studies on the dates of Apollonius are in essence a juggling of the dates of individuals mentioned by Apollonius and other ancient authors. There is the question of exactly what event occurred 246 - 222, whether birth or education. Scholars of the 19th and earlier 20th centuries tend to favor an earlier birth, 260 or 262, in an effort to make Apollonius more the age-mate of Archimedes. Some inscriptional evidence that turned up at Pompeii make Philonides the best dated character. He lived in the 2nd century BC. Since Apollonius' life must be extended into the 2nd century, early birth dates are less likely. A more detailed presentation of the data and problems may be found in {{cite book | title=The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems | first=Wilbur Richard | last=Knorr | location=Cambridge, MA | publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Boston | year=1986 | chapter=The Successors of Archimedes in the Third Century}} The dichotomy between conventional dates deriving from tradition and a more realistic approach is shown by {{cite encyclopedia | title=Apollonius of Perga | encyclopedia=A to Z of Mathematicians | last=McElroy | first=Tucker | year=2005}} McElroy at once gives 262 - 190 (high-side dates) and explains that it should be late 3rd - early 2nd as it is in this article.</ref> The figure  Specific birth and death years stated by the various scholars are only speculative.<ref name=friedintro>{{Harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|loc=Introduction}}</ref>\n\nEutocius appears to associate Perga with the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt. Never under Egypt, Perga in 246 BC belonged to the [[Seleucid Empire]], an independent [[diadochi]] state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty. During the last half of the 3rd century BC, Perga changed hands a number of times, being alternatively under the Seleucids and under the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]] to the north, ruled by the [[Attalid dynasty]]. Someone designated \u201cof Perga\u201d might well be expected to have lived and worked there. To the contrary, if Apollonius was later identified with Perga, it was not on the basis of his residence. The remaining autobiographical material implies that he lived, studied and wrote in Alexandria.\n\nA letter by the Greek mathematician and astronomer [[Hypsicles]] was originally part of the supplement taken from Euclid's Book XIV, part of the thirteen books of Euclid's Elements.<ref>{{cite web|title=The thirteen books of Euclid's Elements|author=Thomas Little Heath|url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenbookseu03heibgoog#page/n521/mode/2up/search/Antiphon|year=1908}}</ref>\n{{Quote|\"[[Basilides of Tyre]], O [[Protarchus]], when he came to Alexandria and met my father, spent the greater part of his sojourn with him on account of the bond between them due to their common interest in mathematics. And on one occasion, when looking into the tract written by Apollonius about the comparison of the [[dodecahedron]] and [[icosahedron]] inscribed in one and the same sphere, that is to say, on the question what ratio they bear to one another, they came to the conclusion that Apollonius' treatment of it in this book was not correct; accordingly, as I understood from my father, they proceeded to amend and rewrite it. But I myself afterwards came across another book published by Apollonius, containing a demonstration of the matter in question, and I was greatly attracted by his investigation of the problem. Now the book published by Apollonius is accessible to all; for it has a large circulation in a form which seems to have been the result of later careful elaboration.\"\n\n\"For my part, I determined to dedicate to you what I deem to be necessary by way of commentary, partly because you will be able, by reason of your proficiency in all mathematics and particularly in geometry, to pass an expert judgment upon what I am about to write, and partly because, on account of your intimacy with my father and your friendly feeling towards myself, you will lend a kindly ear to my disquisition. But it is time to have done with the preamble and to begin my treatise itself.\"}}\n\n===The times of Apollonius===\nApollonius lived toward the end of a historical period now termed the [[Hellenistic Period]], characterized by the superposition of Hellenic culture over extensive non-Hellenic regions to various depths, radical in some places, hardly at all in others. The change was initiated by [[Philip II of Macedon]] and his son, [[Alexander the Great]], who, subjecting all of Greece in a series of stunning victories, went on to conquer the [[Persian Empire]], which ruled territories from Egypt to Pakistan. Philip was assassinated in 336 BC. Alexander went on to fulfill his plan by conquering the vast Persian empire.\n\n===The short autobiography of Apollonius===\nThe material is located in the surviving false \u201cPrefaces\u201d of the books of his ''Conics.'' These are letters delivered to influential friends of Apollonius asking them to review the book enclosed with the letter. The Preface to Book I, addressed to one Eudemus, reminds him that ''Conics'' was initially requested by a house guest at Alexandria, the geometer, Naucrates, otherwise unknown to history. Naucrates had the first draft of all eight books in his hands by the end of the visit. Apollonius refers to them as being \u201cwithout a thorough purgation\u201d (''ou diakatharantes'' in Greek, ''ea non perpurgaremus'' in Latin). He intended to verify and emend the books, releasing each one as it was completed.\n\nHearing of this plan from Apollonius himself on a subsequent visit of the latter to Pergamon, Eudemus had insisted Apollonius send him each book before release. The circumstances imply that at this stage Apollonius was a young geometer seeking the company and advice of established professionals. Pappus states that he was with the students of [[Euclid]] at Alexandria. Euclid was long gone. This stay had been, perhaps, the final stage of Apollonius\u2019 education. Eudemus was perhaps a senior figure in his earlier education at Pergamon; in any case, there is reason to believe that he was or became the head of the Library and Research Center ([[Museum]]) of Pergamon. Apollonius goes on to state that the first four books were concerned with the development of elements while the last four were concerned with special topics.\n\nThere is something of a gap between Prefaces I and II. Apollonius has sent his son, also Apollonius, to deliver II. He speaks with more confidence, suggesting that Eudemus use the book in special study groups, which implies that Eudemus was a senior figure, if not the headmaster, in the research center. Research in such institutions, which followed the model of the [[Lycaeum]] of [[Aristotle]] at Athens, due to the residency of [[Alexander the Great]] and his companions in its northern branch, was part of the educational effort, to which the library and museum were adjunct. There was only one such school in the state. Owned by the king, it was under royal patronage, which was typically jealous, enthusiastic, and participatory. The kings bought, begged, borrowed and stole the precious books whenever and wherever they could. Books were of the highest value, affordable only to wealthy patrons. Collecting them was a royal obligation. Pergamon was known for its parchment industry, whence \u201c[[parchment]]\u201d is derived from \u201cPergamon.\u201d\n\nApollonius brings to mind [[Philonides of Laodicea]], a geometer whom he introduced to Eudemus in [[Ephesus]]. Philonides became Eudemus' student. He lived mainly in Syria during the 1st half of the 2nd century BC. Whether the meeting indicates that Apollonius now lived in Ephesus is unresolved. The intellectual community of the Mediterranean was international in culture. Scholars were mobile in seeking employment. They all communicated via some sort of postal service, public or private. Surviving letters are abundant. They visited each other, read each other's works, made suggestions to each other, recommended students and accumulated a tradition termed by some \u201cthe golden age of mathematics.\u201d\n\nPreface III is missing. During the interval Eudemus passed away, says Apollonius in IV, again supporting a view that Eudemus was senior over Apollonius. Prefaces IV\u2013VII are more formal, omitting personal information and concentrating on summarizing the books. They are all addressed to a mysterious Attalus, a choice made \u201cbecause\u201d, as Apollonius writes to Attalus, \u201cof your earnest desire to possess my works.\u201d By that time a good many people at Pergamum had such a desire. Presumably, this Attalus was someone special, receiving copies of Apollonius\u2019 masterpiece fresh from the author's hand. One strong theory is that Attalus is [[Attalus II Philadelphus]], 220-138 BC, general and defender of his brother's kingdom ([[Eumenes II]]), co-regent on the latter's illness in 160 BC, and heir to his throne and his widow in 158 BC. He and his brother were great patrons of the arts, expanding the library into international magnificence. The dates are consonant with those of Philonides, while Apollonius\u2019 motive is consonant with Attalus' book-collecting initiative.\n\nApollonius sent to Attalus Prefaces V\u2013VII. In Preface VII he describes Book VIII as \u201can appendix\u201d ... \u201cwhich I will take care to send you as speedily as possible.\u201d There is no record that it was ever sent or ever completed. It may be missing from history because it was never in history, Apollonius having died before its completion. [[Pappus of Alexandria]], however, provided lemmas for it, so at the very least some edition of it must once have been in circulation.\n\n== Documented works of Apollonius ==\nApollonius was a prolific geometer, turning out a large number of works. Only one survives, ''Conics''. It is a dense and extensive reference work on the topic, even by today's standards, serving as a repository of now little known geometric propositions as well as a vehicle for some new ones devised by Apollonius. Its audience was not the general population, which could not read or write. It was always intended for savants of mathematics and their small number of educated readers associated with the state schools and their associated libraries. It always was, in other words, a library reference work.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Its basic definitions have become an important mathematical heritage. For the most part its methods and conclusions have been superseded by Analytic Geometry.\n\nOf its eight books, only the first four have a credible claim to descent from the original texts of Apollonius. Books 5-7 have been translated from the Arabic into Latin. The original Greek has been lost. The status of Book VIII is unknown. A first draft existed. Whether the final draft was ever produced is not known. A \"reconstruction\" of it by Edmond Halley exists in Latin. There is no way to know how much of it, if any, is verisimilar to Apollonius. Halley also reconstructed ''De Rationis Sectione'' and ''De Spatii Sectione''. Beyond these works, except for a handful of fragments, documentation that might in any way be interpreted as descending from Apollonius ends.\n\nMany of the lost works are described or mentioned by commentators. In addition are ideas attributed to Apollonius by other authors without documentation. Credible or not, they are hearsay. Some authors identify Apollonius as the author of certain ideas, consequently named after him. Others attempt to express Apollonius in modern notation or phraseology with indeterminate degrees of fidelity.\n\n=== ''Conics'' ===\nThe Greek text of ''Conics'' uses the Euclidean arrangement of definitions, figures and their parts; i.e., the \u201cgivens,\u201d followed by propositions \u201cto be proved.\u201d Books I-VII present 387 propositions. This type of arrangement can be seen in any modern geometry textbook of the traditional subject matter. As in any course of mathematics, the material is very dense and consideration of it, necessarily slow.  Apollonius had a plan for each book, which is partly described in the ''Prefaces''. The headings, or pointers to the plan, are somewhat in deficit, Apollonius having depended more on the logical flow of the topics.\n\nAn intellectual niche is thus created for the commentators of the ages. Each must present Apollonius in the most lucid and relevant way for his own times. They use a variety of methods: annotation, extensive prefatory material, different formats, additional drawings, superficial reorganization by the addition of capita, and so on. There are subtle variations in interpretation. The modern English speaker encounters a lack of material in English due to the preference for New Latin by English scholars. Such intellectual English giants as Edmund Halley and Isaac Newton, the proper descendants of the Hellenistic tradition of mathematics and astronomy,  can only be read and interpreted in translation by populations of English speakers unacquainted with the classical languages; that is, most of them.\n\nPresentations written entirely in native English begin in the late 19th century. Of special note is Heath's ''Treatise on Conic Sections''. His extensive prefatory commentary includes such items as a lexicon of Apollonian geometric terms giving the Greek, the meanings, and usage.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|pp=clvii-clxx}}</ref> Commenting that \u201cthe apparently portentious bulk of the treatise has deterred many from attempting to make its acquaintance,\u201d<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga||Heath|1896|p=vii}}</ref> he promises to add headings, changing the organization superficially, and to clarify the text with modern notation. His work thus references two systems of organization, his own and Apollonius\u2019, to which concordances are given in parentheses.\n\nHeath's work is indispensable. He taught throughout the early 20th century, passing away in 1940, but meanwhile another point of view was developing. [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)]], which had been a military school since colonial times, preceding the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], to which it is adjacent, in 1936 lost its accreditation and was on the brink of bankruptcy. In desperation the board summoned [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] from the [[University of Chicago]], where they had been developing a new theoretical program for instruction of the Classics. Leaping at the opportunity, in 1937 they instituted the \u201cnew program\u201d at St. John's, later dubbed the [[Great Books]] program, a fixed curriculum that would teach the works of select key contributors to the culture of western civilization. At St. John's, Apollonius came to be taught as himself, not as some adjunct to [[analytic geometry]].\n\nThe \u201ctutor\u201d of Apollonius was [[R. Catesby Taliaferro]], a new PhD in 1937 from the [[University of Virginia]]. He tutored until 1942 and then later for one year in 1948, supplying the English translations by himself, translating Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' and Apollonius\u2019 ''Conics''. These translations became part of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's [[Great Books of the Western World]] series. Only Books I-III are included, with an appendix for special topics. Unlike Heath, Taliaferro did not attempt to reorganize Apollonius, even superficially, or to rewrite him. His translation into modern English follows the Greek fairly closely. He does use modern geometric notation to some degree.\n\nContemporaneously with Taliaferro's work, [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas|Ivor Thomas]] an Oxford don of the World War II era, was taking an intense interest in Greek mathematics. He planned a compendium of selections, which came to fruition during his military service as an officer in the [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]]. After the war it found a home in the [[Loeb Classical Library]], where it occupies two volumes, all translated by Thomas, with the Greek on one side of the page and the English on the other, as is customary for the Loeb series. Thomas' work has served as a handbook for the golden age of Greek mathematics. For Apollonius he only includes mainly those portions of Book I that define the sections.\n\nHeath, Taliaferro, and Thomas satisfied the public demand for Apollonius in translation for most of the 20th century. The subject moves on. More recent translations and studies incorporate new information and points of view as well as examine the old.\n\n====Book I====\nBook I presents 58 propositions. Its most salient content is all the basic definitions concerning cones and conic sections. These definitions are not exactly the same as the modern ones of the same words. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] the modern words derive from the ancient, but the etymon often differs in meaning from its [[Linguistic reconstruction|reflex]].\n\nA [[conical surface]] is generated by a [[line segment]] rotated about a [[bisection|bisector]] point such that the end points trace [[circle]]s, each in its own [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]. A [[cone]], one branch of the double conical surface, is the surface with the point ([[Apex (geometry)|apex]] or [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]), the circle ([[Base (geometry)|base]]), and the axis, a line joining vertex and center of base.\n\nA \u201c[[Cross section (geometry)|section]]\u201d (Latin sectio, Greek tome) is an imaginary \u201ccutting\u201d  of a cone by a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].\n* Proposition I.3: \u201cIf a cone is cut by a plane through the vertex, the section is a triangle.\u201d In the case of a double cone, the section is two triangles such that the angles at the vertex are [[angle|vertical angles]].\n* Proposition I.4 asserts that sections of a cone parallel to the base are circles with centers on the axis.<ref>Note that the Greek geometers were not defining the circle, the ellipse, and other figures as conic sections. This would be circular definition, as the cone was defined in terms of a circle. Each figure has its own geometric definition, and in addition, is being shown to be a conic section.</ref>\n* Proposition I.13 defines the ellipse, which is conceived as the cutting of a single cone by a plane inclined to the plane of the base and intersecting the latter in a line perpendicular to the diameter extended of the base outside the cone (not shown). The angle of the inclined plane must be greater than zero, or the section would be a circle. It must be less than the corresponding base angle of the axial triangle, at which the figure becomes a parabola. \n* Proposition I.11 defines a parabola. Its plane is parallel to a side in the conic surface of the axial triangle. \n* Proposition I.12 defines a hyperbola. Its plane is parallel to the axis. It cut both cones of the pair, thus acquiring two distinct branches (only one is shown).\n\nThe Greek geometers were interested in laying out select figures from their inventory in various applications of engineering and architecture, as the great inventors, such as Archimedes, were accustomed to doing. A demand for conic sections existed then and exists now. The development of mathematical characterization had moved geometry in the direction of [[Greek geometric algebra]], which visually features such algebraic fundamentals as assigning values to line segments as variables. They used a coordinate system intermediate between a grid of measurements and the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. The theories of proportion and application of areas allowed the development of visual equations. (See below under Methods of Apollonius).\n\n[[File:Parabola connection with areas of a square and a rectangle.gif|thumb|250px|The animated figure depicts the method of \"application of areas\" to express the mathematical relationship that characterizes a parabola. The upper left corner of the changing rectangle on the left side and the upper right corner on the right side is \"any point on the section.\" The animation has it following the section. The orange square at the top is \"the square on the distance from the point to the diameter; i.e., a square of the ordinate. In Apollonius, the orientation is horizontal rather than the vertical shown here. Here it is the square of the abscissa. Regardless of orientation, the equation is the same, names changed. The blue rectangle on the outside is the rectangle on the other coordinate and the distance p. In algebra, x<sup>2</sup> = py, one form of the equation for a parabola. If the outer rectangle exceeds py in area, the section must be a hyperbola; if it is less, an ellipse.]]\nThe \u201capplication of areas\u201d implicitly asks, given an area and a line segment, does this area apply; that is, is it equal to, the square on the segment? If yes, an applicability (parabole) has been established. Apollonius followed Euclid in asking if a rectangle on the [[abscissa]] of any point on the section applies to the square of the [[ordinate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=c}}</ref> If it does, his word-equation is the equivalent of <math display=\"inline\">y^2 {{=}} kx</math> which is one modern form of the equation for a [[parabola]]. The rectangle has sides <math>k</math> and <math>x</math>. It was he who accordingly named the figure, parabola, \u201capplication.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cno applicability\u201d case is further divided into two possibilities. Given a function, <math display=\"inline\">f(x)</math>, such that, in the applicability case, <math display=\"inline\">y^2 {{=}} g(x)</math>, in the no applicability case, either <math display=\"inline\">y^2 > g(x)</math> or <math display=\"inline\">y^2 < g(x)</math>. In the former, <math display=\"inline\">g(x)</math> falls short of <math display=\"inline\">y^2</math> by a quantity termed the ellipsis, \u201ddeficit.\u201d  In the latter, <math display=\"inline\">g(x)</math> overshoots by a quantity termed the hyperbole, \"surfeit.\"\n\nApplicability could be achieved by adding the deficit, <math display=\"inline\">y^2 {{=}} f(x) {{=}} g(x) + d</math>, or subtracting the surfeit, <math display=\"inline\">g(x) - s</math>. The figure compensating for a deficit was named an ellipse; for a surfeit, a hyperbola.<ref>Note that a circle, being another case of the deficit, is sometimes considered a kind of ellipse with a single center instead of two foci.</ref> The terms of the modern equation depend on the translation and rotation of the figure from the origin, but the general equation for an ellipse,\n\n:{{math|Ax<sup>2</sup> + By<sup>2</sup> {{=}} C}}\n\ncan be placed in the form\n\n<math>y^2 {{=}} \\left | \\frac{{A}}{{B}}x^2\\right | + \\frac{{C}}{{B}}</math>\n\nwhere C/B is the d, while an equation for the hyperbola,\n\n:{{math|Ax<sup>2</sup> - By<sup>2</sup> {{=}} C}}\n\nbecomes\n\n<math>y^2 {{=}} \\left | \\frac{{A}}{{B}}x^2\\right | - \\frac{{C}}{{B}}</math>\n\nwhere C/B is the s.<ref>Note that y<sup>2</sup> = g(x) is not the equation for a parabola, which is y<sup>2</sup> = kx, the x being a lower power.</ref>\n\n====Book II====\nBook II contains 53 propositions. Apollonius says that he intended to cover \"the properties having to do with the diameters and axes and also the [[asymptotes]] and other things ... for limits of possibility.\" His definition of \"diameter\" is different from the traditional, as he finds it necessary to refer the intended recipient of the letter to his work for a definition. The elements mentioned are those that specify the shape and generation of the figures. [[Tangents]] are covered at the end of the book.\n\n====Book III====\nBook III contains 56 propositions. Apollonius claims original discovery for theorems \"of use for the construction of solid loci ... the three-line and four-line [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] ....\" The locus of a conic section is the section. The three-line locus problem (as stated by Taliafero's appendix to Book III) finds \"the locus of points whose distances from three given fixed straight lines ... are such that the square of one of the distances is always in a constant ratio to the rectangle contained by the other two distances.\" This is the proof of the application of areas resulting in the parabola.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}} The four-line problem results in the ellipse and hyperbola. Analytic geometry derives the same loci from simpler criteria supported by algebra, rather than geometry, for which Descartes was highly praised. He supersedes Apollonius in his methods.\n\n====Book IV====\nBook IV contains 57 propositions. The first sent to Attalus, rather than to Eudemus, it thus represents his more mature geometric thought. The topic is rather specialized: \"the greatest number of points at which sections of a cone can meet one another, or meet a circumference of a circle, ....\" Nevertheless, he speaks with enthusiasm, labeling them \"of considerable use\" in solving problems (Preface 4).<ref>Many of the commentators and translators, as well, no doubt, as copyists, have been explicitly less than enthusiastic about their use, especially after analytic geometry, which can do most of the problems by algebra without any stock of constructions. Taliaferro stops at Book III. Heath attempts a digest of the book to make it more palatable to the reader ({{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|loc=Intersecting Conics}}) Fried is more true to Apollonius, supplying an extensive critical apparatus instead ({{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Fried|2002|loc=Footnotes}}).</ref>\n\n====Book V====\nBook V, known only through translation from the Arabic, contains 77 propositions, the most of any book.<ref>{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=146}}</ref> They cover the ellipse (50 propositions), the parabola (22), and the hyperbola (28).<ref>{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=188}}</ref> These are not explicitly the topic, which in Prefaces I and V Apollonius states to be maximum and minimum lines. These terms are not explained. In contrast to Book I, Book V contains no definitions and no explanation.\n\nThe ambiguity has served as a magnet to exegetes of Apollonius, who must interpret without sure knowledge of the meaning of the book's major terms. Until recently Heath's view prevailed: the lines are to be treated as normals to the sections.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Pergas|Heath|1896|loc=Normals as Maxima and Minima}}</ref> A [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] in this case is the [[perpendicular]] to a curve at a [[tangent point]] sometimes called the foot. If a section is plotted according to Apollonius\u2019 coordinate system (see below under Methods of Apollonius), with the diameter (translated by Heath as the axis) on the x-axis and the vertex at the origin on the left, the phraseology of the propositions indicates that the minima/maxima are to be found between the section and the axis. Heath is led into his view by consideration of a fixed point p on the section serving both as tangent point and as one end of the line. The minimum distance between p and some point g on the axis must then be the normal from p.\n\nIn modern mathematics, normals to curves are known for being the location of the [[center of curvature]] of that small part of the curve located around the foot. The distance from the foot to the center is the [[radius of curvature]]. The latter is the [[radius]] of a circle, but for other than circular curves, the small [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] can be approximated by a circular arc. The curvature of non-circular curves; e.g., the conic sections, must change over the section. A map of the center of curvature; i.e., its locus, as the foot moves over the section, is termed the [[evolute]] of the section. Such a figure, the edge of the successive positions of a line, is termed an [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] today. Heath believed that in Book V we are seeing Apollonius establish the logical foundation of a theory of normals, evolutes, and envelopes.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|loc=Propositions Leading Immediately to the Determination of the Evolute}}</ref>\n\nHeath's was accepted as the authoritative interpretation of Book V for the entire 20th century, but the changing of the century brought with it a change of view. In 2001, Apollonius scholars Fried & Unguru, granting all due respect to other Heath chapters, balked at the historicity of Heath's analysis of Book V, asserting that he \u201creworks the original to make it more congenial to a modern mathematician ... this is the kind of thing that makes Heath\u2019s work of dubious value for the historian, revealing more of Heath\u2019s mind than that of Apollonius.\u201d<ref name=fried148>{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=148}}</ref> Some of his arguments are in summary as follows. There is no mention of maxima/minima being per se normals in either the prefaces or the books proper.<ref>Normalis is a perfectly good Latin word meaning \"measured with a norma,\" or square. Halley uses it to translate Pappus' eutheia, \"right-placed,\" which has a more general sense of directionally right. For \"the perpendicular to,\" the mathematical Greeks used \"the normal of,\" where the object of \"of\" could be any figure, usually a straight line. What Fried is saying is that there was no standard use of normal to mean normal of a curve, nor did Apollonius introduce one, although in several isolated cases he did describe one.</ref> Out of Heath's selection of 50 propositions said to cover normals, only 7, Book V: 27-33, state or imply maximum/minimum lines being perpendicular to the tangents. These 7 Fried classifies as isolated, unrelated to the main propositions of the book. They do not in any way imply that maxima/minima in general are normals. In his extensive investigation of the other 43 propositions, Fried proves that many cannot be.<ref>Fried & Unguru dedicate an entire chapter to these criticisms:{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|loc=Maximum and Minimum Lines: Book V of the Conica}}</ref>\n\nFried and Unguru counter by portraying Apollonius as a continuation of the past rather than a foreshadowing of the future. First is a complete philological study of all references to minimum and maximum lines, which uncovers a standard phraseology. There are three groups of 20-25 propositions each.<ref>A summary table is given in {{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=190}}</ref> The first group contains the phrase \u201cfrom a point on the axis to the section,\u201d which is exactly the opposite of a hypothetical \u201cfrom a point on the section to the axis.\u201d The former does not have to be normal to anything, although it might be. Given a fixed point on the axis, of all the lines connecting it to all the points of the section, one will be longest (maximum) and one shortest (minimum). Other phrases are \u201cin a section,\u201d \u201cdrawn from a section,\u201d \u201ccut off between the section and its axis,\u201d cut off by the axis,\u201d all referring to the same image.\n\nIn the view of Fried and Unguru, the topic of Book V is exactly what Apollonius says it is, maximum and minimum lines. These are not code words for future concepts, but refer to ancient concepts then in use. The authors cite Euclid, Elements, Book III, which concerns itself with circles, and maximum and minimum distances from interior points to the circumference.<ref>{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=182}}</ref> Without admitting to any specific generality they use terms such as \u201clike\u201d or \u201cthe analog of.\u201d They are known for innovating the term \u201cneusis-like.\u201d A [[neusis construction]] was a method of fitting a given segment between two given curves. Given a point P, and a ruler with the segment marked off on it. one rotates the ruler around P cutting the two curves until the segment is fitted between them. In Book V, P is the point on the axis. Rotating a ruler around it, one discovers the distances to the section, from which the minimum and maximum can be discerned. The technique is not applied to the situation, so it is not neusis. The authors use neusis-like, seeing an archetypal similarity to  the ancient method.<ref name=fried148/>\n\n====Book VI====\nBook VI, known only through translation from the Arabic, contains 33 propositions, the least of any book. It also has large [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]], or gaps in the text, due to damage or corruption in the previous texts.\n\nThe topic is relatively clear and uncontroversial. Preface 1 states that it is \u201cequal and similar sections of cones.\u201d Apollonius extends the concepts of congruence and similarity presented by Euclid for more elementary figures, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, to conic sections. Preface 6 mentions \u201csections and segments\u201d that are \u201cequal and unequal\u201d as well as \u201csimilar and dissimilar,\u201d and adds some constructional information.\n\nBook VI features a return to the basic definitions at the front of the book. \u201c[[Extensionality|Equality]]\u201d is determined by an application of areas. If one figure; that is, a section or a segment, is \u201capplied\u201d to another (Halley's ''si applicari possit altera super alteram''), they are \u201cequal\u201d (Halley's ''aequales'') if they coincide and no line of one crosses any line of the other. This is obviously a standard of [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] following Euclid, Book I, Common Notions, 4: \u201cand things coinciding (''epharmazanta'') with one another are equal (''isa'').\u201d Coincidence and equality overlap, but they are not the same: the application of areas used to define the sections depends on quantitative equality of areas but they can belong to different figures.\n\nBetween instances that are the [[Identity (philosophy)|same]] (homos), being equal to each other, and those that are [[Difference (philosophy)|different]], or [[Inequality (mathematics)|unequal]], are figures that are \u201csame-ish\u201d (hom-oios), or [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]]. They are neither entirely the same nor different, but share aspects that are the same and do not share aspects that are different. Intuitively the geometricians had [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] in mind; e.g., a map is similar to a topographic region. Thus figures could have larger or smaller versions of themselves.\n\nThe aspects that are the same in similar figures depend on the figure. Book 6 of Euclid's Elements presents similar triangles as those that have the same corresponding angles. A triangle can thus have miniatures as small as you please, or giant versions, and still be \u201cthe same\u201d triangle as the original.\n\nIn Apollonius' definitions at the beginning of Book VI, similar right cones have similar axial triangles. Similar sections and segments of sections are first of all in similar cones. In addition, for every abscissa of one must exist an abscissa in the other at the desired scale. Finally, abscissa and ordinate of one must be matched by coordinates of the same ratio of ordinate to abscissa as the other. The total effect is as though the section or segment were moved up and down the cone to achieve a different scale.<ref>A mathematical explanation as well as precis of each proposition in the book can be found in {{harvnb|Toomer|1990|pp=lxi-lxix}} Note that translations of the definitions vary widely as each English author attempts to paraphrase the complexities in clear and succinct English. In essence, no such English is available.</ref>\n\n==== Book VII ====\nBook VII, also a translation from the Arabic, contains 51 Propositions. These are the last that Heath considers in his 1896 edition. In Preface I, Apollonius does not mention them, implying that, at the time of the first draft, they may not have existed in sufficiently coherent form to describe. Apollonius uses obscure language, that they are \u201cperi dioristikon theorematon\u201d, which Halley translated as \u201cde theorematis ad determinationem pertinentibus,\u201d and Heath as \u201ctheorems involving determinations of limits.\u201d This is the language of definition, but no definitions are forthcoming. Whether the reference might be to a specific kind of definition is a consideration but to date nothing credible has been proposed.<ref>A summary of the question can be found at {{harvnb|Heath|1896|p=lxx}}. Most writers have something to say about it; for example, {{cite book | first=GJ | last=Toomer | year=1990 | title=Apollonius Conics Book V to VII: the Arabic Translation of the Lost Greek Original in the Version of the Banu Musa | volume=I | series=Sources in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences 9 | location=New York | publisher=Springer | pages=lxix-lxx | quote=we may regard the establishment of limits of solution as its main purpose}} Toomer\u2019s view is given without specifics or reference to any text of Book VII except the Preface.</ref> The topic of Book VII, completed toward the end of Apollonius\u2019 life and career, is stated in Preface VII to be [[diameter]]s and \u201cthe figures described upon them,\u201d which must include [[conjugate diameters]], as he relies heavily on them. In what way the term \u201climits\u201d or \u201cdeterminations\u201d might apply is not mentioned.\n\nDiameters and their conjugates are defined in Book I (Definitions 4-6). Not every diameter has a conjugate. The topography of a diameter (Greek diametros) requires a regular [[curve]]d [[shape|figure]]. Irregularly-shaped areas, addressed in modern times, are not in the ancient game plan. Apollonius has in mind, of course, the conic sections, which he describes in often convolute language: \u201ca curve in the same plane\u201d is a circle, ellipse or parabola, while \u201ctwo curves in the same plane\u201d is a hyperbola. A [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is a straight line whose two end points are on the figure; i.e., it cuts the figure in two places. If a grid of parallel chords is imposed on the figure, then the diameter is defined as the line bisecting all the chords, reaching the curve itself at a point called the vertex. There is no requirement for a closed figure; e.g., a parabola has a diameter.\n\nA parabola has [[Symmetry (geometry)|symmetry]] in one dimension. If you imagine it folded on its one diameter, the two halves are congruent, or fit over each other. The same may be said of one branch of a hyperbola. Conjugate diameters (Greek suzugeis diametroi, where suzugeis is \u201cyoked together\u201d), however, are symmetric in two dimensions. The figures to which they apply require also an areal center (Greek kentron), today called a [[centroid]], serving as a center of symmetry in two directions. These figures are the circle, ellipse, and two-branched hyperbola. There is only one centroid, which must not be confused with the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]]. A diameter is a chord passing through the centroid, which always bisects it.\n\nFor the circle and ellipse, let a grid of parallel chords be superimposed over the figure such that the longest is a diameter and the others are successively shorter until the last is not a chord, but is a tangent point. The tangent must be parallel to the diameter. A conjugate diameter bisects the chords, being placed between the centroid and the tangent point. Moreover, both diameters are conjugate to each other, being called a conjugate pair. It is obvious that any conjugate pair of a circle are perpendicular to each other, but in an ellipse, only the major and minor axes are, the elongation destroying the perpendicularity in all other cases.\n\nConjugates are defined for the two branches of a [[hyperbola]] resulting from the cutting of a double cone by a single plane. They are called conjugate branches. They have the same diameter. Its centroid bisects the segment between vertices. There is room for one more diameter-like line: let a grid of lines parallel to the diameter cut both branches of the hyperbola. These lines are chord-like except that they do not terminate on the same continuous curve. A conjugate diameter can be drawn from the centroid to bisect the chord-like lines.\n\nThese concepts mainly from Book I get us started on the 51 propositions of Book VII defining in detail the relationships between sections, diameters, and conjugate diameters. As with some of Apollonius other specialized topics, their utility today compared to Analytic Geometry remains to be seen, although he affirms in Preface VII that they are both useful and innovative; i.e., he takes the credit for them.\n\n=== Lost and reconstructed works described by Pappus ===\nPappus mentions other treatises of Apollonius:\n# \u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae, ''De Rationis Sectione'' (\"Cutting of a Ratio\")\n# \u03a7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae, ''De Spatii Sectione'' (\"Cutting of an Area\")\n# \u0394\u03b9\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae, ''De Sectione Determinata'' (\"Determinate Section\")\n# \u1f18\u03c0\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af, ''De Tactionibus'' (\"Tangencies\")<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mackenzie|first=Dana|date=|title=A Tisket, a Tasket, an Apollonian Gasket|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/a-tisket-a-tasket-an-apollonian-gasket/|journal=American Scientist|volume=98, January\u2013February 2010|issue=1|pages=10\u201314|via=}}</ref>\n# \u039d\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, ''De Inclinationibus'' (\"Inclinations\")\n# \u03a4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03b9, ''De Locis Planis'' (\"Plane Loci\").\nEach of these was divided into two books, and\u2014with the ''Data'', the ''Porisms'', and ''Surface-Loci'' of Euclid and the ''Conics'' of Apollonius\u2014were, according to Pappus, included in the body of the ancient analysis.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}} Descriptions follow of the six works mentioned above.\n\n==== ''De Rationis Sectione'' ====\n''De Rationis Sectione'' sought to resolve a simple problem: Given two straight lines and a point in each, draw through a third given point a straight line cutting the two fixed lines such that the parts intercepted between the given points in them and the points of intersection with this third line may have a given ratio.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}\n\n==== ''De Spatii Sectione'' ====\n''De Spatii Sectione'' discussed a similar problem requiring the rectangle contained by the two intercepts to be equal to a given rectangle.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}\n\nIn the late 17th century, [[Edward Bernard]] discovered a version of ''De Rationis Sectione'' in the [[Bodleian Library]].

The most difficult and historically interesting case arises when the three given things are circles. In the 16th century, [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te|Vieta]] presented this problem (sometimes known as the Apollonian Problem) to [[Adrianus Romanus]], who solved it with a [[hyperbola]]. Vieta thereupon proposed a simpler solution, eventually leading him to restore the whole of Apollonius's treatise in the small work ''Apollonius Gallus'' (Paris, 1600). The history of the problem is explored in fascinating detail in the preface to [[J. W. Camerer]]'s brief ''Apollonii Pergaei quae supersunt, ac maxime Lemmata Pappi in hos Libras, cum Observationibus, &c'' (Gothae, 1795, 8vo).{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}\n\n==== ''De Inclinationibus'' ====\nThe object of ''De Inclinationibus'' was to demonstrate how a straight line of a given length, tending towards a given point, could be inserted between two given (straight or circular) lines.

The translation was performed by writers working for them.<ref name=friedintro/> In Halley's work, only the Latin translation of Books V-VII is given. This is its first printed publication. Book VIII was lost before the scholars of Almamon could take a hand at preserving it. Halley's concoction, based on expectations developed in Book VII, and the lemmas of Pappus, is given in Latin. The commentary of Eutocius, the lemmas of Pappus, and two related treatises by Serenus are included as a guide to the interpretation of the ''Conics''.\n\n== Ideas attributed to Apollonius by other writers ==\n\n=== Apollonius' contribution to astronomy ===\nThe equivalence of two descriptions of planet motions, one using excentrics and another [[deferent and epicycle]]s, is attributed to him. Ptolemy describes this equivalence as [[Apollonius' theorem]] in the ''[[Almagest]]'' XII.1.\n\n=== Methods of Apollonius ===\nAccording to Heath,<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=ci}}</ref> \u201cThe Methods of Apollonius\u201d were not his and were not personal. Whatever influence he had on later theorists was that of geometry, not of his own innovation of technique. Heath says, \n<blockquote>\u201cAs a preliminary to the consideration in detail of the methods employed in the Conics, it may be stated generally that they follow steadily the accepted principles of geometrical investigation which found their definitive expression in the Elements of Euclid.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nWith regard to moderns speaking of golden age geometers, the term \"method\" means specifically the visual, reconstructive way in which the geometer unknowingly produces the same result as an algebraic method used today. As a simple example, algebra finds the area of a square by squaring its side. The geometric method of accomplishing the same result is to construct a visual square. Geometric methods in the golden age could produce most of the results of elementary algebra.\n\n====Geometrical algebra====\n[[File:\u041f\u0438\u0444\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043d\u044b.png|thumb|200px|left|Visual form of the Pythagorean theorem as the ancient Greeks saw it. The blue square is the sum of the other two squares.]]\nHeath goes on to use the term [[Greek geometric algebra|geometrical algebra]] for the methods of the entire golden age. The term is \u201cnot inappropriately\u201d called that, he says. Today the term has been resurrected for use in other senses (see under [[geometric algebra]]). Heath was using it as it had been defined by [[Henry Burchard Fine]] in 1890 or before.<ref>{{cite book | last=Fine | first=Henry B | authorlink=Henry Burchard Fine | year=1902 | title=The number-system of algebra treated theoretically and historically | location=Boston | publisher=Leach | pages=119\u2013120}}</ref> Fine applies it to [[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]] of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], the first full-blown work of [[analytic geometry]]. Establishing as a precondition that \u201ctwo algebras are formally identical whose fundamental operations are formally the same,\u201d Fine says that Descartes\u2019 work \u201cis not ... mere numerical algebra, but what may for want of a better name be called the algebra of line segments. Its symbolism is the same as that of numerical algebra; ....\u201d\n\nFor example, in Apollonius a line segment AB (the line between Point A and Point B) is also the numerical length of the segment. It can have any length. AB therefore becomes the same as an [[Variable (mathematics)|algebraic variable]], such as ''x'' (the unknown), to which any value might be assigned; e.g., ''x''=3.\n\nVariables are defined in Apollonius by such word statements as \u201clet AB be the distance from any point on the section to the diameter,\u201d a practice that continues in algebra today. Every student of basic algebra must learn to convert \u201cword problems\u201d to algebraic variables and equations, to which the rules of algebra apply in solving for ''x''. Apollonius had no such rules. His solutions are geometric.\n\nRelationships not readily amenable to pictorial solutions were beyond his grasp; however, his repertory of pictorial solutions came from a pool of complex geometric solutions generally not known (or required) today. One well-known exception is the indispensable [[Pythagorean Theorem]], even now represented by a right triangle with squares on its sides illustrating an expression such as a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>. The Greek geometers called those terms \u201cthe square on AB,\u201d etc. Similarly, the area of a rectangle formed by AB and CD was \"the rectangle on AB and CD.\"\n\nThese concepts gave the Greek geometers algebraic access to [[Linear equation|linear functions]] and [[quadratic functions]], which latter the conic sections are. They contain [[Exponentiation|powers]] of 1 or 2 respectively. Apollonius had not much use for cubes (featured in [[solid geometry]]), even though a cone is a solid. His interest was in conic sections, which are plane figures. Powers of 4 and up were beyond visualization, requiring a degree of abstraction not available in geometry, but ready at hand in algebra.\n\n====The coordinate system of Apollonius====\n[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system Oxy P.svg|thumb|200px|Cartesian coordinate system, standard in analytic geometry]]\nAll ordinary measurement of length in public units, such as inches, using standard public devices, such as a ruler, implies public recognition of a [[Regular grid|Cartesian grid]]; that is, a surface divided into unit squares, such as one square inch, and a space divided into unit cubes, such as one cubic inch. The [[ancient Greek units of measurement]] had provided such a grid to Greek mathematicians since the Bronze Age. \nPrior to Apollonius, [[Menaechmus]] and [[Archimedes]] had already started locating their figures on an implied window of the common grid by referring to distances conceived to be measured from a left-hand vertical line marking a low measure and a bottom horizontal line marking a low measure, the directions being rectilinear, or perpendicular to one another.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=cxv}}</ref> These edges of the window become, in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the axes. One specifies the rectilinear distances of any point from the axes as the [[coordinates]]. The ancient Greeks did not have that convention. They simply referred to distances.\n\nApollonius does have a standard window in which he places his figures. Vertical measurement is from a horizontal line he calls the \u201cdiameter.\u201d  The word is the same in Greek as it is in English, but the Greek is somewhat wider in its comprehension.<ref>Apollonius, ''Conics'', Book I, Definition 4. Refer also to {{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=clxi}}</ref>  If the figure of the conic section is cut by a grid of parallel lines, the diameter bisects all the line segments included between the branches of the figure. It must pass through the vertex (koruphe, \"crown\"). A diameter thus comprises open figures such as a parabola as well as closed, such as a circle. There is no specification that the diameter must be perpendicular to the parallel lines, but Apollonius uses only rectilinear ones.\n\nThe rectilinear distance from a point on the section to the diameter is termed tetagmenos in Greek, etymologically simply \u201cextended.\u201d  As it is only ever extended \u201cdown\u201d (kata-) or \u201cup\u201d (ana-), the translators interpret it as [[ordinate]]. In that case the diameter becomes the x-axis and the vertex the origin. The y-axis then becomes a tangent to the curve at the vertex. The [[abscissa]] is then defined as the segment of the diameter between the ordinate and the vertex.\n\nUsing his version of a coordinate system, Apollonius manages to develop in pictorial form the geometric equivalents of the equations for the conic sections, which raises the question of whether his coordinate system can be considered Cartesian. There are some differences. The Cartesian system is to be regarded as universal, covering all figures in all space applied before any calculation is done. It has four quadrants divided by the two crossed axes. Three of the quadrants include negative coordinates meaning directions opposite the reference axes of zero.\n\nApollonius has no negative numbers, does not explicitly have a number for zero, and does not develop the coordinate system independently of the conic sections. He works essentially only in Quadrant 1, all positive coordinates. Carl Boyer, a modern historian of mathematics, therefore says:<ref name=\"Boyer Apollonius\">{{cite book | first=Carl B. | last=Boyer | authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer | title=A History of Mathematics | edition=Second | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | date=1991 | isbn=0-471-54397-7 | chapter=Apollonius of Perga | pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00boye/page/156 156\u2013157] | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00boye/page/156 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\u201dHowever, Greek geometric algebra did not provide for negative magnitudes; moreover, the coordinate system was in every case superimposed ''a posteriori'' upon a given curve in order to study its properties .... Apollonius, the greatest geometer of antiquity, failed to develop analytic geometry....\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n\nNo one denies, however, that Apollonius occupies some sort of intermediate niche between the grid system of conventional measurement and the fully developed Cartesian Coordinate System of Analytic Geometry. In reading Apollonius, one must take care not to assume modern meanings for his terms.\n\n====The theory of proportions====\n{{main article|Ratio|Proportionality (mathematics)|Magnitude (mathematics)|Fraction (mathematics)|Eudoxus of Cnidus}}\nApollonius uses the \"Theory of Proportions\" as expressed in [[Euclid]]\u2019s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', Books 5 and 6. Devised by Eudoxus of Cnidus, the theory is intermediate between purely graphic methods and modern number theory. A standard decimal number system is lacking, as is a standard treatment of fractions. The propositions, however, express in words rules for manipulating fractions in arithmetic. Heath proposes that they stand in place of multiplication and division.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|pp=ci \u2013 cii}}</ref>\n\nBy the term \u201cmagnitude\u201d  Eudoxus hoped to go beyond numbers to a general sense of size, a meaning it still retains. With regard to the figures of Euclid, it most often means numbers, which was the Pythagorean approach. [[Pythagoras]] believed the universe could be characterized by quantities, which belief has become the current scientific dogma. Book V of Euclid begins by insisting that a magnitude (megethos, \u201csize\u201d) must be divisible evenly into units (meros, \u201cpart\u201d). A magnitude is thus a multiple of units. They do not have to be standard measurement units, such as meters or feet. One unit can be any designated line segment.\n\nThere follows perhaps the most useful fundamental definition ever devised in science: the ratio (Greek [[logos]], meaning roughly \u201cexplanation.\u201d) is a statement of relative magnitude. Given two magnitudes, say of segments AB and CD. the ratio of AB to CD, where CD is considered unit, is the number of CD in AB; for example, 3 parts of 4, or 60 parts per million, where [[Parts-per notation|ppm]] still uses the \u201cparts\u201d terminology. The ratio is the basis of the modern fraction, which also still means \u201cpart,\u201d or \u201cfragment\u201d,  from the same Latin root as fracture.\nThe ratio is the basis of mathematical prediction in the logical structure called a \u201cproportion\u201d  (Greek analogos). The proportion states that if two segments, AB and CD, have the same ratio as two others, EF and GH, then AB and CD are proportional to EF and GH, or, as would be said in Euclid, AB is to CD as EF is to GH.\n\nAlgebra reduces this general concept to the expression AB/CD = EF/GH. Given any three of the terms, one can calculate the fourth as an unknown. Rearranging the above equation, one obtains AB = (CD/GH)\u2022EF, in which, expressed as y = kx, the CD/GH is known as the \u201cconstant of proportionality.\u201d The Greeks had little difficulty with taking multiples (Greek pollaplasiein), probably by successive addition.\n\nApollonius uses ratios almost exclusively of line segments and areas, which are designated by squares and rectangles.

The conic sections pervade modern mathematics.]]\n\n'''Apollonius of Perga''' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2}}; {{lang-la|Apollonius Pergaeus}}; late 3rd{{snd}}early 2nd centuries BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[geometer]] and [[astronomer]] known for his theories on the topic of [[conic sections]]. Beginning from the theories of [[Euclid]] and [[Archimedes]] on the topic, he brought them to the state they were in just before the invention of [[analytic geometry]]. His definitions of the terms [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], and [[hyperbola]] are the ones in use today.\n\nApollonius worked on many other topics, including astronomy. Most of the work has not survived except in fragmentary references in other authors. His hypothesis of eccentric orbits to explain the apparently aberrant motion of the planets, commonly believed until the Middle Ages, was superseded during the Renaissance.\n\n==Life==\nFor such an important contributor to the field of mathematics, scant biographical information remains. The 6th century Palestinian commentator, [[Eutocius of Ascalon]], on Apollonius\u2019 major work, ''Conics'', states:<ref>Eutocius, ''Commentary on Conica'', Book I, Lines 5-10, to be found translated in {{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Thomas|1953|p=277}}</ref> \n<blockquote>\u201cApollonius, the geometrician, ...  came from Perga in Pamphylia in the times of Ptolemy Euergetes, so records Herakleios the biographer of Archimedes ....\u201d</blockquote>\n\n[[Perga]] at the time was a Hellenized city of [[Pamphylia]] in [[Anatolia]]. The ruins of the city yet stand. It was a center of Hellenistic culture. Euergetes, \u201cbenefactor,\u201d identifies [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], third Greek dynast of Egypt in the diadochi succession. Presumably, his \u201ctimes\u201d are his regnum, 246-222/221 BC. Times are always recorded by ruler or officiating magistrate, so that if Apollonius was born earlier than 246, it would have been the \u201ctimes\u201d of Euergetes\u2019 father. The identity of Herakleios is uncertain. The approximate times of Apollonius are thus certain, but no exact dates can be given.<ref>Studies on the dates of Apollonius are in essence a juggling of the dates of individuals mentioned by Apollonius and other ancient authors. There is the question of exactly what event occurred 246 - 222, whether birth or education. Scholars of the 19th and earlier 20th centuries tend to favor an earlier birth, 260 or 262, in an effort to make Apollonius more the age-mate of Archimedes. Some inscriptional evidence that turned up at Pompeii make Philonides the best dated character. He lived in the 2nd century BC. Since Apollonius' life must be extended into the 2nd century, early birth dates are less likely. A more detailed presentation of the data and problems may be found in {{cite book | title=The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems | first=Wilbur Richard | last=Knorr | location=Cambridge, MA | publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Boston | year=1986 | chapter=The Successors of Archimedes in the Third Century}} The dichotomy between conventional dates deriving from tradition and a more realistic approach is shown by {{cite encyclopedia | title=Apollonius of Perga | encyclopedia=A to Z of Mathematicians | last=McElroy | first=Tucker | year=2005}} McElroy at once gives 262 - 190 (high-side dates) and explains that it should be late 3rd - early 2nd as it is in this article.</ref> The figure  Specific birth and death years stated by the various scholars are only speculative.<ref name=friedintro>{{Harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|loc=Introduction}}</ref>\n\nEutocius appears to associate Perga with the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt. Never under Egypt, Perga in 246 BC belonged to the [[Seleucid Empire]], an independent [[diadochi]] state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty. During the last half of the 3rd century BC, Perga changed hands a number of times, being alternatively under the Seleucids and under the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]] to the north, ruled by the [[Attalid dynasty]]. Someone designated \u201cof Perga\u201d might well be expected to have lived and worked there. To the contrary, if Apollonius was later identified with Perga, it was not on the basis of his residence. The remaining autobiographical material implies that he lived, studied and wrote in Alexandria.\n\nA letter by the Greek mathematician and astronomer [[Hypsicles]] was originally part of the supplement taken from Euclid's Book XIV, part of the thirteen books of Euclid's Elements.<ref>{{cite web|title=The thirteen books of Euclid's Elements|author=Thomas Little Heath|url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenbookseu03heibgoog#page/n521/mode/2up/search/Antiphon|year=1908}}</ref>\n{{Quote|\"[[Basilides of Tyre]], O [[Protarchus]], when he came to Alexandria and met my father, spent the greater part of his sojourn with him on account of the bond between them due to their common interest in mathematics. And on one occasion, when looking into the tract written by Apollonius about the comparison of the [[dodecahedron]] and [[icosahedron]] inscribed in one and the same sphere, that is to say, on the question what ratio they bear to one another, they came to the conclusion that Apollonius' treatment of it in this book was not correct; accordingly, as I understood from my father, they proceeded to amend and rewrite it. But I myself afterwards came across another book published by Apollonius, containing a demonstration of the matter in question, and I was greatly attracted by his investigation of the problem. Now the book published by Apollonius is accessible to all; for it has a large circulation in a form which seems to have been the result of later careful elaboration.\"\n\n\"For my part, I determined to dedicate to you what I deem to be necessary by way of commentary, partly because you will be able, by reason of your proficiency in all mathematics and particularly in geometry, to pass an expert judgment upon what I am about to write, and partly because, on account of your intimacy with my father and your friendly feeling towards myself, you will lend a kindly ear to my disquisition. But it is time to have done with the preamble and to begin my treatise itself.\"}}\n\n===The times of Apollonius===\nApollonius lived toward the end of a historical period now termed the [[Hellenistic Period]], characterized by the superposition of Hellenic culture over extensive non-Hellenic regions to various depths, radical in some places, hardly at all in others. The change was initiated by [[Philip II of Macedon]] and his son, [[Alexander the Great]], who, subjecting all of Greece in a series of stunning victories, went on to conquer the [[Persian Empire]], which ruled territories from Egypt to Pakistan. Philip was assassinated in 336 BC. Alexander went on to fulfill his plan by conquering the vast Persian empire.\n\n===The short autobiography of Apollonius===\nThe material is located in the surviving false \u201cPrefaces\u201d of the books of his ''Conics.'' These are letters delivered to influential friends of Apollonius asking them to review the book enclosed with the letter. The Preface to Book I, addressed to one Eudemus, reminds him that ''Conics'' was initially requested by a house guest at Alexandria, the geometer, Naucrates, otherwise unknown to history. Naucrates had the first draft of all eight books in his hands by the end of the visit. Apollonius refers to them as being \u201cwithout a thorough purgation\u201d (''ou diakatharantes'' in Greek, ''ea non perpurgaremus'' in Latin). He intended to verify and emend the books, releasing each one as it was completed.\n\nHearing of this plan from Apollonius himself on a subsequent visit of the latter to Pergamon, Eudemus had insisted Apollonius send him each book before release. The circumstances imply that at this stage Apollonius was a young geometer seeking the company and advice of established professionals. Pappus states that he was with the students of [[Euclid]] at Alexandria. Euclid was long gone. This stay had been, perhaps, the final stage of Apollonius\u2019 education. Eudemus was perhaps a senior figure in his earlier education at Pergamon; in any case, there is reason to believe that he was or became the head of the Library and Research Center ([[Museum]]) of Pergamon. Apollonius goes on to state that the first four books were concerned with the development of elements while the last four were concerned with special topics.\n\nThere is something of a gap between Prefaces I and II. Apollonius has sent his son, also Apollonius, to deliver II. He speaks with more confidence, suggesting that Eudemus use the book in special study groups, which implies that Eudemus was a senior figure, if not the headmaster, in the research center. Research in such institutions, which followed the model of the [[Lycaeum]] of [[Aristotle]] at Athens, due to the residency of [[Alexander the Great]] and his companions in its northern branch, was part of the educational effort, to which the library and museum were adjunct. There was only one such school in the state. Owned by the king, it was under royal patronage, which was typically jealous, enthusiastic, and participatory. The kings bought, begged, borrowed and stole the precious books whenever and wherever they could. Books were of the highest value, affordable only to wealthy patrons. Collecting them was a royal obligation. Pergamon was known for its parchment industry, whence \u201c[[parchment]]\u201d is derived from \u201cPergamon.\u201d\n\nApollonius brings to mind [[Philonides of Laodicea]], a geometer whom he introduced to Eudemus in [[Ephesus]]. Philonides became Eudemus' student. He lived mainly in Syria during the 1st half of the 2nd century BC. Whether the meeting indicates that Apollonius now lived in Ephesus is unresolved. The intellectual community of the Mediterranean was international in culture. Scholars were mobile in seeking employment. They all communicated via some sort of postal service, public or private. Surviving letters are abundant. They visited each other, read each other's works, made suggestions to each other, recommended students and accumulated a tradition termed by some \u201cthe golden age of mathematics.\u201d\n\nPreface III is missing. During the interval Eudemus passed away, says Apollonius in IV, again supporting a view that Eudemus was senior over Apollonius. Prefaces IV\u2013VII are more formal, omitting personal information and concentrating on summarizing the books. They are all addressed to a mysterious Attalus, a choice made \u201cbecause\u201d, as Apollonius writes to Attalus, \u201cof your earnest desire to possess my works.\u201d By that time a good many people at Pergamum had such a desire. Presumably, this Attalus was someone special, receiving copies of Apollonius\u2019 masterpiece fresh from the author's hand. One strong theory is that Attalus is [[Attalus II Philadelphus]], 220-138 BC, general and defender of his brother's kingdom ([[Eumenes II]]), co-regent on the latter's illness in 160 BC, and heir to his throne and his widow in 158 BC. He and his brother were great patrons of the arts, expanding the library into international magnificence. The dates are consonant with those of Philonides, while Apollonius\u2019 motive is consonant with Attalus' book-collecting initiative.\n\nApollonius sent to Attalus Prefaces V\u2013VII. In Preface VII he describes Book VIII as \u201can appendix\u201d ... \u201cwhich I will take care to send you as speedily as possible.\u201d There is no record that it was ever sent or ever completed. It may be missing from history because it was never in history, Apollonius having died before its completion. [[Pappus of Alexandria]], however, provided lemmas for it, so at the very least some edition of it must once have been in circulation.\n\n== Documented works of Apollonius ==\nApollonius was a prolific geometer, turning out a large number of works. Only one survives, ''Conics''. It is a dense and extensive reference work on the topic, even by today's standards, serving as a repository of now little known geometric propositions as well as a vehicle for some new ones devised by Apollonius. Its audience was not the general population, which could not read or write. It was always intended for savants of mathematics and their small number of educated readers associated with the state schools and their associated libraries. It always was, in other words, a library reference work.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Its basic definitions have become an important mathematical heritage. For the most part its methods and conclusions have been superseded by Analytic Geometry.\n\nOf its eight books, only the first four have a credible claim to descent from the original texts of Apollonius. Books 5-7 have been translated from the Arabic into Latin. The original Greek has been lost. The status of Book VIII is unknown. A first draft existed. Whether the final draft was ever produced is not known. A \"reconstruction\" of it by Edmond Halley exists in Latin. There is no way to know how much of it, if any, is verisimilar to Apollonius. Halley also reconstructed ''De Rationis Sectione'' and ''De Spatii Sectione''. Beyond these works, except for a handful of fragments, documentation that might in any way be interpreted as descending from Apollonius ends.\n\nMany of the lost works are described or mentioned by commentators. In addition are ideas attributed to Apollonius by other authors without documentation. Credible or not, they are hearsay. Some authors identify Apollonius as the author of certain ideas, consequently named after him. Others attempt to express Apollonius in modern notation or phraseology with indeterminate degrees of fidelity.\n\n=== ''Conics'' ===\nThe Greek text of ''Conics'' uses the Euclidean arrangement of definitions, figures and their parts; i.e., the \u201cgivens,\u201d followed by propositions \u201cto be proved.\u201d Books I-VII present 387 propositions. This type of arrangement can be seen in any modern geometry textbook of the traditional subject matter. As in any course of mathematics, the material is very dense and consideration of it, necessarily slow.  Apollonius had a plan for each book, which is partly described in the ''Prefaces''. The headings, or pointers to the plan, are somewhat in deficit, Apollonius having depended more on the logical flow of the topics.\n\nAn intellectual niche is thus created for the commentators of the ages. Each must present Apollonius in the most lucid and relevant way for his own times. They use a variety of methods: annotation, extensive prefatory material, different formats, additional drawings, superficial reorganization by the addition of capita, and so on. There are subtle variations in interpretation. The modern English speaker encounters a lack of material in English due to the preference for New Latin by English scholars. Such intellectual English giants as Edmund Halley and Isaac Newton, the proper descendants of the Hellenistic tradition of mathematics and astronomy,  can only be read and interpreted in translation by populations of English speakers unacquainted with the classical languages; that is, most of them.\n\nPresentations written entirely in native English begin in the late 19th century. Of special note is Heath's ''Treatise on Conic Sections''. His extensive prefatory commentary includes such items as a lexicon of Apollonian geometric terms giving the Greek, the meanings, and usage.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|pp=clvii-clxx}}</ref> Commenting that \u201cthe apparently portentious bulk of the treatise has deterred many from attempting to make its acquaintance,\u201d<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga||Heath|1896|p=vii}}</ref> he promises to add headings, changing the organization superficially, and to clarify the text with modern notation. His work thus references two systems of organization, his own and Apollonius\u2019, to which concordances are given in parentheses.\n\nHeath's work is indispensable. He taught throughout the early 20th century, passing away in 1940, but meanwhile another point of view was developing. [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)]], which had been a military school since colonial times, preceding the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], to which it is adjacent, in 1936 lost its accreditation and was on the brink of bankruptcy. In desperation the board summoned [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] from the [[University of Chicago]], where they had been developing a new theoretical program for instruction of the Classics. Leaping at the opportunity, in 1937 they instituted the \u201cnew program\u201d at St. John's, later dubbed the [[Great Books]] program, a fixed curriculum that would teach the works of select key contributors to the culture of western civilization. At St. John's, Apollonius came to be taught as himself, not as some adjunct to [[analytic geometry]].\n\nThe \u201ctutor\u201d of Apollonius was [[R. Catesby Taliaferro]], a new PhD in 1937 from the [[University of Virginia]]. He tutored until 1942 and then later for one year in 1948, supplying the English translations by himself, translating Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' and Apollonius\u2019 ''Conics''. These translations became part of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's [[Great Books of the Western World]] series. Only Books I-III are included, with an appendix for special topics. Unlike Heath, Taliaferro did not attempt to reorganize Apollonius, even superficially, or to rewrite him. His translation into modern English follows the Greek fairly closely. He does use modern geometric notation to some degree.\n\nContemporaneously with Taliaferro's work, [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas|Ivor Thomas]] an Oxford don of the World War II era, was taking an intense interest in Greek mathematics. He planned a compendium of selections, which came to fruition during his military service as an officer in the [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]]. After the war it found a home in the [[Loeb Classical Library]], where it occupies two volumes, all translated by Thomas, with the Greek on one side of the page and the English on the other, as is customary for the Loeb series. Thomas' work has served as a handbook for the golden age of Greek mathematics. For Apollonius he only includes mainly those portions of Book I that define the sections.\n\nHeath, Taliaferro, and Thomas satisfied the public demand for Apollonius in translation for most of the 20th century. The subject moves on. More recent translations and studies incorporate new information and points of view as well as examine the old.\n\n====Book I====\nBook I presents 58 propositions. Its most salient content is all the basic definitions concerning cones and conic sections. These definitions are not exactly the same as the modern ones of the same words. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] the modern words derive from the ancient, but the etymon often differs in meaning from its [[Linguistic reconstruction|reflex]].\n\nA [[conical surface]] is generated by a [[line segment]] rotated about a [[bisection|bisector]] point such that the end points trace [[circle]]s, each in its own [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]. A [[cone]], one branch of the double conical surface, is the surface with the point ([[Apex (geometry)|apex]] or [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]), the circle ([[Base (geometry)|base]]), and the axis, a line joining vertex and center of base.\n\nA \u201c[[Cross section (geometry)|section]]\u201d (Latin sectio, Greek tome) is an imaginary \u201ccutting\u201d  of a cone by a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].\n* Proposition I.3: \u201cIf a cone is cut by a plane through the vertex, the section is a triangle.\u201d In the case of a double cone, the section is two triangles such that the angles at the vertex are [[angle|vertical angles]].\n* Proposition I.4 asserts that sections of a cone parallel to the base are circles with centers on the axis.<ref>Note that the Greek geometers were not defining the circle, the ellipse, and other figures as conic sections. This would be circular definition, as the cone was defined in terms of a circle. Each figure has its own geometric definition, and in addition, is being shown to be a conic section.</ref>\n* Proposition I.13 defines the ellipse, which is conceived as the cutting of a single cone by a plane inclined to the plane of the base and intersecting the latter in a line perpendicular to the diameter extended of the base outside the cone (not shown). The angle of the inclined plane must be greater than zero, or the section would be a circle. It must be less than the corresponding base angle of the axial triangle, at which the figure becomes a parabola. \n* Proposition I.11 defines a parabola. Its plane is parallel to a side in the conic surface of the axial triangle. \n* Proposition I.12 defines a hyperbola. Its plane is parallel to the axis. It cut both cones of the pair, thus acquiring two distinct branches (only one is shown).\n\nThe Greek geometers were interested in laying out select figures from their inventory in various applications of engineering and architecture, as the great inventors, such as Archimedes, were accustomed to doing. A demand for conic sections existed then and exists now. The development of mathematical characterization had moved geometry in the direction of [[Greek geometric algebra]], which visually features such algebraic fundamentals as assigning values to line segments as variables. They used a coordinate system intermediate between a grid of measurements and the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. The theories of proportion and application of areas allowed the development of visual equations. (See below under Methods of Apollonius).\n\n[[File:Parabola connection with areas of a square and a rectangle.gif|thumb|250px|The animated figure depicts the method of \"application of areas\" to express the mathematical relationship that characterizes a parabola. The upper left corner of the changing rectangle on the left side and the upper right corner on the right side is \"any point on the section.\" The animation has it following the section. The orange square at the top is \"the square on the distance from the point to the diameter; i.e., a square of the ordinate. In Apollonius, the orientation is horizontal rather than the vertical shown here. Here it is the square of the abscissa. Regardless of orientation, the equation is the same, names changed. The blue rectangle on the outside is the rectangle on the other coordinate and the distance p. In algebra, x<sup>2</sup> = py, one form of the equation for a parabola. If the outer rectangle exceeds py in area, the section must be a hyperbola; if it is less, an ellipse.]]\nThe \u201capplication of areas\u201d implicitly asks, given an area and a line segment, does this area apply; that is, is it equal to, the square on the segment? If yes, an applicability (parabole) has been established. Apollonius followed Euclid in asking if a rectangle on the [[abscissa]] of any point on the section applies to the square of the [[ordinate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=c}}</ref> If it does, his word-equation is the equivalent of <math display=\"inline\">y^2 {{=}} kx</math> which is one modern form of the equation for a [[parabola]]. The rectangle has sides <math>k</math> and <math>x</math>. It was he who accordingly named the figure, parabola, \u201capplication.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cno applicability\u201d case is further divided into two possibilities. Given a function, <math display=\"inline\">f(x)</math>, such that, in the applicability case, <math display=\"inline\">y^2 {{=}} g(x)</math>, in the no applicability case, either <math display=\"inline\">y^2 > g(x)</math> or <math display=\"inline\">y^2 < g(x)</math>. In the former, <math display=\"inline\">g(x)</math> falls short of <math display=\"inline\">y^2</math> by a quantity termed the ellipsis, \u201ddeficit.\u201d  In the latter, <math display=\"inline\">g(x)</math> overshoots by a quantity termed the hyperbole, \"surfeit.\"\n\nApplicability could be achieved by adding the deficit, <math display=\"inline\">y^2 {{=}} f(x) {{=}} g(x) + d</math>, or subtracting the surfeit, <math display=\"inline\">g(x) - s</math>. The figure compensating for a deficit was named an ellipse; for a surfeit, a hyperbola.<ref>Note that a circle, being another case of the deficit, is sometimes considered a kind of ellipse with a single center instead of two foci.</ref> The terms of the modern equation depend on the translation and rotation of the figure from the origin, but the general equation for an ellipse,\n\n:{{math|Ax<sup>2</sup> + By<sup>2</sup> {{=}} C}}\n\ncan be placed in the form\n\n<math>y^2 {{=}} \\left | \\frac{{A}}{{B}}x^2\\right | + \\frac{{C}}{{B}}</math>\n\nwhere C/B is the d, while an equation for the hyperbola,\n\n:{{math|Ax<sup>2</sup> - By<sup>2</sup> {{=}} C}}\n\nbecomes\n\n<math>y^2 {{=}} \\left | \\frac{{A}}{{B}}x^2\\right | - \\frac{{C}}{{B}}</math>\n\nwhere C/B is the s.<ref>Note that y<sup>2</sup> = g(x) is not the equation for a parabola, which is y<sup>2</sup> = kx, the x being a lower power.</ref>\n\n====Book II====\nBook II contains 53 propositions. Apollonius says that he intended to cover \"the properties having to do with the diameters and axes and also the [[asymptotes]] and other things ... for limits of possibility.\" His definition of \"diameter\" is different from the traditional, as he finds it necessary to refer the intended recipient of the letter to his work for a definition. The elements mentioned are those that specify the shape and generation of the figures. [[Tangents]] are covered at the end of the book.\n\n====Book III====\nBook III contains 56 propositions. Apollonius claims original discovery for theorems \"of use for the construction of solid loci ... the three-line and four-line [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] ....\" The locus of a conic section is the section. The three-line locus problem (as stated by Taliafero's appendix to Book III) finds \"the locus of points whose distances from three given fixed straight lines ... are such that the square of one of the distances is always in a constant ratio to the rectangle contained by the other two distances.\" This is the proof of the application of areas resulting in the parabola.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}} The four-line problem results in the ellipse and hyperbola. Analytic geometry derives the same loci from simpler criteria supported by algebra, rather than geometry, for which Descartes was highly praised. He supersedes Apollonius in his methods.\n\n====Book IV====\nBook IV contains 57 propositions. The first sent to Attalus, rather than to Eudemus, it thus represents his more mature geometric thought. The topic is rather specialized: \"the greatest number of points at which sections of a cone can meet one another, or meet a circumference of a circle, ....\" Nevertheless, he speaks with enthusiasm, labeling them \"of considerable use\" in solving problems (Preface 4).<ref>Many of the commentators and translators, as well, no doubt, as copyists, have been explicitly less than enthusiastic about their use, especially after analytic geometry, which can do most of the problems by algebra without any stock of constructions. Taliaferro stops at Book III. Heath attempts a digest of the book to make it more palatable to the reader ({{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|loc=Intersecting Conics}}) Fried is more true to Apollonius, supplying an extensive critical apparatus instead ({{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Fried|2002|loc=Footnotes}}).</ref>\n\n====Book V====\nBook V, known only through translation from the Arabic, contains 77 propositions, the most of any book.<ref>{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=146}}</ref> They cover the ellipse (50 propositions), the parabola (22), and the hyperbola (28).<ref>{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=188}}</ref> These are not explicitly the topic, which in Prefaces I and V Apollonius states to be maximum and minimum lines. These terms are not explained. In contrast to Book I, Book V contains no definitions and no explanation.\n\nThe ambiguity has served as a magnet to exegetes of Apollonius, who must interpret without sure knowledge of the meaning of the book's major terms. Until recently Heath's view prevailed: the lines are to be treated as normals to the sections.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Pergas|Heath|1896|loc=Normals as Maxima and Minima}}</ref> A [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] in this case is the [[perpendicular]] to a curve at a [[tangent point]] sometimes called the foot. If a section is plotted according to Apollonius\u2019 coordinate system (see below under Methods of Apollonius), with the diameter (translated by Heath as the axis) on the x-axis and the vertex at the origin on the left, the phraseology of the propositions indicates that the minima/maxima are to be found between the section and the axis. Heath is led into his view by consideration of a fixed point p on the section serving both as tangent point and as one end of the line. The minimum distance between p and some point g on the axis must then be the normal from p.\n\nIn modern mathematics, normals to curves are known for being the location of the [[center of curvature]] of that small part of the curve located around the foot. The distance from the foot to the center is the [[radius of curvature]]. The latter is the [[radius]] of a circle, but for other than circular curves, the small [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] can be approximated by a circular arc. The curvature of non-circular curves; e.g., the conic sections, must change over the section. A map of the center of curvature; i.e., its locus, as the foot moves over the section, is termed the [[evolute]] of the section. Such a figure, the edge of the successive positions of a line, is termed an [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] today. Heath believed that in Book V we are seeing Apollonius establish the logical foundation of a theory of normals, evolutes, and envelopes.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|loc=Propositions Leading Immediately to the Determination of the Evolute}}</ref>\n\nHeath's was accepted as the authoritative interpretation of Book V for the entire 20th century, but the changing of the century brought with it a change of view. In 2001, Apollonius scholars Fried & Unguru, granting all due respect to other Heath chapters, balked at the historicity of Heath's analysis of Book V, asserting that he \u201creworks the original to make it more congenial to a modern mathematician ... this is the kind of thing that makes Heath\u2019s work of dubious value for the historian, revealing more of Heath\u2019s mind than that of Apollonius.\u201d<ref name=fried148>{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=148}}</ref> Some of his arguments are in summary as follows. There is no mention of maxima/minima being per se normals in either the prefaces or the books proper.<ref>Normalis is a perfectly good Latin word meaning \"measured with a norma,\" or square. Halley uses it to translate Pappus' eutheia, \"right-placed,\" which has a more general sense of directionally right. For \"the perpendicular to,\" the mathematical Greeks used \"the normal of,\" where the object of \"of\" could be any figure, usually a straight line. What Fried is saying is that there was no standard use of normal to mean normal of a curve, nor did Apollonius introduce one, although in several isolated cases he did describe one.</ref> Out of Heath's selection of 50 propositions said to cover normals, only 7, Book V: 27-33, state or imply maximum/minimum lines being perpendicular to the tangents. These 7 Fried classifies as isolated, unrelated to the main propositions of the book. They do not in any way imply that maxima/minima in general are normals. In his extensive investigation of the other 43 propositions, Fried proves that many cannot be.<ref>Fried & Unguru dedicate an entire chapter to these criticisms:{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|loc=Maximum and Minimum Lines: Book V of the Conica}}</ref>\n\nFried and Unguru counter by portraying Apollonius as a continuation of the past rather than a foreshadowing of the future. First is a complete philological study of all references to minimum and maximum lines, which uncovers a standard phraseology. There are three groups of 20-25 propositions each.<ref>A summary table is given in {{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=190}}</ref> The first group contains the phrase \u201cfrom a point on the axis to the section,\u201d which is exactly the opposite of a hypothetical \u201cfrom a point on the section to the axis.\u201d The former does not have to be normal to anything, although it might be. Given a fixed point on the axis, of all the lines connecting it to all the points of the section, one will be longest (maximum) and one shortest (minimum). Other phrases are \u201cin a section,\u201d \u201cdrawn from a section,\u201d \u201ccut off between the section and its axis,\u201d cut off by the axis,\u201d all referring to the same image.\n\nIn the view of Fried and Unguru, the topic of Book V is exactly what Apollonius says it is, maximum and minimum lines. These are not code words for future concepts, but refer to ancient concepts then in use. The authors cite Euclid, Elements, Book III, which concerns itself with circles, and maximum and minimum distances from interior points to the circumference.<ref>{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=182}}</ref> Without admitting to any specific generality they use terms such as \u201clike\u201d or \u201cthe analog of.\u201d They are known for innovating the term \u201cneusis-like.\u201d A [[neusis construction]] was a method of fitting a given segment between two given curves. Given a point P, and a ruler with the segment marked off on it. one rotates the ruler around P cutting the two curves until the segment is fitted between them. In Book V, P is the point on the axis. Rotating a ruler around it, one discovers the distances to the section, from which the minimum and maximum can be discerned. The technique is not applied to the situation, so it is not neusis. The authors use neusis-like, seeing an archetypal similarity to  the ancient method.<ref name=fried148/>\n\n====Book VI====\nBook VI, known only through translation from the Arabic, contains 33 propositions, the least of any book. It also has large [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]], or gaps in the text, due to damage or corruption in the previous texts.\n\nThe topic is relatively clear and uncontroversial. Preface 1 states that it is \u201cequal and similar sections of cones.\u201d Apollonius extends the concepts of congruence and similarity presented by Euclid for more elementary figures, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, to conic sections. Preface 6 mentions \u201csections and segments\u201d that are \u201cequal and unequal\u201d as well as \u201csimilar and dissimilar,\u201d and adds some constructional information.\n\nBook VI features a return to the basic definitions at the front of the book. \u201c[[Extensionality|Equality]]\u201d is determined by an application of areas. If one figure; that is, a section or a segment, is \u201capplied\u201d to another (Halley's ''si applicari possit altera super alteram''), they are \u201cequal\u201d (Halley's ''aequales'') if they coincide and no line of one crosses any line of the other. This is obviously a standard of [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] following Euclid, Book I, Common Notions, 4: \u201cand things coinciding (''epharmazanta'') with one another are equal (''isa'').\u201d Coincidence and equality overlap, but they are not the same: the application of areas used to define the sections depends on quantitative equality of areas but they can belong to different figures.\n\nBetween instances that are the [[Identity (philosophy)|same]] (homos), being equal to each other, and those that are [[Difference (philosophy)|different]], or [[Inequality (mathematics)|unequal]], are figures that are \u201csame-ish\u201d (hom-oios), or [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]]. They are neither entirely the same nor different, but share aspects that are the same and do not share aspects that are different. Intuitively the geometricians had [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] in mind; e.g., a map is similar to a topographic region. Thus figures could have larger or smaller versions of themselves.\n\nThe aspects that are the same in similar figures depend on the figure. Book 6 of Euclid's Elements presents similar triangles as those that have the same corresponding angles. A triangle can thus have miniatures as small as you please, or giant versions, and still be \u201cthe same\u201d triangle as the original.\n\nIn Apollonius' definitions at the beginning of Book VI, similar right cones have similar axial triangles. Similar sections and segments of sections are first of all in similar cones. In addition, for every abscissa of one must exist an abscissa in the other at the desired scale. Finally, abscissa and ordinate of one must be matched by coordinates of the same ratio of ordinate to abscissa as the other. The total effect is as though the section or segment were moved up and down the cone to achieve a different scale.<ref>A mathematical explanation as well as precis of each proposition in the book can be found in {{harvnb|Toomer|1990|pp=lxi-lxix}} Note that translations of the definitions vary widely as each English author attempts to paraphrase the complexities in clear and succinct English. In essence, no such English is available.</ref>\n\n==== Book VII ====\nBook VII, also a translation from the Arabic, contains 51 Propositions. These are the last that Heath considers in his 1896 edition. In Preface I, Apollonius does not mention them, implying that, at the time of the first draft, they may not have existed in sufficiently coherent form to describe. Apollonius uses obscure language, that they are \u201cperi dioristikon theorematon\u201d, which Halley translated as \u201cde theorematis ad determinationem pertinentibus,\u201d and Heath as \u201ctheorems involving determinations of limits.\u201d This is the language of definition, but no definitions are forthcoming. Whether the reference might be to a specific kind of definition is a consideration but to date nothing credible has been proposed.<ref>A summary of the question can be found at {{harvnb|Heath|1896|p=lxx}}. Most writers have something to say about it; for example, {{cite book | first=GJ | last=Toomer | year=1990 | title=Apollonius Conics Book V to VII: the Arabic Translation of the Lost Greek Original in the Version of the Banu Musa | volume=I | series=Sources in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences 9 | location=New York | publisher=Springer | pages=lxix-lxx | quote=we may regard the establishment of limits of solution as its main purpose}} Toomer\u2019s view is given without specifics or reference to any text of Book VII except the Preface.</ref> The topic of Book VII, completed toward the end of Apollonius\u2019 life and career, is stated in Preface VII to be [[diameter]]s and \u201cthe figures described upon them,\u201d which must include [[conjugate diameters]], as he relies heavily on them. In what way the term \u201climits\u201d or \u201cdeterminations\u201d might apply is not mentioned.\n\nDiameters and their conjugates are defined in Book I (Definitions 4-6). Not every diameter has a conjugate. The topography of a diameter (Greek diametros) requires a regular [[curve]]d [[shape|figure]]. Irregularly-shaped areas, addressed in modern times, are not in the ancient game plan. Apollonius has in mind, of course, the conic sections, which he describes in often convolute language: \u201ca curve in the same plane\u201d is a circle, ellipse or parabola, while \u201ctwo curves in the same plane\u201d is a hyperbola. A [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is a straight line whose two end points are on the figure; i.e., it cuts the figure in two places. If a grid of parallel chords is imposed on the figure, then the diameter is defined as the line bisecting all the chords, reaching the curve itself at a point called the vertex. There is no requirement for a closed figure; e.g., a parabola has a diameter.\n\nA parabola has [[Symmetry (geometry)|symmetry]] in one dimension. If you imagine it folded on its one diameter, the two halves are congruent, or fit over each other. The same may be said of one branch of a hyperbola. Conjugate diameters (Greek suzugeis diametroi, where suzugeis is \u201cyoked together\u201d), however, are symmetric in two dimensions. The figures to which they apply require also an areal center (Greek kentron), today called a [[centroid]], serving as a center of symmetry in two directions. These figures are the circle, ellipse, and two-branched hyperbola. There is only one centroid, which must not be confused with the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]]. A diameter is a chord passing through the centroid, which always bisects it.\n\nFor the circle and ellipse, let a grid of parallel chords be superimposed over the figure such that the longest is a diameter and the others are successively shorter until the last is not a chord, but is a tangent point. The tangent must be parallel to the diameter. A conjugate diameter bisects the chords, being placed between the centroid and the tangent point. Moreover, both diameters are conjugate to each other, being called a conjugate pair. It is obvious that any conjugate pair of a circle are perpendicular to each other, but in an ellipse, only the major and minor axes are, the elongation destroying the perpendicularity in all other cases.\n\nConjugates are defined for the two branches of a [[hyperbola]] resulting from the cutting of a double cone by a single plane. They are called conjugate branches. They have the same diameter. Its centroid bisects the segment between vertices. There is room for one more diameter-like line: let a grid of lines parallel to the diameter cut both branches of the hyperbola. These lines are chord-like except that they do not terminate on the same continuous curve. A conjugate diameter can be drawn from the centroid to bisect the chord-like lines.\n\nThese concepts mainly from Book I get us started on the 51 propositions of Book VII defining in detail the relationships between sections, diameters, and conjugate diameters. As with some of Apollonius other specialized topics, their utility today compared to Analytic Geometry remains to be seen, although he affirms in Preface VII that they are both useful and innovative; i.e., he takes the credit for them.\n\n=== Lost and reconstructed works described by Pappus ===\nPappus mentions other treatises of Apollonius:\n# \u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae, ''De Rationis Sectione'' (\"Cutting of a Ratio\")\n# \u03a7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae, ''De Spatii Sectione'' (\"Cutting of an Area\")\n# \u0394\u03b9\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae, ''De Sectione Determinata'' (\"Determinate Section\")\n# \u1f18\u03c0\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af, ''De Tactionibus'' (\"Tangencies\")<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mackenzie|first=Dana|date=|title=A Tisket, a Tasket, an Apollonian Gasket|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/a-tisket-a-tasket-an-apollonian-gasket/|journal=American Scientist|volume=98, January\u2013February 2010|issue=1|pages=10\u201314|via=}}</ref>\n# \u039d\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, ''De Inclinationibus'' (\"Inclinations\")\n# \u03a4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03b9, ''De Locis Planis'' (\"Plane Loci\").\nEach of these was divided into two books, and\u2014with the ''Data'', the ''Porisms'', and ''Surface-Loci'' of Euclid and the ''Conics'' of Apollonius\u2014were, according to Pappus, included in the body of the ancient analysis.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}} Descriptions follow of the six works mentioned above.\n\n==== ''De Rationis Sectione'' ====\n''De Rationis Sectione'' sought to resolve a simple problem: Given two straight lines and a point in each, draw through a third given point a straight line cutting the two fixed lines such that the parts intercepted between the given points in them and the points of intersection with this third line may have a given ratio.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}\n\n==== ''De Spatii Sectione'' ====\n''De Spatii Sectione'' discussed a similar problem requiring the rectangle contained by the two intercepts to be equal to a given rectangle.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}\n\nIn the late 17th century, [[Edward Bernard]] discovered a version of ''De Rationis Sectione'' in the [[Bodleian Library]].

The most difficult and historically interesting case arises when the three given things are circles. In the 16th century, [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te|Vieta]] presented this problem (sometimes known as the Apollonian Problem) to [[Adrianus Romanus]], who solved it with a [[hyperbola]]. Vieta thereupon proposed a simpler solution, eventually leading him to restore the whole of Apollonius's treatise in the small work ''Apollonius Gallus'' (Paris, 1600). The history of the problem is explored in fascinating detail in the preface to [[J. W. Camerer]]'s brief ''Apollonii Pergaei quae supersunt, ac maxime Lemmata Pappi in hos Libras, cum Observationibus, &c'' (Gothae, 1795, 8vo).{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}\n\n==== ''De Inclinationibus'' ====\nThe object of ''De Inclinationibus'' was to demonstrate how a straight line of a given length, tending towards a given point, could be inserted between two given (straight or circular) lines.

The Greek and Latin were typically juxtaposed, but only the Greek is original, or else was restored by the editor to what he thought was original. Critical apparatuses were in Latin. The ancient commentaries, however, were in ancient or medieval Greek. Only in the 18th and 19th centuries did modern languages begin to appear.

''De Sectione Rationis'' comes from an unpublished manuscript in Arabic in the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford originally partially translated by [[Edward Bernard]] but interrupted by his death. It was given to [[Edmond Halley]], professor, astronomer, mathematician and explorer, after whom [[Halley's Comet]] later was named. Unable to decipher the corrupted text, he abandoned it. Subsequently, [[David Gregory (mathematician)]] restored the Arabic for [[Henry Aldrich]], who gave it again to Halley. Learning Arabic, Halley created ''De Sectione Rationis'' and as an added emolument for the reader created a Neo-Latin translation of a version of ''De Sectione Spatii'' reconstructed from Pappus Commentary on it. The two Neo-Latin works and Pappus' ancient Greek commentary were bound together in the single volume of 1706. The author of the Arabic manuscript is not known. Based on a statement that it was written under the \"auspices\" of [[Al-Ma'mun]], Latin Almamon, astronomer and Caliph of Baghdad in 825, Halley dates it to 820 in his \"Praefatio ad Lectorem.\"\n# {{cite book | author1=Apollonius | author2=Alexandrinus Pappus | author3=Halley, Edmond | author4=Eutocius | author5=Serenus | authorlink2=Pappus of Alexandria | authorlink3=Edmond Halley | authorlink4=Eutocius of Ascalon | authorlink5=Serenus of Antinouplis | year=1710 | title=Apollonii Pergaei Conicorum libri octo, et Sereni Antissensis De sectione cylindri & coni libri duo | location=Oxoniae | publisher=e Theatro Sheldoniano | url=http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/apollonius/Apollonii_Pergaei_Conicorum_libri_octo.pdf | language=la, grc}} Encouraged by the success of his translation of David Gregory's emended Arabic text of ''de Sectione rationis'', published in 1706, Halley went on to restore and translate into Latin Apollonius\u2019 entire ''elementa conica''.<ref>He said in his ''Praefatio'' of 1710, that although Apollonius was second only (in his opinion) to [[Archimedes]], a large part of his ''elementa conica'' was \u201ctruncated\u201d and the remaining part \u201cless faithful;\u201d consequently he was now going to emend it. The question of exactly what items are to be regarded as \u201cfaithful\u201d pervades today's literature.</ref> Books I-IV had never been lost. They appear with the Greek in one column and Halley's Latin in a parallel column. Books V-VI came from a windfall discovery of a previously unappreciated translation from Greek to Arabic that had been purchased by the antiquarian scholar [[Jacobus Golius]] in [[Aleppo]] in 1626. On his death in 1696 it passed by a chain of purchases and bequests to the Bodleian Library (originally as MS Marsh 607, dated 1070).<ref>For a more precise version of the chain see {{cite web | first=Colin | last=Wakefield | title=Arabic Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library | url=http://www.islamicmanuscripts.info/reference/books/Russell-1994-Arabick/Russell-1994-Arabick-128-146-Wakefield.pdf | pages=136\u2013137}}</ref> The translation, dated much earlier, comes from the branch of Almamon's school entitled the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]], \u201csons of Musa,\u201d a group of three brothers, who lived in the 9th century. The translation was performed by writers working for them.<ref name=friedintro/> In Halley's work, only the Latin translation of Books V-VII is given. This is its first printed publication. Book VIII was lost before the scholars of Almamon could take a hand at preserving it. Halley's concoction, based on expectations developed in Book VII, and the lemmas of Pappus, is given in Latin. The commentary of Eutocius, the lemmas of Pappus, and two related treatises by Serenus are included as a guide to the interpretation of the ''Conics''.\n\n== Ideas attributed to Apollonius by other writers ==\n\n=== Apollonius' contribution to astronomy ===\nThe equivalence of two descriptions of planet motions, one using excentrics and another [[deferent and epicycle]]s, is attributed to him. Ptolemy describes this equivalence as [[Apollonius' theorem]] in the ''[[Almagest]]'' XII.1.\n\n=== Methods of Apollonius ===\nAccording to Heath,<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=ci}}</ref> \u201cThe Methods of Apollonius\u201d were not his and were not personal. Whatever influence he had on later theorists was that of geometry, not of his own innovation of technique. Heath says, \n<blockquote>\u201cAs a preliminary to the consideration in detail of the methods employed in the Conics, it may be stated generally that they follow steadily the accepted principles of geometrical investigation which found their definitive expression in the Elements of Euclid.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nWith regard to moderns speaking of golden age geometers, the term \"method\" means specifically the visual, reconstructive way in which the geometer unknowingly produces the same result as an algebraic method used today. As a simple example, algebra finds the area of a square by squaring its side. The geometric method of accomplishing the same result is to construct a visual square. Geometric methods in the golden age could produce most of the results of elementary algebra.\n\n====Geometrical algebra====\n[[File:\u041f\u0438\u0444\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043d\u044b.png|thumb|200px|left|Visual form of the Pythagorean theorem as the ancient Greeks saw it. The blue square is the sum of the other two squares.]]\nHeath goes on to use the term [[Greek geometric algebra|geometrical algebra]] for the methods of the entire golden age. The term is \u201cnot inappropriately\u201d called that, he says. Today the term has been resurrected for use in other senses (see under [[geometric algebra]]). Heath was using it as it had been defined by [[Henry Burchard Fine]] in 1890 or before.<ref>{{cite book | last=Fine | first=Henry B | authorlink=Henry Burchard Fine | year=1902 | title=The number-system of algebra treated theoretically and historically | location=Boston | publisher=Leach | pages=119\u2013120}}</ref> Fine applies it to [[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]] of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], the first full-blown work of [[analytic geometry]]. Establishing as a precondition that \u201ctwo algebras are formally identical whose fundamental operations are formally the same,\u201d Fine says that Descartes\u2019 work \u201cis not ... mere numerical algebra, but what may for want of a better name be called the algebra of line segments. Its symbolism is the same as that of numerical algebra; ....\u201d\n\nFor example, in Apollonius a line segment AB (the line between Point A and Point B) is also the numerical length of the segment. It can have any length. AB therefore becomes the same as an [[Variable (mathematics)|algebraic variable]], such as ''x'' (the unknown), to which any value might be assigned; e.g., ''x''=3.\n\nVariables are defined in Apollonius by such word statements as \u201clet AB be the distance from any point on the section to the diameter,\u201d a practice that continues in algebra today. Every student of basic algebra must learn to convert \u201cword problems\u201d to algebraic variables and equations, to which the rules of algebra apply in solving for ''x''. Apollonius had no such rules. His solutions are geometric.\n\nRelationships not readily amenable to pictorial solutions were beyond his grasp; however, his repertory of pictorial solutions came from a pool of complex geometric solutions generally not known (or required) today. One well-known exception is the indispensable [[Pythagorean Theorem]], even now represented by a right triangle with squares on its sides illustrating an expression such as a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>. The Greek geometers called those terms \u201cthe square on AB,\u201d etc. Similarly, the area of a rectangle formed by AB and CD was \"the rectangle on AB and CD.\"\n\nThese concepts gave the Greek geometers algebraic access to [[Linear equation|linear functions]] and [[quadratic functions]], which latter the conic sections are. They contain [[Exponentiation|powers]] of 1 or 2 respectively. Apollonius had not much use for cubes (featured in [[solid geometry]]), even though a cone is a solid. His interest was in conic sections, which are plane figures. Powers of 4 and up were beyond visualization, requiring a degree of abstraction not available in geometry, but ready at hand in algebra.\n\n====The coordinate system of Apollonius====\n[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system Oxy P.svg|thumb|200px|Cartesian coordinate system, standard in analytic geometry]]\nAll ordinary measurement of length in public units, such as inches, using standard public devices, such as a ruler, implies public recognition of a [[Regular grid|Cartesian grid]]; that is, a surface divided into unit squares, such as one square inch, and a space divided into unit cubes, such as one cubic inch. The [[ancient Greek units of measurement]] had provided such a grid to Greek mathematicians since the Bronze Age. \nPrior to Apollonius, [[Menaechmus]] and [[Archimedes]] had already started locating their figures on an implied window of the common grid by referring to distances conceived to be measured from a left-hand vertical line marking a low measure and a bottom horizontal line marking a low measure, the directions being rectilinear, or perpendicular to one another.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=cxv}}</ref> These edges of the window become, in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the axes. One specifies the rectilinear distances of any point from the axes as the [[coordinates]]. The ancient Greeks did not have that convention. They simply referred to distances.\n\nApollonius does have a standard window in which he places his figures. Vertical measurement is from a horizontal line he calls the \u201cdiameter.\u201d  The word is the same in Greek as it is in English, but the Greek is somewhat wider in its comprehension.<ref>Apollonius, ''Conics'', Book I, Definition 4. Refer also to {{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=clxi}}</ref>  If the figure of the conic section is cut by a grid of parallel lines, the diameter bisects all the line segments included between the branches of the figure. It must pass through the vertex (koruphe, \"crown\"). A diameter thus comprises open figures such as a parabola as well as closed, such as a circle. There is no specification that the diameter must be perpendicular to the parallel lines, but Apollonius uses only rectilinear ones.\n\nThe rectilinear distance from a point on the section to the diameter is termed tetagmenos in Greek, etymologically simply \u201cextended.\u201d  As it is only ever extended \u201cdown\u201d (kata-) or \u201cup\u201d (ana-), the translators interpret it as [[ordinate]]. In that case the diameter becomes the x-axis and the vertex the origin. The y-axis then becomes a tangent to the curve at the vertex. The [[abscissa]] is then defined as the segment of the diameter between the ordinate and the vertex.\n\nUsing his version of a coordinate system, Apollonius manages to develop in pictorial form the geometric equivalents of the equations for the conic sections, which raises the question of whether his coordinate system can be considered Cartesian. There are some differences. The Cartesian system is to be regarded as universal, covering all figures in all space applied before any calculation is done. It has four quadrants divided by the two crossed axes. Three of the quadrants include negative coordinates meaning directions opposite the reference axes of zero.\n\nApollonius has no negative numbers, does not explicitly have a number for zero, and does not develop the coordinate system independently of the conic sections. He works essentially only in Quadrant 1, all positive coordinates. Carl Boyer, a modern historian of mathematics, therefore says:<ref name=\"Boyer Apollonius\">{{cite book | first=Carl B. | last=Boyer | authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer | title=A History of Mathematics | edition=Second | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | date=1991 | isbn=0-471-54397-7 | chapter=Apollonius of Perga | pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00boye/page/156 156\u2013157] | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00boye/page/156 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\u201dHowever, Greek geometric algebra did not provide for negative magnitudes; moreover, the coordinate system was in every case superimposed ''a posteriori'' upon a given curve in order to study its properties .... Apollonius, the greatest geometer of antiquity, failed to develop analytic geometry....\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n\nNo one denies, however, that Apollonius occupies some sort of intermediate niche between the grid system of conventional measurement and the fully developed Cartesian Coordinate System of Analytic Geometry. In reading Apollonius, one must take care not to assume modern meanings for his terms.\n\n====The theory of proportions====\n{{main article|Ratio|Proportionality (mathematics)|Magnitude (mathematics)|Fraction (mathematics)|Eudoxus of Cnidus}}\nApollonius uses the \"Theory of Proportions\" as expressed in [[Euclid]]\u2019s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', Books 5 and 6. Devised by Eudoxus of Cnidus, the theory is intermediate between purely graphic methods and modern number theory. A standard decimal number system is lacking, as is a standard treatment of fractions. The propositions, however, express in words rules for manipulating fractions in arithmetic. Heath proposes that they stand in place of multiplication and division.<ref>{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|pp=ci \u2013 cii}}</ref>\n\nBy the term \u201cmagnitude\u201d  Eudoxus hoped to go beyond numbers to a general sense of size, a meaning it still retains. With regard to the figures of Euclid, it most often means numbers, which was the Pythagorean approach. [[Pythagoras]] believed the universe could be characterized by quantities, which belief has become the current scientific dogma. Book V of Euclid begins by insisting that a magnitude (megethos, \u201csize\u201d) must be divisible evenly into units (meros, \u201cpart\u201d). A magnitude is thus a multiple of units. They do not have to be standard measurement units, such as meters or feet. One unit can be any designated line segment.\n\nThere follows perhaps the most useful fundamental definition ever devised in science: the ratio (Greek [[logos]], meaning roughly \u201cexplanation.\u201d) is a statement of relative magnitude. Given two magnitudes, say of segments AB and CD. the ratio of AB to CD, where CD is considered unit, is the number of CD in AB; for example, 3 parts of 4, or 60 parts per million, where [[Parts-per notation|ppm]] still uses the \u201cparts\u201d terminology. The ratio is the basis of the modern fraction, which also still means \u201cpart,\u201d or \u201cfragment\u201d,  from the same Latin root as fracture.\nThe ratio is the basis of mathematical prediction in the logical structure called a \u201cproportion\u201d  (Greek analogos). The proportion states that if two segments, AB and CD, have the same ratio as two others, EF and GH, then AB and CD are proportional to EF and GH, or, as would be said in Euclid, AB is to CD as EF is to GH.\n\nAlgebra reduces this general concept to the expression AB/CD = EF/GH. Given any three of the terms, one can calculate the fourth as an unknown. Rearranging the above equation, one obtains AB = (CD/GH)\u2022EF, in which, expressed as y = kx, the CD/GH is known as the \u201cconstant of proportionality.\u201d The Greeks had little difficulty with taking multiples (Greek pollaplasiein), probably by successive addition.\n\nApollonius uses ratios almost exclusively of line segments and areas, which are designated by squares and rectangles. The translators have undertaken to use the colon notation introduced by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'', 1684.<ref>{{cite book | title=A history of mathematical notations | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00cajo_0 | url-access=registration | first=Florian | last=Cajori | location=New York | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1993 | page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00cajo_0/page/295 295]}}</ref> Here is an example from ''Conics'', Book I, on Proposition 11:\n\n:Literal translation of the Greek: Let it be contrived that the (square) of BC be to the (rectangle) of BAC as FH is to FA\n:Taliaferro\u2019s translation: \u201cLet it be contrived that sq.

During the 1930s, Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as ''[[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|Captain and the Kids]]''. In 1937, while working at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), Hanna met [[Joseph Barbera]]. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. In 1957, they co-founded [[Hanna-Barbera]], which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, creating and/or producing programs such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Huckleberry Hound|The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[The Yogi Bear Show|Yogi Bear]]''. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] for $12&nbsp;million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which in turn was merged with [[Time Warner]] in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.\n\n''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' won seven Academy Awards, while Hanna and Barbera were nominated for two others and won eight Emmy Awards. Their cartoons have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna-Barbera's shows had a worldwide audience of over 300&nbsp;million people in their 1960s heyday, and have been translated into more than 28 languages.\n\n== Early and personal life==\nWilliam Hanna was born to William John (1873-1949) and Avice Joyce (Denby) Hanna (1882-1956) on July 14, 1910, in [[Melrose, New Mexico|Melrose]], [[New Mexico Territory]].<ref name=\"AutoBiog\">{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|author2=Tom Ito|title=A Cast of Friends|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Emeryville, California|year=2000|isbn=0-306-80917-6|url=https://books.google.is/books/about/A_Cast_of_Friends.html?id=pSwRAQAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>{{rp|5}} He was the third of seven children and the only son.

During the 1930s, Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as ''[[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|Captain and the Kids]]''. In 1937, while working at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), Hanna met [[Joseph Barbera]]. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. In 1957, they co-founded [[Hanna-Barbera]], which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, creating and/or producing programs such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Huckleberry Hound|The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[The Yogi Bear Show|Yogi Bear]]''. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] for $12&nbsp;million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which in turn was merged with [[Time Warner]] in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.\n\n''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' won seven Academy Awards, while Hanna and Barbera were nominated for two others and won eight Emmy Awards. Their cartoons have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna-Barbera's shows had a worldwide audience of over 300&nbsp;million people in their 1960s heyday, and have been translated into more than 28 languages.\n\n== Early and personal life==\nWilliam Hanna was born to William John (1873-1949) and Avice Joyce (Denby) Hanna (1882-1956) on July 14, 1910, in [[Melrose, New Mexico|Melrose]], [[New Mexico Territory]].<ref name=\"AutoBiog\">{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|author2=Tom Ito|title=A Cast of Friends|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Emeryville, California|year=2000|isbn=0-306-80917-6|url=https://books.google.is/books/about/A_Cast_of_Friends.html?id=pSwRAQAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>{{rp|5}} He was the third of seven children and the only son.

Kara Thrace]] and [[Lee Adama]] organize resistance on board the ''Galactica'' and try to retake control of the ship. Zarek brings in [[Romo Lampkin]] to serve as Admiral Adama's defense counsel, against both Lampkin's and Adama's will. After a brief trial, Zarek, acting as judge, condemns Adama to death by firing squad. Zarek travels to ''Colonial One'' to attempt to solidify his position with the support of the [[Quorum of Twelve (Battlestar Galactica)|Quorum of Twelve]] (absent Lee Adama). When they reject his ''coup'' and ask him to leave, he has two marines execute the entire group. Meanwhile, Kara and Lee rescue the high-profile prisoners taken in \"[[The Oath (Battlestar Galactica)|The Oath]]\" ([[Samuel Anders]], [[Saul Tigh|Colonel Tigh]], [[Sharon Agathon]], as well as [[Karl Agathon|Helo]], [[Hera Agathon|Hera]] and Caprica-Six), and with the help of [[Aaron Kelly (Battlestar Galactica)|Aaron Kelly]] rescue Admiral Adama from execution. [[Laura Roslin]] and her allies on the Cylon basestar, now under threat of attack from Gaeta and the ''Galactica'', position the ship among the fleet to temporarily shield themselves. With Adama certain to be killed, the Cylons vote to jump away, but Roslin convinces them to stay with the fleet.\n\nAdama and his allies, including some former mutineers, march to retake the CIC. During a skirmish, Anders is shot in the neck, and Kara convinces Romo Lampkin to help her carry him to [[Dr. Cottle]]. In the CIC, Gaeta and Zarek are in the middle of a standoff with President Roslin. Zarek lies that Adama has already been killed, and Roslin vows to take vengeance. Gaeta orders the ship to jump away, but Tyrol has sabotaged the [[Jump drive|FTL drive]], and Gaeta realizes the mutiny is failing. Rather than attacking as Zarek presses him to do, Gaeta orders his men to stand down. Moments later, Adama and his men storm the CIC, and the mutineers give up without a fight. After the CIC is reclaimed, Tyrol, who is still in the engine room, notices and inspects a heavily damaged section of wall. Long linear grooves appear to have been gouged into the steel. It is unclear what caused this damage.\n\nLater, Gaeta has a conversation with [[Gaius Baltar]] where he expands upon his former hopes and dreams and his wish for people to know who he really was and why he did what he did. Baltar and Gaeta make peace with each other over their past differences with Baltar acknowledging an understanding of who Gaeta is. As a result of their actions, Admiral Adama has Gaeta and Zarek executed by a firing squad that he commands personally. Moments before being executed, Gaeta's phantom limb pain stops, indicating that he is finally at peace with himself.\n\n==Ratings==\nSame-day total viewership ratings for \"Blood on the Scales\" rose to 1.767 from 1.560 million the previous week, a rise of about 13.2 percent.<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/02/10/monk-wwe-raw-the-closer-and-burn-notice-lead-cable-viewing/12499 Seidman, Robert. \"Monk, WWE RAW, The Closer and Burn Notice Lead Cable Viewing.\" TVBytheNumbers.com.
