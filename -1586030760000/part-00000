Previously Linda Jones was the first to apply for an apprentice\u2019s licence and be turned down. She had ridden in a number of lady riders events over many years in New Zealand and overseas such as in Brazil, which highlighted that New Zealand and Australia were outliers in not allowing women to compete with male jockeys in professional races. \n\nThe first win by a woman in New Zealand was visiting Canadian jockey Joan Phipps, at Te Awamutu in November 1977. Sue Day from Christchurch became the first New Zealand female jockey winner in a totalisator race against males on 22 July 1978 when she won with the Ned Thistoll-trained Jaws in the Waybrook Handicap at Timaru<ref>https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2018/07/13/sue-historic-day-40-years-racing-milestone/</ref>. Other female riders then included Joanne Hale, Vivienne Kaye, Joanne Lamond and Cherie Saxon. \n\nLinda Jones\u2019 first win was on Big Bickies at Te Rapa and soon after Royal Petite was the first Open Handicap winner for a female jockey. Subsequent highlight wins for Linda were Lovaro in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap and Holy Toledo in the Wellington Derby (possibly the first female jockey world-wide to win a Derby).  Linda Jones was also the first female jockey to win a professional race against males at a registered meeting in Australia (Doomben).<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12088993</ref>\n\nFemale riders have subsequently gone on to win the New Zealand premiership; Lisa Cropp (2005-2007), Lisa Allpress (2012, 2016 and 2019) and Samantha Collett (2018).\n\nIn late February 2020 Lisa Allpress was the first female to win a thoroughbred race in Saudi Arabia on the horse Matmon at King Abdullah Aziz racetrack in Riyadh<ref>https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/238767/jockey-lisa-allpress-makes-history-in-saudi-arabia</ref>.

Previously Linda Jones was the first to apply for an apprentice\u2019s licence and be turned down. She had ridden in a number of lady riders events over many years in New Zealand and overseas such as in Brazil, which highlighted that New Zealand and Australia were outliers in not allowing women to compete with male jockeys in professional races. \n\nThe first win by a woman in New Zealand was visiting Canadian jockey Joan Phipps, at Te Awamutu in November 1977. Sue Day from Christchurch became the first New Zealand female jockey winner in a totalisator race against males on 22 July 1978 when she won with the Ned Thistoll-trained Jaws in the Waybrook Handicap at Timaru<ref>https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2018/07/13/sue-historic-day-40-years-racing-milestone/</ref>. Other female riders then included Joanne Hale, Vivienne Kaye, Joanne Lamond and Cherie Saxon. \n\nLinda Jones\u2019 first win was on Big Bickies at Te Rapa and soon after Royal Petite was the first Open Handicap winner for a female jockey. Subsequent highlight wins for Linda were Lovaro in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap and Holy Toledo in the Wellington Derby (possibly the first female jockey world-wide to win a Derby).  Linda Jones was also the first female jockey to win a professional race against males at a registered meeting in Australia (Doomben).<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12088993</ref>\n\nFemale riders have subsequently gone on to win the New Zealand premiership; Lisa Cropp (2005-2007), Lisa Allpress (2012, 2016 and 2019) and Samantha Collett (2018).\n\nIn late February 2020 Lisa Allpress was the first female to win a thoroughbred race in Saudi Arabia on the horse Matmon at King Abdullah Aziz racetrack in Riyadh<ref>https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/238767/jockey-lisa-allpress-makes-history-in-saudi-arabia</ref>.

A [[fossil]] of the single and [[type species]], ''B. taimyrensis'', has been discovered in [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] of the Early [[Devonian]] [[Period (geology)|period]] ([[Lochkovian]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]) in the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Siberia]], [[Russia]]. The name of the genus honors [[Carsten Borchgrevink]], an Anglo-Norwegian [[explorer]] who participated in many expeditions to [[Antarctica]].

In 1966, Kjellesvig-Waering classified ''Borchgrevinkium'' with ''Woodwardopterus'' in the family Woodwardopteridae. He based this conclusion on the similarity of the ornamentation, the shape of the prosoma and the exceptional size of the first two segments of both.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1972, St\u00f8rmer questioned the affiliation of the genus in this clade and suggested that it might represent a chasmataspidid within the [[Order (biology)|order]] Xiphosura.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Arthropods from the Lower Devonian (Lower Emsian) of Alken an der Mosel, Germany.

The woodwardopterines were presumably united by the great elongation of the first two segments.<ref name=\":5\" /> This point of view was not approved by other researchers, and eventually Woodwardopterina was [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] with [[Stylonurina]] and Woodwardopteridae with Mycteroptidae.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nNowadays, ''Borchgrevinkium'' is a highly uncertain and problematic genus. Its eurypterid nature was soon denied again in 2013, when Lamsdell placed it in the clade Prosomapoda. It encomapasses all [[chelicerate]]s with prosomal uniramous appendages (appendages composed of a single series of [[Podomere|segments]] attached end-to-end) in the adult stage (excluding the sixth and last appendage). However, the appendages of ''Borchgrevinkium'' are poorly known. Lamsdell made a note in it and in ''[[Anderella]]'', determining that in order to consolidate the classification of both genera in Prosomapoda, new fossil material is needed.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nA phylogenetic analysis (the results presented in a [[cladogram]] below) conducted by Lamsdell in 2013 on the relationships within Xiphosura and the relations to other closely related groups concluded that Xiphosura, as presently understood, was [[paraphyletic]] (that is, it was a group sharing a [[last common ancestor]] but not including all descendants of this ancestor) and thus not a valid phylogenetic group. Prosomapoda was erected to include several chelicerates formerly classified mostly as xiphosurans, as well as the xiphosurans themselves and [[Planaterga]].

''Borchgrevinkium'' might belong to this clade as well.]]\n''Borchgrevinkium'' was originally described as a mycteroptid eurypterid by Novojilov, although he also noted a certain resemblance to ''Weinbergina'', especially for the paired \"ridges\" that both have on their tergites.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nowadays, his descriptions are considered inaccurate, inexhaustive and based only on the best preserved material.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the genus continued being considered by other authors as a eurypterid. In 1966, Kjellesvig-Waering classified ''Borchgrevinkium'' with ''Woodwardopterus'' in the family Woodwardopteridae. He based this conclusion on the similarity of the ornamentation, the shape of the prosoma and the exceptional size of the first two segments of both.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1972, St\u00f8rmer questioned the affiliation of the genus in this clade and suggested that it might represent a chasmataspidid within the [[Order (biology)|order]] Xiphosura.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Arthropods from the Lower Devonian (Lower Emsian) of Alken an der Mosel, Germany. Part 2: Xiphosura|first=Leif|last=St\u00f8rmer|author-link=Leif St\u00f8rmer|journal=Senckenbergiana lethaea|volume=53|issue=1\u20132|pp=1\u201329}}</ref> Following this recommendation, Tollerton reclassified it in 1989 inside this order during his revision of Eurypterida.<ref name=\":4\" /> In 2004, Tetlie did not support this change and transferred ''Borchgrevinkium'' as eurypterid, again in the family Woodwardopteridae with ''Woodwardopterus'' and ''Mycterops'' but now in a different [[suborder]], Woodwardopterina, suggesting that these arthropods actually could not represent eurypterids. The woodwardopterines were presumably united by the great elongation of the first two segments.<ref name=\":5\" /> This point of view was not approved by other researchers, and eventually Woodwardopterina was [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] with [[Stylonurina]] and Woodwardopteridae with Mycteroptidae.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nNowadays, ''Borchgrevinkium'' is a highly uncertain and problematic genus. Its eurypterid nature was soon denied again in 2013, when Lamsdell placed it in the clade Prosomapoda. It encomapasses all [[chelicerate]]s with prosomal uniramous appendages (appendages composed of a single series of [[Podomere|segments]] attached end-to-end) in the adult stage (excluding the sixth and last appendage). However, the appendages of ''Borchgrevinkium'' are poorly known. Lamsdell made a note in it and in ''[[Anderella]]'', determining that in order to consolidate the classification of both genera in Prosomapoda, new fossil material is needed.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nA phylogenetic analysis (the results presented in a [[cladogram]] below) conducted by Lamsdell in 2013 on the relationships within Xiphosura and the relations to other closely related groups concluded that Xiphosura, as presently understood, was [[paraphyletic]] (that is, it was a group sharing a [[last common ancestor]] but not including all descendants of this ancestor) and thus not a valid phylogenetic group. Prosomapoda was erected to include several chelicerates formerly classified mostly as xiphosurans, as well as the xiphosurans themselves and [[Planaterga]].

[[Philip Fox (actor)|Philip Fox]] has appeared in several episodes, whilst [[Cariad Lloyd]] and [[Mike Wozniak]] have also appeared in the supporting cast.\n\nAs well as standalone sketches, the show also features recurring segments. The current segments are Breaking News and Number Crunchers.\n*'''Breaking News''': A one-liner linked to a current news story.\n*'''Number Crunchers''': A joke with a statistical set-up and punchline. This segment was introduced in series 16 and has also been referred to as \"Number Breakdown\" and \"Number Crunching\".\n\nWriters wishing to submit material for ''Newsjack'' are invited to write material for these segments as well as their own sketches not related to them.\n\nIn the past recurring segments have included:\n*'''The Newsjack App''': Mock answerphone messages. These are designed so that writers can create [[One-liner joke|one-liners]] and other kinds of quick jokes.\n*'''From the Archive''': The show looks at a (fictional) programme from the past to see how news stories similar to those of today were covered in the past.\n*'''Julia''': a woman called Julia has been locked in a room, which symbolises the dark world of petty journalism, e.g.: reporting on the wedding of Zara Philips. As a result, she has become psychotic, longing to see sunlight; upon which the presenter shuts the door on her desperate pleas.  \n*'''Newsjack Films''': Spoof movie trailers.\n*'''Celebrity Diary''': The cast impersonate a celebrity and see recent events from their viewpoint.\n*'''Corrections''': At the end of the programme, the cast read out made-up corrections relating to things from the previous episode.\n*'''Viewsjack''': One-liners in the style of a vox-pop interview answer.\n*'''And Finally''': A post-credits sequence where the show pretends the current episode is an old show and make jokes about how the world might have changed since the programme went out.\n*'''Newsjackpedia''': Introduced in series 19.

The current segments are Breaking News and Number Crunchers.\n*'''Breaking News''': A one-liner linked to a current news story.\n*'''Number Crunchers''': A joke with a statistical set-up and punchline. This segment was introduced in series 16 and has also been referred to as \"Number Breakdown\" and \"Number Crunching\".\n\nWriters wishing to submit material for ''Newsjack'' are invited to write material for these segments as well as their own sketches not related to them.\n\nIn the past recurring segments have included:\n*'''The Newsjack App''': Mock answerphone messages. These are designed so that writers can create [[One-liner joke|one-liners]] and other kinds of quick jokes.\n*'''From the Archive''': The show looks at a (fictional) programme from the past to see how news stories similar to those of today were covered in the past.\n*'''Julia''': a woman called Julia has been locked in a room, which symbolises the dark world of petty journalism, e.g.: reporting on the wedding of Zara Philips. As a result, she has become psychotic, longing to see sunlight; upon which the presenter shuts the door on her desperate pleas.  \n*'''Newsjack Films''': Spoof movie trailers.\n*'''Celebrity Diary''': The cast impersonate a celebrity and see recent events from their viewpoint.\n*'''Corrections''': At the end of the programme, the cast read out made-up corrections relating to things from the previous episode.\n*'''Viewsjack''': One-liners in the style of a vox-pop interview answer.\n*'''And Finally''': A post-credits sequence where the show pretends the current episode is an old show and make jokes about how the world might have changed since the programme went out.\n*'''Newsjackpedia''': Introduced in series 19.

[[William Conner]] was the first white settler in the county. In the summer of 1822, after realizing there were enough settlers in the area, Conner and other settlers applied to the Indiana Legislature for a charter authorizing them to become a separate and independent county under Indiana law. The application was presented to the Legislature at the 1822-23 session and the act was passed and approved by the governor on January 8, 1823. The act took effect on the first Monday in April (April 7), 1823. The County Commissioners first met on May 5, 1823, at the house of [[William Conner]]. Conner's house would also serve as the County Circuit Court. The county was named after [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first secretary of the treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Hamilton County stats| publisher=Indiana.edu| url=http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| accessdate=2007-06-30| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708012823/http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| archivedate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

In 1912, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]] had carried the county with a 3.06% plurality over Republican opponent [[William Taft]].<ref name=\"uselectionatlas.org\">[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential Atlas (Maps for Indiana by election)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130204636/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 |date=2008-11-30 }} Results prior to 1960 available through subscription only</ref>\n\nHamilton County's loyalty to the Republican Party is not limited to presidential elections. The county regularly rejects Democrats in [[Governor of Indiana|gubernatorial]] and [[United States Senate|senatorial]] races, and is typically one of the Republicans' strongest counties at the state level. One of the few times in recent memory that Hamilton County has supported a Democrat for governor or Senate was in 1992, when [[Evan Bayh]] narrowly carried it with 50.48 percent of the vote in his successful reelection bid.  However, Bayh lost Hamilton County in his three bids for Senate.\n\nDespite these facts, however, the county is slowly tilting more Democratic like many suburban counties. [[Donald Trump]] in 2016 gave the weakest showing for a Republican nominee  since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932, despite his statewide dominance that year, winning just 56% of the vote. Thus, Hamilton County voted less Republican than the rest of the state for the first time in almost 100 years, even though Trump still carried the county. Eight years earlier, [[Barack Obama]] received 38.45% of the county vote during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], the strongest result for a Democrat since [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1936. [[Joe Donnelly]] in his 2018 senate re-election loss also came less than 10% away from winning the county, winning 44.4% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Election Results 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/indiana/ |website=Politico}}</ref>\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

[[William Conner]] was the first white settler in the county. In the summer of 1822, after realizing there were enough settlers in the area, Conner and other settlers applied to the Indiana Legislature for a charter authorizing them to become a separate and independent county under Indiana law. The application was presented to the Legislature at the 1822-23 session and the act was passed and approved by the governor on January 8, 1823. The act took effect on the first Monday in April (April 7), 1823. The County Commissioners first met on May 5, 1823, at the house of [[William Conner]]. Conner\u2019s house would also serve as the County Circuit Court. The county was named after [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first secretary of the treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Hamilton County stats| publisher=Indiana.edu| url=http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| accessdate=2007-06-30| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708012823/http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| archivedate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

In 1912, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]] had carried the county with a 3.06% plurality over Republican opponent [[William Taft]].<ref name=\"uselectionatlas.org\">[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential Atlas (Maps for Indiana by election)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130204636/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 |date=2008-11-30 }} Results prior to 1960 available through subscription only</ref>\n\nHamilton County's loyalty to the Republican Party is not limited to presidential elections. The county regularly rejects Democrats in [[Governor of Indiana|gubernatorial]] and [[United States Senate|senatorial]] races, and is typically one of the Republicans' strongest counties at the state level. One of the few times in recent memory that Hamilton County has supported a Democrat for governor or Senate was in 1992, when [[Evan Bayh]] narrowly carried it with 50.48 percent of the vote in his successful reelection bid.  However, Bayh lost Hamilton County in his three bids for Senate.\n\nDespite these facts, however, the county is slowly tilting more Democratic like many suburban counties. [[Donald Trump]] in 2016 gave the weakest showing for a Republican nominee  since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932, despite his statewide dominance that year, winning just 56% of the vote. Thus, Hamilton County voted less Republican than the rest of the state for the first time in almost 100 years, even though Trump still carried the county. Eight years earlier, [[Barack Obama]] received 38.45% of the county vote during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], the strongest result for a Democrat since [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1936. [[Joe Donnelly]] in his 2018 senate re-election loss also came less than 10% away from winning the county, winning 44.4% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Election Results 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/indiana/ |website=Politico}}</ref>\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
