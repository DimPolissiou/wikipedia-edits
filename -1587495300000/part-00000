How did this happen? What hold did the capitalist have on the worker that permitted this new form of organization to thrive and eventually to dominate?''\n\n''The conventional answer is superior efficiency, a better mousetrap.

How did this happen? What hold did the capitalist have on the worker that permitted this new form of organization to thrive and eventually to dominate?''\n\n''The conventional answer is superior efficiency, a better mousetrap. If the capitalist enterprise comes into existence because of its superior efficiency, then the boss can entice the worker by offering him more money than the worker could earn on his own. [\u2026] By contrast, the answer in \"Bosses\" is that the capitalist organization of work came into existence not because of superior efficiency but in consequence of the rent-seeking activities of the capitalist.''<ref>{{Harvnb|Marglin|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d_lYHlp72EQC&pg=PA153 153\u20134]}}.</ref>\n}}\n\nElsewhere, Marglin argued: \"The obstacles to liberating the workplace lie not only in the dominance of classes in whose interest it is to perpetuate the authoritarian workplace, but also in the dominance of the knowledge system that legitimizes the authority of the boss.

Landes' original survey ({{Harvnb|Landes|1969}}), drawn on his background in entrepreneurial history, had suggested a combination of technological and cultural factors explaining why Britain came first and why it later dropped behind. Marglin (1974), from a background in radical economics, instead took a strong labour-process view, in a paper entitled \"What Do Bosses Do?\" For him it was the control entrusted to the 'bosses' through the factory system that crucially defined that Industrial Revolution. {{Harvp|Landes|1986}} replied with a restatement more strongly favouring the technology as the ''sine qua non'' of early industrialisation.

The Army had originally planned to raise an additional regiment, the 114th, but failed to raise the required number of men. The companies were from the following counties:<br>\nCompany A Philadelphia<br />\nCompany B Philadelphia \u2013 Captained by [[Theodore Blakeley]]<br />\nCompany C Philadelphia \u2013 Captained by [[Daniel Linn]]<br />\nCompany D Philadelphia \u2013 Captained by [[Newton R.

Curtis as [[Lieutenant Colonel|lieutenant colonel]] and Montgomery Martin as [[major]]. The 58th was mustered in on February 13, 1862.\n\nIn early March, the regiment was sent to Fort Monroe. On May 10, it was attached to a force sent to capture [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Until September, the regiment was assigned to garrison duty around Hampton Roads, and was then transferred to [[South Carolina]]. During this time, it fought only in small skirmishes and raids, losing few men. During a raid on [[Kinston, North Carolina]], on May 21, 1863, Jones was killed. Curtis was promoted to colonel, Martin to lieutenant colonel, and Captain Henry Metcalf to major. In June, the 58th was sent to [[North Carolina]], where it was broken up into various detachments and spread along the Pamlico River.\n\nIn late April 1864, the regiment was reassigned to the [[Army of the James]] as part of the 3rd Brigade, First Division, [[XVIII Corps (ACW)|XVIII Corps]]. Other than some skirmishing during the initial advance on [[Richmond, Virginia]], the regiment did not see much action. Along with the rest of the corps, it fought at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]]. After the battle, the entire corps was moved to the lines in front of [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. During the [[Siege of Petersburg]], the regiment was assigned mostly to picket, guard, and fatigue duty.  It did fight in the [[Battle of Chaffin's Farm]] on September 28, 1864, where it lost six officers and 128 enlisted men.\n\nAfter serving in the [[Appomattox Campaign]], the regiment was broken up into various detachments and assigned to the lower counties of Virginia. It was mustered out at [[City Point, Virginia]], on January 26, 1866.\n\n[[Image:The58thPennsylvaniaInfantry.jpg|right|frame|58th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment Reunion, 1914]]\n\n==Reenactors==\nA group portraying the 58th Pennsylvania is based in [[North Branch, New York]]. website is https://web.archive.org/web/20071206200535/http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/58thpa/58thpa.html\n\n==Casualties==\n* Killed and mortally wounded: 6 officers, 68 enlisted men\n* Wounded: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n* Died of disease: 4 officers, 139 enlisted men\n* Captured or missing: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n* Total: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Pennsylvania Civil War Units]]\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.pa-roots.com/~pacw/infantry/58th/58thorg.html Pennsylvania in the Civil War]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080410173040/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/regiments.cfm Civil War Soldiers and Sailors]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080502043353/http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~usgenweb/pa/northumberp/bellcont.htm History of Northumberland Co., PA]\n* [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa&cc=moa&sid=778308149b189f58bf191421757c33c6&q1=Fifty-Eighth%20Regiment&idno=ABY3439.0002.001&view=image&seq=00000293 History of Pennsylvania volunteers, 1861-5; prepared in compliance with acts of the legislature, by Samuel P.

In June, the 58th was sent to [[North Carolina]], where it was broken up into various detachments and spread along the Pamlico River.\n\nIn late April 1864, the regiment was reassigned to the [[Army of the James]] as part of the 3rd Brigade, First Division, [[XVIII Corps (ACW)|XVIII Corps]]. Other than some skirmishing during the initial advance on [[Richmond, Virginia]], the regiment did not see much action. Along with the rest of the corps, it fought at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]]. After the battle, the entire corps was moved to the lines in front of [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. During the [[Siege of Petersburg]], the regiment was assigned mostly to picket, guard, and fatigue duty.  It did fight in the [[Battle of Chaffin's Farm]] on September 28, 1864, where it lost six officers and 128 enlisted men.\n\nAfter serving in the [[Appomattox Campaign]], the regiment was broken up into various detachments and assigned to the lower counties of Virginia. It was mustered out at [[City Point, Virginia]], on January 26, 1866.\n\n[[Image:The58thPennsylvaniaInfantry.jpg|right|frame|58th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment Reunion, 1914]]\n\n==Reenactors==\nA group portraying the 58th Pennsylvania is based in [[North Branch, New York]]. website is https://web.archive.org/web/20071206200535/http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/58thpa/58thpa.html\n\n==Casualties==\n* Killed and mortally wounded: 6 officers, 68 enlisted men\n* Wounded: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n* Died of disease: 4 officers, 139 enlisted men\n* Captured or missing: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n* Total: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Pennsylvania Civil War Units]]\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.pa-roots.com/~pacw/infantry/58th/58thorg.html Pennsylvania in the Civil War]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080410173040/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/regiments.cfm Civil War Soldiers and Sailors]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080502043353/http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~usgenweb/pa/northumberp/bellcont.htm History of Northumberland Co., PA]\n* [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa&cc=moa&sid=778308149b189f58bf191421757c33c6&q1=Fifty-Eighth%20Regiment&idno=ABY3439.0002.001&view=image&seq=00000293 History of Pennsylvania volunteers, 1861-5; prepared in compliance with acts of the legislature, by Samuel P.

An adult worm is normally 4 to 10 m in length, but can become very large; specimens over 22 m long are reported. Typical of cestodes, its body is flattened dorsoventrally and heavily segmented. It is entirely covered by a [[Tegument (helminth)|tegument]]. The body is white in colour and consists of three portions: [[scolex]], neck, and strobila. The scolex has four suckers, but they have no hooks. Lack of hooks and a rostellum is an identifying feature from other ''Taenia'' species.<ref name=kone/> The rest of the body proper, the strobila, is basically a chain of numerous body segments called proglottids. The neck is the shortest part of the body, and consists of immature proglottids. The midstrobila is made of mature proglottids that eventually lead to the gravid proglottids, which are at the posterior end. An individual can have as many as 1000 to 2000 proglottids.\n\n''T. saginata'' does not have a [[digestive system]], mouth, [[anus]], or digestive tract. It derives nutrients from the host through its tegument, as the tegument is completely covered with absorptive hair-like [[microtriches]]. It is also an [[acoelomate]], having no body cavity. The inside of each mature proglottid is filled with muscular layers and complete male and female reproductive systems, including the tubular unbranched [[uterus]], [[ovary]], [[genital]] pore, testes, and [[Vitelline duct|vitelline gland]].

Oncospheres enter the [[duodenum]], the anterior portion of the small intestine, and hatch there under the influence of [[gastric juices]]. The embryonic membranes are removed, liberating free [[hexacanth]] (\"six-hooked\") larvae. With their hooks, they attach to the intestinal wall and penetrate the [[intestinal mucosa]] into the blood vessels. The larvae can move to all parts of the body by the general [[circulatory system]], and finally settle in [[skeletal muscles]] within 70 days. Inside the tissue, they cast off their hooks and instead develop a protective cuticular shell, called the [[cyst]]. Thus, they become fluid-filled cysticerci. Cysterci can also form in [[lungs]] and [[liver]]. The inner membrane of the cysticercus soon develops numerous protoscolices (small scolices) that are invertedly attached to the inner surface.

In some cases, the proglottid ruptures inside the intestine, and the eggs are released. The free proglottids and liberated eggs are removed by [[peristalsis]] into the environment.

Since it is difficult to diagnose using eggs alone, looking at the scolex or the gravid proglottids can help identify it as ''Taenia saginata''.<ref name=\"schmidt\"/> Proglottids sometimes trickle down the thighs of infected humans and are visible with unaided eye, so can aid with identification. Observation of scolex help distinguish between ''T. saginata'', ''T. solium'' and ''[[Taenia asiatica|T. asiatica]]''. When the [[uterus]] is injected with [[India ink]], its branches become visible. Counting the uterine branches enables some identification (''T. saginata'' uteri have 12 or more branches on each side, while other species such as ''T. solium'' only have five to 10).<ref name=\"lange\"/>\n\nDifferentiation of the species of ''[[Taenia (genus)|Taenia]]'', such as ''T. solium'' and ''T. asiatica'', is notoriously difficult because of their close [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] resemblance, and their eggs are more or less identical.

[[Feces]] are examined to find parasite eggs. The eggs look like other eggs from the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Taeniidae]], so it is only possible to identify the eggs to the family, not to the species level. Since it is difficult to diagnose using eggs alone, looking at the scolex or the gravid proglottids can help identify it as ''Taenia saginata''.<ref name=\"schmidt\"/> Proglottids sometimes trickle down the thighs of infected humans and are visible with unaided eye, so can aid with identification. Observation of scolex help distinguish between ''T. saginata'', ''T. solium'' and ''[[Taenia asiatica|T. asiatica]]''. When the [[uterus]] is injected with [[India ink]], its branches become visible. Counting the uterine branches enables some identification (''T. saginata'' uteri have 12 or more branches on each side, while other species such as ''T. solium'' only have five to 10).<ref name=\"lange\"/>\n\nDifferentiation of the species of ''[[Taenia (genus)|Taenia]]'', such as ''T. solium'' and ''T. asiatica'', is notoriously difficult because of their close [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] resemblance, and their eggs are more or less identical. Identification often requires [[histology|histological]] observation of the [[uterus|uterine branches]] and [[PCR]] detection of [[ribosome|ribosomal 5.8S gene]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gonz\u00e1lez LM, Montero E, Harrison LJ, Parkhouse RM, Garate T |title=Differential diagnosis of Taenia saginata and Taenia solium infection by PCR. |journal=J Clin Microbiol |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=737\u2013744 |year=2000 |doi=10.1128/JCM.38.2.737-744.2000 |pmid=10655377 |pmc=86191 }}</ref> The uteri of ''T. saginata'' stem out from the center to form 12 to 20 branches, but in contrast to its closely related ''Taenia'' species, the branches are much less in number and comparatively thicker; in addition, the [[ovary|ovaries]] are bilobed and testes are twice as many.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zarlenga DS. |title=The differentiation of a newly described Asian taeniid from Taenia saginata using enzymatically amplified non-transcribed ribosomal DNA repeat sequences. |journal=Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health.  |volume=22 |issue=suppl |pages=251\u2013255 |year=1991 |pmid=1822899 }}</ref>\n\n[[Eosinophilia]] and elevated [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] levels are chief hematological findings.
