Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present.

Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K.

Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and other wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it.

This typical [[19th century|nineteenth-century]] urban plan can be found especially in the area between Via Venti Settembre, Viale Castro Pretorio, Via del Castro Pretorio and the long straight road Via Volturno-Via Marsala, with its center in the large Piazza dell'Indipendenza, the focal point of this section of the ''rione''; a grid of secondary roads, bearing names that recall the places where the Italian wars of independence took place, radiates from the square.\nThis is the most populated area of the ''rione'', showing the urban coexistence of two-storey villas, [[Stile umbertino]] palaces, offices and more or less luxurious hotels intended to accommodate the large number of tourists from the nearby [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini railway station]].\n\nThe most monumental part of the ''rione'', as well as most \"international\" one due to the large flow of tourists, is certainly [[Piazza della Repubblica, Rome|Piazza della Repubblica]] (formerly Piazza Esedra) together with Via Nazionale, the crossroads of the Quattro Fontane and [[Via Cavour, Rome|Via Cavour]], important arteries connecting the railway station and the historic center.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Casino della Villa Peretti - Plate 194 - Giuseppe Vasi.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Engraving by [[Giuseppe Vasi]] showing Villa Peretti (later Villa Negroni).]]\nDuring the [[Roman Empire|Imperial age]], the area belonged to the ''regio'' ''[[Alta Semita]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"high pathway\"). At that time, a huge part of the present-day ''rione'' was gloomy and infamous, as it housed the ''Campus Sceleratus'', a large area just outside [[Porta Collina]] (between Via Venti Settembre and Piazza dell'Indipendenza) where Vestal virgins that infringed their chastity vows were buried alive.\n\nAnother landmark of the borough was the ''Castra Praetoria'', the barracks of the Praetorian Guard established by [[Tiberius]] between [[AD 21]] and [[AD 23]], later incorporated into the Aurelian Walls. \n\nBetween [[298]] and [[306]], in order to serve the densely populated quarters of the [[Quirinal hill|Quirinal]], [[Viminal hill|Viminal]] and [[Esquiline hill|Esquiline]] hills, the majestic [[Baths of Diocletian]] were built, whose remains can still be seen along Via Cernaia and in Piazza dei Cinquecento. \nThe baths occupied the area between Piazza della Repubblica, Piazza dei Cinquecento, Via Volturno and Via Venti Settembre. They definitively ceased activity in [[537]], due to the cutting of the aqueducts during the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic war]].\n\nIn the eastern part of Piazza dei Cinquecento there was the [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]] of [[Servius Tullius]], located near the former [[Porta Viminale]], whose remains still rise in front of the Termini railway station. In the ''rione'' there were two other gates that no longer exist, Porta Collina and [[Porta Nomentana]], belonging to the [[Servian Wall|Servian]] and to the Aurelian Walls respectively.\n\nFollowing to the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Rome began to depopulate, and the area of the ''rione'' was among the first boroughs to be abandoned, being peripheral, unsafe and lacking of water. In the following centuries, little hamlets arose only around some major churches, such as the basilicas of [[Santa Prassede]], [[Santa Pudenziana]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], thanks to their convents.\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] promoted the urbanization of the area, with the construction of the ''Strada Felice'', a 2 kilometers straight line between [[Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti]] and [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (it coincides with the present-day [[Via Sistina]], [[Via delle Quattro Fontane]] and Via Agostino Depretis) and of the ''[[Acqua Felice|Acquedotto Felice]]'': both the road and the aqueduct recall the name of the Pope, Felice Peretti. The refurbishments promoted by Sixtus V also involved the intersection between Via Sistina and Via Pia, where the [[Quattro Fontane]] were positioned, thus creating a scenic viewpoint where people used to stop in summertime and enjoy \"the good air\", which is unimaginable today. It must be said that Cardinal Peretti had shown his great interest in this area even before he became Pope, as he ordered the construction of a huge villa, with a park richly adorned with fountains and portals, between Santa Maria Maggiore and the present Via Marsala and Via del Viminale <ref>The villa, which later became [[Villa Montalto Peretti Massimo]], was demolished immediately after the unification of Italy for the urbanization of the area and today no trace remains of it, with the only exception of the [[Fontana del Prigione]] now in [[Trastevere]]</ref>.\n\nIn the [[17th century]] some [[Jesuits]], back from a mission in the Far East, established here and nicknamed the borough ''[[Macau|Macao]]'': the name was widely used up to the post-war period and is currently evoked by a street of the ''rione'' (Via del Macao).\n\nAfter the [[Capture of Rome]], the ''rione'' experienced a feverish development, just as the other ''rioni'' that were urbanized at the time, and a number of huge ''[[stile umbertino]]'' palaces, such as the headquarters of the Ministers of Treasury and of Defence, were built alongside Via Venti Settembre; relevant arteries were also opened, such as Via Nazionale and Via Cavour. In the same period, two important roman squares were built (Piazza dell'Indipendenza, with a central garden, and the monumental Piazza della Repubblica, with the [[Piazza della Repubblica, Rome|Fontana delle Naiadi]] in the center and the two large Savoy palaces with arcades on the sides, following the exedra of the Baths on which the square was built), as well as a number of luxury buildings, like the Albergo Quirinale, the Grand Hotel and the Teatro Costanzi'' (the current [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]]).\nThe original core (the present one dates back to a complete [[20th century|twentieth-century]] reconstruction) of the [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini railway station]] was also built.\n\nBetween [[1883]] and [[1886]], Villa Peretti Massimo was demolished, and [[Palazzo Massimo alle Terme]] was built in place of it, in order to house the ''Collegio Massimo'', a Jesuit school: it is now the main seat of the [[National Roman Museum]].\n\n[[File:Stemma Castro Pretorio (vect.).svg|thumb|upright=0.7|right]]\n=== Coat or arms ===\n''[[Gules]], Praetorians [[insignia]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]]''.\n\nThe coat of arms is the [[labarum]] of the [[Praetorian Guard]] in gold on a red background<ref>Note that the coat of arms of the ''rione'' was established by Council Resolution no. 20 of 20 August 1921, which describes it without showing its image.
