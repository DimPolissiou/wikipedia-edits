He is a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in the builder category.\n\nBorn in Toronto, he attended a public high school, [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]], Neilson's coaching career began as a student at [[McMaster University]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] where he continued  to coach until graduation with a degree in [[Physical Education]] in both [[Ice hockey|hockey]] and baseball.\n\n==Coaching career==\nNeilson's coaching career began in 1966 as head coach of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]'s [[Peterborough Petes]], then the junior farm team of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], and he remained for 10 years in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], where he maintained a home until his death. He also worked at the [[University of Windsor]] with a summer hockey camp program, which led to camps from [[Port Hope, Ontario]] to [[Israel]].\n\nHe moved into professional hockey coaching with the [[Dallas Black Hawks]] in the [[Central Hockey League (1963\u201384)|Central Hockey League]] in 1976\u201377.\n\nRoger Neilson was head coach in the NHL for:\n* [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] from [[1977\u201378 NHL season|1977]] to [[1978\u201379 NHL season|1979]] (following another eventual member of the [[Order of Canada]], [[Red Kelly]]),\n* [[Buffalo Sabres]] for the [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1980\u201381 season]],\n* [[Vancouver Canucks]] from [[1981\u201382 NHL season|March 1982]] to [[1983\u201384 NHL season|January 1984]],\n* [[Los Angeles Kings]] from February to April 1984,\n* [[New York Rangers]] from [[1989\u201390 NHL season|1989]] to January[[1992\u201393 NHL season| 1993]],\n* [[Florida Panthers]] from [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993]] to [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1995]],\n* [[Philadelphia Flyers]] from March [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1998]] to [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|2000]],\n* [[Ottawa Senators]] for two games [[2001\u201302 NHL season|in April 2002]] (Neilson was an Ottawa assistant coach, but he was allowed to coach the final two games of the season so that he could hit the 1,000 game mark).\n\nIn 1979, he was fired as head coach of the Maple Leafs by owner [[Harold Ballard]]. There was outrage throughout the players, media, and general public. Ballard then relented but wanted Neilson to enter the next game with a paper bag over his head as \"the mystery coach\", but Neilson refused and coached the next game as if nothing had happened. \n\nHe was initially an assistant coach with Vancouver, but he took over as head coach after [[Harry Neale]] was suspended for taking part in an altercation with fans during a brawl in against the [[Quebec Nordiques]]. When the team went unbeaten in the next seven games, he was given the job permanently. It was in his new capacity that he led the team on its run to the [[1982 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nHis tenure with the New York Rangers was also successful; the highlight was coaching the team to the [[Presidents' Trophy]] as the first place team in the league in 1992.\n\nWith Philadelphia, he led the team to first place in the Eastern Conference in 2000, a position that the team would retain for the rest of the regular season. With the Flyers leading in the conference standings by the mid-season All-Star Game, Neilson earned the honour of being head coach of the Eastern Conference All-Stars. Previously, he had coached the Campbell Conference All-Stars at the [[35th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1983 All-Star Game]].\n\nIn addition, Neilson also worked for the [[Edmonton Oilers]] as a video analyst during the [[1983\u201384 NHL season|1984 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], culminating in the Oilers' first Stanley Cup championship, and the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] as an assistant coach under [[Bob Pulford]] from 1984 to 1987. From 1995 to 1997, he was an assistant coach for the [[St. Louis Blues]].\n\n==Broadcasting career==\nDuring the [[1987\u201388 NHL season|1987\u201388]] and [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1988\u201389]] seasons,he did not coach but worked as a color commentator on [[TSN Hockey]] coverage along with [[Jim Hughson]] and [[Gary Green (ice hockey)|Gary Green]].\n\n===Retirement from hockey===\nHe had gone on medical leave from the Flyers just before the 2000 playoffs for cancer treatment but was later informed that he had been permanently replaced by [[Craig Ramsay]]. His unceremonious dismissal by Flyers General Manager [[Bobby Clarke]] was widely lamented by fans and media as lacking class and respect. His doctors advised the Flyers that he lacked the strength to perform his duties as head coach. He insisted on trying to return at the end of the first round of the playoffs. At the end of the season, he was dismissed as head coach. He later conceded Clarke did the right thing, and he never served as a head coach again.\n\nHe was then hired as an assistant coach of the Senators. For the last two games of the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]], which were inconsequential to the standings, Head Coach [[Jacques Martin (ice hockey)|Jacques Martin]] stepped away from the bench, allowing him to take the reins and become the ninth man to coach 1,000 games. The next season, the Senators won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] as the first place team in the league and made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals. As it was well known that his cancer was [[terminal illness|terminal]] when the Senators were eliminated in a tough seven game series, several players expressed their sadness at not being able to win the Stanley Cup for him before he died.\n\nNeilson's overall regular season record was 460 wins, 378 losses, 159 ties, and 3 overtime losses.\n\n===Coaching legacy===\nHe dedicated his entire life to coaching and to hockey and affected the careers of thousands. He had no family and would stay up late into the night watching video and analysing games.\n\nAmong his most well-known innovations was the use of [[Video cassette recorder|videotape]] to analyze other teams, leading to the nickname \"Captain Video\". He was also the first to use microphone headsets to communicate with his assistant coaches.\n\nIn situations where the face off was in the opposition's end and there were perhaps three or less seconds to go in the first and/or second period, Neilson would pull his goaltender for an extra attacker for a potential shot on net off the ensuing face-off. His reasoning was that if the other team gained possession of the puck, it would be virtually impossible for the opposition to score from their end in the mere seconds that were left. No other coach would consider this radical move, and it was indicative of his innovative thinking.\n\nHe was well known for closely reading the rule book looking to exploit [[loopholes]]. During one particular game in his first season coaching the Petes, he was down two men in a [[five on three|5-on-3]] situation for the last minute of the game. Realizing that more penalties could not be served under the existing rules, he put too many men on the ice every 10 seconds. The referees stopped the play and a faceoff was held relieving pressure on the defence. In addition, he also took advantage of fans throwing objects onto the ice to deliberately cause stoppages of play late in a game. After these displays, the rules were changed so that a call for too many men on the ice in a 5-on-3 situation, or a delay-of-game penalty in a 5-on-3 situation, or any deliberate act to stop play (i.e., objects thrown on the ice, or the net being intentionally dislodged), in the last two minutes of regulation or in overtime now results in a [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]].\n\nHe also discovered that if he put a defenceman in net instead of a goaltender during a penalty shot, the defenceman could rush the attacker and cut down the latter's angle of shot, greatly reducing the chances of a goal. In 1968, he used this information in an OHL game between Neilson's Peterborough Petes and the opposing [[Toronto Marlboros]]. Neilson replaced Petes goaltender Pete Kostek with defenseman [[Ron Stackhouse]]. Stackhouse successfully blocked Frank Hamill's penalty shot attempt by charging out as soon as Hamill crossed the blue line.<ref>{{cite news|title=Penalty shot bid blocked by defenceman|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-qUtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5J8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4070%2C6460564|accessdate=30 January 2015|agency=The Canadian Press|publisher=The Montreal Gazette|date=Sep 27, 1968}}</ref><ref name=kay>{{cite web|last1=Kay|first1=Jason|title=NFL has Deflategate, did the NHL have Coffeegate?|url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/nfl-has-deflategate-did-the-nhl-have-coffeegate/|website=thehockeynews.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> Today the rules states that a team must use a goaltender in net for a penalty shot and that the goaltender cannot leave the crease until the skater has touched the puck.\n\nOne game during a time-out, he told his goaltender, \u201c...When we pull you, just leave your goal stick lying in the crease.\u201d When the other team gained possession, they sent the puck the length of the ice toward the open net, only to deflect wide when it hit the goal stick lying in the crease.

The City of Peterborough renamed George Street South ''Roger Neilson Way'' opposite the Memorial Centre Arena in 2003; the address of the Arena was supposed to be changed to ''1 Roger Neilson Way''. The Ottawa Senators have named their coaches office at [[Scotiabank Place]] ''The Roger Neilson Room''. The City of Ottawa renamed their Minor Peewee AAA Hockey Division after Neilson in 2005. Also in 2005, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] created an award for the top academic player attending college or university and named it the [[Roger Neilson Memorial Award]].\n\nIn 1999, Neilson was diagnosed with [[bone cancer]], which spread to become [[skin cancer]] in 2001.

He is a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in the builder category.\n\nBorn in Toronto, he attended a public high school, [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]], Neilson's coaching career began as a student at [[McMaster University]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] where he continued  to coach until graduation with a degree in [[Physical Education]] in both [[Ice hockey|hockey]] and baseball.\n\n==Coaching career==\nNeilson's coaching career began in 1966 as head coach of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]'s [[Peterborough Petes]], then the junior farm team of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], and he remained for 10 years in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], where he maintained a home until his death. He also worked at the [[University of Windsor]] with a summer hockey camp program, which led to camps from [[Port Hope, Ontario]] to [[Israel]].\n\nNeilson moved into professional hockey coaching with the [[Dallas Black Hawks]] in the [[Central Hockey League (1963\u201384)|Central Hockey League]] in 1976\u201377.\n\nNeilson was head coach in the NHL for:\n* [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] from [[1977\u201378 NHL season|1977]] to [[1978\u201379 NHL season|1979]] (following another eventual member of the [[Order of Canada]], [[Red Kelly]]),\n* [[Buffalo Sabres]] for the [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1980\u201381 season]],\n* [[Vancouver Canucks]] from [[1981\u201382 NHL season|March 1982]] to [[1983\u201384 NHL season|January 1984]],\n* [[Los Angeles Kings]] from February to April 1984,\n* [[New York Rangers]] from [[1989\u201390 NHL season|1989]] to January[[1992\u201393 NHL season| 1993]],\n* [[Florida Panthers]] from [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993]] to [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1995]],\n* [[Philadelphia Flyers]] from March [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1998]] to [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|2000]],\n* [[Ottawa Senators]] for two games [[2001\u201302 NHL season|in April 2002]] (Neilson was an Ottawa assistant coach, but was allowed to coach the final two games of the season so that he could hit the 1,000 game mark).\n\nIn 1979, Neilson was fired as head coach of the Maple Leafs by owner [[Harold Ballard]]. There was outrage throughout the players, media, and general public. Ballard then relented, but wanted Neilson to enter the next game with a paper bag over his head as \"the mystery coach\", but Neilson refused and coached the next game as if nothing had happened. \n\nNeilson was initially an assistant coach with Vancouver, but he took over as head coach after [[Harry Neale]] was suspended for taking part in an altercation with fans during a brawl in against the [[Quebec Nordiques]]. When the team went unbeaten in the next seven games, he was given the job permanently. It was in his new capacity that Neilson led the team on its run to the [[1982 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nNeilson's tenure with the New York Rangers was also successful; the highlight was coaching the team to the [[Presidents' Trophy]] as the first place team in the league in 1992.\n\nWith Philadelphia, Neilson led the team to first place in the Eastern Conference in 2000, a position that the team would retain for the rest of the regular season. With the Flyers leading in the conference standings by the midseason All-Star Game, Neilson earned the honour of being head coach of the Eastern Conference All-Stars. Previously, he had coached the Campbell Conference All-Stars at the [[35th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1983 All-Star Game]].\n\nIn addition, Neilson also worked for the [[Edmonton Oilers]] as a video analyst during the [[1983\u201384 NHL season|1984 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], culminating in the Oilers' first Stanley Cup championship, and the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] as an assistant coach under [[Bob Pulford]] from 1984 to 1987. From 1995 to 1997 he was an assistant coach for the [[St. Louis Blues]].\n\nDuring the [[1987\u201388 NHL season|1987\u201388]] and [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1988\u201389]] seasons, Neilson did not coach but worked as a television analyst for hockey coverage on [[NHL on TSN|TSN]].\n\n===Retirement from hockey===\nNeilson had gone on medical leave from the Flyers just before the 2000 playoffs for cancer treatment but was later informed that he had been permanently replaced by [[Craig Ramsay]]. Neilson's unceremonious dismissal by Flyers General Manager [[Bobby Clarke]] was widely lamented by fans and media as lacking class and respect. Neilson's doctors advised the Flyers that he lacked the strength to perform his duties as head coach. Neilson insisted on trying to return at the end of the first round of the playoffs. At the end of the season, Neilson was dismissed as head coach. He later conceded Clarke did the right thing, and he never served as a head coach again.\n\nNeilson was then hired as an assistant coach of the Senators. For the last two games of the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]], which were inconsequential to the standings, Head Coach [[Jacques Martin (ice hockey)|Jacques Martin]] stepped away from the bench, allowing Neilson to take the reins and become the ninth man to coach 1000 games. The following season, the Senators won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] as the first place team in the league and made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals. As it was well known that Neilson's cancer was [[terminal illness|terminal]] when the Senators were eliminated in a tough seven game series, several players expressed their sadness at not being able to win the Stanley Cup for Neilson before he died.\n\nNeilson's overall regular season record was 460 wins, 378 losses, 159 ties, and 3 overtime losses.\n\n===Coaching legacy===\nNeilson dedicated his entire life to coaching and to hockey and affected the careers of thousands. He had no family and would stay up late into the night watching video and analysing games.\n\nAmong his most well-known innovations was the use of [[Video cassette recorder|videotape]] to analyze other teams, leading to the nickname \"Captain Video\". He was also the first to use microphone headsets to communicate with his assistant coaches.\n\nIn situations where the face off was in the opposition's end and there were perhaps three or less seconds to go in the first and/or second period, Neilson would pull his goaltender for an extra attacker for a potential shot on net off the ensuing face-off.  His reasoning was that if the other team gained possession of the puck, it would be virtually impossible for the opposition to score from their end in the mere seconds that were left.  No other coach would consider this radical move, and it was indicative of his innovative thinking.\n\nNeilson was well known for closely reading the rule book looking to exploit [[loopholes]]. During one particular game in his first season coaching the Petes, he was down two men in a [[five on three|5-on-3]] situation for the last minute of the game. Realizing that more penalties could not be served under the existing rules, Neilson put too many men on the ice every ten seconds. The referees stopped the play and a faceoff was held relieving pressure on the defence. In addition, Neilson also took advantage of fans throwing objects onto the ice to deliberately cause stoppages of play late in a game. After these displays, the rules were changed so that a call for too many men on the ice in a 5-on-3 situation, or a delay-of-game penalty in a 5-on-3 situation, or any deliberate act to stop play (i.e., objects thrown on the ice, or the net being intentionally dislodged), in the last two minutes of regulation or in overtime now results in a [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]].\n\nNeilson also discovered that if he put a defenceman in net instead of a goaltender during a penalty shot, the defenceman could rush the attacker and cut down the latter's angle of shot, greatly reducing the chances of a goal. In 1968, he used this information in an OHL game between Neilson's Peterborough Petes and the opposing [[Toronto Marlboros]]. Neilson replaced Petes goaltender Pete Kostek with defenseman [[Ron Stackhouse]]. Stackhouse successfully blocked Frank Hamill's penalty shot attempt by charging out as soon as Hamill crossed the blue line.<ref>{{cite news|title=Penalty shot bid blocked by defenceman|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-qUtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5J8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4070%2C6460564|accessdate=30 January 2015|agency=The Canadian Press|publisher=The Montreal Gazette|date=Sep 27, 1968}}</ref><ref name=kay>{{cite web|last1=Kay|first1=Jason|title=NFL has Deflategate, did the NHL have Coffeegate?|url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/nfl-has-deflategate-did-the-nhl-have-coffeegate/|website=thehockeynews.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> Today the rules states that a team must use a goaltender in net for a penalty shot and that the goaltender cannot leave the crease until the skater has touched the puck.\n\nOne game during a time-out, Neilson told his goaltender, \u201c...when we pull you, just leave your goal stick lying in the crease.\u201d When the other team gained possession, they sent the puck the length of the ice toward the open net, only to deflect wide when it hit the goal stick lying in the crease.

Canucks fans [[Towel Power|waved white towels by the thousands]] at the next game, a playoff tradition that continues to this day and is widely copied by other hockey teams.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McIndoe|first1=Sean|title=NHL Grab Bag: Everyone in Toronto Seems Extremely Chill About Clarkson\u2019s First Goal|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nhl-grab-bag-everyone-in-toronto-seems-extremely-chill-about-clarksons-first-goal/|accessdate=March 28, 2017|publisher=Grantland.com|date=November 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Life after hockey==\nNeilson was awarded a [[Doctor of Laws]] by McMaster University in 2001 (see below). He was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] as a builder in November 2002. He was also appointed as a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] {CM} in 2002. The City of Peterborough renamed George Street South ''Roger Neilson Way'' opposite the Memorial Centre Arena in 2003; the address of the Arena was supposed to be changed to ''1 Roger Neilson Way''. The Ottawa Senators have named their coaches office at [[Scotiabank Place]] ''The Roger Neilson Room''. The City of Ottawa renamed their Minor Peewee AAA Hockey Division after Neilson in 2005. Also in 2005, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] created an award for the top academic player attending college or university and named it the [[Roger Neilson Memorial Award]].\n\nIn 1999, Neilson was diagnosed with [[bone cancer]], which spread to become [[skin cancer]] in 2001. He died on June 21, 2003, only five days after his 69th birthday, and the funeral was held in Northview Pentecostal Church in Peterborough.<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2003/06/21/neilson_obit_ap/</ref>\n\nShortly after his death, the Ottawa Senators Foundation<ref name=\"Sens Foundation\">{{cite web|title=Roger Neilson House|url=http://www.sensfoundation.com/what-we-do/rogerneilsonhouse/|publisher=Ottawa Senators Foundation|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> announced plans to build \"Roger's House\" (French: \"La maison de Roger\"), later renamed Roger Neilson House, a pediatric palliative care facility built in his memory on the grounds of the [[Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario]] in Ottawa.<ref name=\"Rogers House\">{{cite web|title=Memory of former Sens coach lives on at newly renamed Roger Neilson House|url=http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6728210-memory-of-former-sens-coach-lives-on-at-newly-renamed-roger-neilson-house/|publisher=Ottawa Community News|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=17 June 2016}}</ref> The building was opened on April 21, 2006, by the [[Premier of Ontario]], [[Dalton McGuinty]].\n\nIn September 2004, Roger Neilson Public School, a new elementary school in Peterborough, opened.
