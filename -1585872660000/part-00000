At this moment, soldier rushed in and reported that the enemies were approaching. The chef, knowing he had no time to cook the sheep, cut out ten pieces of thin meat with a knife, and stirred them into boiling water.

There are two versions of how Little Sheep is created in Baotou. One theory is that Zhang Gang developed a method of eating hotpot without cooking, so he opened a hotpot restaurant with a few friends that grew wildly popular. Another theory is that Zhang Gang and a friend had a meal together and found out that the hot pot was delicious and easy to promote, so he spent a lot of money to buy the hot pot base receipt and began to develop the little sheep hot pot. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.795.com.cn/wz/48859.html|title=\u5f20\u94a2\uff0c\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a\u7684\u9910\u996e\u5e1d\u56fd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFinally, Zhang Gang and others worked out a recipe for Little Sheep. Before opening the restaurant, everyone was worried about what to name the restaurant. One day, Zhang Gang casually said \"Little Sheep\", and his daughter-in-law immediately said: \"The name is good, and it is related to mutton lamb. I'm sure I can't forget it after eating, and it's easy to remember.\" And then, \"Little Sheep\" was born.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn August 8, 1999, the first \"Little Sheep\" of the \"Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd.\" was opened at No.22 Wulan Road, Kun District, [[Baotou]]City.

This allows the founders of Little Sheep to see the hope to start the chain-store operation. They started to open more Little Sheep restaurants in out countries in China since April 2000.

In addition, the special smell of raw lamb is not accepted by southerners in China, so lamb mutton was regional. \"Little Sheep\" has made innovations on the basis of traditional\"instant-boiled mutton\", pioneering the method of \"simmering mutton without dipped in ingredients\": a pot-base soup made from dozens of nourishing condiments. By changing cumbersome ingredients, this method removes the special smell of lamb while retaining its delicious flavor.

Xilinguole Grassland(\u9521\u6797\u90ed\u52d2\u8349\u539f) is located in [[Inner Mongolia]]. Xilinguole grassland has become one of the world's four most famous grasslands due to its wide range of types of flora and fauna. Its rich aquatic plants provide sufficient natural food for sheep without supplementary feeding. Xilinguole grassland has high-quality natural grassland area of more than 180,000 square kilometers and a unique geographical position of 45 \u00b0 north latitude, which has created the natural quality of pastures and bred fertile Mongolian sheep, such as well-known \"Wuzhumuqin Sheep(\u4e4c\u73e0\u7a46\u6c81\u7f8a)\", \"Sunite Sheep(\u82cf\u5c3c\u7279\u7f8a)\", and \"Wulatetan Sheep(\u4e4c\u62c9\u7279\u6ee9\u7f8a)\". only six-month-old lamb will be selected, because the meat is fresh and tender, not smelly or stale. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Menu ==\nThe Little Sheep has been serving high-quality lamb, beef, and other specials. Signatures include Lamb-lover Platter, Signature AAA Lamb Rolls, Mongolian Style Roasted Lamb Shank, Premium Beef Cube, Premium Grain Feb Beef New Zealand Origin, Handmade Squid Paste with Fish Caviar, and so on.

Another theory is that Zhang Gang and a friend had a meal together and found out that the hot pot was delicious and easy to promote, so he spent a lot of money to buy the hot pot base receipt and began to develop the little sheep hot pot. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.795.com.cn/wz/48859.html|title=\u5f20\u94a2\uff0c\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a\u7684\u9910\u996e\u5e1d\u56fd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFinally, Zhang Gang and others worked out a recipe for Little Sheep. Before opening the restaurant, everyone was worried about what to name the restaurant. One day, Zhang Gang casually said \"Little Sheep\", and his daughter-in-law immediately said: \"The name is good, and it is related to mutton lamb. I'm sure I can't forget it after eating, and it's easy to remember.\" And then, \"Little Sheep\" was born.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn August 8, 1999, the first \"Little Sheep\" of the \"Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd.\" was opened at No.22 Wulan Road, Kun District, [[Baotou]]City. It is such a small shop. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.795.com.cn/wz/70185.html|title=\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b|last=|first=|date=|website=\u77a7\u8fd9\u7f51|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\nDue to the good operation of the first Little Sheep restaurant, founders successfully opened two Little Sheep Hot Pot restaurants in Qingshan District and Donghe District of Baotou City two months later, and the business was equally well. This allows the founders of Little Sheep to see the hope to start the chain-store operation. They started to open more Little Sheep restaurants in out countries in China since April 2000. In early 2001, the Little Sheep meat product processing base was established.\n\nIn May 2001, [[Shanghai]] branch of Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was established (there are currently 30 direct investment restaurants). \n\nIn January 2002, the [[Beijing]] branch of Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was established (there are currently 15 direct investment restaurants).\n[[File:Little_Sheep_Coquitlam.jpg|thumb|380x380px|Little Sheep in Coquitlam]]\nIn January 2002, [[Shenzhen]] branch of Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was established (there are currently 18 direct investment restaurants). \n\nIn November 2002, Little Sheep Hotpot Store was opened in [[Chengdu]], entered the most competitive hotpot market in China, and challenged Sichuan hotpot brands. It achieved the income record of 170,000 yuan one day. \n\nIn January 2003, the Little Sheep Condiment Base was established.\n\nIn November 2003, Little Sheep's first overseas chain store opened in [[Los Angeles]], USA. \n\nIn September 2004, Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. ranked among the Top 500 Chinese companies.\n\nOn November 12, 2004, \"LITTLE SHEEP\" and its logo were recognized as China Famous [[Trademark|Trade Mark.]]\n\nOn October 12, 2005, the first directly operated store were opened in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]].\n\nIn June 2006, it was again selected as \"China's 500 Most Valuable Brands\" with a brand value of 5.677 billion Yuan.\n\nOn June 22, 2007, Little Sheep was selected for the third time as the \"China's 500 Most Valuable Brands\" and was ranked in 104th place in the Top 500 Chinese companies with a brand value of 5.916 billion Yuan.\n\nOn November 11, 2007, at the fourth annual of Top 100 Chinese Restaurants Awards in [[New York City|New York]], USA, it won three honors: Chinese Best 100 Local Cuisine, Chinese Best 100 New Restaurant, and Chinese Best 100 Healthy Cuisine.\n\nOn June 12, 2008, Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was successfully listed in [[Hong Kong]]\n\nUntil January 2010, Little Sheep Company had a total of more than 60,000 employees, drove more than 240,000 people in related employment, and increased more than 200,000 farmers and herdsmen's income.  <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Acquisition by Yum!

In addition, the special smell of raw lamb is not accepted by southerners in China, so lamb mutton was regional. \"Little Sheep\" has made innovations on the basis of traditional\"instant-boiled mutton\", pioneering the method of \"simmering mutton without dipped in ingredients\": a pot-base soup made from dozens of nourishing condiments. By changing cumbersome ingredients, this method removes the special smell of lamb while retaining its delicious flavor.

Xilinguole grassland has become one of the world's four most famous grasslands due to its wide range of types of flora and fauna. Its rich aquatic plants provide sufficient natural food for sheep without supplementary feeding. Xilinguole grassland has high-quality natural grassland area of more than 180,000 square kilometers and a unique geographical position of 45 \u00b0 north latitude, which has created the natural quality of pastures and bred fertile Mongolian sheep, such as well-known \"Wuzhumuqin Sheep(\u4e4c\u73e0\u7a46\u6c81\u7f8a)\", \"Sunite Sheep(\u82cf\u5c3c\u7279\u7f8a)\", and \"Wulatetan Sheep(\u4e4c\u62c9\u7279\u6ee9\u7f8a)\". only six-month-old lamb will be selected, because the meat is fresh and tender, not smelly or stale. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Menu ==\nThe Little Sheep has been serving high-quality lamb, beef, and other specials. Signatures include Lamb-lover Platter, Signature AAA Lamb Rolls, Mongolian Style Roasted Lamb Shank, Premium Beef Cube, Premium Grain Feb Beef New Zealand Origin, Handmade Squid Paste with Fish Caviar, and so on.
