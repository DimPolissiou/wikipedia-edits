Khyal adds ornamental notes, shorter, moody and celebratory.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|p=152}}\n\nThe ancient practice of dancing on Dhrupad has been reintroduced into recent times by Dr. [[Puru Dadeech]].  Dr Dadheech is India's first [[Kathak]] dancer to bring back 'Dhrupad' on the formal Kathak stage and this composition in 28 matra.<ref>http://www.afternoondc.in/culture/sunil-performs-the-naayak-in-kathak/article_235028</ref>\n\n==Nature and practice==\n{{refimprove-section|date=December 2016}}\nDhrupad as we know it today is performed by a solo singer or a small number of singers in unison to the beat of the ''[[pakhavaj]]'' or ''[[mridang]]'' rather than the [[tabla]]. The vocalist is usually accompanied by two [[tanpura]]s, the players sitting close behind, with the percussionist at the right of the vocalist. Traditionally the primary instrument used for dhrupad has been the [[Rudra Veena]], but the [[surbahar]] and the [[sursringar]] have also long been used for this music. Preferably, any instrument used for dhrupad should have a deep bass register and long sustain.\n\nLike all [[Indian classical music]], dhrupad is [[Musical mode|modal]] and [[Monophony|monophonic]], with a single melodic line and no [[chord progression]]. Each [[raga]] has a [[modal frame]] - a wealth of micro-tonal ornamentations (''[[gamak]]'') are typical.\n\nThe text is preceded by a wholly improvised section, the ''[[alap]]''. The alap in dhrupad is sung using a set of [[syllable]]s, popularly thought to be derived from a [[mantra]], in a recurrent, set pattern: ''a re ne na, t\u00e9 te re ne na, ri re re ne na, te ne toom ne'' (this last group is used in the end of a long phrase). Dhrupad styles have long elaborate ''[[alap]]s'', their slow and deliberate melodic development gradually bringing an accelerating rhythmic pulse. In most styles of dhrupad singing it can easily last an hour, broadly subdivided into the ''alap'' proper (unmetered), the ''jor'' (with steady rhythm) and the ''jhala'' (accelerating strumming) or ''nomtom'', when syllables are sung at a very rapid pace. Then the composition is sung to the rhythmic accompaniment: the four lines, in serial order, are termed ''sthayi'', ''antara'', ''sanchari'' and ''aabhog''.\n\nCompositions exist in the metres (''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'') ''tivra'' (7 beats), ''sul'' (10 beats) and ''chau'' (12 beats) - a composition set to the 10-beat ''jhap'' tala is called a [[sadra (music)|sadra]] while one set to the 14-beat ''dhamar'' is called a ''[[Dhamar (music)|dhamar]]''. The latter is seen as a lighter musical form, associated with the [[Holi]] spring festival.\n\nAlongside concert performance the practice of singing dhrupad in temples continues, though only a small number of recordings have been made. It bears little resemblance to concert dhrupad: there is very little or no alap; percussion such as bells and finger cymbals, not used in the classical setting, are used here, and the drum used is a smaller, older variant called ''mrdang'', quite similar to the mridangam.\n\n==Family and style==\n{{refimprove-section|date=December 2016}}\nThere are said to be four broad stylistic variants (''vanis'' or ''banis'') of classical dhrupad \u2013 the Gauri (Gauhar), Khandar, Nauhar, and Dagar, tentatively linked to five singing styles (''geetis'') known from the 7th Century: Shuddha, Bhinna, Gauri, Vegswara, and Sadharani. But more importantly, there are a number of dhrupad ''[[gharana]]s'': \"houses\", or family styles. The best-known gharana is the Dagar family <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhrupad.info/dagar_brothers.htm|title= The Dagar family |website=The Dagar Brothers and the Dagar family|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref> who sing in the [[Dagar vani]] or Dagar gharana. The Dagar style puts great emphasis on alap and for several generations their singers have performed in pairs (often pairs of brothers). The Dagars are Muslims but sing Hindu texts of Gods and Goddesses. Some of the best dhrupad singers outside the Dagar family, such as [[Uday Bhawalkar]], [[Ritwik Sanyal]], [[Nirmalya Dey]] and the [[Gundecha Brothers]], also belong to the Dagar vani, as does instrumentalist Pushparaj Koshti, who plays the surbahar. The [[Bishnupur gharana]] features [[Manilal Nag]], among others.\n\nFrom the state of [[Bihar]] come the [[Darbhanga gharana]] and the [[Bettiah]] gharana. The Mallicks of the Darbhanga gharana are linked to the Khandar vani and Gauharvani. [[Ram Chatur Mallick]] (1902 - 1990), [[Vidur Mallick]] (1936 - 2002), [[Abhay Narayan Mallick]] (b. 1937), [[Laxman Bhatt Tailang]] (b.1928) and [[Siyaram Tiwari (musician)|Siyaram Tiwari]] (1919 - 1998) were well known exponents of Darbhanga gharana in the last century. Dhrupad of the Darbhanga gharana has a strong representation in [[Vrindaban]] owing to late Pandit Vidur Mallik, who lived and taught in Vrindaban during the 1980s and 1990s. Great female Dhrupad artists include [[Asgari Bai]] (1918 - 2006), [[Alaka Lahiri]], [[Ashok Nandy]] (b.1946), [[Madhu Bhatt Tailang]], the Pakistani singer [[Alisha Rasheed]] (b. 1978) and the Italian singer [[Amelia Cuni]] (b.1958). <ref> [[Selina Sharma|Thielemann, Selina]]; [https://www.bookdepository.com/Dharbanga-Tradition-Selina-Thielemann/9788186569016 ''The Darbhanga Tradition. Dhrupad in the school of Pandit Vidur Mallik''], Varanasi: Indica Books, 1997 </ref> \n\nThe Mishras practised Gaurhar, Dagur, Nauhar and Khandar styles. This gharana flourished under the patronage of the kings of [[Bettiah Raj]]. Pandit [[Falguni Mitra]] is an exponent of this [[Gharana]] in the present generation.\n\n==Seminars==\n[[ITC Sangeet Research Academy]]'s Scientific Research Department, in their effort to link tradition to scientific methodologies, has been organizing symposia and workshops from 1987. The objective of these workshops/symposia is to create awareness of research in various fields of music.<ref>https://www.itcsra.org/Seminar-and-Workshops</ref>  In 2013 they have conducted Dhrupad Seminar in association with [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)]] (NCPA, Mumbai) where Dr. Puru Dadheech participated as speaker to discuss the origin and predecessors of Dhrupad.<ref>https://www.itcsra.org/pdf/sra2013programme_1.pdf</ref>  Prof. Richard Widdess (Head, Department of Music, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, UK) and Dr. Puru Dadheech, (Indore, India) discussed the origin of Dhrupad at length.

Then the composition is sung to the rhythmic accompaniment: the four lines, in serial order, are termed ''sthayi'', ''antara'', ''sanchari'' and ''aabhog''.\n\nCompositions exist in the metres (''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'') ''tivra'' (7 beats), ''sul'' (10 beats) and ''chau'' (12 beats) - a composition set to the 10-beat ''jhap'' tala is called a [[sadra (music)|sadra]] while one set to the 14-beat ''dhamar'' is called a ''[[Dhamar (music)|dhamar]]''. The latter is seen as a lighter musical form, associated with the [[Holi]] spring festival.\n\nAlongside concert performance the practice of singing dhrupad in temples continues, though only a small number of recordings have been made. It bears little resemblance to concert dhrupad: there is very little or no alap; percussion such as bells and finger cymbals, not used in the classical setting, are used here, and the drum used is a smaller, older variant called ''mrdang'', quite similar to the mridangam.\n\n==Family and style==\n{{refimprove-section|date=December 2016}}\nThere are said to be four broad stylistic variants (''vanis'' or ''banis'') of classical dhrupad \u2013 the Gauri (Gauhar), Khandar, Nauhar, and Dagar, tentatively linked to five singing styles (''geetis'') known from the 7th Century: Shuddha, Bhinna, Gauri, Vegswara, and Sadharani. But more importantly, there are a number of dhrupad ''[[gharana]]s'': \"houses\", or family styles. The best-known gharana is the Dagar family <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhrupad.info/dagar_brothers.htm|title= The Dagar family |website=The Dagar Brothers and the Dagar family|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref> who sing in the [[Dagar vani]] or Dagar gharana. The Dagar style puts great emphasis on alap and for several generations their singers have performed in pairs (often pairs of brothers). The Dagars are Muslims but sing Hindu texts of Gods and Goddesses. Some of the best dhrupad singers outside the Dagar family, such as [[Uday Bhawalkar]], [[Ritwik Sanyal]], [[Nirmalya Dey]] and the [[Gundecha Brothers]], also belong to the Dagar vani, as does instrumentalist Pushparaj Koshti, who plays the surbahar. The [[Bishnupur gharana]] features [[Manilal Nag]], among others.\n\nFrom the state of [[Bihar]] come the [[Darbhanga gharana]] and the [[Bettiah]] gharana. The Mallicks of the Darbhanga gharana are linked to the Khandar vani and Gauharvani. [[Ram Chatur Mallick]] (1902 - 1990), [[Vidur Mallick]] (1936 - 2002), [[Abhay Narayan Mallick]] (b. 1937), [[Laxman Bhatt Tailang]] (b.1928) and [[Siyaram Tiwari (musician)|Siyaram Tiwari]] (1919 - 1998) were well known exponents of Darbhanga gharana in the last century. Dhrupad of the Darbhanga gharana has a strong representation in [[Vrindaban]] owing to late Pandit Vidur Mallik, who lived and taught in Vrindaban during the 1980s and 1990s. Great female Dhrupad artists include [[Asgari Bai]] (1918 - 2006), [[Alaka Lahiri]], [[Ashok Nandy]] (b.1946) , [[Madhu Bhatt Tailang]], the Pakistani singer [[Alisha Rasheed]] (b. 1978) and the Italian singer [[Amelia Cuni]] (b.1958). <ref> [[Selina Sharma|Thielemann, Selina]]; [https://www.bookdepository.com/Dharbanga-Tradition-Selina-Thielemann/9788186569016 ''The Darbhanga Tradition. Dhrupad in the school of Pandit Vidur Mallik''], Varanasi: Indica Books, 1997 </ref> \n\nThe Mishras practised Gaurhar, Dagur, Nauhar and Khandar styles. This gharana flourished under the patronage of the kings of [[Bettiah Raj]]. Pandit [[Falguni Mitra]] is an exponent of this [[Gharana]] in the present generation.\n\n==Seminars==\n[[ITC Sangeet Research Academy]]'s Scientific Research Department, in their effort to link tradition to scientific methodologies, has been organizing symposia and workshops from 1987. The objective of these workshops/symposia is to create awareness of research in various fields of music.<ref>https://www.itcsra.org/Seminar-and-Workshops</ref>  In 2013 they have conducted Dhrupad Seminar in association with [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)]] (NCPA, Mumbai) where Dr. Puru Dadheech participated as speaker to discuss the origin and predecessors of Dhrupad.<ref>https://www.itcsra.org/pdf/sra2013programme_1.pdf</ref>  Prof. Richard Widdess (Head, Department of Music, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, UK) and Dr. Puru Dadheech, (Indore, India) discussed the origin of Dhrupad at length.

Jake confesses to the Na'vi that he was a spy, and they take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac\u00f3n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but Grace is shot by Quaritch during the escape.\n\nTo regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred [[Fictional universe in Avatar#The Tree of Souls|Tree of Souls]] and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace.

Jake confesses to the Na'vi that he was a spy, and they take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac\u00f3n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but Grace is shot by Quaritch during the escape.\n\nTo regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred [[Fictional universe in Avatar#The Tree of Souls|Tree of Souls]] and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed.

Quaritch organizes a [[Preemptive war|pre-emptive strike]] against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives.

Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an [[mecha|AMP suit]], escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time.\n\nWith the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth.

The equation was first introduced by [[Harry Bateman]] in 1915<ref>Bateman, H. (1915). Some recent researches on the motion of fluids. Monthly Weather Review, 43(4), 163-170.</ref><ref>Whitham, G. B.

A mathematical model illustrating the theory of turbulence. In Advances in applied mechanics (Vol. 1, pp. 171-199). Elsevier.</ref>\n\nFor a given field <math>u(x,t)</math> and [[diffusion coefficient]] (or ''kinematic viscosity'', as in the original fluid mechanical context) <math>\\nu</math>, the general form of Burgers' equation (also known as '''viscous Burgers' equation''') in one space dimension is the [[dissipative system]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\nu\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}.</math>\n\nWhen the diffusion term is absent (i.e. <math>\\nu=0</math>), Burgers' equation becomes the '''inviscid Burgers' equation''':\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0,</math>\n\nwhich is a prototype for [[conservation law|conservation equations]] that can develop discontinuities ([[shock wave]]s). The previous equation is the ''advective form'' of the Burgers' equation. The ''conservative form'' is found to be more useful in numerical integration\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial u^2}{\\partial x} = 0.</math>\n\n== Inviscid Burgers' equation==\n[[Image:Inviscid Burgers Equation in Two Dimensions.gif|right|frame|This is a numerical simulation of the inviscid Burgers Equation in two space variables up until the time of shock formation.]]\n\nThe inviscid Burgers' equation is a [[conservation law|conservation equation]], more generally a first order quasilinear [[hyperbolic equation]]. The solution to the equation and along with the initial condition\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad u(x,0) = f(x)</math> \n\ncan be constructed by the [[method of characteristics]]. The characteristic equations are\n\n:<math>\\frac{dx}{dt} = u, \\quad \\frac{du}{dt}=0.</math>\n\nIntegration of the second equation tells us that <math>u</math> is constant along the characteristic and integration of the first equation shows that the characteristics are straight lines, i.e.,\n\n:<math>u=c, \\quad x = ut + \\xi </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\xi</math> is the point (or parameter) on the ''x''-axis (''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) of the ''x''-''t'' plane from which the characteristic curve is drawn. Since at the point, the velocity is known from the initial condition and the fact that this value is unchanged as we move along the characteristic emanating from that point, we write <math>u=c=f(\\xi)</math> on that characteristic. Therefore, the trajectory of that characteristic is\n\n:<math>x=f(\\xi) t+ \\xi.</math>\n\nThus, the solution is given by\n\n:<math>u(x,t) = f(\\xi) = f(x-ut), \\quad \\xi = x - f(\\xi) t.</math>\n\nThis is an implicit relation that determines the solution of the inviscid Burgers' equation provided characteristics don't intersect.  If the characteristics do intersect, then a classical solution to the PDE does not exist and leads to the formation of a [[shock wave]]. In fact, the ''breaking time'' before a shock wave can be formed is given by\n\n:<math>t_b = \\frac{-1}{\\min f'(x)}.</math>\n\n===Complete integral===\n\n[[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] provided the explicit solution in 1943 (''[[:s:On the Decay of Plane Shock Waves|On the decay of plane shock waves]]'') when the initial condition  is linear, i.e., <math>f(x)=ax + b</math>, where a and b are constants.<ref>Chandrasekhar, S. (1943). On the decay of plane shock waves (No. 423). Ballistic Research Laboratories.</ref> The explicit solution is\n\n:<math>u(x,t) = \\frac{ax+b}{at+1}.</math>\n\nThis solution is  also the ''[[First-order partial differential equation#general integral and complete integral|complete integral]]'' of the inviscid Burgers' equation because it contains as many arbitrary constants as the number of independent variables appearing in the equation.<ref>Forsyth, A. R. (1902). A treatise on differential equations. </ref> Explicit solutions for other relevant initial conditions are, in general, not known.\n\n==Viscous Burgers' equation==\n\n[[Image:Solution of the viscous two dimensional Burgers equation.gif|thumbnail|This is a numerical solution of the viscous two dimensional Burgers equation using an initial Gaussian profile.

Violet is a [[spectral color]] \u2013 it occupies its own place at the end of the [[spectrum of light]] first identified by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1672, and it has its own wavelength (approximately 380\u2013420&nbsp;nm) \u2013 whereas purple is a combination of two spectral colors, red and blue.

(In fact, the only monochromatic colors of light that can be produced by this color system are the red, green, and blue that define it.) However, the system is capable of approximating it due to the fact that the L-cone (red cone) in the eye is uniquely sensitive to two different discontinuous regions in the [[Visible spectrum|visible]] spectrum \u2013 its primary region being the long wavelength light of the yellow-red region of the spectrum, and a secondary smaller region overlapping with the S-cone (blue cone) in the shortest wavelength, violet part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3/theory_of_color.html|title=Theory of color|work=ucla.edu}}</ref> This means that when violet light strikes the eye, the S-cone should be stimulated strongly, and the L-cone stimulated weakly along with it. By lighting the red primary of the display weakly along with the blue primary, a relatively similar pattern of sensitization can be achieved, creating an illusion, the sensation of extremely short wavelength light using what is in fact mixed light of two longer wavelengths. The resulting color has the same [[hue]] as pure violet; however, it has a lower [[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturation]].\n\nOne [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] difference between purple and violet is their appearance with an increase in [[luminance]] (apparent brightness). Violet, as it brightens, looks more and more blue. The same effect does not happen with purple. This is the result of what is known as the [[Bezold\u2013Br\u00fccke shift]].\n\nWhile the scientific definitions of violet and purple are clear, the cultural definitions are more varied.

These works have been dated to between 16,000 and 25,000 BC.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs-pigments dans les mains des peuples'', p. 144\u2013146</ref>\n\nAs early as the 15th century BC the citizens of [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], two cities on the coast of Ancient [[Phoenicia]], (present day Lebanon), were producing purple dye from a sea snail called the [[Bolinus brandaris|spiny dye-murex]].<ref name=\"Ball, Philip p. 290\">Ball, Philip, ''Bright Earth; Art and the Invention of Colour''.  p. 290</ref>  Clothing colored with the Tyrian dye was mentioned in both the ''[[Iliad]]'' of [[Homer]] and the ''[[Aeneid]]''  of [[Virgil]].<ref name=\"Ball, Philip p. 290\" /> The deep, rich purple dye made from this snail became known as Tyrian purple.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs-pigments dans les mains des peuples'', p. 135\u2013138</ref>\n\nThe process of making the dye was long, difficult and expensive. Thousands of the tiny snails had to be found, their shells cracked, the snail removed. Mountains of empty shells have been found at the ancient sites of Sidon and Tyre.  The snails were left to soak, then a tiny gland was removed and the juice extracted and put in a basin, which was placed in the sunlight. There, a remarkable transformation took place. In the sunlight the juice turned white, then yellow-green, then green, then violet, then a red which turned darker and darker. The process had to be stopped at exactly the right time to obtain the desired color, which could range from a bright crimson to a dark purple, the color of dried blood. Then either wool, linen or silk would be dyed.  The exact hue varied between crimson and violet, but it was always rich, bright and lasting.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs-pigments dans les mains des peuples'', p. 135</ref>\n\nTyrian purple became the color of kings, nobles, priests and magistrates all around the Mediterranean. It was mentioned in the Old Testament; in the [[Book of Exodus]], God instructs [[Moses]] to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth \"of blue, and purple, and scarlet,\"<ref>KJV Book of Exodus 25:4</ref> to be used in the curtains of the [[Tabernacle]] and the garments of priests. The term used for purple in the 4th-century [[Latin Vulgate]] version of the Bible passage is ''purpura'' or Tyrian purple.<ref>http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2025&version=VULGATE| Bible Gateway, Vulgate Bible  (retrieved December 23, 2012)</ref> In the ''[[Iliad]]'' of [[Homer]], the belt of [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] is purple, and the tails of the horses of Trojan warriors are dipped in purple. In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the blankets on the wedding bed of [[Odysseus]] are purple. In the poems of [[Sappho]] (6th century BC) she celebrates the skill of the dyers of the Greek kingdom of [[Lydia]] who made purple footwear, and in the play of [[Aeschylus]] (525\u2013456 BC), Queen [[Clytemnestra]] welcomes back her husband [[Agamemnon]] by decorating the palace with purple carpets. In 950 BC, [[King Solomon]] was reported to have brought artisans from Tyre to provide purple fabrics to decorate the [[Temple of Jerusalem]].<ref>Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p.&nbsp;136</ref>\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] (when giving imperial audiences as the [[basileus]] of the [[Macedonian Empire]]), the basileus of the [[Seleucid Empire]], and the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|kings of Ptolemaic Egypt]] all wore Tyrian purple.\n\nThe Roman custom of wearing purple [[togas]] may have come from the [[Etruscans]]; an Etruscan tomb painting from the 4th century BC shows a nobleman wearing a deep purple and embroidered toga.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the ''Toga praetexta'' was an ordinary white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border. It was worn by freeborn Roman boys who had not yet come of age,<ref>Liv. xxiv. 7, 2. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref> [[Magistratus Curulis|curule magistrates]],<ref>cf. Cic. ''post red. in Sen.'' 5, 12.

As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''</ref>  and a few other categories of citizens.\n\nThe ''Toga picta'' was solid purple, embroidered with gold. During the [[Roman Republic]], it was worn by generals in their [[Roman triumph|triumphs]], and by the [[Praetor Urbanus]] when he rode in the chariot of the gods into the circus at the [[Ludi Apollinares]].<ref>cf. Liv. v. 41, 2. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  During the Empire, the ''toga picta'' was worn by magistrates giving public [[gladiator]]ial games, and by the [[consul]]s, as well as by the emperor on special occasions.\n\nDuring the Roman Republic, when a triumph was held, the general being honored wore an entirely purple toga bordered in gold, and Roman Senators wore a toga with a purple stripe. However, during the [[Roman Empire]], purple was more and more associated exclusively with the emperors and their officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmdtkw.org/VPurple.html |title=Tyrian Purple in Ancient Rome |publisher=Mmdtkw.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref> Suetonius claims that the early emperor [[Caligula]] had the [[Ptolemy of Mauretania|King of Mauretania]] murdered for the splendour of his purple cloak, and that [[Nero]] forbade the use of certain purple dyes.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/suetonius/12caesars/home.html|title=The Lives of the Twelve Caesars|last=Suetonius|series=Loeb Classical Library|publisher=Heinemann|publication-date=1914|year=121|translator-last=Rolfe|translator-first=John Carew|translator-link=John Carew Rolfe|language=Latin, English|accessdate=2017-03-28}}</ref> In the late empire the sale of purple cloth became a state monopoly protected by the death penalty.<ref name=\"Marzano2013\">{{cite book|author=Annalisa Marzano|title=Harvesting the Sea: The Exploitation of Marine Resources in the Roman Mediterranean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ0oAAAAQBAJ|date=1 August 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-967562-3|page=150}}</ref>\n\n[[Jesus Christ]], in the hours leading up to his crucifixion, was dressed in purple (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1: ''porphura'') by the Roman garrison to mock his claim to be 'King of the Jews'.<ref>Mark 15:17 and 20</ref>\n\nThe actual color of Tyrian purple seems to have varied from a reddish to a bluish purple. According to the Roman writer [[Vitruvius]], (1st century BC), the murex coming from northern waters, probably [[murex brandaris]], produced a more bluish color than those of the south, probably [[murex trunculus]]. The most valued shades were said to be those closer to the color of dried blood, as seen in the mosaics of the robes of the [[Emperor Justinian]] in [[Ravenna]]. The chemical composition of the dye from the murex is close to that of the dye from [[indigo]], and indigo was sometimes used to make a counterfeit Tyrian purple, a crime which was severely punished. What seems to have mattered about Tyrian purple was not its color, but its luster, richness, its resistance to weather and light, and its high price.<ref>John Gage (2009), ''La Couleur dans l'art'', p.&nbsp;148\u2013150.</ref>\n\nIn modern times, Tyrian purple has been recreated, at great expense. When the German chemist, Paul Friedander, tried to recreate Tyrian purple in 2008, he needed twelve thousand mollusks to create 1.4 ounces of dye, enough to color a handkerchief. In the year 2000, a gram of Tyrian purple made from ten thousand mollusks according to the original formula, cost two thousand euros.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques'', p.&nbsp;163</ref><ref>Phillip Ball (2001), ''Bright Earth, Art, and the Invention of Colour'', p.&nbsp;291</ref>\n\n==== China ====\nIn ancient China, purple was obtained not through the Mediterranean mollusc, but [[Lithospermum erythrorhizon|purple gromwell]].  The dye obtained did not easily adhere to fabrics, making purple fabrics expensive.  Purple became a fashionable color in the state of Qi (\u9f4a) because its ruler developed a preference for it.  As a result, the price of a purple spoke of fabric was in excess of five times that of a plain spoke.  His minister, Guan Zhong (\u7ba1\u4ef2), eventually convinced him to relinquish this preference.\n\nPurple was regarded as a secondary color in ancient China.  In classical times, secondary colors were not as highly prized as the five primary colors of the Chinese spectrum, and purple was used to allude to impropriety, compared to crimson, which was deemed a primary color and thus symbolized legitimacy.  Nevertheless, by the 6th Century, purple was ranked above crimson.  Several changes to the ranks of colors occurred after that time.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Egyptian - Faience Bowl - Walters 48451 - Interior.jpg|An Egyptian bowl colored with Egyptian blue, with motifs painted in dark manganese purple.

[[Gospels|Gospel]] [[manuscript]]s were written in gold lettering on [[parchment]] that was colored Tyrian purple.<ref>Varichon, Anne ''Colors:What They Mean and How to Make Them'' New York:2006 Abrams Page 140 \u2013 This information is in the caption of a [[color printing|color]] illustration showing an 8th-century manuscript page of the [[Gospel of Luke]] written in gold on Tyrian purple parchment.</ref>\nEmpresses gave birth in the Purple Chamber, and the emperors born there were known as \"born to the purple,\" to separate them from emperors who won or seized the title through political intrigue or military force. Bishops of the Byzantine church wore white robes with stripes of purple, while government officials wore squares of purple fabric to show their rank.\n\nIn western Europe, the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] was crowned in 800 wearing a mantle of Tyrian purple, and was buried in 814 in a shroud of the same color, which still exists (see below). However, after the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, the color lost its imperial status. The great dye works of Constantinople were destroyed, and gradually [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]], made with dye from the [[cochineal]] insect, became the royal color in Europe.<ref>Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p.&nbsp;137\u201338</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Empress Theodora.jpg|The Empress Theodora, the wife of the Emperor Justinian, dressed in Tyrian purple.

Dutton, ''Cochineal: A Bright Red Animal Dye'', p.&nbsp;57., http://www.cochineal.info/pdf/Ch-5-History-Dyes-Dying-Industry-Old-World-Cochineal-Industry.pdf</ref> since the dye from Byzantium was no longer available. Bishops and archbishops, of a lower status than cardinals, were assigned the color purple, but not the rich Tyrian purple. They wore cloth dyed first with the less expensive [[indigo]] blue, then overlaid with red made from [[kermes (dye)|kermes]] dye.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques'', p.&nbsp;165.</ref><ref>Elena Phipps, ''Cochineal red: The art history of a color'', p.&nbsp;26.</ref>\n\nWhile purple was worn less frequently by Medieval and [[Renaissance]] kings and princes, it was worn by the professors of many of Europe's new universities.  Their robes were modeled after those of the clergy, and they often wore square violet or purple caps and robes, or black robes with purple trim. Purple robes were particularly worn by students of divinity.\n\nPurple and violet also played an important part in the religious paintings of the Renaissance.  Angels and the [[Virgin Mary]] were often portrayed wearing purple or violet robes.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Aquileia Basilica - Krypta Fresco Bischofsweihe Hermagoras.jpg|A 12th-century painting of [[Saint Peter]] consecrating [[Hermagoras of Aquileia|Hermagoras]], wearing purple, as a bishop.\nFile:Ghent Altarpiece D - Popes - Bishops.jpg|In the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' (1422) by [[Jan van Eyck]], the popes and bishops are wearing purple robes.\nFile:Rafael - Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o de Cristo (detalhe - anjo).jpg|A purple-clad angel from the ''Resurrection of Christ'' by Raphael (1483\u20131520)\n</gallery>\n\n=== 18th and 19th centuries ===\n\nIn the 18th century, purple was still worn on occasion by [[Catherine the Great]] and other rulers, by bishops and, in lighter shades, by members of the aristocracy, but rarely by ordinary people, because of its high cost. But in the 19th century, that changed.\n\nIn 1856, an eighteen-year-old British chemistry student named [[William Henry Perkin]] was trying to make a synthetic [[quinine]]. His experiments produced instead the first synthetic [[aniline dye]], a purple shade called [[mauveine]], shortened simply to [[mauve]]. It took its name from the mallow flower, which is the same color.<ref name=\"Grovier\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180801-tyrian-purple-the-regal-colour-taken-from-mollusc-mucus|title=Tyrian Purple: The disgusting origins of the colour purple|last=Grovier|first=Kelly|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref> The new color quickly became fashionable, particularly after [[Queen Victoria]] wore a silk gown dyed with mauveine to the Royal Exhibition of 1862. Prior to Perkin's discovery, mauve was a color which only the aristocracy and rich could afford to wear.

It was the first of a series of modern industrial dyes which completely transformed both the chemical industry and fashion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Garfield, S.|year=2000|title=Mauve: How One Man Invented a Colour That Changed the World |publisher=Faber and Faber, London, UK|isbn=978-0-571-20197-6}}</ref>\n\nPurple was popular with the [[pre-Raphaelite]] painters in Britain, including [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], who loved bright colors and romantic scenes.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Rokotov ekaterina.jpg|Portrait of Empress [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia, by [[Fyodor Rokotov]].

But at the same time, it was becoming associated with social change; with the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement for the right to vote for women in the early decades of the century, with [[Feminism]] in the 1970s, and with the [[psychedelic drug culture]] of the 1960s.\n\nIn the early 20th century, purple, green, and white were the colors of the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement, which fought to win the right to vote for women, finally succeeding with the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.  Later, in the 1970s, in a tribute to the Suffragettes, it became the color of the [[women's liberation movement]].<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques'', image 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn the concentration camps of [[Nazi Germany]], prisoners who were members of non-conformist religious groups, such as the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], were required to wear a [[purple triangle]].<ref>https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/knocking/holocaust.html</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, it was also associated with [[counterculture]], [[psychedelics]], and musicians like [[Jimi Hendrix]] with his 1967 song \"[[Purple Haze]]\", or the English [[psychedelic rock|rock]] band of [[Deep Purple]] which formed in 1968. Later, in the 1980s, it was featured in the song and album ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' (1984) by the American musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].\n\nThe [[Purple Rain Protest]] was a protest against [[apartheid]] that took place in [[Cape Town]], South Africa on 2 September 1989, in which a police [[water cannon]] with purple dye sprayed thousands of demonstrators. This led to the slogan ''The Purple Shall Govern''.\n\nThe violet or purple necktie became very popular at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, particularly among political and business leaders. It combined the assertiveness and confidence of a red necktie with the sense of peace and cooperation of a blue necktie, and it went well with the blue business suit worn by most national and corporate leaders.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eva Heller, Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques.</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Gustav Klimt 009.jpg|[[Gustav Klimt]] portrait of woman with a purple hat (1912).\nFile:George VI.jpg|[[George VI]] (1895\u20131952) wore purple in his official portrait.\nFile:Elizabeth and Philip 1953.jpg|The Coronation portrait of [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]] (1953) has three different shades of purple in the train, curtains and crown.\nFile:Official Program Woman Suffrage Procession - March 3, 1913.jpg|Program from the [[Woman Suffrage Procession]], a 1913 [[Women's Suffrage]] march.\nFile:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Votes for women pennant.jpg|A pennant from the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement in the state of [[Indiana]].\nFile:Feminism symbol.svg|Symbol of the [[Feminist]] movement in the United States (1970s).

For this reason, it is called a ''non-spectral color''.  It exists in culture and art, but not, in the same way that violet does, in optics. It is simply a combination, in various proportions, of two primary colors, red and blue.\n\nIn [[color theory]], a \"purple\" is defined as any [[Spectral color#Non-spectral colors|non-spectral color]] between [[Violet (color)|violet]] and red (excluding violet and red themselves).<ref name=\"gilbert\" /> The [[spectral color]]s violet and indigo are not purples according to color theory, but they are purples according to common English usage since they are perceived to be similar.\n\nIn the traditional color wheel long used by painters, purple is usually placed between crimson and violet.<ref>See ''Oxford English Dictionary'' definition</ref> In a slightly different variation, on the [[HSV color space|color wheel]], it is placed between magenta and violet. This shade is sometimes called electric purple (See [[shades of purple]]).<ref>Lanier F.

The standard [[HTML]] color purple is created by red and blue light of equal intensity, at a brightness that is halfway between full power and darkness.\n\nIn color printing, purple is sometimes represented by the color [[magenta]], or sometimes by mixing magenta with red or blue.  It can also be created by mixing just red and blue alone, but in that case the purple is less bright, with lower\nsaturation or intensity.  A less bright purple can also be created with light or paint by adding a certain quantity of the third primary color (green for light or yellow for pigment).\n\nOn a [[chromaticity diagram]], the straight line connecting the extreme spectral colors (red and violet) is known as the [[line of purples]] (or 'purple boundary'); it represents one limit of human [[Color vision|color perception]]. The color magenta used in the [[CMYK]] printing process is near the center of the line of purples, but most people associate the term \"purple\" with a somewhat bluer tone, such as is displayed by the color \"electric purple\" (a color also directly on the line of purples), shown below. Some common confusion exists concerning the [[color name]]s \"purple\" and \"violet\". Purple is a mixture of red and blue light, whereas violet is a [[spectral color]].\n\nOn the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE xy chromaticity diagram]], violet is on the curved edge in the lower left, while purples are on the straight line connecting the extreme colors red and violet; this line is known as the [[line of purples]], or the purple line.<ref>{{cite book|title = Digital video and HDTV|author = Charles A.

They were used by [[Neolithic]] artists in the form of sticks, like charcoal, or ground and powdered and mixed with fat, and used as a paint. Hematite is a reddish [[iron oxide]] which, when ground coarsely, makes a purple pigment. Manganese was also used in Roman times to color glass purple.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs-pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 146</ref>\n*[[Han purple]] was the first synthetic purple pigment, invented in China in about 700 BC. It was used in wall paintings and pottery and other applications.  In color, it was very close to [[indigo]], which had a similar chemical structure.  Han purple was very unstable, and sometimes was the result of the chemical breakdown of Han blue.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, artists usually made purple by combining red and blue pigments; most often blue azurite or lapis-lazuli with [[red ochre]], [[cinnabar]], or [[minium]]. They also combined lake colors made by mixing dye with powder; using [[woad]] or indigo dye for the blue, and dye made from [[cochineal]] for the red.<ref name=\"Anne Carichon 2000 p.&nbsp;133\" />\n\n*[[Cobalt violet]] was the first modern synthetic color in the purple family, manufactured in 1859. It was found, along with [[cobalt blue]], in the palette of [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Signac]], and [[Georges Seurat]].

Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century, when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.<ref>Anne Carichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples''. p.&nbsp;144.</ref>\n\nFrom the Middle Ages onward, purple and violet dyes for the clothing of common people were often made from the [[blackberry]] or other red fruit of the genus [[rubus]], or from the [[mulberry]].  All of these dyes were more reddish than bluish, and faded easily with washing and exposure to sunlight.\n\nA popular new dye which arrived in Europe from the New World during the Renaissance was made from the wood of the [[logwood]] tree (H''aematoxylum campechianum''), which grew in Spanish Mexico.  Depending on the different minerals added to the dye, it produced a blue, red, black or, with the addition of [[alum]], a purple color,  It made a good color, but, like earlier dyes, it did not resist sunlight or washing.\n\nIn the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes.  Two synthetic purple dyes were invented at about the same time. '''Cudbear''' is a [[dye]] extracted from [[orchil]] [[lichen]]s that can be used to dye [[wool]] and [[silk]], without the use of [[mordant]].  Cudbear was developed by Dr Cuthbert Gordon of [[Scotland]]: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of [[ammonium carbonate]]. The mixture is then cooled and [[ammonia]] is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3\u20134 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.\n\n'''French purple''' was developed in France at about the same time.  The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia. Then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated with [[calcium chloride]]; the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples.\n\n'''Cobalt violet''' is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the 19th century, and is made by a similar process as [[cobalt blue]], [[cerulean blue]]  and [[cobalt green]].  It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists.\n\n'''[[Mauveine]]''', also known as '''[[aniline]] purple''' and '''Perkin's [[mauve]]''', was the first synthetic [[organic chemistry|organic chemical]] [[dye]],<ref>{{cite journal\n| title=  History: 150 Years of mauveine\n| author= Hubner K\n| journal=  Chemie in Unserer Zeit\n| year=  2006\n| volume=  40\n| issue=  4\n| pages= 274\u2013275\n| doi= 10.1002/ciuz.200690054 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n| title=  Perkin's Mauve: Ancestor of the Organic Chemical Industry\n| author= Anthony S.

It produced a brilliant fuchsia color.\n\nIn the 1950s, a new family of purple and violet synthetic organic pigments called [[quinacridone]] came onto the market. It had originally been discovered in 1896, but were not synthetized until 1936, and not manufactured until the 1950s. The colors in the group range from deep red to bluish purple in color, and have the molecular formula C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>12</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

This phenomenon, long recognized by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and other painters, is called [[aerial perspective]] or atmospheric perspective. The more distant the mountains are, the less contrast the eye sees between the mountains and the sky.\n\nThe bluish color is caused by an optical effect called [[Rayleigh scattering]]. The sunlit sky is blue because [[air]] scatters short-[[wavelength]] light more than longer wavelengths. Since blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light. The result is that the human eye perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun.<ref>\"[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9062822 Rayleigh scattering].\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. 2007. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. 16 Nov. 2007.</ref>\n\nAt sunrise and sunset, the light is passing through the atmosphere at a lower angle, and traveling a greater distance through a larger volume of air. Much of the green and blue is scattered away, and more red light comes to the eye, creating the colors of the sunrise and sunset and making the mountains look purple.\n\nA [[List of Crayola crayon colors|Crayola]] crayon called Purple Mountains' Majesty (or Purple Mountain Majesty) is named after this natural phenomenon. It was first formulated in 1993.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Aerial perspective 1.JPG|The more distant mountains are, the lighter and more blue they are.

Violet is a [[spectral color]] \u2013 it occupies its own place at the end of the [[spectrum of light]] first identified by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1672, and it has its own wavelength (approximately 380\u2013420&nbsp;nm) \u2013 whereas purple is a combination of two spectral colors, red and blue. There is no such thing as the \"wavelength of purple light\"; it only exists as a combination.<ref name=gilbert>{{cite book|title=Physics in the Arts|author=P. U.P.

(In fact, the only monochromatic colors of light that can be produced by this color system are the red, green, and blue that define it.) However, the system is capable of approximating it due to the fact that the L-cone (red cone) in the eye is uniquely sensitive to two different discontinuous regions in the [[Visible spectrum|visible]] spectrum \u2013 its primary region being the long wavelength light of the yellow-red region of the spectrum, and a secondary smaller region overlapping with the S-cone (blue cone) in the shortest wavelength, violet part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3/theory_of_color.html|title=Theory of color|work=ucla.edu}}</ref> This means that when violet light strikes the eye, the S-cone should be stimulated strongly, and the L-cone stimulated weakly along with it. By lighting the red primary of the display weakly along with the blue primary, a relatively similar pattern of sensitization can be achieved, creating an illusion, the sensation of extremely short wavelength light using what is in fact mixed light of two longer wavelengths. The resulting color has the same [[hue]] as pure violet; however, it has a lower [[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturation]].\n\nOne [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] difference between purple and violet is their appearance with an increase in [[luminance]] (apparent brightness). Violet, as it brightens, looks more and more blue. The same effect does not happen with purple. This is the result of what is known as the [[Bezold\u2013Br\u00fccke shift]].\n\nWhile the scientific definitions of violet and purple are clear, the cultural definitions are more varied. The color known in antiquity as ''[[Tyrian purple]]'' ranged from crimson to a deep bluish-purple, depending upon how it was made. In France, purple is defined as \"a dark red, inclined toward violet\".<ref>''Le Grand Robert de la Langue Fran\u00e7aise'' (2001).</ref> The color called purple by the French, ''pourpre'', contains more red and half the amount of blue of the color called purple in the United States and the U.K. In German, this color is sometimes called ''Purpurrot'' (\"purple-red\") to avoid confusion.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques'', image 69 in French edition.</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Color icon violet v2.svg|The color violet\nFile:Color icon purple.svg|The color purple\nFile:Boutet 1708 color circles.jpg|In the traditional Boutet color circle (1708), purple is shown between crimson and violet\nFile:Heraldic Shield Purpure.svg|The French call the color on this shield ''pourpre'' (purple).

The artists of [[Pech Merle]] cave and other [[Neolithic]] sites in France used sticks of [[manganese]] and [[hematite]] powder to draw and paint animals and the outlines of their own hands on the walls of their caves. These works have been dated to between 16,000 and 25,000 BC.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs-pigments dans les mains des peuples'', p. 144\u2013146</ref>\n\nAs early as the 15th century BC the citizens of [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], two cities on the coast of Ancient [[Phoenicia]], (present day Lebanon), were producing purple dye from a sea snail called the [[Bolinus brandaris|spiny dye-murex]].<ref name=\"Ball, Philip p. 290\">Ball, Philip, ''Bright Earth; Art and the Invention of Colour''.  p. 290</ref>  Clothing colored with the Tyrian dye was mentioned in both the ''[[Iliad]]'' of [[Homer]] and the ''[[Aeneid]]''  of [[Virgil]].<ref name=\"Ball, Philip p. 290\" /> The deep, rich purple dye made from this snail became known as Tyrian purple.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs-pigments dans les mains des peuples'', p. 135\u2013138</ref>\n\nThe process of making the dye was long, difficult and expensive. Thousands of the tiny snails had to be found, their shells cracked, the snail removed. Mountains of empty shells have been found at the ancient sites of Sidon and Tyre.  The snails were left to soak, then a tiny gland was removed and the juice extracted and put in a basin, which was placed in the sunlight. There, a remarkable transformation took place. In the sunlight the juice turned white, then yellow-green, then green, then violet, then a red which turned darker and darker. The process had to be stopped at exactly the right time to obtain the desired color, which could range from a bright crimson to a dark purple, the color of dried blood. Then either wool, linen or silk would be dyed.  The exact hue varied between crimson and violet, but it was always rich, bright and lasting.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs-pigments dans les mains des peuples'', p. 135</ref>\n\nTyrian purple became the color of kings, nobles, priests and magistrates all around the Mediterranean. It was mentioned in the Old Testament; in the [[Book of Exodus]], God instructs [[Moses]] to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth \"of blue, and purple, and scarlet,\"<ref>KJV Book of Exodus 25:4</ref> to be used in the curtains of the [[Tabernacle]] and the garments of priests. The term used for purple in the 4th-century [[Latin Vulgate]] version of the Bible passage is ''purpura'' or Tyrian purple.<ref>http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2025&version=VULGATE| Bible Gateway, Vulgate Bible  (retrieved December 23, 2012)</ref> In the ''[[Iliad]]'' of [[Homer]], the belt of [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] is purple, and the tails of the horses of Trojan warriors are dipped in purple. In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the blankets on the wedding bed of [[Odysseus]] are purple. In the poems of [[Sappho]] (6th century BC) she celebrates the skill of the dyers of the Greek kingdom of [[Lydia]] who made purple footwear, and in the play of [[Aeschylus]] (525\u2013456 BC), Queen [[Clytemnestra]] welcomes back her husband [[Agamemnon]] by decorating the palace with purple carpets. In 950 BC, [[King Solomon]] was reported to have brought artisans from Tyre to provide purple fabrics to decorate the [[Temple of Jerusalem]].<ref>Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p.&nbsp;136</ref>\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] (when giving imperial audiences as the [[basileus]] of the [[Macedonian Empire]]), the basileus of the [[Seleucid Empire]], and the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|kings of Ptolemaic Egypt]] all wore Tyrian purple.\n\nThe Roman custom of wearing purple [[togas]] may have come from the [[Etruscans]]; an Etruscan tomb painting from the 4th century BC shows a nobleman wearing a deep purple and embroidered toga.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the ''Toga praetexta'' was an ordinary white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border.

According to the Roman writer [[Vitruvius]], (1st century BC), the murex coming from northern waters, probably [[murex brandaris]], produced a more bluish color than those of the south, probably [[murex trunculus]]. The most valued shades were said to be those closer to the color of dried blood, as seen in the mosaics of the robes of the [[Emperor Justinian]] in [[Ravenna]]. The chemical composition of the dye from the murex is close to that of the dye from [[indigo]], and indigo was sometimes used to make a counterfeit Tyrian purple, a crime which was severely punished. What seems to have mattered about Tyrian purple was not its color, but its luster, richness, its resistance to weather and light, and its high price.<ref>John Gage (2009), ''La Couleur dans l'art'', p.&nbsp;148\u2013150.</ref>\n\nIn modern times, Tyrian purple has been recreated, at great expense. When the German chemist, Paul Friedander, tried to recreate Tyrian purple in 2008, he needed twelve thousand mollusks to create 1.4 ounces of dye, enough to color a handkerchief. In the year 2000, a gram of Tyrian purple made from ten thousand mollusks according to the original formula, cost two thousand euros.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques'', p.&nbsp;163</ref><ref>Phillip Ball (2001), ''Bright Earth, Art, and the Invention of Colour'', p.&nbsp;291</ref>\n\n==== China ====\nIn ancient China, purple was obtained not through the Mediterranean mollusc, but [[Lithospermum erythrorhizon|purple gromwell]].  The dye obtained did not easily adhere to fabrics, making purple fabrics expensive.  Purple became a fashionable color in the state of Qi (\u9f4a) because its ruler developed a preference for it.  As a result, the price of a purple spoke of fabric was in excess of five times that of a plain spoke.  His minister, Guan Zhong (\u7ba1\u4ef2), eventually convinced him to relinquish this preference.\n\nPurple was regarded as a secondary color in ancient China.  In classical times, secondary colors were not as highly prized as the five primary colors of the Chinese spectrum, and purple was used to allude to impropriety, compared to crimson, which was deemed a primary color and thus symbolized legitimacy.  Nevertheless, by the 6th Century, purple was ranked above crimson.  Several changes to the ranks of colors occurred after that time.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Egyptian - Faience Bowl - Walters 48451 - Interior.jpg|An Egyptian bowl colored with Egyptian blue, with motifs painted in dark manganese purple.

[[Gospels|Gospel]] [[manuscript]]s were written in gold lettering on [[parchment]] that was colored Tyrian purple.<ref>Varichon, Anne ''Colors:What They Mean and How to Make Them'' New York:2006 Abrams Page 140 \u2013 This information is in the caption of a [[color printing|color]] illustration showing an 8th-century manuscript page of the [[Gospel of Luke]] written in gold on Tyrian purple parchment.</ref>\nEmpresses gave birth in the Purple Chamber, and the emperors born there were known as \"born to the purple,\" to separate them from emperors who won or seized the title through political intrigue or military force. Bishops of the Byzantine church wore white robes with stripes of purple, while government officials wore squares of purple fabric to show their rank.\n\nIn western Europe, the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] was crowned in 800 wearing a mantle of Tyrian purple, and was buried in 814 in a shroud of the same color, which still exists (see below). However, after the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, the color lost its imperial status. The great dye works of Constantinople were destroyed, and gradually [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]], made with dye from the [[cochineal]] insect, became the royal color in Europe.<ref>Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p.&nbsp;137\u201338</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Empress Theodora.jpg|The Empress Theodora, the wife of the Emperor Justinian, dressed in Tyrian purple.

Bishops and archbishops, of a lower status than cardinals, were assigned the color purple, but not the rich Tyrian purple.

Their robes were modeled after those of the clergy, and they often wore square violet or purple caps and robes, or black robes with purple trim. Purple robes were particularly worn by students of divinity.\n\nPurple and violet also played an important part in the religious paintings of the Renaissance.  Angels and the [[Virgin Mary]] were often portrayed wearing purple or violet robes.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Aquileia Basilica - Krypta Fresco Bischofsweihe Hermagoras.jpg|A 12th-century painting of [[Saint Peter]] consecrating [[Hermagoras of Aquileia|Hermagoras]], wearing purple, as a bishop.\nFile:Ghent Altarpiece D - Popes - Bishops.jpg|In the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' (1422) by [[Jan van Eyck]], the popes and bishops are wearing purple robes.\nFile:Rafael - Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o de Cristo (detalhe - anjo).jpg|A purple-clad angel from the ''Resurrection of Christ'' by Raphael (1483\u20131520)\n</gallery>\n\n=== 18th and 19th centuries ===\n\nIn the 18th century, purple was still worn on occasion by [[Catherine the Great]] and other rulers, by bishops and, in lighter shades, by members of the aristocracy, but rarely by ordinary people, because of its high cost. But in the 19th century, that changed.\n\nIn 1856, an eighteen-year-old British chemistry student named [[William Henry Perkin]] was trying to make a synthetic [[quinine]]. His experiments produced instead the first synthetic [[aniline dye]], a purple shade called [[mauveine]], shortened simply to [[mauve]]. It took its name from the mallow flower, which is the same color.<ref name=\"Grovier\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180801-tyrian-purple-the-regal-colour-taken-from-mollusc-mucus|title=Tyrian Purple: The disgusting origins of the colour purple|last=Grovier|first=Kelly|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref> The new color quickly became fashionable, particularly after [[Queen Victoria]] wore a silk gown dyed with mauveine to the Royal Exhibition of 1862.

But at the same time, it was becoming associated with social change; with the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement for the right to vote for women in the early decades of the century, with [[Feminism]] in the 1970s, and with the [[psychedelic drug culture]] of the 1960s.\n\nIn the early 20th century, purple, green, and white were the colors of the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement, which fought to win the right to vote for women, finally succeeding with the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.  Later, in the 1970s, in a tribute to the Suffragettes, it became the color of the [[women's liberation movement]].<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques'', image 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn the concentration camps of [[Nazi Germany]], prisoners who were members of non-conformist religious groups, such as the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], were required to wear a [[purple triangle]].<ref>https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/knocking/holocaust.html</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, it was also associated with [[counterculture]], [[psychedelics]], and musicians like [[Jimi Hendrix]] with his 1967 song \"[[Purple Haze]]\", or the English [[psychedelic rock|rock]] band of [[Deep Purple]] which formed in 1968. Later, in the 1980s, it was featured in the song and album ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' (1984) by the American musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].\n\nThe [[Purple Rain Protest]] was a protest against [[apartheid]] that took place in [[Cape Town]], South Africa on 2 September 1989, in which a police [[water cannon]] with purple dye sprayed thousands of demonstrators. This led to the slogan ''The Purple Shall Govern''.\n\nThe violet or purple necktie became very popular at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, particularly among political and business leaders. It combined the assertiveness and confidence of a red necktie with the sense of peace and cooperation of a blue necktie, and it went well with the blue business suit worn by most national and corporate leaders.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eva Heller, Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques.</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Gustav Klimt 009.jpg|[[Gustav Klimt]] portrait of woman with a purple hat (1912).\nFile:George VI.jpg|[[George VI]] (1895\u20131952) wore purple in his official portrait.\nFile:Elizabeth and Philip 1953.jpg|The Coronation portrait of [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]] (1953) has three different shades of purple in the train, curtains and crown.\nFile:Official Program Woman Suffrage Procession - March 3, 1913.jpg|Program from the [[Woman Suffrage Procession]], a 1913 [[Women's Suffrage]] march.\nFile:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Votes for women pennant.jpg|A pennant from the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement in the state of [[Indiana]].\nFile:Feminism symbol.svg|Symbol of the [[Feminist]] movement in the United States (1970s).

For this reason, it is called a ''non-spectral color''.  It exists in culture and art, but not, in the same way that violet does, in optics. It is simply a combination, in various proportions, of two primary colors, red and blue.\n\nIn [[color theory]], a \"purple\" is defined as any [[Spectral color#Non-spectral colors|non-spectral color]] between [[Violet (color)|violet]] and red (excluding violet and red themselves).<ref name=\"gilbert\" /> The [[spectral color]]s violet and indigo are not purples according to color theory, but they are purples according to common English usage since they are perceived to be similar.\n\nIn the traditional color wheel long used by painters, purple is usually placed between crimson and violet.<ref>See ''Oxford English Dictionary'' definition</ref> In a slightly different variation, on the [[HSV color space|color wheel]], it is placed between magenta and violet. This shade is sometimes called electric purple (See [[shades of purple]]).<ref>Lanier F.

The standard [[HTML]] color purple is created by red and blue light of equal intensity, at a brightness that is halfway between full power and darkness.\n\nIn color printing, purple is sometimes represented by the color [[magenta]], or sometimes by mixing magenta with red or blue.  It can also be created by mixing just red and blue alone, but in that case the purple is less bright, with lower\nsaturation or intensity.  A less bright purple can also be created with light or paint by adding a certain quantity of the third primary color (green for light or yellow for pigment).\n\nOn a [[chromaticity diagram]], the straight line connecting the extreme spectral colors (red and violet) is known as the [[line of purples]] (or 'purple boundary'); it represents one limit of human [[Color vision|color perception]]. The color magenta used in the [[CMYK]] printing process is near the center of the line of purples, but most people associate the term \"purple\" with a somewhat bluer tone, such as is displayed by the color \"electric purple\" (a color also directly on the line of purples), shown below. Some common confusion exists concerning the [[color name]]s \"purple\" and \"violet\". Purple is a mixture of red and blue light, whereas violet is a [[spectral color]].\n\nOn the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE xy chromaticity diagram]], violet is on the curved edge in the lower left, while purples are on the straight line connecting the extreme colors red and violet; this line is known as the [[line of purples]], or the purple line.<ref>{{cite book|title = Digital video and HDTV|author = Charles A.

They were used by [[Neolithic]] artists in the form of sticks, like charcoal, or ground and powdered and mixed with fat, and used as a paint. Hematite is a reddish [[iron oxide]] which, when ground coarsely, makes a purple pigment. Manganese was also used in Roman times to color glass purple.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs-pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 146</ref>\n*[[Han purple]] was the first synthetic purple pigment, invented in China in about 700 BC. It was used in wall paintings and pottery and other applications.  In color, it was very close to [[indigo]], which had a similar chemical structure.  Han purple was very unstable, and sometimes was the result of the chemical breakdown of Han blue.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, artists usually made purple by combining red and blue pigments; most often blue azurite or lapis-lazuli with [[red ochre]], [[cinnabar]], or [[minium]]. They also combined lake colors made by mixing dye with powder; using [[woad]] or indigo dye for the blue, and dye made from [[cochineal]] for the red.<ref name=\"Anne Carichon 2000 p.&nbsp;133\" />\n\n*[[Cobalt violet]] was the first modern synthetic color in the purple family, manufactured in 1859. It was found, along with [[cobalt blue]], in the palette of [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Signac]], and [[Georges Seurat]].

(See history section above).<ref name=\"StClair\" />\n\nIn western [[Polynesia]], residents of the islands made a purple dye similar to Tyrian purple from the [[sea urchin]].  In Central America, the inhabitants made a dye from a different sea snail, the [[Purpura (gastropod)|purpura]], found on the coasts of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Nicaragua]].  The [[Mayans]] used this color to dye fabric for religious ceremonies, while the [[Aztecs]] used it for paintings of ideograms, where it symbolized royalty.<ref name=\"Anne Carichon 2000 p.&nbsp;133\">Anne Carichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples''. p.&nbsp;133.</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages, those who worked with blue and black dyes belonged to separate guilds from those who worked with red and yellow dyes, and were often forbidden to dye any other colors than those of their own guild.<ref name=\"StClair2\">{{Cite book|title=The Secret Lives of Colour|last=St. Clair|first=Kassia|publisher=John Murray|year=2016|isbn=9781473630819|location=London|page=211|oclc=936144129}}</ref>  Most purple fabric was made by the dyers who worked with red, and who used dye from [[Rubia|madder]] or [[cochineal]], so Medieval violet colors were inclined toward red.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n[[Orcein]], or ''purple moss'', was another common purple dye. It was known to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, and was made from a Mediterranean [[lichen]] called archil or dyer's moss ([[Roccella tinctoria]]), combined with an [[ammoniac]], usually urine. Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century, when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.<ref>Anne Carichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples''. p.&nbsp;144.</ref>\n\nFrom the Middle Ages onward, purple and violet dyes for the clothing of common people were often made from the [[blackberry]] or other red fruit of the genus [[rubus]], or from the [[mulberry]].  All of these dyes were more reddish than bluish, and faded easily with washing and exposure to sunlight.\n\nA popular new dye which arrived in Europe from the New World during the Renaissance was made from the wood of the [[logwood]] tree (H''aematoxylum campechianum''), which grew in Spanish Mexico.  Depending on the different minerals added to the dye, it produced a blue, red, black or, with the addition of [[alum]], a purple color,  It made a good color, but, like earlier dyes, it did not resist sunlight or washing.\n\nIn the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes.  Two synthetic purple dyes were invented at about the same time. '''Cudbear''' is a [[dye]] extracted from [[orchil]] [[lichen]]s that can be used to dye [[wool]] and [[silk]], without the use of [[mordant]].  Cudbear was developed by Dr Cuthbert Gordon of [[Scotland]]: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of [[ammonium carbonate]]. The mixture is then cooled and [[ammonia]] is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3\u20134 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.\n\n'''French purple''' was developed in France at about the same time.  The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia. Then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated with [[calcium chloride]]; the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples.\n\n'''Cobalt violet''' is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the 19th century, and is made by a similar process as [[cobalt blue]], [[cerulean blue]]  and [[cobalt green]].  It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists.\n\n'''[[Mauveine]]''', also known as '''[[aniline]] purple''' and '''Perkin's [[mauve]]''', was the first synthetic [[organic chemistry|organic chemical]] [[dye]],<ref>{{cite journal\n| title=  History: 150 Years of mauveine\n| author= Hubner K\n| journal=  Chemie in Unserer Zeit\n| year=  2006\n| volume=  40\n| issue=  4\n| pages= 274\u2013275\n| doi= 10.1002/ciuz.200690054 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n| title=  Perkin's Mauve: Ancestor of the Organic Chemical Industry\n| author= Anthony S.

This phenomenon, long recognized by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and other painters, is called [[aerial perspective]] or atmospheric perspective. The more distant the mountains are, the less contrast the eye sees between the mountains and the sky.\n\nThe bluish color is caused by an optical effect called [[Rayleigh scattering]]. The sunlit sky is blue because [[air]] scatters short-[[wavelength]] light more than longer wavelengths. Since blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light. The result is that the human eye perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun.<ref>\"[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9062822 Rayleigh scattering].\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. 2007. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. 16 Nov. 2007.</ref>\n\nAt sunrise and sunset, the light is passing through the atmosphere at a lower angle, and traveling a greater distance through a larger volume of air. Much of the green and blue is scattered away, and more red light comes to the eye, creating the colors of the sunrise and sunset and making the mountains look purple.\n\nA [[List of Crayola crayon colors|Crayola]] crayon called Purple Mountains' Majesty (or Purple Mountain Majesty) is named after this natural phenomenon. It was first formulated in 1993.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Aerial perspective 1.JPG|The more distant mountains are, the lighter and more blue they are.

[[Catholic bishop|Bishops]] were assigned the color [[Amaranth (color)#Amaranth purple|amaranth]], being a pale and pinkish purple made then from a less-expensive mixture of indigo and cochineal.\n\nIn the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic liturgy]], purple symbolizes [[penitence]]; [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] and [[Catholic priest]]s wear a purple [[stole (vestment)|stole]] when they hear [[confession]] and a purple stole and [[chasuble]] during [[Advent]] and [[Lent]].
