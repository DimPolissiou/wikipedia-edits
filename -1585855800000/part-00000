They did not have the vibration, smell, and noise associated with gasoline cars. They also did not require gear changes. (While steam-powered cars also had no gear shifting, they suffered from long start-up times of up to 45 minutes on cold mornings.) The cars were also preferred because they did not require a manual effort to start, as did gasoline cars which featured a hand crank to start the engine.\n\nElectric cars found popularity among well-heeled customers who used them as [[city cars]], where their limited range proved to be even less of a disadvantage.  Electric cars were often marketed as suitable vehicles for women drivers due to their ease of operation; in fact, early electric cars were stigmatized by the perception that they were \"women's cars\", leading some companies to affix radiators to the front to disguise the car's propulsion system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[File:Detroit Eletric ad 1912.jpg|thumb|1912 [[Detroit Electric]] advertisement]]\n\nAcceptance of electric cars was initially hampered by a lack of power infrastructure, but by 1912, many homes were wired for electricity, enabling a surge in the popularity of the cars. In the United States by the turn of the century, 40 percent of automobiles were powered by steam, 38 percent by electricity, and 22 percent by gasoline. A total of 33,842 electric cars were registered in the United States, and the U.S. became the country where electric cars had gained the most acceptance.<ref name=Britannica>{{citation|url= https://www.britannica.com/technology/automobile/Early-electric-automobiles |title=Automobile |accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref> Most early electric vehicles were massive, ornate carriages designed for the upper-class customers that made them popular. They featured luxurious interiors and were replete with expensive materials. Sales of electric cars peaked in the early 1910s.\n\nIn order to overcome the limited operating range of electric vehicles, and the lack of recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896.<ref name=HistEV/> The concept was first put into practice by [[Hartford Electric Light Company]] through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Wagon Company cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.<ref name=HistEV>{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=David A.|title=The Electric Vehicle and the Burden of History|url=https://archive.org/details/electricvehicleb0000kirs|url-access=registration|location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]], and London| year = 2000| pages= [https://archive.org/details/electricvehicleb0000kirs/page/153 153\u2013162]| publisher =[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn= 0-8135-2809-7}}</ref>\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-21519-0005, Neue Fahrzeuge der Deutschen Post.jpg|thumb|[[East German]] electric vans of the [[Deutsche Post of the GDR|Deutsche Post]] in 1953]]\n\nAfter enjoying success at the beginning of the 20th century, the electric car began to lose its position in the automobile market. A number of developments contributed to this situation. By the 1920s an improved road infrastructure required vehicles with a greater range than that offered by electric cars. Worldwide discoveries of large [[petroleum]] reserves led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline, making gas-powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Electric cars were limited to urban use by their slow speed (no more than 24\u201332&nbsp;km/h or 15\u201320&nbsp;mph<ref name= Britannica/>) and low range (50\u201365&nbsp;km or 30\u201340 miles<ref name=Britannica/>), and gasoline cars were now able to travel farther and faster than equivalent electrics.\n\nGasoline cars became even easier to operate thanks to the invention of the [[electric starter]] by [[Charles Kettering]] in 1912,<ref Name=R1>{{cite web|title=The Voltec System - Energy Storage and Electric Propulsion|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262004450_The_Voltec_System_Energy_Storage_and_Electric_Propulsion|last1=Matthe|first1=Roland|last2=Eberle|first2=Ulrich|date=2014-01-01|accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref> which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the [[muffler]], which [[Milton O.

Finally, [[Assembly line|the initiation of mass production]] of gas-powered vehicles by [[Henry Ford]] brought their price down.<ref>{{cite web |last=McMahon |first=D. |title=Some EV History / History of Electric Cars and Other Vehicles |publisher=Econogics |url= http://www.econogics.com/ev/evhistry.htm |date=13 November 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2013 }}</ref> By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.<ref name=aboutcom/>\n\n[[File:Kilowatt.jpg|thumb|The [[Henney Kilowatt]], a 1961 production electric car]]\n\nMost electric car makers stopped production at some point in the 1910s.

They did not have the vibration, smell, and noise associated with gasoline cars. They also did not require gear changes. (While steam-powered cars also had no gear shifting, they suffered from long start-up times of up to 45 minutes on cold mornings.) The cars were also preferred because they did not require a manual effort to start, as did gasoline cars which featured a hand crank to start the engine.\n\nElectric cars found popularity among well-heeled customers who used them as [[city cars]], where their limited range proved to be even less of a disadvantage.  Electric cars were often marketed as suitable vehicles for women drivers due to their ease of operation; in fact, early electric cars were stigmatized by the perception that they were \"women's cars\", leading some companies to affix radiators to the front to disguise the car's propulsion system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[File:Detroit Eletric ad 1912.jpg|thumb|1912 [[Detroit Electric]] advertisement]]\n\nAcceptance of electric cars was initially hampered by a lack of power infrastructure, but by 1912, many homes were wired for electricity, enabling a surge in the popularity of the cars. In the United States by the turn of the century, 40 percent of automobiles were powered by steam, 38 percent by electricity, and 22 percent by gasoline. A total of 33,842 electric cars were registered in the United States, and the U.S. became the country where electric cars had gained the most acceptance.<ref name=Britannica>{{citation|url= https://www.britannica.com/technology/automobile/Early-electric-automobiles |title=Automobile |accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref> Most early electric vehicles were massive, ornate carriages designed for the upper-class customers that made them popular. They featured luxurious interiors and were replete with expensive materials. Sales of electric cars peaked in the early 1910s.\n\nIn order to overcome the limited operating range of electric vehicles, and the lack of recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896.<ref name=HistEV/> The concept was first put into practice by [[Hartford Electric Light Company]] through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Wagon Company cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.<ref name=HistEV>{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=David A.|title=The Electric Vehicle and the Burden of History|url=https://archive.org/details/electricvehicleb0000kirs|url-access=registration|location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]], and London| year = 2000| pages= [https://archive.org/details/electricvehicleb0000kirs/page/153 153\u2013162]| publisher =[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn= 0-8135-2809-7}}</ref>\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-21519-0005, Neue Fahrzeuge der Deutschen Post.jpg|thumb|[[East German]] electric vans of the [[Deutsche Post of the GDR|Deutsche Post]] in 1953]]\n\nAfter enjoying success at the beginning of the 20th century, the electric car began to lose its position in the automobile market. A number of developments contributed to this situation. By the 1920s an improved road infrastructure required vehicles with a greater range than that offered by electric cars. Worldwide discoveries of large [[petroleum]] reserves led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline, making gas-powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Electric cars were limited to urban use by their slow speed (no more than 24\u201332&nbsp;km/h or 15\u201320&nbsp;mph<ref name= Britannica/>) and low range (50\u201365&nbsp;km or 30\u201340 miles<ref name=Britannica/>), and gasoline cars were now able to travel farther and faster than equivalent electrics.\n\nGasoline cars became even easier to operate thanks to the invention of the [[electric starter]] by [[Charles Kettering]] in 1912,<ref Name=R1>{{cite web|title=The Voltec System - Energy Storage and Electric Propulsion|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262004450_The_Voltec_System_Energy_Storage_and_Electric_Propulsion|last1=Matthe|first1=Roland|last2=Eberle|first2=Ulrich|date=2014-01-01|accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref> which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the [[muffler]], which [[Milton O.

Fuel-starved European countries fighting in World War II experimented with electric cars such as the British [[milk float]]s and the French [[Br\u00e9guet Aviation]] car, but overall, while [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] development progressed at a brisk pace, electric vehicle technology stagnated. In the late 1950s, Henney Coachworks and the National Union Electric Company, makers of Exide batteries, formed a joint venture to produce a new electric car, the [[Henney Kilowatt]], based on the French [[Renault Dauphine]].

Its [[declination]] reaches a maximum  equal to the angle of Earth's [[axial tilt]] (23.44\u00b0)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2015/Astronomical_Constants_2015.pdf |page=K6\u2013K7 |title=Selected Astronomical Constants, 2015 (PDF) |date=2014 |publisher=US Naval Observatory }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2015/Astronomical_Constants_2015.txt |page=K6\u2013K7 |title=Selected Astronomical Constants, 2015 (TXT) |date=2014 |publisher=US Naval Observatory }}</ref> on the [[June solstice]], then decreases until reaching its minimum (\u221223.44\u00b0) on the [[December solstice]], when its value is the negative of the axial tilt. This variation produces the [[season]]s.\n\nA [[line chart|line graph]] of the Sun's declination during a year resembles a [[sine wave]] with an [[amplitude]] of 23.44\u00b0, but one lobe of the wave is several days longer than the other, among other differences.\n\nThe following phenomena would occur if Earth is a perfect [[spheroid|sphere]], in a [[circular orbit]] around the Sun, and if its axis is tilted 90\u00b0, so that the axis itself is on the [[orbital plane]] (similar to [[Uranus]]). At one date in the year, the Sun would be [[zenith|directly overhead]] at the [[North Pole]], so its declination would be +90\u00b0. For the next few months, the [[subsolar point]] would move toward the [[South Pole]] at constant speed, crossing the [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] at a constant rate, so that the solar declination would decrease ''linearly'' with time. Eventually, the Sun would be directly above the South Pole, with a declination of \u221290\u00b0; then it would start to move northward at a constant speed. Thus, the graph of solar declination, as seen from this highly tilted Earth, would resemble a [[triangle wave]] rather than a sine wave, [[zigzag]]ging between plus and minus 90\u00b0, with linear segments between the maxima and minima.\n\nIf the 90\u00b0 axial tilt is decreased, then the absolute maximum and minimum values of the declination would decrease, to equal the axial tilt. Also, the shapes of the maxima and minima on the graph would become less acute (\"pointy\"), being curved to resemble the maxima and minima of a sine wave. However, even when the axial tilt equals that of the actual Earth, the maxima and minima remain more acute than those of a sine wave.\n\nIn reality, [[Earth's orbit]] is [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]]. Earth moves more rapidly around the Sun near [[perihelion]], in early January, than near [[aphelion]], in early July. This makes processes like the variation of the solar declination happen faster in January than in July. On the graph, this makes the minima more acute than the maxima. Also, since perihelion and aphelion do not happen on the exact dates as the solstices, the maxima and minima are slightly asymmetrical. The rates of change before and after are not quite equal.\n\nThe graph of apparent solar declination is therefore different in several ways from a sine wave. Calculating it accurately involves some complexity, as shown below.\n\n===Calculations===\nThe declination of the [[Sun]], \u03b4<sub>\u2609</sub>, is the angle between the rays of the Sun and the plane of the Earth's equator. The Earth's [[axial tilt]] (called the ''obliquity of the ecliptic'' by astronomers) is the angle between the Earth's axis and a line perpendicular to the Earth's orbit.  The Earth's axial tilt changes slowly over thousands of years but its current value of about \u03b5 = 23\u00b026' is nearly constant, so the change in solar declination during one year is nearly the same as during the next year.\n\nAt the [[solstice]]s, the angle between the rays of the Sun and the plane of the Earth's equator reaches its maximum value of 23\u00b026'. Therefore, \u03b4<sub>\u2609</sub> = +23\u00b026' at the northern summer solstice and \u03b4<sub>\u2609</sub> = \u221223\u00b026' at the southern summer solstice.\n\nAt the moment of each [[equinox]], the center of the Sun appears to pass through the [[celestial equator]], and \u03b4<sub>\u2609</sub> is 0\u00b0.\n\nThe Sun's declination at any given moment is calculated by:\n\n:<math>\\delta_\\odot = \\arcsin \\left [ \\sin \\left ( -23.44^\\circ \\right ) \\cdot \\sin \\left ( EL \\right ) \\right ]</math>\n\nwhere EL is the [[ecliptic longitude]] (essentially, the Earth's position in its orbit). Since the Earth's [[orbital eccentricity]] is small, its orbit can be approximated as a circle which causes up to 1\u00b0 of error. The circle approximation means the EL would be 90\u00b0 ahead of the solstices in Earth's orbit (at the equinoxes), so that sin(EL) can be written as sin(90+NDS)=cos(NDS) where NDS is the number of days after the December solstice. By also using the approximation that arcsin[sin(d)\u00b7cos(NDS)] is close to d\u00b7cos(NDS), the following frequently used formula is obtained:\n\n:<math>\\delta_\\odot = - 23.44^\\circ \\cdot \\cos \\left [ \\frac{360^\\circ}{365} \\cdot \\left ( N + 10 \\right ) \\right ]</math>\n\nwhere N is the day of the year beginning with N=0 at midnight [[Universal Time]] (UT) as January 1 begins (i.e. the days part of the [[ordinal date]] \u22121).  The number 10, in (N+10), is the approximate number of days after the December solstice to January 1.   This equation overestimates the declination near the September equinox by up to +1.5\u00b0.  The sine function approximation by itself leads to an error of up to 0.26\u00b0 and has been discouraged for use in solar energy applications.<ref name=\"jenkins\" />  The 1971 Spencer formula<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Fourier series representation of the position of the sun\n|author=J.

They also correct the 23.44\u00b0 obliquity which changes very slightly with time. Corrections may also include the effects of the moon in offsetting the Earth's position from the center of the pair's orbit around the Sun. After obtaining the declination relative to the center of the Earth, a further correction for [[parallax]] is applied, which depends on the observer's distance away from the center of the Earth. This correction is less than 0.0025\u00b0. The error in calculating the position of the center of the Sun can be less than 0.00015\u00b0. For comparison, the Sun's width is about 0.5\u00b0.\n\n===Atmospheric refraction===\nThe declination calculations described above do not include the effects of the [[Atmospheric refraction|refraction]] of light in the atmosphere, which causes the apparent angle of elevation of the Sun as seen by an observer to be higher than the actual angle of elevation, especially at low Sun elevations.<ref name=\"jenkins\" />  For example, when the Sun is at an elevation of 10\u00b0, it appears to be at 10.1\u00b0. The Sun's declination can be used, along with its [[right ascension]], to calculate its azimuth and also its true elevation, which can then be corrected for refraction to give its apparent position.<ref name=\"jenkins\" /><ref  name=noaacalc/><ref>{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Refraction Approximation|url=http://www.srrb.noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/atmosrefr.gif|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Equation of time==\n[[Image:Equation of time.svg|thumb|right|210px|The equation of time \u2014 above the axis a sundial will appear fast relative to a clock showing local mean time, and below the axis a sundial will appear slow.]]\n{{Main|Equation of time}}\nIn addition to the annual north-south oscillation of the Sun's apparent position, corresponding to the variation of its declination described above, there is also a smaller but more complex oscillation in the east-west direction. This is caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis, and also by changes in the speed of its orbital motion around the Sun produced by the elliptical shape of the orbit. The principal effects of this east-west oscillation are variations in the timing of events such as sunrise and sunset, and in the reading of a [[sundial]] compared with a [[clock]] showing [[local mean time]]. As the graph shows, a sundial can be up to about 16 minutes fast or slow, compared with a clock. Since the Earth rotates at a mean speed of one degree every four minutes, relative to the Sun, this 16-minute displacement corresponds to a shift eastward or westward of about four degrees in the apparent position of the Sun, compared with its mean position. A westward shift causes the sundial to be ahead of the clock.\n\nSince the main effect of this oscillation concerns time, it is called the ''equation of time'', using the word \"equation\" in a somewhat archaic sense meaning \"correction\". The oscillation is measured in units of time, minutes and seconds, corresponding to the amount that a sundial would be ahead of a clock. The equation of time can be positive or negative.\n\n==Analemma==\n[[File:analemma.png|thumb|right|100px|An [[analemma]] with solar [[declination]] and [[equation of time]] to the same scale]]\n{{main|Analemma}}\n\nAn [[analemma]] is a diagram that shows the annual variation of the Sun's position on the [[celestial sphere]], relative to its mean position, as seen from a fixed location on Earth. (The word ''analemma'' is also occasionally, but rarely, used in other contexts.) It can be considered as an image of the Sun's apparent motion during a [[tropical year|year]], which resembles a figure-8. An analemma can be pictured by superimposing photographs taken at the same time of day, a few days apart for a [[year]].\n\nAn analemma can also be considered as a graph of the [[#Declination of the Sun as seen from Earth|Sun's declination]], usually plotted vertically, against the [[equation of time]], plotted horizontally. Usually, the scales are chosen so that equal distances on the diagram represent equal angles in both directions on the celestial sphere. Thus 4 minutes (more precisely 3 minutes, 56 seconds), in the equation of time, are represented by the same distance as 1\u00b0 in the [[declination]], since [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] at a mean speed of 1\u00b0 every 4 minutes, relative to the Sun.\n\nAn analemma is drawn as it would be seen in the sky by an observer looking upward. If [[north]] is shown at the top, then [[west]] is to the ''right''. This is usually done even when the analemma is marked on a geographical [[globe]], on which the continents, etc., are shown with west to the left.\n\nSome analemmas are marked to show the position of the Sun on the graph on various dates, a few days apart, throughout the year. This enables the analemma to be used to make simple analog computations of quantities such as the times and [[azimuth]]s of [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. Analemmas without date markings are used to correct the time indicated by [[sundial]]s.<ref>[[Sundial#Noon marks]]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ecliptic]]\n* [[Effect of Sun angle on climate]]\n* [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun]]\n* [[Solar azimuth angle]]\n* [[Solar elevation angle]]\n* [[Solar irradiance]]\n* [[Solar time]]\n* [[Sun path]]\n* [[Sunrise equation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/codesandalgorithms/spa/ Solar Position Algorithm], at National Renewable Energy Laboratory's [http://www.nrel.gov/rredc/ Renewable Resource Data Center] website.\n* [http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/2-properties-sunlight/sun-position-calculator Sun Position Calculator], at [http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom pveducation.org].

Its [[declination]] reaches a maximum  equal to the angle of Earth's [[axial tilt]] (23.44\u00b0)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2015/Astronomical_Constants_2015.pdf |page=K6\u2013K7 |title=Selected Astronomical Constants, 2015 (PDF) |date=2014 |publisher=US Naval Observatory }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2015/Astronomical_Constants_2015.txt |page=K6\u2013K7 |title=Selected Astronomical Constants, 2015 (TXT) |date=2014 |publisher=US Naval Observatory }}</ref> on the [[June solstice]], then decreases until reaching its minimum (\u221223.44\u00b0) on the [[December solstice]], when its value is the negative of the axial tilt. This variation produces the [[season]]s.\n\nA [[line chart|line graph]] of the Sun's declination during a year resembles a [[sine wave]] with an [[amplitude]] of 23.44\u00b0, but one lobe of the wave is several days longer than the other, among other differences.\n\nThe following phenomena would occur if Earth is a perfect [[spheroid|sphere]], in a [[circular orbit]] around the Sun, and if its axis is tilted 90\u00b0, so that the axis itself is on the [[orbital plane]] (similar to [[Uranus]]). At one date in the year, the Sun would be [[zenith|directly overhead]] at the [[North Pole]], so its declination would be +90\u00b0. For the next few months, the [[subsolar point]] would move toward the [[South Pole]] at constant speed, crossing the [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] at a constant rate, so that the solar declination would decrease ''linearly'' with time. Eventually, the Sun would be directly above the South Pole, with a declination of \u221290\u00b0; then it would start to move northward at a constant speed. Thus, the graph of solar declination, as seen from this highly tilted Earth, would resemble a [[triangle wave]] rather than a sine wave, [[zigzag]]ging between plus and minus 90\u00b0, with linear segments between the maxima and minima.\n\nIf the 90\u00b0 axial tilt is decreased, then the absolute maximum and minimum values of the declination would decrease, to equal the axial tilt. Also, the shapes of the maxima and minima on the graph would become less acute (\"pointy\"), being curved to resemble the maxima and minima of a sine wave. However, even when the axial tilt equals that of the actual Earth, the maxima and minima remain more acute than those of a sine wave.\n\nIn reality, [[Earth's orbit]] is [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]]. Earth moves more rapidly around the Sun near [[perihelion]], in early January, than near [[aphelion]], in early July. This makes processes like the variation of the solar declination happen faster in January than in July. On the graph, this makes the minima more acute than the maxima. Also, since perihelion and aphelion do not happen on the exact dates as the solstices, the maxima and minima are slightly asymmetrical. The rates of change before and after are not quite equal.\n\nThe graph of apparent solar declination is therefore different in several ways from a sine wave. Calculating it accurately involves some complexity, as shown below.\n\n===Calculations===\nThe declination of the [[Sun]], \u03b4<sub>\u2609</sub>, is the angle between the rays of the Sun and the plane of the Earth's equator. The Earth's [[axial tilt]] (called the ''obliquity of the ecliptic'' by astronomers) is the angle between the Earth's axis and a line perpendicular to the Earth's orbit.  The Earth's axial tilt changes slowly over thousands of years but its current value of about \u03b5 = 23\u00b026' is nearly constant, so the change in solar declination during one year is nearly the same as during the next year.\n\nAt the [[solstice]]s, the angle between the rays of the Sun and the plane of the Earth's equator reaches its maximum value of 23\u00b026'. Therefore, \u03b4<sub>\u2609</sub> = +23\u00b026' at the northern summer solstice and \u03b4<sub>\u2609</sub> = \u221223\u00b026' at the southern summer solstice.\n\nAt the moment of each [[equinox]], the center of the Sun appears to pass through the [[celestial equator]], and \u03b4<sub>\u2609</sub> is 0\u00b0.\n\nThe Sun's declination at any given moment is calculated by:\n\n:<math>\\delta_\\odot = \\arcsin \\left [ \\sin \\left ( -23.44^\\circ \\right ) \\cdot \\sin \\left ( EL \\right ) \\right ]</math>\n\nwhere EL is the [[ecliptic longitude]] (essentially, the Earth's position in its orbit). Since the Earth's [[orbital eccentricity]] is small, its orbit can be approximated as a circle which causes up to 1\u00b0 of error. The circle approximation means the EL would be 90\u00b0 ahead of the solstices in Earth's orbit (at the equinoxes), so that sin(EL) can be written as sin(90+NDS)=cos(NDS) where NDS is the number of days after the December solstice. By also using the approximation that arcsin[sin(d)\u00b7cos(NDS)] is close to d\u00b7cos(NDS), the following frequently used formula is obtained:\n\n:<math>\\delta_\\odot = - 23.44^\\circ \\cdot \\cos \\left [ \\frac{360^\\circ}{365} \\cdot \\left ( N + 10 \\right ) \\right ]</math>\n\nwhere N is the day of the year beginning with N=0 at midnight [[Universal Time]] (UT) as January 1 begins (i.e. the days part of the [[ordinal date]] \u22121).  The number 10, in (N+10), is the approximate number of days after the December solstice to January 1.   This equation overestimates the declination near the September equinox by up to +1.5\u00b0.  The sine function approximation by itself leads to an error of up to 0.26\u00b0 and has been discouraged for use in solar energy applications.<ref name=\"jenkins\" />  The 1971 Spencer formula<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Fourier series representation of the position of the sun\n|author=J.

They also correct the 23.44\u00b0 obliquity which changes very slightly with time. Corrections may also include the effects of the moon in offsetting the Earth's position from the center of the pair's orbit around the Sun. After obtaining the declination relative to the center of the Earth, a further correction for [[parallax]] is applied, which depends on the observer's distance away from the center of the Earth. This correction is less than 0.0025\u00b0. The error in calculating the position of the center of the Sun can be less than 0.00015\u00b0. For comparison, the Sun's width is about 0.5\u00b0.\n\n===Atmospheric refraction===\nThe declination calculations described above do not include the effects of the [[Atmospheric refraction|refraction]] of light in the atmosphere, which causes the apparent angle of elevation of the Sun as seen by an observer to be higher than the actual angle of elevation, especially at low Sun elevations.<ref name=\"jenkins\" />  For example, when the Sun is at an elevation of 10\u00b0, it appears to be at 10.1\u00b0. The Sun's declination can be used, along with its [[right ascension]], to calculate its azimuth and also its true elevation, which can then be corrected for refraction to give its apparent position.<ref name=\"jenkins\" /><ref  name=noaacalc/><ref>{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Refraction Approximation|url=http://www.srrb.noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/atmosrefr.gif|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Equation of time==\n[[Image:Equation of time.svg|thumb|right|210px|The equation of time \u2014 above the axis a sundial will appear fast relative to a clock showing local mean time, and below the axis a sundial will appear slow.]]\n{{Main|Equation of time}}\nIn addition to the annual north-south oscillation of the Sun's apparent position, corresponding to the variation of its declination described above, there is also a smaller but more complex oscillation in the east-west direction. This is caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis, and also by changes in the speed of its orbital motion around the Sun produced by the elliptical shape of the orbit. The principal effects of this east-west oscillation are variations in the timing of events such as sunrise and sunset, and in the reading of a [[sundial]] compared with a [[clock]] showing [[local mean time]]. As the graph shows, a sundial can be up to about 16 minutes fast or slow, compared with a clock. Since the Earth rotates at a mean speed of one degree every four minutes, relative to the Sun, this 16-minute displacement corresponds to a shift eastward or westward of about four degrees in the apparent position of the Sun, compared with its mean position. A westward shift causes the sundial to be ahead of the clock.\n\nSince the main effect of this oscillation concerns time, it is called the ''equation of time'', using the word \"equation\" in a somewhat archaic sense meaning \"correction\". The oscillation is measured in units of time, minutes and seconds, corresponding to the amount that a sundial would be ahead of a clock. The equation of time can be positive or negative.\n\n==Analemma==\n[[File:analemma.png|thumb|right|100px|An [[analemma]] with solar [[declination]] and [[equation of time]] to the same scale]]\n{{main|Analemma}}\n\nAn [[analemma]] is a diagram that shows the annual variation of the Sun's position on the [[celestial sphere]], relative to its mean position, as seen from a fixed location on Earth. (The word ''analemma'' is also occasionally, but rarely, used in other contexts.) It can be considered as an image of the Sun's apparent motion during a [[tropical year|year]], which resembles a figure-8. An analemma can be pictured by superimposing photographs taken at the same time of day, a few days apart for a [[year]].\n\nAn analemma can also be considered as a graph of the [[#Declination of the Sun as seen from Earth|Sun's declination]], usually plotted vertically, against the [[equation of time]], plotted horizontally. Usually, the scales are chosen so that equal distances on the diagram represent equal angles in both directions on the celestial sphere. Thus 4 minutes (more precisely 3 minutes, 56 seconds), in the equation of time, are represented by the same distance as 1\u00b0 in the [[declination]], since [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] at a mean speed of 1\u00b0 every 4 minutes, relative to the Sun.\n\nAn analemma is drawn as it would be seen in the sky by an observer looking upward. If [[north]] is shown at the top, then [[west]] is to the ''right''. This is usually done even when the analemma is marked on a geographical [[globe]], on which the continents, etc., are shown with west to the left.\n\nSome analemmas are marked to show the position of the Sun on the graph on various dates, a few days apart, throughout the year. This enables the analemma to be used to make simple analog computations of quantities such as the times and [[azimuth]]s of [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]].

This \"Hamitic language group\" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient [[Egyptian language]], the [[Berber languages]], the [[Cushitic languages]], the [[Beja language]], and the [[Chadic languages]]. Unlike M\u00fcller, Lepsius considered that [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Nama language|Nama]] were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.<ref name = \"mer\">[[Merritt Ruhlen]], ''A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification'', Stanford University Press, 1991, pp. 80\u20131</ref>\n[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.png|thumb|Distribution of the Afroasiatic/Hamito-Semitic languages in Africa]]\nIn 1912, [[Carl Meinhof]] published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' (\"The Languages of the Hamites\"), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Nandi languages|Nandi]], [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s.<ref name = \"mer\"/> Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that \"speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.\"<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797</ref> However, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a \"fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]].\" Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub \"Nilo-Hamitic\" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.<ref name=\"Ruhlen109\">Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109</ref>\n\n[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct \"Hamitic\" subgroup, and included [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of \"Hamitic\" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate \"Nilo-Hamitic\" language category in particular, Greenberg was \"returning to a view widely held a half century earlier.\" He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.<ref name=\"Ruhlen\"/> He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.\n\nGreenberg's model was fully developed in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Following [[Isaac Schapera]] and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the [[Hottentot language|Khoekhoe language]] as a member of the [[Khoisan languages]], a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of [[Click consonant|click sounds]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sands|first=Bonnie|date=2009|title=Africa's linguistic diversity|url=|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|volume=3|issue=2|pages=559\u2013580|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818X.2008.00124.x}}</ref> To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages consider them to be [[Language isolate|linguistic isolates]].<ref>Sands, Bonny E.

He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed [[Ongota language|Ongota]] as a new third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.\n* Like Harold Fleming, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean. He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic. He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and \"Boreafrasian.\" According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic.\n* [[Vladimir Orel]] and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a [[language family]].\n* [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.\n* [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as \"Macro-Cushitic\". He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.\n* Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic.\n\n==Position among the world's languages==\nAfroasiatic is one of the four major [[Languages of Africa|language families]] spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nThere are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:\n* [[Hermann M\u00f6ller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as [[grammatical gender]], noun-adjective [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], three-way [[Grammatical number|number]] distinction, and [[vowel alternation]] as a means of derivation).\n* Apparently influenced by M\u00f6ller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic macro-family]] (cf. Pedersen 1931:336\u2013338), also included the Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Yukaghir languages]], and [[Dravidian languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].\n* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000\u20132002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Eskimo\u2013Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].\n* Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. The even larger [[Borean languages|Borean super-family]] contains Nostratic as well as [[Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian languages|Den\u00e9-Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]].\n\n==Date of Afroasiatic==\n[[File:Assyriansample.ogg|thumb|right|180px|Speech sample in the Semitic [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Aramaic]] language, a descendant of [[Old Aramaic]]]]\nThe earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html|title=Earliest Egyptian Glyphs \u2013 Archaeology Magazine Archive|author=|date=|website=www.archaeology.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] (Naqada II) pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]] (Trombetti 1905: 1\u20132), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35\u201336) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other [[proto-language]]s.\n\n==Afroasiatic Urheimat==\n{{main|Afroasiatic Urheimat}}\n[[File:Expansion of Afroasiatic.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing one of the proposed Afroasiatic Urheimat (Eastern Sahara theory.)]]\nThe term Afroasiatic Urheimat (''Urheimat'' meaning \"original homeland\" in German) refers to the hypothetical place where [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in [[Western Asia|West Asia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahel]]. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the [[Sahara pump theory|Sahara pump]] operating over the last 10,000 years.\n\nThere is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed. The main theories of Urheimat are the Levant/Fertile Crescent,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wKT-5SOAKQC&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Quantitative Approaches to Linguistic Diversity: Commemorating the Centenary of the Birth of Morris Swadesh|page=73|isbn=978-9027202659|last1=Wichmann|first1=S\u00f8ren|last2=Grant|first2=Anthony|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyhvaJq2biEC&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Transition to Modernity: Essays on Power, Wealth and Belief|author=John A.

In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.<ref name=\"Sands2009\" />\n* [[Beja language|Beja]], sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic, is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a substantial degree of internal diversity.\n* Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself.\n* There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see [[#Subgrouping|\u00a7 Subgrouping]] below). This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: scholars also frequently disagree on the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance.\n* The extinct [[Meroitic language]] has been proposed ([[Bruce Trigger]], 1964,<ref name=Trigger01>Trigger, Bruce G., ''\u2018Meroitic and Eastern Sudanic: A Linguistic Relationship?\u2019'', Kush 12, 1964, 188\u2013194.</ref> 1977<ref name=Trigger02>Trigger, Bruce, G.,''\u2018The Classification of Meroitic: Geographical Considerations\u2019'', Schriften zur Geschichte und Kultur des Alten Orients 13, 1977, 421\u2013435.</ref>) as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the [[phonotactics]] characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification (Fritz Hintze, 1974,<ref name=Hintze01>Hintze, Fritz, ''\u2018Some Problems of Meroitic Philology\u2019'', Abdel Gadir Mahmoud Abdalla (ed.),  Studies of the Ancient Languages of the Sudan, Sudanese Studies 3, Khartoum University Press, Khartoum, 1974, 73\u201378.</ref> 1979<ref name=Hintze02>Hintze, Fritz ''\u2018Beitr\u00e4ge zur meroitische Grammatik.\u2019'' Meroitica 3, Berlin, 1979, 1\u2013214.</ref>).\n* The classification of [[Kujarg\u00e9 language|Kujarg\u00e9]] within Afroasiatic is not agreed upon.

In 1844, [[Theodor Benfey]] suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter \"Ethiopic\").{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In the same year, T.N.

This \"Hamitic language group\" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient [[Egyptian language]], the [[Berber languages]], the [[Cushitic languages]], the [[Beja language]], and the [[Chadic languages]]. Unlike M\u00fcller, Lepsius considered that [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Nama language|Nama]] were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.<ref name = \"mer\">[[Merritt Ruhlen]], ''A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification'', Stanford University Press, 1991, pp. 80\u20131</ref>\n[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.png|thumb|Distribution of the Afroasiatic/Hamito-Semitic languages in Africa]]\nIn 1912, [[Carl Meinhof]] published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' (\"The Languages of the Hamites\"), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Nandi languages|Nandi]], [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s.<ref name = \"mer\"/> Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that \"speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.\"<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797</ref> However, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a \"fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]].\" Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub \"Nilo-Hamitic\" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.<ref name=\"Ruhlen109\">Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109</ref>\n\n[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct \"Hamitic\" subgroup, and included [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of \"Hamitic\" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate \"Nilo-Hamitic\" language category in particular, Greenberg was \"returning to a view widely held a half century earlier.\" He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.<ref name=\"Ruhlen\"/> He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.\n\nGreenberg's model was fully developed in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Following [[Isaac Schapera]] and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the [[Hottentot language|Khoekhoe language]] as a member of the [[Khoisan languages]], a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of [[Click consonant|click sounds]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sands|first=Bonnie|date=2009|title=Africa's linguistic diversity|url=|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|volume=3|issue=2|pages=559\u2013580|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818X.2008.00124.x}}</ref> To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages consider them to be [[Language isolate|linguistic isolates]].<ref>Sands, Bonny E.

However, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.\n\nOtherwise:\n* [[Paul Newman (linguist)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic. Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iln/LING2110/v07/THEIL%20Is%20Omotic%20Afroasiatic.pdf|title=Is Omotic Afroasiatic? (In Norwegian)|author=|date=|website=uio.no|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or \"Erythraean\", into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian. He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed [[Ongota language|Ongota]] as a new third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.\n* Like Harold Fleming, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean. He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic. He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and \"Boreafrasian.\" According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic.\n* [[Vladimir Orel]] and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a [[language family]].\n* [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.\n* [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as \"Macro-Cushitic\". He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.\n* Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic.\n\n==Position among the world's languages==\nAfroasiatic is one of the four major [[Languages of Africa|language families]] spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nThere are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:\n* [[Hermann M\u00f6ller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as [[grammatical gender]], noun-adjective [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], three-way [[Grammatical number|number]] distinction, and [[vowel alternation]] as a means of derivation).\n* Apparently influenced by M\u00f6ller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic macro-family]] (cf. Pedersen 1931:336\u2013338), also included the Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Yukaghir languages]], and [[Dravidian languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].\n* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000\u20132002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Eskimo\u2013Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].\n* Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. The even larger [[Borean languages|Borean super-family]] contains Nostratic as well as [[Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian languages|Den\u00e9-Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]].\n\n==Date of Afroasiatic==\n[[File:Assyriansample.ogg|thumb|right|180px|Speech sample in the Semitic [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Aramaic]] language, a descendant of [[Old Aramaic]]]]\nThe earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html|title=Earliest Egyptian Glyphs \u2013 Archaeology Magazine Archive|author=|date=|website=www.archaeology.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] (Naqada II) pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]] (Trombetti 1905: 1\u20132), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35\u201336) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other [[proto-language]]s.\n\n==Afroasiatic Urheimat==\n{{main|Afroasiatic Urheimat}}\n[[File:Expansion of Afroasiatic.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing one of the proposed Afroasiatic Urheimat (Eastern Sahara theory.)]]\nThe term Afroasiatic Urheimat (''Urheimat'' meaning \"original homeland\" in German) refers to the hypothetical place where [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in [[Western Asia|West Asia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahel]]. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the [[Sahara pump theory|Sahara pump]] operating over the last 10,000 years.\n\nThere is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed. The main theories of Urheimat are the Levant/Fertile Crescent,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wKT-5SOAKQC&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Quantitative Approaches to Linguistic Diversity: Commemorating the Centenary of the Birth of Morris Swadesh|page=73|isbn=978-9027202659|last1=Wichmann|first1=S\u00f8ren|last2=Grant|first2=Anthony|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyhvaJq2biEC&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Transition to Modernity: Essays on Power, Wealth and Belief|author=John A.

Other sources speculate he was one of three Turkish stallions captured at the [[Battle of Vienna]].<ref name=Bloodlines/> It is even possible he was bred in England from previously imported stock.<ref name=\"101Facts\">{{cite book|last1=Byles|first1=Tony|title=101 Interesting Facts on the History of Horse Racing|date=January 14, 2015|publisher=Apex Publishing Limited}}</ref> He was definitely the war horse of Captain [[Robert Byerley]], who was dispatched to Ireland in 1689 during [[King William's War]] and saw further military service in the [[Battle of the Boyne]]. According to early records, Captain Byerley was nearly captured while reconnoitering the enemy, \"owing his safety to the superior speed of his horse\".<ref name=\"Bloodlines\"/> \n\nAs a general rule, the spelling of a name registered with the [[Jockey Club]] is considered definitive, even if it is an obvious error.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoppert|first1=Melissa|title=So, Who Misspelled American Pharoah?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/sports/american-pharoah-may-be-seeking-triple-crown-but-letter-perfect-hes-not.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=21 February 2017|date=22 May 2015}}</ref> However, the original edition of the ''General Stud Book'' was compiled nearly a century after the fact (in 1791) and contains several errors that have been subsequently corrected.

The My Babu sire line persisted for several generations, leading to [[Cirrus des Aigles]], a Group 1 winner as late as 2014. Unfortunately, Cirrus des Aigles was gelded so the My Babu sire line is on the brink of extinction.\n* Djebel also sired Clarion, born in 1944, who, though less successful than My Babu on the track, is the best hope for the survival of the Byerley Turk sire line\n* Clarion sired Klairon in 1952, whose son Luthier would lead the french sire list four times.

Indian Ridge in turn has several sons and grandsons still at stud. Another son of Ahonoora, Inchinor, sired [[Notnowcato]] in 2002\n\nThus the continuation of the Byerley Turk Thoroughbred sire line via Herod now largely depends on the descendants of [[Ahonoora]],

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\".

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\".

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.
