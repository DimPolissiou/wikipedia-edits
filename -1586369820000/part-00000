It was released on April 30, 2013, as a free digital download. In July 2013, the album debuted at number 63 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], due to bootleg downloads on [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] not affiliated with the artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/5650665/chance-the-rapper-with-acid-rap-mixtape-meets-the |title=Chance the Rapper, with 'Acid Rap' Mixtape, Meets the Legal Black Hole Around Unsigned Artists (From the Magazine) |work=Billboard |date=2013-08-14 |accessdate=2013-10-13}}</ref> The mixtape has been certified \"diamond\" on mixtape site Datpiff, for garnering over 10,000,000 downloads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/Chance-The-Rapper-Acid-Rap-mixtape.483826.html |title=Datpiff Acid Rap |website=Datpiff |date= 2014 |accessdate= 2015-08-21}}</ref> It was rereleased on streaming services on June 21, 2019, alongside his 2012 mixtape [[10 Day]].\n\n== Background and production ==\n\n=== Use of LSD ===\nChancelor Bennett has admitted that some [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] was used during the production of this mixtape. Bennett has said, \"[There] was a lot of acid involved in ''Acid Rap''. I mean, it wasn't ''too'' much \u2014 I'd say it was about 30 to 40 percent acid... more so 30 percent acid.\"<ref name=\"MtvNews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1707187/chance-the-rapper-acid-rap-mixtape/|title=Chance The Rapper: There Was 'A Lot Of Acid Involved In Acid Rap'|last=Alexis|first=Nadeska|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> He has also made it clear that LSD's involvement was just a small factor in the making of the mixtape. Bennett has said that, \"It wasn't the biggest component at all. It was something that I was really interested in for a long time during the making of the tape, but it's not necessarily a huge faction at all. It was more so just a booster, a bit of fuel. It's an allegory to acid, more so than just a tape about acid.\"<ref name=\"MtvNews\"/>\n\n=== Cover art ===\nThe cover art for ''Acid Rap'' was based on a real picture taken at [[South by Southwest]], an annual conglomerate of film, [[interactive media]], and [[music festival]]s and [[Convention (meeting)|conferences]] that take place in mid-March in [[Austin, Texas]]. The picture was taken by Brandon Beuax, who also designed the cover art for Bennett's previous mixtape ''[[10 Day]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/632812919/the-artist-responsible-for-chance-the-rappers-meme-inspired-abstract-art|title=The Artist Responsible For Chance The Rapper's Meme-Inspired Abstract Art|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> The picture happened by chance, according to Beaux, \"I had made these Tie Dye tank tops before we went to SXSW and I gave them to Chance\u2026 In the back of my mind I'm like I hope you wear this.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/here-s-the-original-photo-that-inspired-chance-the-rapper-s-acid-rap-cover|title=Here's the Original Photo That Inspired Chance the Rapper's 'Acid Rap' Cover|website=Genius|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\nBennett used artists and producers from Chicago who he had also worked with before. The [[acid jazz]] sound of the mixtape can be attributed to the collaboration of artists and producers from multiple genres.<ref name=\"BRB\">{{Citation|last=BackRoomsBasements|title=Chance The Rapper talks Acid Rap, SXSW, Violence in Chicago + more|date=2013-04-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKMrdVbEAbc|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> Bennett has said, \"People that I worked with on other projects from multiple genres just came together to make a dope tape.\" Bennett attributes most of the funky or jazz sound to Peter Cottontale saying, \"Peter Cottontale is a really sick jazz pianist.\"<ref name=\"BRB\"/>\n\nBennett describes ''Acid Rap'' as more of a music based album and less of a story-based album when compared to his previous mixtape. When asked to compare ''10 Day'' to ''Acid Rap'' Bennett said, \"''Acid Rap'' is just a whole different monster; it's me as an adult making great music instead of a kid trying to explain a story. It's less of a conceptual project. It's still very cohesive, storytelling-wise, and its own project. But it's more music-based than story-based this time. I'm still telling the story of what it's like coming out of high school, not going to college and my experience with LSD. The new music that I started listening to has got a really heavy Acid Jazz base to it. It's just really good songs; it's a collection of great songs, which is exactly what ''#10Day'' is. But it's more of just a really good album than a story.\"<ref name=\"http://hiphopdx.com\">{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.2099/title.chance-the-rapper-talks-the-chicago-scene-his-acid-rap-mixtape|title=Chance The Rapper Talks The Chicago Scene & His \"Acid Rap\" Mixtape|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2013-05-03|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Acid Rap'' was released as a [[mixtape]] and not an [[album]]. Bennett said, \"One of my biggest talents is performing live.<ref name=\"http://hiphopdx.com\"/> \" This gave him the idea to make his money by selling merchandise and performing live. Along with these reasons he also chose to release his music as a mixtape because he wanted to create free music. More recently he has also rapped about his hatred for record labels in one of his more recent songs, ''No Problem.''<ref>{{Citation|last=TR|title=Chance The Rapper - No Problem (feat. Lil Wayne 2 Chainz) Explicit|date=2016-05-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoSUseCSD7s|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> Bennett being unsigned also gives him the ability to collaborate with any artists of his choosing. Collaboration was a main factor in the production of ''Acid Rap'' and that is another reason why Bennett decided to remain unsigned.\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Bennett officially released the mixtape onto streaming services along with his prior mixtape ''10 Day''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/chance-the-rapper-mixtapes-acid-rap-and-10day-hit-streaming-listen/amp/|title=Chance the Rapper's Mixtapes Are Now Streaming, Coming to Vinyl|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> The track \"Juice\" didn't have its sample cleared and is instead replaced by a 30-second voice memo by Bennett.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| ADM = 8.1/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/5487/Chance-The-Rapper-Acid-Rap.aspx|title=Acid Rap by Chance The Rapper reviews|publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]]|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref>\n| MC = 86/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

It was released on April 30, 2013, as a free digital download. In July 2013, the album debuted at number 63 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], due to bootleg downloads on [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] not affiliated with the artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/5650665/chance-the-rapper-with-acid-rap-mixtape-meets-the |title=Chance the Rapper, with 'Acid Rap' Mixtape, Meets the Legal Black Hole Around Unsigned Artists (From the Magazine) |work=Billboard |date=2013-08-14 |accessdate=2013-10-13}}</ref> The mixtape has been certified \"diamond\" on mixtape site Datpiff, for garnering over 10,000,000 downloads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/Chance-The-Rapper-Acid-Rap-mixtape.483826.html |title=Datpiff Acid Rap |website=Datpiff |date= 2014 |accessdate= 2015-08-21}}</ref> It was rereleased on streaming services on June 21, 2019, alongside his 2012 mixtape [[10 Day]].\n\n== Background and production ==\n\n=== Use of LSD ===\nChancelor Bennett has admitted that some [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] was used during the production of this mixtape. Bennett has said, \"[There] was a lot of acid involved in ''Acid Rap''. I mean, it wasn't ''too'' much \u2014 I'd say it was about 30 to 40 percent acid... more so 30 percent acid.\"<ref name=\"MtvNews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1707187/chance-the-rapper-acid-rap-mixtape/|title=Chance The Rapper: There Was 'A Lot Of Acid Involved In Acid Rap'|last=Alexis|first=Nadeska|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> He has also made it clear that LSD's involvement was just a small factor in the making of the mixtape. Bennett has said that, \"It wasn't the biggest component at all. It was something that I was really interested in for a long time during the making of the tape, but it's not necessarily a huge faction at all. It was more so just a booster, a bit of fuel. It's an allegory to acid, more so than just a tape about acid.\"<ref name=\"MtvNews\"/>\n\n=== Cover art ===\nThe cover art for ''Acid Rap'' was based on a real picture taken at [[South by Southwest]], an annual conglomerate of film, [[interactive media]], and [[music festival]]s and [[Convention (meeting)|conferences]] that take place in mid-March in [[Austin, Texas]]. The picture was taken by Brandon Beuax, who also designed the cover art for Bennett's previous mixtape ''[[10 Day]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/632812919/the-artist-responsible-for-chance-the-rappers-meme-inspired-abstract-art|title=The Artist Responsible For Chance The Rapper's Meme-Inspired Abstract Art|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> The picture happened by chance, according to Beaux, \"I had made these Tie Dye tank tops before we went to SXSW and I gave them to Chance\u2026 In the back of my mind I'm like I hope you wear this.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/here-s-the-original-photo-that-inspired-chance-the-rapper-s-acid-rap-cover|title=Here's the Original Photo That Inspired Chance the Rapper's 'Acid Rap' Cover|website=Genius|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\nBennett used artists and producers from Chicago who he had also worked with before. The [[acid jazz]] sound of the mixtape can be attributed to the collaboration of artists and producers from multiple genres.<ref name=\"BRB\">{{Citation|last=BackRoomsBasements|title=Chance The Rapper talks Acid Rap, SXSW, Violence in Chicago + more|date=2013-04-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKMrdVbEAbc|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> Bennett has said, \"People that I worked with on other projects from multiple genres just came together to make a dope tape.\" Bennett attributes most of the funky or jazz sound to Peter Cottontale saying, \"Peter Cottontale is a really sick jazz pianist.\"<ref name=\"BRB\"/>\n\nBennett describes ''Acid Rap'' as more of a music based album and less of a story-based album when compared to his previous mixtape. When asked to compare ''10 Day'' to ''Acid Rap'' Bennett said, \"''Acid Rap'' is just a whole different monster; it's me as an adult making great music instead of a kid trying to explain a story. It's less of a conceptual project. It's still very cohesive, storytelling-wise, and its own project. But it's more music-based than story-based this time. I'm still telling the story of what it's like coming out of high school, not going to college and my experience with LSD. The new music that I started listening to has got a really heavy Acid Jazz base to it. It's just really good songs; it's a collection of great songs, which is exactly what ''#10Day'' is. But it's more of just a really good album than a story.\"<ref name=\"http://hiphopdx.com\">{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.2099/title.chance-the-rapper-talks-the-chicago-scene-his-acid-rap-mixtape|title=Chance The Rapper Talks The Chicago Scene & His \"Acid Rap\" Mixtape|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2013-05-03|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Acid Rap'' was released as a [[mixtape]] and not an [[album]]. Bennett said, \"One of my biggest talents is performing live.<ref name=\"http://hiphopdx.com\"/> \" This gave him the idea to make his money by selling merchandise and performing live. Along with these reasons he also chose to release his music as a mixtape because he wanted to create free music. More recently he has also rapped about his hatred for record labels in one of his more recent songs, ''No Problem.''<ref>{{Citation|last=TR|title=Chance The Rapper - No Problem (feat.

Collaboration was a main factor in the production of ''Acid Rap'' and that is another reason why Bennett decided to remain unsigned.\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Bennett officially released the mixtape onto streaming services along with his prior mixtape ''10 Day''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/chance-the-rapper-mixtapes-acid-rap-and-10day-hit-streaming-listen/amp/|title=Chance the Rapper's Mixtapes Are Now Streaming, Coming to Vinyl|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> The track \"Juice\" didn't have its sample cleared and is instead replaced by a 30-second voice memo by Bennett.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| ADM = 8.1/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/5487/Chance-The-Rapper-Acid-Rap.aspx|title=Acid Rap by Chance The Rapper reviews|publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]]|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref>\n| MC = 86/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

{"title_page": "Fuel-management systems", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n'''Fuel-management systems''' are used to maintain, control and monitor [[fuel consumption]] and stock in any type of industry that uses [[transport]], including [[rail transport|rail]], [[road transport|road]], [[water transport|water]] and [[air transport|air]], as a means of business. Fuel-management systems are designed to effectively measure and manage the use of [[fuel]] within the transportation and construction industries. They are typically used for [[vehicle fleet|fleets of vehicles]], including railway vehicles and aircraft, as well as any vehicle that requires fuel to operate. They employ various methods and technologies to monitor and track fuel inventories, fuel purchases and fuel dispensed. This information can be then stored in computerized systems and reports generated with data to inform management practices. Online fuel management is provided through the use of web portals to provide detailed fueling data, usually vis a vis the back end of an automated fuel-management system. This enables consumption control, cost analysis and tax accounting for fuel purchases.\n \nThere are several types of fuel-management systems. [[Fuel card|Card-based]] fuel-management systems typically track fuel transactions based on a fueling [[credit card]] and the associated driver PIN. Reports can then be generated based on fuel consumption by driver, and data can be directly downloaded. On-site fuel-management systems may employ fleet refueling services or bulk fuel tanks at the site. Fuel is tracked as it is pumped into vehicles, and on-site storage levels can be managed.\n \nSome fuel companies offer total fuel-management systems whereby they provide elements of a card-based system along with on-site fuel delivery and refueling services. Mobile fuel management refers to a fleet of fuel trucks or tankers which provide fuel supply to commercial fleets of trucks or construction equipment. May involve combining [[RFID]] technology to identify equipment and automated fuel management to append the details of each transaction to a unique piece of equipment. By refueling vehicles in the evening when they are not in use, the company can conserve man-hours as the operators do not refuel and the vehicles do not require additional fuel to travel to the refueling station. They may also employ more sophisticated systems that utilize remote data collection to gather specific technical information about the vehicle usage and performance characteristics such as mileage, hours of operation and engine idling time.\n\nThe increasing use of biofuel has introduced another challenge in fuel management. With greater water content, there will be a risk of microbial growth \u2013 depending on the storage conditions, the fuel quality will deteriorate over time, leading to clogged filters and loss of productivity.\n\n[[Tank manufacturer]]s have introduced [[fuel filter]]ing and cleansing packs which recirculate the tank contents through a series of filters and ultraviolet treatment to kill bacteria. Data from fuel quality instrumentation can be streamed to allow remote monitoring over Internet connections.\n\n==Hardware==\n\nThere have been, to date, five recognizable generations of fuel-management system:\n\n'''First generation''' : A bank of  a number of [[electromechanical]] [[Counter (digital)|counters]], pulsed by a shaft-driven encoder fitted to the pump. The correct counter is selected by the use of an encoded key. These types of systems were available throughout the 1960s superseded by more sophisticated systems in the late 1970s.\n\n'''Second generation''' : A self-contained, electronic and/or [[microprocessor]]-controlled fuel-island control systems which has an ID reader (key, card, RFID etc.) to identify the vehicle and driver, a means of controlling a pump, a means of measuring the fuel delivered, and usually, a means of reporting fuel drawn by a vehicle. The fleet list is usually input using an integral keypad or an office based console. These systems were either fitted with integral printers or permanently hard-wired to back office consoles that provided simple reporting and printouts, these system types were superseded by the proliferation of low cost PC's.\n\n'''Third generation''' : A fuel-island control system similar to a second-generation system, which is either periodically, or permanently connected to a PC which is used to report on the fuellings and input the fleet information. These systems also provided the first \"networked\" systems, usually fitted with a dial up modem within the island terminal, networks could be polled around usually at 12pm onwards to download the days transaction to a central PC and controller.\n\n'''Fourth generation''' : The fuel-island controller is fully connected directly to a central [[Internet]]-based server which is updated in real time. All fleet information and transactions are held on the central server. Connection is made from the fuel island to the server using [[GPRS]], or can use the operators own network using a [[Wi-Fi]] or Cabled Network Link. Continuous Internet connection can not be guaranteed and hence any fourth-generation system must have a fall-back white/black list, usually built in real time from previous authorisations.\n\nThe principal advantages of a real-time system are that site operation can be monitored in real time, stock figures are always current, and, with integrated tank gauging, fuel theft from tanks and short deliveries can be identified immediately.\n\nThe advent of real-time systems has much reduced the requirements of having printed reports, usually circulated and ignored, in favour of users looking at live and current data presented as and when they need it. Having users interact with live and relevant data, rather than simply viewing lists of out of date information encourages a more active view of fuel management than was previously possible, so that active, timely interventions take place generating fuel savings - which is the entire point of the system. The challenge facing manufacturers currently is to make real time data analysis tools which are relevant to the industry and are quick and simple to use by any operator with no technical background.\n\n'''Fifth generation''' : This is the latest and has done away with the controller/pedestal and utilizes smartphone access. Each hose/nozzle has hardware device to turn it on/off and count the fuel dispensed. The local server has been replaced with [[Cloud]] servers.  Communication has been replaced with cellular data transfers.  Everything has stayed real time so all vehicle, personnel, and transaction information is instantaneous.  The hardware at fuel island is now minimal now.  For customer that still need a controller/pedestal a tablet, with cell phone ability is used for a more stationary access point. Fuel Management has now joined the IoT of technology systems.\n\n==ID Devices/Methods==\nTo identify the vehicle/equipment being fuelled, some sort of ID token is normally used. On the most simple systems, this may be an ID or registration number typed in through a keypad, but as this is open to abuse, offering no real fuel security, a physical token is most often used. Some of the most common are listed here :\n\n'''RFID Tags''' : By far the most common type of ID token as it is the most reliable in the sometimes harsh environment where fuelling takes place. Using an RFID tag means there are no openings required in the fuel-management terminal and hence best protection from water or dust ingress. [[RFID tag]]s are low cost and very reliable and the reader requires no ongoing maintenance.\n\n'''Magnetic Cards''' : Often seen as a saving over purchasing RFID tags, a fleet already using fuel cards will use these same [[magnetic card|cards]] at the fuel-island terminal. The exposed nature of most fuel islands is not the ideal environment for the use of fuel cards so reliability may be compromised and hence perceived savings not achieved. If the readers are regularly cleaned, then an acceptable level of reliability may be achieved.\n\n'''Dallas Touch Keys / IButtons''' : A popular alternative to RFID tags, these keys have two electrical contacts which need to be touched to a reader. These keys are very reliable with only minimal maintenance of the key reader required.\n\n'''Nozzle Based Technologies''' : In this system, the fuelling nozzle has a reader mounted on it, or integrated within the nozzle itself. When the refuelling nozzle is inserted into the vehicle filler neck, or connected as part of a dry break fuel system, the vehicle ID is read. This vehicle identification is then transmitted back to the FM terminal using wires or RFID technology. The advantage of this type of system is that the fuelling nozzle must be fully inserted or connected to the vehicle before fuel starts to flow, and fuelling stops if the nozzle is removed, making on-site fuel theft much more difficult. Unfortunately, it does nothing to stop off-site fuel theft, and so should be coupled with anti-syphoning technologies to complete the system.\n\n'''Hand Held Scanners''' : These are especially useful for Mobile Refuelling Solutions where the fueller is some distance from the pumping unit (eg Bowser) when fuelling takes place. The Hand Held Unit has either an RFID, Near field or Barcode Reader to read a tag or barcode permanently attached to the equipment to be fuelled. The HHU then uses a radio link to transmit the ID data back to the bowser where it is validated and the pump started. The fueller is at the point of delivery and hence can control the hose, minimising spillage issues.\n\n'''Bluetooth technology''': Vehicles may be retrofitted with a [[Bluetooth]] transponder to allow for both vehicle identification and data transfer from the vehicle's [[CAN bus|CAN]] network.\n\n==Software==\n'''[[Fuel oil|Fuel-oil]] management system''' (FOMS) is a recent development in the field of [[electric power]] by which the [[fuel oil]] level in any [[power plant]] or any industry can be monitored and controlled using [[programmable logic controller]] and [[supervisory control and data acquisition]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Publication/60018027 | title=Development of fuel oil management system software: Phase 1, Tank management module | date=1992 | accessdate=22 February 2014 | author=Lange, H.B. |display-authors=etal }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy|Transport}}\n*[[Fleet management]]\n*[[Fluid management]]\n*[[Fuel]]\n*[[Fuel oil]]\n*[[Marine fuel management]]\n*[[Fuel Controller]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0v1ygAACAAJ | title=Computerized Fuel Management System for a Foss Tugboat | publisher=University of Washington | last=Hohn | first=Geoffrey M. | year=2011 }}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=izek2m1vJiwC&pg=PA84&dq=%22Fuel+management+system%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MTgwU4CQNM7GoATEnYDgAQ&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Fuel%20management%20system%22&f=false Aircraft Fuel Systems - Roy Langton, Chuck Clark, Martin Hewitt, Lonnie Richards<!-- Bot generated title -->]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=7EbJo-lI6KAC&pg=SA5-PA16&dq=%22Fuel+management+system%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MTgwU4CQNM7GoATEnYDgAQ&ved=0CEoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Fuel%20management%20system%22&f=false Advanced Avionics Handbook<!-- Bot generated title -->]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fuel Management Systems}}\n[[Category:Fuels]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n'''Fuel-management systems''' are used to maintain, control and monitor [[fuel consumption]] and stock in any type of industry that uses [[transport]], including [[rail transport|rail]], [[road transport|road]], [[water transport|water]] and [[air transport|air]], as a means of business.

The Hand Held Unit has either an RFID, Near field or Barcode Reader to read a tag or barcode permanently attached to the equipment to be fuelled. The HHU then uses a radio link to transmit the ID data back to the bowser where it is validated and the pump started. The fueller is at the point of delivery and hence can control the hose, minimising spillage issues.\n\n'''Bluetooth technology''': Vehicles may be retrofitted with a [[Bluetooth]] transponder to allow for both vehicle identification and data transfer from the vehicle's [[CAN bus|CAN]] network.\n\n==Software==\n'''[[Fuel oil|Fuel-oil]] management system''' (FOMS) is a recent development in the field of [[electric power]] by which the [[fuel oil]] level in any [[power plant]] or any industry can be monitored and controlled using [[programmable logic controller]] and [[supervisory control and data acquisition]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Publication/60018027 | title=Development of fuel oil management system software: Phase 1, Tank management module | date=1992 | accessdate=22 February 2014 | author=Lange, H.B. |display-authors=etal }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy|Transport}}\n*[[Fleet management]]\n*[[Fuel]]\n*[[Fuel oil]]\n*[[Marine fuel management]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0v1ygAACAAJ | title=Computerized Fuel Management System for a Foss Tugboat | publisher=University of Washington | last=Hohn | first=Geoffrey M. | year=2011 }}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=izek2m1vJiwC&pg=PA84&dq=%22Fuel+management+system%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MTgwU4CQNM7GoATEnYDgAQ&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Fuel%20management%20system%22&f=false Aircraft Fuel Systems - Roy Langton, Chuck Clark, Martin Hewitt, Lonnie Richards<!-- Bot generated title -->]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=7EbJo-lI6KAC&pg=SA5-PA16&dq=%22Fuel+management+system%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MTgwU4CQNM7GoATEnYDgAQ&ved=0CEoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Fuel%20management%20system%22&f=false Advanced Avionics Handbook<!-- Bot generated title -->]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fuel Management Systems}}\n[[Category:Fuels]]\n", "name_user": "Katherine blyth", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel-management_systems"}

[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. Charlotte now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1993.html|title=1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets Roster and Stats|publisher=Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs.

While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive but failed to qualify for the playoffs, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]], acquiring center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in exchange for the rights to rookie and future Hall of Famer [[Kobe Bryant]], whom the Hornets picked 13th overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-and-the-draft-day-trade-that-changed-nba-history/|title=Kobe Bryant and the draft day trade that changed NBA history|last=Harper|first=Zach|date=April 4, 2016|publisher=CBS Sports|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing 54\u201328, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, advancing to the second round, only to be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n====1998\u20132002: Final years of original personnel====\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] was shortened. The season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the team's fifth head coach. The team finished with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe next three seasons ([[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]], [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] and [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302]]) saw the Hornets in the playoffs each year, reaching the conference semifinals twice. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the 2002 playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season.

A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange.

Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal, green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes in white, green, blue and purple. The '[[Hugo (mascot)|Hugo]]' logo was prominently featured on the shorts' beltline, beginning in early 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal.

Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline and the piping.\n\n====Bobcats====\nThe Bobcats' first home [[Jersey (clothing)|jerseys]] were white, reading \"Bobcats\" in orange with blue and black trimming.

Both designs featured silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform was also updated to include the pinstripes.

The navy away uniforms featured 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] uniforms.

The Coliseum hosted 364 consecutive NBA sell-outs from December 1988 to November 1997. The Hornets would go on to lead the NBA in attendance over the course of their first seven seasons. When they returned as the Bobcats, they temporarily played in the Coliseum in the 2004\u201305 season while their new arena (the Charlotte Bobcats Arena) was being built. After its completion, the city closed the old Coliseum in the 2005 off-season and opened the new arena with a [[Rolling Stones]] concert.\nIn April 2008, the Bobcats reached a [[naming rights]] deal with [[Time Warner Cable]], North Carolina's largest [[cable television]] provider. In exchange for the naming rights, Time Warner agreed to tear up the cable television deal that had limited the Bobcats' exposure over the team's first four years (see below).<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\">{{cite press release|title=Bobcats, Time Warner Cable, Fox Sports Strike Unprecedented Deal|url=http://www.nba.com/bobcats/arena_tv_rights_release.html|publisher=Charlotte Bobcats|date=April 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420070145/http://www.nba.com/bobcats/arena_tv_rights_release.html|archivedate=April 20, 2008|accessdate=June 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=AP: Time Warner gets naming rights for Bobcats Arena|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/bobcats/2008-04-07-time-warner-rights_N.htm|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 7, 2008|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}</ref> When the Hornets returned to Charlotte, \"The Hive\" nickname also returned to the arena.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]].

[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. Charlotte now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1993.html|title=1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets Roster and Stats|publisher=Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]], the Hornets finished with a 50\u201332 record, returning to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1995.html|title=Charlotte Hornets 1994\u20131995 Summary|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.com|access-date=December 14, 2016}}</ref> Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-11-04-9511040064-story.html|title=Mourning OFF To Miami|last=Smith|first=Sam|date=November 4, 1995|publisher=Chicago Tribune|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====1995\u20131998: Glen Rice era====\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive but failed to qualify for the playoffs, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]], acquiring center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in exchange for the rights to rookie and future Hall of Famer [[Kobe Bryant]], whom the Hornets picked 13th overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-and-the-draft-day-trade-that-changed-nba-history/|title=Kobe Bryant and the draft day trade that changed NBA history|last=Harper|first=Zach|date=April 4, 2016|publisher=CBS Sports|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing 54\u201328, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, advancing to the second round, only to be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n====1998\u20132002: Final years of original personnel====\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] was shortened. The season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the team's fifth head coach. The team finished with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe next three seasons ([[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]], [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] and [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302]]) saw the Hornets in the playoffs each year, reaching the conference semifinals twice. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the 2002 playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season. The move came mainly because attendance tailed off dramatically, reportedly due to Shinn's declining popularity in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Move To New Orleans Approved|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/New_Orleans_Approved.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 10, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020805150133/http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/New_Orleans_Approved.html|archivedate=August 5, 2002|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=19900329&id=7fweAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZlIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6688,3395525}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/charhorn/charhornets.html |title=Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002) |publisher=SportsECyclopedia.com |date=February 28, 2015 |accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2004\u20132014: Charlotte Bobcats===\nShortly after the relocation of the team to New Orleans, the NBA opened itself to the possibility of adding a replacement team in Charlotte for the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]], given an arena deal could be reached.<ref>{{cite web |title=Belkin's potential ownership group includes Bird, Carr |url=http://a.espncdn.com/nba/news/2002/0619/1396833.html |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=June 19, 2002 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref> Several ownership groups, including one led by former [[Boston Celtics]] star [[Larry Bird]], made bids for the franchise.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bird, Carr thinking pro hoops in Charlotte? |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today |date=May 23, 2002 |accessdate=June 30, 2009 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/stories/2002-05-20-bird-carr-charlotte.htm}}</ref> On December 18, 2002, a group led by [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] founder [[Robert L.

Inside the 'C' was a smaller white letter 'H' outlined in teal, with a black colored hornet holding a basketball from birds-eye view placed in the center. The 'H' portion of the logo remained on the warm-ups and waistband of the jerseys until the 1991\u201392 season.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Bobcats primary logo from 2004 to 2012 consisted of a snarling orange bobcat facing to the right with the indented name 'Bobcats' above in silver on a blue background, with 'Charlotte' (also indented) appearing above it in the same blue color. A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange. This logo would become prominent in the team's marketing and be featured at center court from 2007\u201308 until 2013\u201314.\n\nCharlotte's second Hornets logo features a teal and purple forward-facing hornet with the words 'Charlotte Hornets' on its torso.

The team chose teal and purple as its primary colors and featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014pinstripes. While most teams feature team names on home jerseys and their home city on away jerseys, the Hornets' uniforms had \"Charlotte\" on both home and away jerseys. Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal, green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes in white, green, blue and purple. The '[[Hugo (mascot)|Hugo]]' logo was prominently featured on the shorts' beltline, beginning in early 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal.

Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline and the piping.\n\n====Bobcats====\nThe Bobcats' first home [[Jersey (clothing)|jerseys]] were white, reading \"Bobcats\" in orange with blue and black trimming.

The home uniforms were white and featured an arched \"Bobcats\" in blue with orange and white trim. Road uniforms were blue and featured an arched \"Charlotte\" in white with blue and orange trim. Both designs featured silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform was also updated to include the pinstripes.

The navy away uniforms featured 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] uniforms. The addition of Carolina blue was seen as way to connect owner Michael Jordan's [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|collegiate roots]], while the formal adoption of 'Cats' for marketing purposes reflected a popular nickname.\n\n====Hornets====\nThe newly renamed Hornets unveiled the team's uniforms on June 19, 2014, consisting of white home and purple road uniforms with the \"Hornets\" wordmark across the chest.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]]. Before 2010, games had aired on [[WOLS]]. WOLS switched its non-sports programming from [[oldies]] to Spanish language on January 1, 2009, making Bobcats and Duke basketball the station's only non-Spanish language programming. [[WBT (radio station)|WBT]] was the Hornets' radio flagship during the original franchise's entire run.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Charlotte Hornets}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Charlotte Bobcats}}\n{{Navboxes|titlestyle = {{NBA color cell|Charlotte Hornets|border=2}}|list =\n{{Charlotte Bobcats seasons}}\n{{NBA}}\n{{North Carolina Sports}}\n{{Charlotte, North Carolina}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|Sports|United States}}\n\n[[Category:Charlotte Hornets| ]]\n[[Category:Charlotte Bobcats| ]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association teams]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams established in 1988]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "2606:a000:5f87:b200:64b9:1a8f:6118:94c6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets"}
