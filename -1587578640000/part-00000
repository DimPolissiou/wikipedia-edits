After abandoning her brief passionless marriage, she meets a young virile engineer who becomes her lover. ''Ecstasy'' was filmed in three language versions \u2013 German, Czech, and French. It is perhaps the first non-[[pornographic movie]] to portray [[sexual intercourse]] and female [[orgasm]], although never showing more than the actors' faces.\n\n==Plot==\nEmil, a fastidious and orderly older man, carries his happy new bride, Eva, over the threshold of their home. He has great difficulty opening the lock on the front door, trying key after key. She is greatly disappointed on their wedding night because he does not even come to bed. He has pinched his finger in the clasp of Eva's pearls when he attempts to remove them.  He is unable to consummate their marriage due to the minor injury on his finger. Emil continues to ignore Eva for many days often retreating behind his newspaper.  Eva refuses to live in a loveless marriage.  She can no longer bear to be Emil's wife in name only and returns to the estate of her father, a wealthy horse breeder. Eva seeks and is granted a divorce from Emil.    \n\nOne day, Eva goes horseback riding in the countryside surrounding her father's estate. She has a [[Nude swimming|swim in the nude]], leaving her clothes on her horse which wanders off to find a stallion locked in a nearby corral. Eva, still completely naked, chases after her horse.  Adam, a virile, young engineer working in road construction in that area happens to look up and see Eva trying to catch her horse.  Finally, Adam is able to catch the runaway horse.  Eva is so embarrassed that she hides in the bushes when Adam approaches her.  At first, Eva is ashamed of her nudity, but then she glares up at him in defiance. He hands Eva her clothes. When she tries to leave, she hurts her ankle. At first, she resists Adam's efforts to help, then acquiesces.\n\nThat night, Eva is restless and cannot stop thinking about Adam. Finally, she goes to his isolated residence which is located near the field where they met. After some hesitation, they embrace and spend the night together. In the throes of passion, Eva's pearl necklace is broken and falls to the floor. She forgets to take it with her the next morning. But the young lovers promise to meet in town at the local hotel the following evening.\n\nWhen Eva returns home the next morning, she finds an unwelcome visitor. Her ex-husband, Emil, has been waiting for her all night. He wants to reconcile with her, but she tells him that it is too late. Brokenhearted, he leaves.\n\nBy chance, while driving away, Emil encounters Adam on the road.  Adam helps to guide Emil through the construction. Then Adam asks Emil for a ride into town. Emil agrees. They stop at Adam's residence in order to pack his suitcase. While packing, Adam notices Eva's pearls on the floor. He takes them along intending to return them to her. While traveling to town, Emil notices Adam admiring the pearl necklace. Emil instantly recognizes the distinctive pearl necklace as those belonging to his ex-wife. Immediately, Emil becomes jealous and enraged. Adam has no idea that Emil had been married to Eva. In his anger, Emil considers driving into an approaching train at a crossing, but at the last moment thinks better of it.\n\nThat night, Emil sits alone in a hotel room while a fly tries futilely to get out through a closed window and several others are shown trapped in [[flypaper]]. Meanwhile, downstairs, Adam is arranging flowers as he waits in the hotel restaurant for his lover, Eva, to arrive. The young lovers are very happy to be reunited. While they are drinking champagne and dancing, they suddenly hear a gunshot. Emil has shot himself. Everyone in the hotel runs to the door of Emil's room. Adam still does not know of the connection between Emil and Eva. She is deeply saddened by the suicide of Emil. However, she does not divulge her relationship with Emil to anyone including Adam.  \n\nThe young couple were to take the train to Berlin later that evening and begin their new life together. While waiting at the train station, Adam falls asleep. A distraught Eva slips quietly away while Adam sleeps. She leaves on a different train without Adam because of the guilt that she feels over the suicide of her former husband, Emil.  When Adam awakens, he realizes that Eva has left him without a word. Later, he returns to his work in construction and  daydreams of Eva. Adam imagines Eva happily holding his baby.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hedy Lamarr]] as Eva Jermann (credit as Hedy Kiesler)\n* [[Aribert Mog]] as Adam\n* [[Zvonimir Rogoz]] as Emil Jermann\n* [[Leopold Kramer]] as Eva's father\n* [[Ji\u0159ina Steimarov\u00e1]] as Typist Madla\n* [[Anton\u00edn Kubov\u00fd]] as Vagrant\n* [[Karel M\u00e1cha-Ku\u010da]] as Lawyer\n* [[Eduard \u0160l\u00e9gl]] as Vagrant\n* [[Jan Svit\u00e1k]] as Dancer on the terrace\n* [[Bed\u0159ich Vrbsk\u00fd]] as Eva's father (Czech voice)\n* [[Ji\u0159ina \u0160t\u011bpni\u010dkov\u00e1]] as Eva (Czech voice)\n* [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Plach\u00fd]] as Adam (Czech voice)\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Nox]] as Eva's father (French version only)\n* [[Pierre Nay]] as Adam (French version only)\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Barrandovske.Terasy.30.leta.20.stoleti.gif|thumb|right|Barrandov Terraces where the dancing scenes were shot]]\n''Ecstasy'' was filmed in the summer of 1932, with a German language script that contained only five pages.<ref name=\"shearer\">{{cite book|last=Shearer |first=Stephen Michael |title=Beautiful: The Life of Hedy Lamarr |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=2010 | page=27|isbn=978-0312550981}}</ref> The original prepared script (two previous versions were canceled<ref name=\"hornicek\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.iluminace.cz/JOOMLA/images/stories/clanky/hornicek_2_2002.pdf|title = \"Extase\" by Machat\u00fd \u2013 The History of the Film\u2019s Origin and Certain Presentation Aspects.

After the shooting at [[Barrandov Terraces]] in [[Prague]] and a pond in [[Jevany]], the crew moved to [[Dob\u0161in\u00e1]], [[Slovakia]] to shoot the rest of the outdoor scenes on 5 July 1932. It was not until August that shooting really started, mostly because of disputes about the French version and French actors. From Dob\u0161in\u00e1, short shooting trips of one or two days  were made to other places: [[Topo\u013e\u010dianky]] (scenes with horses), [[Khust]], [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], and railroad construction \u010cerven\u00e1 skala \u2013 [[Margecany]].<ref name=\"hornicek\" /> The film was not finished in time, and ''A-B ateliery'' in Prague were already booked out in September, and therefore, some indoor scenes were filmed in the Atelier Sch\u00f6nbrunn studios in [[Vienna]], Austria, in 6 days, which was also commercially useful, because the producer did not have to pay the import (contingency) fee when showing the film in Austria.<ref name=\"hornicek\" /> By that time the distribution rights were already sold in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and other countries.<ref name=\"hornicek\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe world premiere of the film took place on 20 January 1933 in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. In [[Austria]], the film was released on 14 February 1933. Due to censorship problems, German cinemas did not show it until 8 January 1935, with the title ''Symphonie der Liebe'' (''Symphony of Love'').\n\n===Controversy===\n''Ecstasy'' was controversial in some countries because of the scenes in which Lamarr is running and swimming naked, and the orgasm scene. Lamarr later claimed in interviews she was tricked into the nude scenes by the director and there was no mention of the nude scenes in the script.\n{{quote|\"When Lamarr applied for the role, she had little experience nor understood the planned filming. Anxious for the job, she signed the contract without reading it. When, during an outdoor scene, the director told her to disrobe, she protested and threatened to quit, but he said that if she refused, she would have to pay for the cost of all the scenes already filmed. To calm her, he said they were using \u2018long shots\u2019 in any case, and no intimate details would be visible. At the preview in Prague, sitting next to the director, when she saw the numerous close-ups produced with telephoto lenses, she screamed at him for tricking her.\"<ref name=Liberty>\"A Candid Portrait of Hedy Lamarr\", ''Liberty'' magazine, December 1938, pp. 18\u201319</ref>}} However other people involved in the movie disputed this. [[Lupita Tovar]] was offered the role of Eva, but after her husband [[Paul Kohner]] saw the script which made it clear the nudity is expected he insisted she does not take the role. A similar story was told by [[Adina Mandlov\u00e1]], who was forbidden to accept the role by her then-boyfriend [[Hugo Haas]]. Cinematographer Jan Stallich said of Lamarr: \"As the star of the picture she knew she would have to appear naked in some scenes. She never made any fuss about it during the production.\"<ref name=\"barton\">{{cite book|title=Hedy Lamarr: The Most Beautiful Woman in Film |last=Barton | first=Ruth | publisher=University Press of Kentucky| date=2010 |pages=29-30 |isbn=978-0813136547}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hedy Lamarr Argentinean Magazine AD.jpg|thumb|right|Hedy Lamarr in 1934]]\nAfter a Vatican journalist attended screening at [[Venice Film Festival]], Pope [[Pius XI]] denounced the film in the Vatican newspaper. As a result, none of the Italian distributors bought the rights for distribution. In Germany, the film was banned and only released in 1935 with edited scenes. In the United States, the [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] found the film morally objectionable. It [[list of films condemned by the Legion of Decency|condemned]] the film in 1933, making ''Ecstasy'' one of the first foreign films condemned by the Legion.\n\nBeginning in 1936, the US distributor of ''Ecstasy'' lobbied the [[Hays office]] for ten months to get the film the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]] seal of approval which would allow it a wide American release. [[Joseph Breen]] called the picture \"highly\u2014even dangerously\u2014indecent\" in an inter-office memo to [[Will H. Hays]],<ref name=gardner>{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Gerald |title=The Censorship Papers: Movie Censorship Letters from the Hays Office, 1934 to 1968 |publisher=Dodd Mead |location=New York |date=1988 |page=[https://archive.org/details/censorshippapers00gard/page/74 74] |isbn=978-0396089032 |url=https://archive.org/details/censorshippapers00gard/page/74 }}</ref> and told the producers:\n{{quote|I regret to have to advise you that we cannot approve your production ''Ecstasy'' that you submitted for our examination yesterday for the reason that is our considered unanimous judgment that the picture is definitely and specifically in violation of the Production Code.

It went on to limited run in America without the Hays seal, where it played in mostly independent art houses.

After the shooting at [[Barrandov Terraces]] in [[Prague]] and a pond in [[Jevany]], the crew moved to [[Dob\u0161in\u00e1]], [[Slovakia]] to shoot the rest of the outdoor scenes on 5 July 1932. It was not until August that shooting really started, mostly because of disputes about the French version and French actors. From Dob\u0161in\u00e1, short shooting trips of one or two days  were made to other places: [[Topo\u013e\u010dianky]] (scenes with horses), [[Khust]], [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], and railroad construction \u010cerven\u00e1 skala \u2013 [[Margecany]].<ref name=\"hornicek\" /> The film was not finished in time, and ''A-B ateliery'' in Prague were already booked out in September, and therefore, some indoor scenes were filmed in the Atelier Sch\u00f6nbrunn studios in [[Vienna]], Austria, in 6 days, which was also commercially useful, because the producer did not have to pay the import (contingency) fee when showing the film in Austria.<ref name=\"hornicek\" /> By that time the distribution rights were already sold in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and other countries.<ref name=\"hornicek\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe world premiere of the film took place on 20 January 1933 in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. In [[Austria]], the film was released on 14 February 1933. Due to censorship problems, German cinemas did not show it until 8 January 1935, with the title ''Symphonie der Liebe'' (''Symphony of Love'').\n\n===Controversy===\n''Ecstasy'' was controversial in some countries because of the scenes in which Lamarr is running and swimming naked, and the orgasm scene. Lamarr later claimed in interviews she was tricked into the nude scenes by the director and there was no mention of the nude scenes in the script.\n{{quote|\"When Lamarr applied for the role, she had little experience nor understood the planned filming. Anxious for the job, she signed the contract without reading it. When, during an outdoor scene, the director told her to disrobe, she protested and threatened to quit, but he said that if she refused, she would have to pay for the cost of all the scenes already filmed. To calm her, he said they were using \u2018long shots\u2019 in any case, and no intimate details would be visible. At the preview in Prague, sitting next to the director, when she saw the numerous close-ups produced with telephoto lenses, she screamed at him for tricking her.\"<ref name=Liberty>\"A Candid Portrait of Hedy Lamarr\", ''Liberty'' magazine, December 1938, pp. 18\u201319</ref>}} However other people involved in the movie disputed this. [[Lupita Tovar]] was offered the role of Eva, but after her husband [[Paul Kohner]] saw the script which made it clear the nudity is expected he insisted she does not take the role. Similar story is told by [[Adina Mandlov\u00e1]] who was forbidden to accept the role by her then-boyfriend [[Hugo Haas]]. Cinematographer Jan Stallich said of Lamarr: \"As the star of the picture she knew she would have to appear naked in some scenes. She never made any fuss about it during the production.\"<ref name=\"barton\">{{cite book|title=Hedy Lamarr: The Most Beautiful Woman in Film |last=Barton | first=Ruth | publisher=University Press of Kentucky| date=2010 |pages=29-30 |isbn=978-0813136547}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hedy Lamarr Argentinean Magazine AD.jpg|thumb|right|Hedy Lamarr in 1934]]\nAfter a Vatican journalist attended screening at [[Venice Film Festival]], Pope [[Pius XI]] denounced the film in the Vatican newspaper. As a result, none of the Italian distributors bought the rights for distribution. In Germany, the film was banned and only released in 1935 with edited scenes. In the United States, the [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] found the film morally objectionable. It [[list of films condemned by the Legion of Decency|condemned]] the film in 1933, making ''Ecstasy'' one of the first foreign films condemned by the Legion.\n\nBeginning in 1936, the US distributor of ''Ecstasy'' lobbied the [[Hays office]] for ten months to get the film the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]] seal of approval which would allow it a wide American release. [[Joseph Breen]] called the picture \"highly\u2014even dangerously\u2014indecent\" in an inter-office memo to [[Will H.

It went on to limited run in America without the Hays seal, where it played in mostly independent art houses.

He spent some time as a member of [[Ringmaster (comics)|Tiboldt]]'s Circus,<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #7-8</ref> before joining the [[Coney Island]] Circus. He witnessed [[Iron Man]] in action and was inspired to become a costumed hero. However, after a misunderstanding on his first outing, Hawkeye was accused of theft and believed to be a criminal. On the run, the naive Hawkeye met the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]], a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], with whom he fell in love. Blindly following the Black Widow, Hawkeye aided her attempts to steal technology developed by Tony Stark. In one of their battles with Iron Man, the Black Widow was seriously injured. Hawkeye rescued her and fled the battle to save her life. But before Hawkeye could take her to a hospital, the Black Widow disappeared.

He is an exceptional fencer, acrobat and marksman, having been trained from childhood in the circus and by the criminals [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] and [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]]. This includes considerable strength, as an employee of Cross Technological Enterprises found out when he tried to use the superhero's {{convert|250|lb-f|N|lk=on|abbr=off}} draw-weight bow and found that he could not draw back the string to launch an arrow.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gruenwald|first=Mark|author2=Layton, Bob|title=Till Death Do Us Part|year=1983|volume=1|series=Hawkeye|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nHawkeye has also been thoroughly trained by Captain America in tactics, martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. Hawkeye excels in the use of ranged weapons, especially the bow and arrow and carries a quiver containing a number of customized \"trick arrows\".

He has gained a reputation for being able to \"turn any object into a weapon\", and has been seen using items such as tin plates, coins, sticks and other debris to great effect against his enemies.\n\nHawkeye is also known to use a \"Sky-Cycle\" as his mode of transportation. The Sky-Cycle is modelled after a commercial snowmobile and is fitted with anti-gravitational technology. It is voice-operated and has an auto-pilot steering system.

Along with the help of [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]], the Swordsman trained Clint to become a master [[Archery|archer]].<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #2</ref> Clint later found the Swordsman embezzling money from the carnival. Before he could turn his mentor over to the authorities, Clint was beaten and left for dead, allowing the Swordsman to escape town.<ref>''Avengers'' #19</ref> Clint's relationship with his brother Barney and Trick Shot soon deteriorated as well.<ref name=\"Hawkeye: Blindspot #1\">''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #1</ref>\n\nClint adapted his archery skills to become a star carnival attraction, a master archer called \"Hawkeye\", otherwise known as \"The World's Greatest Marksman\". He spent some time as a member of [[Ringmaster (comics)|Tiboldt]]'s Circus,<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #7-8</ref> before joining the [[Coney Island]] Circus. He witnessed [[Iron Man]] in action and was inspired to become a costumed hero. However, after a misunderstanding on his first outing, Hawkeye was accused of theft and believed to be a criminal. On the run, the naive Hawkeye met the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]], a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], with whom he fell in love. Blindly following the Black Widow, Hawkeye aided her attempts to steal technology developed by Tony Stark. In one of their battles with Iron Man, the Black Widow was seriously injured. Hawkeye rescued her and fled the battle to save her life. But before Hawkeye could take her to a hospital, the Black Widow disappeared. Hawkeye decided to be a \"straight-shooter\" from then on.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (1964), #60 + 64 (Dec. 1964 and Apr. 1965)</ref>\n\n===Avengers===\nHawkeye later rescues [[Edwin Jarvis]] and his mother from a mugger. In gratitude, Jarvis invites Hawkeye to [[Avengers Mansion]] and stages a confrontation to allow the archer to clear his name and gain the trust of the Avengers.<ref>''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #2 (2011)</ref> Hawkeye is then sponsored by his former enemy Iron Man, who sees that he is serious about becoming a hero. Led by [[Captain America]], Hawkeye joins the team along with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] to form the second incarnation of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref> Almost straight away, Hawkeye clashes with his fellow Avengers. His romantic intentions towards the Scarlet Witch are met with hostility from her brother, Quicksilver. Hawkeye rebels against Captain America's leadership (due to his past problems with authority figures), but over time comes to respect him as a mentor and a friend.<ref>''Avengers'' #55</ref> When the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] attempted to join the Avengers, Hawkeye warned them of his previous history with the villain.<ref>''Avengers'' #19 (Aug. 1965)</ref>\n\n[[File:Avengers no. 63 (Marvel Comics - 1969).jpg|thumb|180px|left|Clint Barton as the second [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]] on the cover of ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #63 (April 1969).

Barney had learned of [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]]'s plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States and came to the Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead's allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master. Tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle;<ref>''Avengers'' #64\u201365 (May\u2013April 1969)</ref> It was later revealed that Barney Barton was actually an undercover FBI agent.<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #6</ref> Soon after this encounter, Egghead hires the Swordsman to capture Goliath (thinking him to be Pym instead of Clint).

They manage to defeat the supervillain, aided by former actress [[Moira Brandon]], who later allows her mansion to become the new Avengers Compound.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' Vol.2 #100</ref> On one of the West Coast Avengers adventures, when the team was lost in time, Mockingbird was kidnapped by an [[American Old West|Old Western]] hero called Lincoln Slade, the [[Phantom Rider]]. The Phantom Rider drugs Mockingbird, convinces her that they are in love, and forces her to engage in a sexual relationship. Mockingbird soon regains her senses. In the resulting battle between the two, Mockingbird allows the Phantom Rider to fall to his death.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol.2 #17-23</ref> Afterwards, when Mockingbird confesses what she did, Hawkeye is stunned that his wife would allow a man to die instead of facing justice. Their relationship becomes frayed as Mockingbird leaves the West Coast Avengers and separates from Hawkeye.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol.2 #37</ref>\n\nHawkeye is challenged to a duel to the death by his former mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]]. Hawkeye reluctantly accepts the challenge and wins. Trick Shot reveals that he is dying of cancer and wants to die honorably in battle. Hawkeye, instead of granting his former mentor's wish, promises to fund his medical care.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3-5</ref> Later, when [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] places a bounty on Hawkeye's right arm, Trick Shot (whose cancer had gone into remission) returns to aid his former pupil. Along with Mockingbird, the two archers defeat an army of supervillains looking to lay claim to the bounty.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #22-25</ref> After this altercation with Crossfire, Hawkeye tells Mockingbird that he was wrong to blame her for what happened with the Phantom Rider. The pair soon reconcile.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #25</ref> After being shot while confronting criminals, Hawkeye adopts an armoured version of his costume to battle the gangs of [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #30-35 (May\u2013Oct. 1990)</ref>\n\nThe West Coast Avengers are then caught in the middle of a supernatural battle between [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]]. The team are able to defeat the two demons and force them back to their own realms. However, Mephisto retaliates by firing energy blasts at the escaping West Coast Avengers. Mockingbird sacrifices herself to save Hawkeye and dies in her husband's arms.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' Vol.2 #100 (1993)</ref> Embittered by Mockingbird's death, Hawkeye leaves the team, which is disbanded almost immediately afterwards.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #102 (Jan. 1994)</ref> Hawkeye isolates himself in the Canadian Rockies to separate himself from the world.

They defeat the demonic [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], but Hawkeye is unable to find his wife.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Annual 2000</ref> To ensure that his Thunderbolts are given full pardons, Hawkeye allows himself to be arrested in their place.

He seeks out Doctor Strange who offers Hawkeye shelter while he comes to terms with his new life. Against the advice of Dr. Strange, Hawkeye eventually travels to [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]] and finds the [[Scarlet Witch]] living a normal life with no memory of her past and apparently without mutant abilities.

Emerging from the crashed ship was a selection of heroes claiming to have been abducted, one of which was Mockingbird. Clint believes that she is the real Mockingbird until [[Mister Fantastic]]'s invention proves that the heroes from the Skrull ship were all imposters.

While battling the [[Lethal Legion]] with the Avengers, Hawkeye's aim is shown to be faltering. After the battle, Tony Stark, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Donald Blake]] and Steve Rogers examine Hawkeye to discover what is causing it. Their diagnosis is that Hawkeye is steadily losing his sight and will soon go blind. Iron Man provides Hawkeye with technology that should stall the blindness. Later, [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] arrives at [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] on the brink of death.

After spelling a couple of words, Cartman believes he will have a chance to win the spelling bee. While at the spelling bee, the children face stiff competition from two [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswalds. Cartman asks the monkey to help him spell his word, ''chair'', but Phonics Monkey is [[masturbation|masturbating]], and Cartman misspells it as \"C-H-A-R-E\"; angered, he runs off to chase the monkey. In the final round, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is unable to spell his word, \"''Kroxldyphivc''\" (which in reality isn't an actual word), correctly and Rebecca and Mark are declared the champions. Although Kyle is annoyed at having been beaten, he ends up developing a crush on Rebecca.\n\nMark becomes intrigued by the interactions he sees between Cartman, Kyle, and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and begs his father to be allowed to attend [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]. His father objects due to how dangerous public schools can be, but reluctantly relents. At the school, Mark, placed in a largely protective [[hamster ball]] by his overpossesive/overprotective father, is tormented for his [[wiktionary:haughty|haughty]] attitude and superior knowledge, and ends up duct taped to a bench by the other boys. This prompts Mark's father to speak with the adults in Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails about the incident and the fact that Kyle has become smitten with Rebecca and should stop pursuing her. The adults are quick to dislike him as much as the kids dislike Mark; after learning that he does not drink beer but prefers [[wine coolers]], they proceed to duct tape Mark's father to one of the bar's benches.\n\nAfter questioning Mark about why he has never been seen before and why he does not attend school like the other children, Cartman is introduced to the concept of home schooling. The idea of never having to go to school appeals to him greatly, and, using [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] condescending remarks towards him as an excuse, demands to be home schooled himself. To him, this involves a regimen of sleeping in and sitting in bed while snacking and watching [[television]], while his mother unsuccessfully attempts to get him to study. When Stan and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] come to visit to tell him about the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] Memorial Dance, Phonics Monkey kills Kenny.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle makes many efforts to make his feelings known to Rebecca, although several end up humorously unsuccessful. Ultimately he convinces her to explore the world of public schooling, and she agrees to go to the South Park dance with him. He also explains what love is to her and, out of curiosity, she asks Kyle if she can experiment a kiss with him, to which he agrees. After kissing him, Rebecca immediately changes when she agrees to Kyle's dance proposal (\"You bet your sweet ass I'll go.\")\n\nAt the dance, the band [[Dio (band)|Dio]] plays their song \"[[Holy Diver (song)|Holy Diver]]\". The boys of the school hatch a plan to [[duct tape]] Mark to the flagpole while the adults also hatch a similar plan for Mark's father. When Rebecca enters the dance dressed up promiscuously and kissing every boy in sight, Mark is outraged and attacks Kyle for turning his sister \"into a [[slut]].\" The other boys perceive his beating up Kyle as cool and finally accept him; [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] breaks up the fight, with Mark warning Kyle he's not through with him. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswald arrive and interrupt the dance, looking for their children so they could leave. Mark gets onstage and makes a speech to his parents (particularly to his father) about the benefits of public schools - \"...it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves.\" Mr. Cotswald, affected by his son's speech, agrees to let Rebecca and Mark regularly attend public school; Rebecca and Kyle then share a kiss. Mark's father, however, is then duct taped to the flagpole in front of the school by the adults, regardless of his change in attitude and opinion.

After spelling a couple of words, Cartman believes he will have a chance to win the spelling bee. While at the spelling bee, the children face stiff competition from two [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswalds. Cartman asks the monkey to help him spell his word, ''chair'', but Phonics Monkey is [[masturbation|masturbating]], and Cartman misspells it as \"C-H-A-R-E\"; angered, he runs off to chase the monkey. In the final round, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is unable to spell his word, \"''Kroxldyphivc''\" (which in reality isn't an actual word), correctly and Rebecca and Mark are declared the champions. Although Kyle is annoyed at having been beaten, he ends up developing a crush on Rebecca.\n\nMark becomes intrigued by the interactions he sees between Cartman, Kyle, and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and begs his father to be allowed to attend [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]. His father objects due to how dangerous public schools can be, but reluctantly relents. At the school, Mark, placed in a largely protective [[hamster ball]] by his overpossesive/overprotective father, is tormented for his [[wiktionary:haughty|haughty]] attitude and superior knowledge, and ends up duct taped to a bench by the other boys. This prompts Mark's father to speak with the adults in Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails about the incident and the fact that Kyle has become smitten with Rebecca and should stop pursuing her. The adults are quick to dislike him as much as the kids dislike Mark; after learning that he does not drink beer but prefers [[wine coolers]], they proceed to duct tape Mark's father to one of the bar's benches.\n\nAfter questioning Mark about why he has never been seen before and why he does not attend school like the other children, Cartman is introduced to the concept of home schooling. The idea of never having to go to school appeals to him greatly, and, using [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] condescending remarks towards him as an excuse, demands to be home schooled himself. To him, this involves a regimen of sleeping in and sitting in bed while snacking and watching [[television]], while his mother unsuccessfully attempts to get him to study. When Stan and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] come to visit to tell him about the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] Memorial Dance, Phonics Monkey kills Kenny.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle makes many efforts to make his feelings known to Rebecca, although several end up humorously unsuccessful. Ultimately he convinces her to explore the world of public schooling, and she agrees to go to the South Park dance with him. He also explains what love is to her and, out of curiosity, she asks Kyle if she can experiment a kiss with him, to which he agrees. After kissing him, Rebecca immediately changes when she agrees to Kyle's dance proposal (\"You bet your sweet ass I'll go.\")\n\nAt the dance, the band [[Dio (band)|Dio]] plays their song \"[[Holy Diver (song)|Holy Diver]]\". The boys of the school hatch a plan to [[duct tape]] Mark to the flagpole while the adults also hatch a similar plan for Mark's father. When Rebecca enters the dance dressed up promiscuously and kissing every boy in sight, Mark is outraged and attacks Kyle for turning his sister \"into a [[slut]].\" The other boys perceive his beating up Kyle as cool and finally accept him; [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] breaks up the fight, with Mark warning Kyle he's not through with him. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswald arrive and interrupt the dance, looking for their children so they could leave. Mark gets onstage and makes a speech to his parents (particularly to his father) about the benefits of public schools - \"...it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves.\" Mr. Cotswald, affected by his son's speech, agrees to let Rebecca and Mark regularly attend public school; Rebecca and Kyle then share a kiss. Mark's father, however, is then duct taped to the flagpole in front of the school by the adults, regardless of his change in attitude and opinion. Dio restarts and plays \"Holy Diver\" over the end credits, with Phonics Monkey joining in on drums.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe character of Rebecca is based on [[Rebecca Sealfon]] who won the 1997 [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]].

{"title_page": "Maker-Breaker game", "text_new": "A '''Maker-Breaker game''' is a kind of [[positional game]].<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite Positional Games 2014}}</ref>{{Rp|13-24}} Like most positional games, it is described by its set of ''positions/points/elements'' (<math>X</math>) and its family of ''winning-sets'' (<math>\\mathcal{F}</math>- a [[Family of sets|family of subsets]] of <math>X</math>). It is played by two players, called Maker and Breaker, who alternately take previously-untaken elements.\n\nIn a Maker-Breaker game, Maker wins if he manages to hold all the elements of a winning-set, while Breaker wins if he manages to prevent this, i.e., to hold at least one element in each winning-set. Draws are not possible. In each Maker-Breaker game, either Maker or Breaker has a winning strategy. The main research question about these games is which of these two options holds.\n\n== Examples ==\nA classic Maker-Breaker game is '''[[Hex (board game)|Hex]].''' There, the winning-sets are all paths from the left side of the board to the right side. Maker wins by owning a connected path; Breaker wins by owning a connected path from top to bottom, since it blocks all connected paths from left to right.\n\n'''[[Tic-tac-toe]]''' can be played as a Maker-Breaker game: in that variant, the goal of Maker is to pick 3 squares in a row, and the goal of Breaker is just to prevent Maker from doing so. In that variant, Maker has a winning strategy. This is in contrast to the classic variant (which is a [[Strong positional game]]) where the second player has a drawing strategy (see [[Strong positional game#Comparison to Maker-Breaker game]]).\n\nUnordered CNF Game<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rahman, Md Lutfar Watson, Thomas|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1081450453|title=Complexity of Unordered CNF Games|date=2018|publisher=Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik|oclc=1081450453}}</ref> on a positive [[Conjunctive normal form|CNF]] (all positive literals) can be considered as a Maker-Breaker game where Maker wants to falsify the CNF, and Breaker wants to satisfy it.\n\nThere has been quite some research done on playing Maker-Breaker games when the board of the game is the edge-set <math>E</math>of some [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] <math>G</math> (usually taken as the [[complete graph]]), and the family of winning-sets is <math>\\mathcal{F}=\\{E'\\subset E\\vert G[E']\\hbox{ has property }\\mathcal{P}\\}</math>, where <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> is some [[graph property]] (usually taken to be monotone increasing) such as connectivity.<ref name=\"ChvatalErdos1978\">{{cite journal|last=Chvatal|author2=Erdos|year=1978|title=Biased positional games|journal=[[Annals of Discrete Mathematics]]|volume=2|pages=221\u2013229|doi=10.1016/S0167-5060(08)70335-2|isbn=9780720410433}}</ref> For instance, the '''[[Shannon switching game]]''' is a Maker-Breaker game in which the winning sets are the paths between two distinguished vertices.\n\n== Breaker-Maker duality ==\nIn a Maker-Breaker game, usually Maker plays first.

Under certain conditions, a player can win using the following greedy strategy: \"whenever your opponent picks an element of pair ''i'', pick the other element of pair ''i''\".\n\nThe \"certain conditions\" are different for Maker and for Breaker; see [[pairing strategy]].\n\n=== Strategies from [[strong positional game]]<nowiki/>s ===\n\nEvery winning-strategy for First in a strong positional game, is also a winning strategy for Maker in the maker-breaker variant (see [[Strong positional game#Comparison to Maker-Breaker game]]). In particular, if in the strong-positional variant there can be no draw, then in the maker-breaker variant Maker has a winning strategy.  The opposite is not necessarily true: a winning-strategy for Maker in the maker-breaker variant is not necessarily a winning-strategy for First in the strong variant, since in the strong variant, Second can win by claiming a winning-set before First. \n\nIn contrast, every winning-strategy for Breaker in a maker-breaker game, is also a drawing-strategy for Second in the strong-positional variant.\n\n=== Potential-based strategies ===\nSuppose we can find a function that assigns, to each winning-set, a ''potential'' based on the number of elements already taken from it by Maker/Breaker. The potential function should satisfy the following properties:\n\n* The potential of a winning-set is between 0 and 1;\n* When Breaker takes an element, the potential of all sets containing it drops to 0 and remains 0;\n* When Maker takes an element, the potential of all (non-broken) sets containing it increases;\n* The potential of a set owned by Maker is 1.\n\nThen, Maker wins iff the potential-sum is more than 0, and Breaker wins iff the potential-sum is less than 1. Hence:\n\n* If the initial sum is more than 0, and Maker can play such that the potential-sum weakly increases, then this is a winning strategy for Maker;\n* If the initial sum is less than 1, and Breaker can play such that the potential-sum weakly decreases, then this is a winning strategy for Breaker.\n\n== A winning condition for Breaker ==\n[[Paul Erd\u0151s]] and [[John Selfridge]] presented a general condition that guarantees Breaker a winning strategy.<ref name=\"es\">{{cite journal|last1=Erd\u0151s|first1=P.|last2=Selfridge|first2=J. L.|author2-link=John Selfridge|year=1973|title=On a combinatorial game|url=https://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1973-10.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]]|series=Series A|volume=14|issue=3|pages=298\u2013301|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(73)90005-8|mr=0327313|author1-link=Paul Erd\u0151s}}</ref> They used a potential-based strategy. They defined the potential of any (non-broken) winning-set   <math>E</math> with <math>|E|</math> unoccupied vertices as  <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. So the potential of a set occupied by Maker is indeed   <math>2^{-0}=1</math>.  Whenever Maker takes an element, the potential of every set containing it increases to  <math>2^{-(|E|-1)}</math>, i.e., increases by <math>2^{-|E|}</math>; whenever Breaker takes an element, the potential of every set containing it drops to 0, i.e., decreases by <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. To every element, we assign a ''value'' which equals the total potential-increase in case Maker takes it, i.e., <math>w(v) := \\sum_{v\\in E} 2^{-|E|}</math>. The winning strategy of Breaker is ''pick an element with a highest value''. This guarantees that, from the first turn of Breaker onwards, the potential always weakly decreases. Hence, if the potential at the first Breaker turn is less than 1, Breaker wins. In Maker's first turn, he can, at most, double the potential (by taking an element contained in all winning-sets). Therefore it is sufficient that, at the game start, the potential is less than 1/2. To summarize, the Erdos-Selfridge theorem says that:\n\n''If <math>\\sum_{E\\in \\mathcal{F}} 2^{-|E|} < 1/2</math>, then <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>is Breaker's win''.\n\nThe theorem gives a very easy-to-check condition, and when this condition is satisfied, it also gives an efficient algorithm for computing Breaker's optimal strategy. \n\nThe potential function has a probabilistic interpretation. The potential of a winning-set is the probability that, if the game is played randomly from now on, Maker will own that set. The potential-sum is thus the expected number of winning-sets owned by Maker if the game is played randomly. Whenever the potential-sum is less than 1, there must be a way to play the game such that the number of sets owned by Maker is 0. By ensuring that the potential-sum remains below 1, Breaker essentially de-randomizes this probabilistic claim until at the end of the game, it becomes a certainty.\n\nNote that if Breaker plays first, the condition changes to ''<math>\\sum_{E\\in \\mathcal{F}} 2^{-|E|} < 1</math>''.\n\nIn particular, if the winning-sets are all of size ''k'' (i.e., the game-hypergraph is  ''k''-uniform), then the Erdos-Selfridge theorem implies that Breaker wins whenever <math>|\\mathcal{F}| < 2^{k-1}</math>, i.e., the number of winning-sets is less than <math>2^{k-1}</math>.<ref name=\"es\" />\n\nThe number <math>2^{k-1}</math>is tight: there are  <math>k</math>-uniform hypergraphs where the number of winning sets is exactly  <math>2^{k-1}</math>, and where Maker has a winning strategy. For example, consider a [[perfect binary tree]] of height <math>k-1</math>. It has <math>2^{k-1}</math>leaves. Define V as the set of tree nodes, and H as the family of all  <math>2^{k-1}</math>paths from the root to a leaf. Maker starts by picking the root. Then, if Breaker picks an element in the left subtree, Maker picks the root of the right subtree, and vice versa. By continuing this way, Maker can always pick a full path, i.e., a winning-set.\n=== Disjoint and almost-disjoint hypergraphs ===\nIf all winning-sets are pairwise-disjoint and their size is at least 2, then Breaker can win using a pairing strategy.\n\nSuppose now that the winning-sets are ''almost'' disjoint, i.e., any two winning-sets have at most one element in common.  If all winning-sets are of size <math>k</math>, and the number of winning sets is less than <math>4^{k - c\\sqrt{k}}</math>(for some fixed constant c), then Breaker has a winning strategy.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=J\u00f3zsef|author-link=J\u00f3zsef Beck|date=1981|title=On positional games|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A|volume=30|issue=2|pages=117\u2013133|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(81)90001-7|issn=0097-3165}}</ref>  So this situation is easier for Breaker than the general case, but harder than the case of disjoint winning-sets.\n\n== A winning condition for Maker ==\nDefine the ''degree'' of a set of elements as the number of different winning-sets that contain this set. Define the ''pair-degree'' of a set-family, denoted <math>d_2</math>, as the maximum degree of a pair of elements (maximum over all pairs). If all winning-sets are of size <math>k</math>, and the number of winning-sets is more than <math>2^{k-3}\\cdot  d_2\\cdot  |X|</math>, then Maker has a winning strategy.<ref name=\"beck81\">{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=J\u00f3zsef|date=1981|title=Van der waerden and ramsey type games|journal=Combinatorica|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=103\u2013116|doi=10.1007/bf02579267|issn=0209-9683}}</ref>{{Rp|Theorem 1}}\n\nThe strategy uses the same potential function used by Erdos and Selfridge: the potential of a winning-set <math>E</math> with <math>|E|</math>unoccupied elements (and no element occupied by Breaker) is  <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. The value of an element is the total potential-decrease if Breaker takes that element, which is the same as the total potential-increase if Maker takes it. Maker's strategy is simply to take the highest-value element.\n\nWhenever Maker takes an element, the potential of every winning-set that contains it increases by <math>2^{-|E|}</math>; whenever Breaker takes an element, the potential of every set that contains it and does ''not'' contain Maker's element decreases by <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. Therefore, if we consider only the winning-sets that were touched once, the potential-sum weakly increases. The potential-sum can decrease only due to sets that contain both Maker's element and Breaker's element. These sets gain <math>2^{-|E|}</math>but then lose <math>2^{-(|E|-1)}</math>, so all in all they lose <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. Since such sets have at least two elements, each such set loses at most 1/4.  By the limited-pair-degree assumption, the number of such sets is at most ''d<sub>2</sub>''. Hence, after each round the potential-sum drops by at most ''d<sub>2</sub>''/4. The number of rounds is |X|/2, so the final potential is smaller than the initial potential by at most <math>d_2\\cdot  |X|/8</math>.  The initial potential is <math>|\\mathcal{F}|\\cdot 2^{-k}</math>. \n\nIf <math>|\\mathcal{F}|\\cdot 2^{-k} > d_2\\cdot  |X|/8</math>, the final potential is more than 0, so there is at least one winning-set with potential 1. This set is owned by Maker.\n\n=== Chromatic numbers and winning strategies ===\nThe [[chromatic number]] of <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>is the smallest number of colors needed to color the elements of X such that no single set in <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>is monochromatic.  If the chromatic number of  <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>is 3, then Maker has a winning-strategy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hales|first1=Alfred W.|last2=Jewett|first2=Robert I.|year=1963|title=Regularity and positional games|journal=[[Trans.

Then, the game is not necessarily zero-sum - it is possible that both players will win. In fact, whenever Breaker has a winning strategy in the Maker-Breaker game, it is possible that two Breakers will both win in the Breaker-Breaker game.\n\nAn application of this strategy is an efficient algorithm for [[Graph coloring|coloring]] a hypergraph. Suppose we want to color the vertices of a ''k''-uniform hypergraph in two colors such that in each hyperedge, both colors are represented. Erdos proved already in 1963, using the [[probabilistic method]], that such a coloring exists whenever the number of hyperedges is less than <math>2^{k-1}</math> (see [[Property B]]). However, the proof was not constructive. Using Breaker's constructive winning strategy, we can color the hypergraph <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> by letting two Breakers play one against the other with their winning strategies. Both players will win - so each player will have at least one vertex in every hyperedge.<ref name=\":02\" />{{Rp|17-20}}\n\n== Partial making ==\nSuppose that, in order to win, Maker does not need to occupy an entire winning-set - he only needs to own a part of such a set. When can Breaker win in this case?\n\n=== Constant partial making ===\n''m'' elements in one set (where Breaker does not own any element). If the size of each winning-set is at least ''m,'' and the number of sets is less than <math>2^{m-1}</math>, then Breaker still has a winning strategy. The strategy uses a potential function: the potential of a \"broken\" set is 0, and the potential of a non-broken set E is  <math>2^{-r(E)}</math>, where r(E) is the number of elements Maker has to take in order to win it. So the initial potential of every winning-set is  <math>2^{-m}</math>, and the potential of a set occupied by Maker is 1. From here the proof is the same as the Erdos-Selfridge theorem.<ref name=\"beck81\" />{{Rp|Lemma 1}}\n\n=== Fractional making ===\nSuppose that, in order to win, Maker needs to own only a fraction ''t'' of the elements in one winning-set, where <math>1/2 < t \\leq 1</math>. So Breaker needs to own a fraction larger than (1-''t'') of the points in every set.  Define the constant: <math>c_t := (2t)^t \\cdot (2-2t)^{1-t} = 2 \\cdot t^t \\cdot (1-t)^{1-t}</math>(in the standard variant, <math>t=1, c_t\\to 2</math>).\n\n* ''If <math>\\sum_{E\\in \\mathcal{F}} {c_t}^{-|E|} < 1</math>, then Breaker has a winning strategy'' ''when'' ''playing first''.<ref name=\"beck81\" />{{Rp|Lemma 3}}\n* ''If <math>\\sum_{E\\in \\mathcal{F}} {c_t}^{-|E|} < {1\\over 2-2t}</math>, then Breaker has a winning strategy'' when ''playing second''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xiaoyun|first=Lu|date=1991-11-29|title=A matching game|journal=Discrete Mathematics|language=en|volume=94|issue=3|pages=199\u2013207|doi=10.1016/0012-365X(91)90025-W|issn=0012-365X}}</ref>\n\nIn particular, if all sets are of size ''k'' and their number is less than  ''<math>{c_t}^{k}</math>'', then Breaker (playing first) has a winning strategy.\n\nThe strategy uses a potential function. The potential of a winning-set is defined as <math>(2 t)^{-r} (2-2t)^{-s}</math>, where ''r''  is the number of elements Maker needs to take in order to occupy the set, and ''s'' is the number of elements Breaker needs to take in order to break it. If Maker occupies a set, then its potential will at some point be at least 1. Therefore, Breaker wins if he manages to keep the potential-sum below 1.  Breaker's strategy is to take the element with the highest value, defined as the sum of potentials of winning-sets containing that element.\n\nWhenever Maker takes an element, the potential of every set containing it is multiplied by 2''t'', so it increases by (2''t''-1) times the current potential. Whenever Breaker takes an element, the potential of every set containing it is multiplied by (2-2''t''), so it increases by (1-2''t'') times the current potential. Whenever Breaker and Maker both touch the same set, its potential is multiplied by 2''t''(2-2''t''), so it increases by -(2''t''-1)<sup>2</sup> times the current potential. Since Breaker's element has a highest value, the potential-sum always decreases. Therefore, if the initial potential-sum is less than 1, Breaker wins.\n\n== Infinite boards ==\nThe definition of Maker-Breaker game has a subtlety when there are infinitely many vertices (<math>|V|=\\infty</math>)  and infinitely many winning sets (<math>|H|=\\infty</math>). In this case we say that Breaker has a winning strategy if, for all ''j''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, Breaker can prevent Maker from completely occupying a winning set by turn&nbsp;''j''.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Clique game]]\n*[[Arithmetic progression game]]\n*[[Biased positional game]]\n*[[Avoider-Enforcer game]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Positional games]]\n", "text_old": "A '''Maker-Breaker game''' is a kind of [[positional game]].<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite Positional Games 2014}}</ref>{{Rp|13-24}} Like most positional games, it is described by its set of ''positions/points/elements'' (<math>X</math>) and its family of ''winning-sets'' (<math>\\mathcal{F}</math>- a [[Family of sets|family of subsets]] of <math>X</math>). It is played by two players, called Maker and Breaker, who alternately take previously-untaken elements.\n\nIn a Maker-Breaker game, Maker wins if he manages to hold all the elements of a winning-set, while Breaker wins if he manages to prevent this, i.e., to hold at least one element in each winning-set. Draws are not possible. In each Maker-Breaker game, either Maker or Breaker has a winning strategy. The main research question about these games is which of these two options holds.\n\n== Examples ==\nA classic Maker-Breaker game is '''[[Hex (board game)|Hex]].''' There, the winning-sets are all paths from the left side of the board to the right side. Maker wins by owning a connected path; Breaker wins by owning a connected path from top to bottom, since it blocks all connected paths from left to right.\n\n'''[[Tic-tac-toe]]''' can be played as a Maker-Breaker game: in that variant, the goal of Maker is to pick 3 squares in a row, and the goal of Breaker is just to prevent Maker from doing so. In that variant, Maker has a winning strategy. This is in contrast to the classic variant (which is a [[Strong positional game]]) where the second player has a drawing strategy (see [[Strong positional game#Comparison to Maker-Breaker game]]).\n\nThere has been quite some research done on playing Maker-Breaker games when the board of the game is the edge-set <math>E</math>of some [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] <math>G</math> (usually taken as the [[complete graph]]), and the family of winning-sets is <math>\\mathcal{F}=\\{E'\\subset E\\vert G[E']\\hbox{ has property }\\mathcal{P}\\}</math>, where <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> is some [[graph property]] (usually taken to be monotone increasing) such as connectivity.<ref name=\"ChvatalErdos1978\">{{cite journal|last=Chvatal|author2=Erdos|year=1978|title=Biased positional games|journal=[[Annals of Discrete Mathematics]]|volume=2|pages=221\u2013229|doi=10.1016/S0167-5060(08)70335-2|isbn=9780720410433}}</ref> For instance, the '''[[Shannon switching game]]''' is a Maker-Breaker game in which the winning sets are the paths between two distinguished vertices.\n\n== Breaker-Maker duality ==\nIn a Maker-Breaker game, usually Maker plays first.

Under certain conditions, a player can win using the following greedy strategy: \"whenever your opponent picks an element of pair ''i'', pick the other element of pair ''i''\".\n\nThe \"certain conditions\" are different for Maker and for Breaker; see [[pairing strategy]].\n\n=== Strategies from [[strong positional game]]<nowiki/>s ===\n\nEvery winning-strategy for First in a strong positional game, is also a winning strategy for Maker in the maker-breaker variant (see [[Strong positional game#Comparison to Maker-Breaker game]]). In particular, if in the strong-positional variant there can be no draw, then in the maker-breaker variant Maker has a winning strategy.  The opposite is not necessarily true: a winning-strategy for Maker in the maker-breaker variant is not necessarily a winning-strategy for First in the strong variant, since in the strong variant, Second can win by claiming a winning-set before First. \n\nIn contrast, every winning-strategy for Breaker in a maker-breaker game, is also a drawing-strategy for Second in the strong-positional variant.\n\n=== Potential-based strategies ===\nSuppose we can find a function that assigns, to each winning-set, a ''potential'' based on the number of elements already taken from it by Maker/Breaker. The potential function should satisfy the following properties:\n\n* The potential of a winning-set is between 0 and 1;\n* When Breaker takes an element, the potential of all sets containing it drops to 0 and remains 0;\n* When Maker takes an element, the potential of all (non-broken) sets containing it increases;\n* The potential of a set owned by Maker is 1.\n\nThen, Maker wins iff the potential-sum is more than 0, and Breaker wins iff the potential-sum is less than 1. Hence:\n\n* If the initial sum is more than 0, and Maker can play such that the potential-sum weakly increases, then this is a winning strategy for Maker;\n* If the initial sum is less than 1, and Breaker can play such that the potential-sum weakly decreases, then this is a winning strategy for Breaker.\n\n== A winning condition for Breaker ==\n[[Paul Erd\u0151s]] and [[John Selfridge]] presented a general condition that guarantees Breaker a winning strategy.<ref name=\"es\">{{cite journal|last1=Erd\u0151s|first1=P.|last2=Selfridge|first2=J. L.|author2-link=John Selfridge|year=1973|title=On a combinatorial game|url=https://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1973-10.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]]|series=Series A|volume=14|issue=3|pages=298\u2013301|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(73)90005-8|mr=0327313|author1-link=Paul Erd\u0151s}}</ref> They used a potential-based strategy. They defined the potential of any (non-broken) winning-set   <math>E</math> with <math>|E|</math> unoccupied vertices as  <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. So the potential of a set occupied by Maker is indeed   <math>2^{-0}=1</math>.  Whenever Maker takes an element, the potential of every set containing it increases to  <math>2^{-(|E|-1)}</math>, i.e., increases by <math>2^{-|E|}</math>; whenever Breaker takes an element, the potential of every set containing it drops to 0, i.e., decreases by <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. To every element, we assign a ''value'' which equals the total potential-increase in case Maker takes it, i.e., <math>w(v) := \\sum_{v\\in E} 2^{-|E|}</math>. The winning strategy of Breaker is ''pick an element with a highest value''. This guarantees that, from the first turn of Breaker onwards, the potential always weakly decreases. Hence, if the potential at the first Breaker turn is less than 1, Breaker wins. In Maker's first turn, he can, at most, double the potential (by taking an element contained in all winning-sets). Therefore it is sufficient that, at the game start, the potential is less than 1/2. To summarize, the Erdos-Selfridge theorem says that:\n\n''If <math>\\sum_{E\\in \\mathcal{F}} 2^{-|E|} < 1/2</math>, then <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>is Breaker's win''.\n\nThe theorem gives a very easy-to-check condition, and when this condition is satisfied, it also gives an efficient algorithm for computing Breaker's optimal strategy. \n\nThe potential function has a probabilistic interpretation. The potential of a winning-set is the probability that, if the game is played randomly from now on, Maker will own that set. The potential-sum is thus the expected number of winning-sets owned by Maker if the game is played randomly. Whenever the potential-sum is less than 1, there must be a way to play the game such that the number of sets owned by Maker is 0. By ensuring that the potential-sum remains below 1, Breaker essentially de-randomizes this probabilistic claim until at the end of the game, it becomes a certainty.\n\nNote that if Breaker plays first, the condition changes to ''<math>\\sum_{E\\in \\mathcal{F}} 2^{-|E|} < 1</math>''.\n\nIn particular, if the winning-sets are all of size ''k'' (i.e., the game-hypergraph is  ''k''-uniform), then the Erdos-Selfridge theorem implies that Breaker wins whenever <math>|\\mathcal{F}| < 2^{k-1}</math>, i.e., the number of winning-sets is less than <math>2^{k-1}</math>.<ref name=\"es\" />\n\nThe number <math>2^{k-1}</math>is tight: there are  <math>k</math>-uniform hypergraphs where the number of winning sets is exactly  <math>2^{k-1}</math>, and where Maker has a winning strategy. For example, consider a [[perfect binary tree]] of height <math>k-1</math>. It has <math>2^{k-1}</math>leaves. Define V as the set of tree nodes, and H as the family of all  <math>2^{k-1}</math>paths from the root to a leaf. Maker starts by picking the root. Then, if Breaker picks an element in the left subtree, Maker picks the root of the right subtree, and vice versa. By continuing this way, Maker can always pick a full path, i.e., a winning-set.\n=== Disjoint and almost-disjoint hypergraphs ===\nIf all winning-sets are pairwise-disjoint and their size is at least 2, then Breaker can win using a pairing strategy.\n\nSuppose now that the winning-sets are ''almost'' disjoint, i.e., any two winning-sets have at most one element in common.  If all winning-sets are of size <math>k</math>, and the number of winning sets is less than <math>4^{k - c\\sqrt{k}}</math>(for some fixed constant c), then Breaker has a winning strategy.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=J\u00f3zsef|author-link=J\u00f3zsef Beck|date=1981|title=On positional games|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A|volume=30|issue=2|pages=117\u2013133|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(81)90001-7|issn=0097-3165}}</ref>  So this situation is easier for Breaker than the general case, but harder than the case of disjoint winning-sets.\n\n== A winning condition for Maker ==\nDefine the ''degree'' of a set of elements as the number of different winning-sets that contain this set. Define the ''pair-degree'' of a set-family, denoted <math>d_2</math>, as the maximum degree of a pair of elements (maximum over all pairs). If all winning-sets are of size <math>k</math>, and the number of winning-sets is more than <math>2^{k-3}\\cdot  d_2\\cdot  |X|</math>, then Maker has a winning strategy.<ref name=\"beck81\">{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=J\u00f3zsef|date=1981|title=Van der waerden and ramsey type games|journal=Combinatorica|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=103\u2013116|doi=10.1007/bf02579267|issn=0209-9683}}</ref>{{Rp|Theorem 1}}\n\nThe strategy uses the same potential function used by Erdos and Selfridge: the potential of a winning-set <math>E</math> with <math>|E|</math>unoccupied elements (and no element occupied by Breaker) is  <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. The value of an element is the total potential-decrease if Breaker takes that element, which is the same as the total potential-increase if Maker takes it. Maker's strategy is simply to take the highest-value element.\n\nWhenever Maker takes an element, the potential of every winning-set that contains it increases by <math>2^{-|E|}</math>; whenever Breaker takes an element, the potential of every set that contains it and does ''not'' contain Maker's element decreases by <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. Therefore, if we consider only the winning-sets that were touched once, the potential-sum weakly increases. The potential-sum can decrease only due to sets that contain both Maker's element and Breaker's element. These sets gain <math>2^{-|E|}</math>but then lose <math>2^{-(|E|-1)}</math>, so all in all they lose <math>2^{-|E|}</math>. Since such sets have at least two elements, each such set loses at most 1/4.  By the limited-pair-degree assumption, the number of such sets is at most ''d<sub>2</sub>''. Hence, after each round the potential-sum drops by at most ''d<sub>2</sub>''/4. The number of rounds is |X|/2, so the final potential is smaller than the initial potential by at most <math>d_2\\cdot  |X|/8</math>.  The initial potential is <math>|\\mathcal{F}|\\cdot 2^{-k}</math>. \n\nIf <math>|\\mathcal{F}|\\cdot 2^{-k} > d_2\\cdot  |X|/8</math>, the final potential is more than 0, so there is at least one winning-set with potential 1. This set is owned by Maker.\n\n=== Chromatic numbers and winning strategies ===\nThe [[chromatic number]] of <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>is the smallest number of colors needed to color the elements of X such that no single set in <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>is monochromatic.  If the chromatic number of  <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>is 3, then Maker has a winning-strategy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hales|first1=Alfred W.|last2=Jewett|first2=Robert I.|year=1963|title=Regularity and positional games|journal=[[Trans.

Horton]] in developing the original android [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] of [[World War II]]. While mostly a silent partner in this endeavor, Dr. Bradley began building a second android during this time.\n\nThe two scientists were unable to correct the design flaw that would cause their android to burst into flames upon exposure to oxygen. Bradley had preferred they resolve this issue before revealing their work to the public. However, Horton, eager for both fame and further financial backing held a press conference in late 1939 debuting their work. This turned into a public relations disaster, as Bradley had predicted, when the android caught on fire, causing the press to label it a menace. Bradley broke off their partnership thereafter and took his unfinished second android with him.<ref>''Invaders II'' #3</ref>\n\nSometime before 1941, Bradley completed his work and the second android acted as the superhero [[Volton]], the Human Generator, from late 1941 to early 1942. Unaware of its artificial origins, Bradley led Volton to believe it was a scientist named Guy Newton who had discovered how to utilize his body's power to generate [[static electricity]]. Around this time, Bradley also decided to become a masked crimefighter, too. While working by day at Mercy Hospital in New York City, he would don a surgical mask and arm himself with a hypodermic gun to fight corruption and crime as Doctor Nemesis.<ref>''Lightning Comics'' #6</ref>\n\nAfter a number of adventures, Doctor Nemesis was approached by agents of the [[Third Reich]] to form a group of costumed beings. Signifying a change in tactics, Bradley changed his alter-ego to Dr. Death and recruited [[Human Meteor]], [[Spider Queen]], Strongman, and Volton for the group, Battle-Axis. The members of Battle-Axis did not, necessarily, agree with the [[Nazism|Nazi]] policies and agenda but, for a variety of reasons, sought to force the United States to pull out of World War II. Doctor Death started work on Project Mojave. Using an experimental device called an oscillotron, Battle-Axis would cause a severe earthquake on the US west coast. Besides causing much damage to American cities, it would destroy the war industry plants and release poison gas from underground storage. With such devastation, the U.S. would be forced to withdraw from the war in order to deal with its homefront crisis.\n\nOn June 22, 1942, Battle-Axis made their public debut protecting a German [[u-boat]] from the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] attack. The two teams battled several times as the Invaders slowly unraveled Doctor Death's secret plans. Doctor Death kidnapped the [[Blue Bullet]] (John Goldstein) to employ him in his Project Mojave, and his brother Jacob was obliged to obey his orders in exchange for John's life. Jacob was forced, as the [[Golem (comics)#Invaders ally|Golem]], to attack the Invaders in Doctor Death's plan to force the USA out of involvement in World War II. When the Invaders attacked Doctor Death's base, the Golem remained neutral to keep from putting his brother in danger. John escaped during the battle, but was shot by [[Sky Shark (comics)|Sky Shark]]. Though the Invaders were able to stop Doctor Death's plan, the Blue Bullet died.<ref>''The Invaders'' #2\u20134 (June\u2013August 1993)</ref>\n\nIn their final confrontation, Doctor Death was able to get the oscillotron activated when he was struck down by Volton. The android had learned of its origins and Doctor Death's own role in keeping it secret. The [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] was able to shut down the machine and Doctor Death was left for dead.<ref>''Invaders II'' #1\u20134</ref>\n\nSomehow surviving the attack, Bradley returned to New York City. Apparently repentant, he assumed his original costumed persona of Doctor Nemesis. Continuing on his war on crime, he became engaged to his co-worker, Nurse Mary Strong. The majority of his wartime activities remain unchronicled.<ref>''Super-Mystery'' #3</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Doctor Bradley moved to [[Santiago del Estero]], [[Argentina]] to hunt down any Nazi superscientists and any of their clones.\n\nMany years later, Doctor Bradley was approached by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] to help assist in undoing the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. Doctor Nemesis had no interest in undoing the \"spell\" that turned off the X-gene. But after defeating two Super Nazis, he agrees to join McCoy's science team.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #504\"/> They later locate and recruit [[Madison Jeffries]] (formerly of [[Alpha Flight]]).<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #505</ref> When they return to [[San Francisco]], they are joined by Dr. [[Kavita Rao]].<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #508\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref> They time-travel back to turn-of-the-century San Francisco in order to obtain genetic samples for study, from the biological parents of one of the first of the modern (20th century) wave of mutants. The mutant in question is actually Doctor Nemesis himself, who reveals to the rest of the team his power of \"self-evolved intellect\", which allowed him to greatly extend his longevity through his own invented serums. His father is a brilliant radical inventor who actually manages to invent a self-powered electric light bulb, and his mother is her husband's bodyguard. Doctor Nemesis' father is killed when he helps the X-Club stop the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s first-ever [[Sentinel (Marvel Comics)|Sentinel]] from ravaging across San Francisco. Nemesis' mother later dies in childbirth, as she is already in a weakened condition from the trauma of losing her spouse. Unknown to the rest of the X-Men, Dr. Nemesis delivered himself as he secretly traveled back in time again to be the physician of his own mother.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #512</ref> The X-Club are ultimately unable to obtain the couple's genetic samples as it appears that they are being deliberately blocked by the Dreaming Celestial (because they would not have survived the time-jump back to the present, they were buried in a cryogenic capsule in [[Golden Gate Park]]) as part of some grand cosmic plan.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}\n\nAfter rescuing Beast and [[Professor X]] from [[Norman Osborn]]'s prison, Doctor Nemesis and the rest of the X-Club join the X-Men on the risen [[Asteroid M]], renamed Utopia, where they mourn the death of Yuriko Takiguchi shortly afterward.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #515</ref> When the arrival of [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] leads to an attack by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], Nemesis and the rest of the X-Club are led to a trap that takes them out of Utopia, where Bastion creates an energy sphere blocking out the entire San Francisco area from the outside world, despite help from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], they are unable to breach the barrier.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #236</ref>\n\nAfter Avengers vs X-Men, Dr. Nemesis is rescued from prison and joins [[Cable and X-Force|X-Force]].\n\nDuring the \"Last Days of \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\", it was mentioned months ago that Doctor Nemesis was among the scientists that Magneto's right-hand person Briar tried to contact in order to make a special cocktail to augment Magneto's powers for the upcoming incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #19</ref>\n\nDoctor Nemesis later appears as a member of the Agents of Wakanda.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #12.

He succeeded and stumbled onto one that was ruled by the monstrous tyrant [[Tim Boo Ba]].<ref name=\"Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone #1\">''Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone'' #1</ref>\n\nAt some point, Michael was associated with [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]] and stationed in a laboratory that was somewhere near [[Hank Pym|Henry Pym]]'s home and laboratory. He plotted to steal Henry Pym's technology and involved himself in the plot of a criminal named M'Sieu Tete. While [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] was out of town, Michael and M'Sieu Tete's gang kidnapped Billy Connors in a plot to make Curt surrender the narcotics that Curt was working with Henry on. Ant-Man and [[Spider-Man]] ended up having to deal with M'Sieu Tete's gang until M'Sieu Tete injected them with a virus to gain their cooperation. Ant-Man and Spider-Man defeated M'Sieu Tete's gang and took the antidote. Unfortunately, Ant-Man was trapped in small size as a side effect of the virus. During this time, Michael pilfered Henry Pym's lab and build a costume for himself using the size-changing circuitry of Ant-Man's helmet and Henry Pym's old Giant-Man costume.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #4</ref>\n\nMichael became Doctor Nemesis and captured Ant-Man and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. He cured Ant-Man of the virus that trapped him in small form. However, he kept Wasp in a weakened state where she would die unless she got further treatments. Doctor Nemesis then forced Henry Pym to take him to [[Avengers Mansion]] where he planned to pilfer the scientific secrets there. Doctor Nemesis then had Ant-Man lower the shields around the mansion. Once the shields were down, Ant-Man attacked Doctor Nemesis and defeated him using his greater size-changing experience.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #9-10</ref>\n\nDoctor Nemesis begins to seek his revenge by infiltrating Wasp's mansion where she was throwing a party. Once inside the mansion, Doctor Nemesis donned a suit of miniature adamantium armor which hasn't been worn by Henry Pym. He then ambushed Wasp and attempted to use the armors weapons to shrink Wasp out of existence. Wasp was assisted by the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]] (who were trapped on Earth at the time). Doctor Nemesis used the beam on some of the Micronauts before the beam was turned on him by Acroyear. Although those who were hit by the beam ended up in the Microverse, Doctor Nemesis continued to shrink. The effects of the shrinking wore off and Doctor Nemesis returned to normal size.<ref>''Micronauts'' #42-43</ref>\n\nHenry Pym assisted in the investigation of several Los Angeles crimes that involved size-changing abilities. Henry Pym suspected that Doctor Nemesis was behind this as the places he robbed were New Centuries Labs, the Entwiler Family jewels, and Morgan-Stern Electronics. Henry Pym then deduced that the next place that Doctor Nemesis might rob is Eckman's Electronics where Henry Pym encountered Doctor Nemesis. Although Henry Pym lacked his size-changing abilities at the time, he tore open Doctor Nemesis' suit while he was in giant form and managed to shrink him back to size upon losing his connection with his helmet. When Doctor Nemesis was back at normal size, Henry Pym then punched him out.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #8</ref>\n\nUnder the alias of Dr. Stockton, Doctor Nemesis was employed at [[Stark Industries|Stane International]] and headed a project that developed the M.A.U. (short for Mass Acquisition Unit). He was assisted on the project by Dr. Edward Hawkins and [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] (since Henry Pym was unavailable at the time) who assisted in the evaluation of the Pym Particles. During this time, the M.A.U. overloaded and causes everything in the area to grow to giant size until Bill Foster (who became Giant-Man) shut it down. Giant-Man then discussed the M.A.U. with Edward stating that it would be too dangerous and would act as a warhead. When Giant-Man attempted to shut the operation down, Dr. Stockton revealed his true identity of Doctor Nemesis and attacked Giant-Man using his size-changing abilities. When Giant-Man started to overpower Doctor Nemesis, [[Erik Josten|Goliath]] arrived to assist Doctor Nemesis where Goliath overpowered Giant-Man. Doctor Nemesis then attempts to make a deal with Edward Hawkins to assist him. Upon recovering, Giant-Man questions Edward Hawkins who revealed that he planned to stop Doctor Nemesis. When they confronted him, they demanded that Doctor Nemesis desists. Edward Hawkins threatens to turn Doctor Nemesis over to the US Government. Goliath delayed Giant-Man while Doctor Nemesis loads the M.A.U. onto his airplane to escape. This time, Giant-Man defeated Goliath while Edward Hawkins delayed Doctor Nemesis enough for him and Giant-Man to board Doctor Nemesis' airplane. Doctor Nemesis activates the M.A.U. in mid-flight before being knocked out by Giant-Man. Hawkins made a few alterations to the M.A.U. and then had Giant-Man flood it with Pym shrinking particles. After the M.A.U. device was destroyed by Giant-Man, Doctor Nemesis and Goliath were sent to prison.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #113-118</ref>\n\nWhen the Creatures from Kosmos began attacking Earthlings that had Pym Particles, Doctor Nemesis shrunk himself down to microscopic size where he ended up on Tim Boo Ba's world. He was captured and tortured Tim Boo Ba and his minions before returning to normal size and escaping. While incarcerated at the Big House, Doctor Nemesis attempted to warn the others of Tim Boo Ba. None would listen to him and he even sent an E-Mail to [[Elsa Bloodstone]]. When Tim Boo Ba began his rampage in New York, Elsa sent Doctor Nemesis an E-Mail stating that he was right.<ref name=\"Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone #1\"/>\n\nDoctor Nemesis was at the [[Bar with No Name]] in New York City where he was among the villains watching a fight between Spider-Man and the \"Basher\" on [[YouTube]]. He was among those that placed their bet with the Bookie.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1 #562</ref> When the real Spider-Man arrived after the Spider-Man that fought Basher was actually Screwball in disguise, Doctor Nemesis was among the villains that fought Spider-Man until the bartender Deke broke up the battle telling them that the Bar With No Name is a sanctuary for those on the run from the law.<ref>'''Amazing Spider-Man''' #563</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe first Doctor Nemesis possesses the mutant powers of having a self-described \"self-evolved\" intellect, making him an instinctively-intuitive scientific and technological genius (like his fellow X-Man, the mutant shaman/inventor [[Forge (comics)|Forge]]). He has delayed his own aging and enhanced his own immune system, leading to a prolonged lifespan. He has also enhanced his eyesight, allowing him to see genetic anomalies, including the Nazi clones he primarily hunted before joining the X-Club, over a distance of {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #504\"/> Dr. Nemesis is a polymath who has made major advances in handheld weaponry, medicine, chemistry, genetics, interdimensional travel, computer programming, and robotics.{{Issue|date=August 2010}} He arms himself with twin handguns that fire hypodermic projectiles containing dangerous narcotics. The projectiles were tailored to pierce body armor. He developed a sedating truth serum for use as an investigator. He created androids, including the sentient and superhuman android, Volton. He perfected a \"dimension smasher\" which teleported beings from other dimensions. His oscillotron device can trigger major earthquakes. He is an accomplished investigator and hand-to-hand combatant.\n\nThe costume of the second Doctor Nemesis possessed a device that enabled him to access the Pym Particles that enabled him to grow and shrink in size.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, James Bradley is seen in a hidden room built unknown to Magneto himself at the center of the fortress. He is frozen and distorted as he is not completely in this reality. Gambit notices he's looking at some brain scans, probably Legion's.<ref>''New Mutants'' #23</ref>\n\n===Secret Wars (2015)===\nDuring the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a version of Doctor Nemesis resides in the [[Battleworld]] domain that is known as the Domain of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. James Bradley is a scientist and geneticist working along with [[Dark Beast]] for Mister Sinister in his breeding pens, intent on breeding more powerful mutants according to Apocalypse's \"survival of the fittest\" ideology. He created and delivered to the humans representative, Dr. Peter Corbeau, a deadly virus that could wipe out all of mutantkind. He also had over the time genetically absorbing the powers of over three hundred mutants. However the existence of the virus is known to Apocalypse and when he finally released the virus, Nemesis made his move. He tried to convince the X-Men and every inhabitant of the domain to aid in his quest to overthrown God Emperor Doom, but was attacked by them instead. Nemesis first act was to kill Dark Beast, as he was the only one who could defeat him, but before his demise, Frost was able to remove from his mind the intel necessary to defeat Nemesis. She and Blink then went to Dark Beast's lab as the X-Men fought Nemesis to try to find a cure for the virus, and found Weapon X and a lobotomized Jean Grey, as Sinister (at the time terrified by her) removed the portion of her brain which governed her mutant powers. Using her powers Emma discovered that being a powerful mutant, Jean still had the power to fix everything, but by unlocking them could do more harm than good as Jean was very angry for what had happened to her. Eventually Frost decided to transplant part of her own brain to reactivate Jean's power. As Sinister conducted the brain surgery, the rest of the X-Men attacked Nemesis, with Weapon X, Creed and Burner (who was revealed to be Cyclops and Havok's lost brother) losing their lives to the omnipotent madman. After Jean Grey rose as the Phoenix, she destroyed Nemesis and used his liquified matter along with the Phoenix Force to cure everyone, not only from the virus but also from the mutant gene. From that day on, every mutant of the Domain of Apocalypse was now human and had been given a second chance at life.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drnemesisga.htm|Doctor Nemesis (James Bradley)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=4886|title=Doctor Nemesis (James Bradley)}}\n* {{marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drnemesi.htm|Doctor Nemesis (Michael Stockton)}}\n\n{{Ant-Man and Wasp}}\n{{X-Men}}\n{{X-Force}}\n{{GoldenAge}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Herb Trimpe]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Friedrich]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1941]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1972]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can change size]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Golden Age superheroes]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n", "text_old": "{{in-universe|date=June 2018}}\n'''Doctor Nemesis''' is the name of two fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe first version (James Bradley) was a derivative version of the eponymous [[Golden Age of comics|Golden Age]] character, that originally appeared in [[Ace Magazines]]' ''Lightning Comics''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/170 |accessdate=1 April 2020 |page=170}}</ref> He is a co-creator of the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch android]],<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #504\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #504</ref> and appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' as a member of the [[X-Club (comics)|X-Club]].<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #507\">''Uncanny X-Men #507''</ref> Doctor Nemesis appeared in ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'', a series by writer Dennis Hopeless and artist [[Salvador Larroca]] that debuted in December 2012.<ref name=\"Cable&X-Force\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40999 |title=EXCLUSIVE: The Future is Hopeless for \"Cable and X-Force\" |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=14 September 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref> Currently James Bradley is owned by Marvel.\n\nThe second version (Michael Shockton) was unidentified in ''Marvel Feature'' #4 but officially debuted in ''Marvel Feature'' #9 and was created by [[Mike Friedrich]] and Craig Russell.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===James Bradley===\n{{Infobox comics character  <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \n| image          =[[File:XMN Nemesis.jpg|250px]]\n| caption        = Doctor Nemesis (James Bradley) in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #511. <br> Art by [[Greg Land]]. \n| character_name = Doctor Nemesis\n| real_name      = James Bradley\n| species        = Human [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutant]]\n| publisher      = [[Ace Magazines (comics)|Ace Magazines]], [[Marvel Comics]]\n| debut          = ''Lightning Comics'' #6 (April 1941; historic)<br> ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' Vol. 2 #1 (May 1993; Marvel Universe)\n|creators        = The creators of the version published by [[Ace Magazines (comics)|Ace Magazines]] are unknown.

The mutant in question is actually Doctor Nemesis himself, who reveals to the rest of the team his power of \"self-evolved intellect\", which allowed him to greatly extend his longevity through his own invented serums. His father is a brilliant radical inventor who actually manages to invent a self-powered electric light bulb, and his mother is her husband's bodyguard. Doctor Nemesis' father is killed when he helps the X-Club stop the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s first-ever [[Sentinel (Marvel Comics)|Sentinel]] from ravaging across San Francisco. Nemesis' mother later dies in childbirth, as she is already in a weakened condition from the trauma of losing her spouse.

He succeeded and stumbled onto one that was ruled by the monstrous tyrant [[Tim Boo Ba]].<ref name=\"Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone #1\">''Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone'' #1</ref>\n\nAt some point, Michael was associated with [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]] and stationed in a laboratory that was somewhere near [[Hank Pym|Henry Pym]]'s home and laboratory. He plotted to steal Henry Pym's technology and involved himself in the plot of a criminal named M'Sieu Tete. While [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] was out of town, Michael and M'Sieu Tete's gang kidnapped Billy Connors in a plot to make Curt surrender the narcotics that Curt was working with Henry on. Ant-Man and [[Spider-Man]] ended up having to deal with M'Sieu Tete's gang until M'Sieu Tete injected them with a virus to gain their cooperation. Ant-Man and Spider-Man defeated M'Sieu Tete's gang and took the antidote. Unfortunately, Ant-Man was trapped in small size as a side effect of the virus. During this time, Michael pilfered Henry Pym's lab and build a costume for himself using the size-changing circuitry of Ant-Man's helmet and Henry Pym's old Giant-Man costume.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #4</ref>\n\nMichael became Doctor Nemesis and captured Ant-Man and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. He cured Ant-Man of the virus that trapped him in small form. However, he kept Wasp in a weakened state where she would die unless she got further treatments. Doctor Nemesis then forced Henry Pym to take him to [[Avengers Mansion]] where he planned to pilfer the scientific secrets there. Doctor Nemesis then had Ant-Man lower the shields around the mansion. Once the shields were down, Ant-Man attacked Doctor Nemesis and defeated him using his greater size-changing experience.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #9-10</ref>\n\nDoctor Nemesis begins to seek his revenge by infiltrating Wasp's mansion where she was throwing a party. Once inside the mansion, Doctor Nemesis donned a suit of miniature adamantium armor which hasn't been worn by Henry Pym. He then ambushed Wasp and attempted to use the armors weapons to shrink Wasp out of existence. Wasp was assisted by the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]] (who were trapped on Earth at the time). Doctor Nemesis used the beam on some of the Micronauts before the beam was turned on him by Acroyear. Although those who were hit by the beam ended up in the Microverse, Doctor Nemesis continued to shrink. The effects of the shrinking wore off and Doctor Nemesis returned to normal size.<ref>''Micronauts'' #42-43</ref>\n\nHenry Pym assisted in the investigation of several Los Angeles crimes that involved size-changing abilities. Henry Pym suspected that Doctor Nemesis was behind this as the places he robbed were New Centuries Labs, the Entwiler Family jewels, and Morgan-Stern Electronics. Henry Pym then deduced that the next place that Doctor Nemesis might rob is Eckman's Electronics where Henry Pym encountered Doctor Nemesis. Although Henry Pym lacked his size-changing abilities at the time, he tore open Doctor Nemesis' suit while he was in giant form and managed to shrink him back to size upon losing his connection with his helmet. When Doctor Nemesis was back at normal size, Henry Pym then punched him out.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #8</ref>\n\nUnder the alias of Dr. Stockton, Doctor Nemesis was employed at [[Stark Industries|Stane International]] and headed a project that developed the M.A.U. (short for Mass Acquisition Unit). He was assisted on the project by Dr. Edward Hawkins and [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] (since Henry Pym was unavailable at the time) who assisted in the evaluation of the Pym Particles. During this time, the M.A.U. overloaded and causes everything in the area to grow to giant size until Bill Foster (who became Giant-Man) shut it down. Giant-Man then discussed the M.A.U. with Edward stating that it would be too dangerous and would act as a warhead. When Giant-Man attempted to shut the operation down, Dr. Stockton revealed his true identity of Doctor Nemesis and attacked Giant-Man using his size-changing abilities. When Giant-Man started to overpower Doctor Nemesis, [[Erik Josten|Goliath]] arrived to assist Doctor Nemesis where Goliath overpowered Giant-Man. Doctor Nemesis then attempts to make a deal with Edward Hawkins to assist him. Upon recovering, Giant-Man questions Edward Hawkins who revealed that he planned to stop Doctor Nemesis. When they confronted him, they demanded that Doctor Nemesis desists. Edward Hawkins threatens to turn Doctor Nemesis over to the US Government. Goliath delayed Giant-Man while Doctor Nemesis loads the M.A.U. onto his airplane to escape. This time, Giant-Man defeated Goliath while Edward Hawkins delayed Doctor Nemesis enough for him and Giant-Man to board Doctor Nemesis' airplane. Doctor Nemesis activates the M.A.U. in mid-flight before being knocked out by Giant-Man. Hawkins made a few alterations to the M.A.U. and then had Giant-Man flood it with Pym shrinking particles. After the M.A.U. device was destroyed by Giant-Man, Doctor Nemesis and Goliath were sent to prison.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #113-118</ref>\n\nWhen the Creatures from Kosmos began attacking Earthlings that had Pym Particles, Doctor Nemesis shrunk himself down to microscopic size where he ended up on Tim Boo Ba's world. He was captured and tortured Tim Boo Ba and his minions before returning to normal size and escaping. While incarcerated at the Big House, Doctor Nemesis attempted to warn the others of Tim Boo Ba. None would listen to him and he even sent an E-Mail to [[Elsa Bloodstone]]. When Tim Boo Ba began his rampage in New York, Elsa sent Doctor Nemesis an E-Mail stating that he was right.<ref name=\"Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone #1\"/>\n\nDoctor Nemesis was at the [[Bar with No Name]] in New York City where he was among the villains watching a fight between Spider-Man and the \"Basher\" on [[YouTube]]. He was among those that placed their bet with the Bookie.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1 #562</ref> When the real Spider-Man arrived after the Spider-Man that fought Basher was actually Screwball in disguise, Doctor Nemesis was among the villains that fought Spider-Man until the bartender Deke broke up the battle telling them that the Bar With No Name is a sanctuary for those on the run from the law.<ref>'''Amazing Spider-Man''' #563</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe first Doctor Nemesis possesses the mutant powers of having a self-described \"self-evolved\" intellect, making him an instinctively-intuitive scientific and technological genius (like his fellow X-Man, the mutant shaman/inventor [[Forge (comics)|Forge]]). He has delayed his own aging and enhanced his own immune system, leading to a prolonged lifespan. He has also enhanced his eyesight, allowing him to see genetic anomalies, including the Nazi clones he primarily hunted before joining the X-Club, over a distance of {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #504\"/> Dr. Nemesis is a polymath who has made major advances in handheld weaponry, medicine, chemistry, genetics, interdimensional travel, computer programming, and robotics.{{Issue|date=August 2010}} He arms himself with twin handguns that fire hypodermic projectiles containing dangerous narcotics. The projectiles were tailored to pierce body armor. He developed a sedating truth serum for use as an investigator. He created androids, including the sentient and superhuman android, Volton. He perfected a \"dimension smasher\" which teleported beings from other dimensions. His oscillotron device can trigger major earthquakes. He is an accomplished investigator and hand-to-hand combatant.\n\nThe costume of the second Doctor Nemesis possessed a device that enabled him to access the Pym Particles that enabled him to grow and shrink in size.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, James Bradley is seen in a hidden room built unknown to Magneto himself at the center of the fortress. He is frozen and distorted as he is not completely in this reality. Gambit notices he's looking at some brain scans, probably Legion's.<ref>''New Mutants'' #23</ref>\n\n===Secret Wars (2015)===\nDuring the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a version of Doctor Nemesis resides in the [[Battleworld]] domain that is known as the Domain of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. James Bradley is a scientist and geneticist working along with [[Dark Beast]] for Mister Sinister in his breeding pens, intent on breeding more powerful mutants according to Apocalypse's \"survival of the fittest\" ideology. He created and delivered to the humans representative, Dr. Peter Corbeau, a deadly virus that could wipe out all of mutantkind. He also had over the time genetically absorbing the powers of over three hundred mutants. However the existence of the virus is known to Apocalypse and when he finally released the virus, Nemesis made his move. He tried to convince the X-Men and every inhabitant of the domain to aid in his quest to overthrown God Emperor Doom, but was attacked by them instead. Nemesis first act was to kill Dark Beast, as he was the only one who could defeat him, but before his demise, Frost was able to remove from his mind the intel necessary to defeat Nemesis. She and Blink then went to Dark Beast's lab as the X-Men fought Nemesis to try to find a cure for the virus, and found Weapon X and a lobotomized Jean Grey, as Sinister (at the time terrified by her) removed the portion of her brain which governed her mutant powers. Using her powers Emma discovered that being a powerful mutant, Jean still had the power to fix everything, but by unlocking them could do more harm than good as Jean was very angry for what had happened to her. Eventually Frost decided to transplant part of her own brain to reactivate Jean's power. As Sinister conducted the brain surgery, the rest of the X-Men attacked Nemesis, with Weapon X, Creed and Burner (who was revealed to be Cyclops and Havok's lost brother) losing their lives to the omnipotent madman. After Jean Grey rose as the Phoenix, she destroyed Nemesis and used his liquified matter along with the Phoenix Force to cure everyone, not only from the virus but also from the mutant gene. From that day on, every mutant of the Domain of Apocalypse was now human and had been given a second chance at life.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drnemesisga.htm|Doctor Nemesis (James Bradley)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=4886|title=Doctor Nemesis (James Bradley)}}\n* {{marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drnemesi.htm|Doctor Nemesis (Michael Stockton)}}\n* \n\n{{Hank Pym}}\n{{X-Men}}\n{{X-Force}}\n{{GoldenAge}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Herb Trimpe]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Friedrich]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1941]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1972]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can change size]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Golden Age superheroes]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n", "name_user": "Favre1fan93", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Nemesis"}

Hall]], and by [[Devon Graye]], [[Dominic Janes]], and [[Maxwell Huckabee]] as a youth.\n\nIn both the novels and the TV series, Dexter is a [[forensic science|forensic]] [[blood spatter analysis|blood spatter analyst]] who works for the fictitious Miami-Metro Police Department. In his spare time, he is a [[vigilante]] [[serial killer]] who targets other murderers who have evaded the justice system. He follows a code of ethics taught to him in childhood by his adoptive father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry]], which he refers to as \"The Code\" or \"The Code of Harry\" and hinges on two principles: Dexter can only kill people after finding conclusive evidence that they are guilty of murder, and he must not get caught.\n\nDexter's novel appearances include ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]'' (2004), ''[[Dearly Devoted Dexter]]'' (2005), ''[[Dexter in the Dark]]'' (2007), ''[[Dexter by Design]]'' (2009), ''[[Dexter Is Delicious]]'' (2010), ''[[Double Dexter]]'' (2011), ''[[Dexter's Final Cut]]'' (2013), and ''[[Dexter Is Dead]]'' (2015).  The eighth and final novel in the series written by Lindsay was titled ''Dexter Is Dead'', and released in July 2015, signifying the ending of the character.\n\nIn 2006, the first novel was adapted into the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] TV series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and its companion web series ''[[Dexter: Early Cuts]]''. Season one is largely based on the first novel, ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]'' (2004), but the following seasons veered away from the rest of the book series.\n\nFor his performance as Dexter, [[Michael C. Hall]] has received critical acclaim. In 2009, he was awarded a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series or Drama]]. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' ranked Dexter Morgan number 6 on their list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011<ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Jackson |title=The 20 Best TV Characters of 2011 |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/12/the-20-best-tv-characters-of-2011.html?p=2 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |publisher=Paste Media Group|location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=December 5, 2011|access-date=June 30, 2012}}</ref> In addition, Hall was awarded with a [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Award]] for [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama|Individual Achievement in Drama]] in 2007, and was nominated five times for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]].\n\n== Characterization ==\n\n=== Psychological profile ===\nSince childhood, Dexter Morgan has felt homicidal urges directed by an inner voice he calls \"the Dark Passenger\"; when that voice cannot be ignored, he \"lets the Dark Passenger do the driving\". He abides by a moral code taught to him by his adoptive father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry]], in which he only allows himself to kill people who are themselves murderers.\n\nDexter considers himself emotionally divorced from the rest of humanity; in his narration, he refers to \"humans\" as if he is not one himself. He makes frequent references to an internal feeling of emptiness and says he kills to feel alive. He claims to have no feelings or [[conscience]], and that all of his emotional responses are part of a well-rehearsed act to conceal his true nature. He has no interest in romance or sex; he considers his relationship with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) [[Rita Bennett]] to be part of his \"disguise\".\n\nDexter likes children, finding them much more interesting than adults; accordingly, he treats victims who prey on children with particular wrath. His connection to Rita's children, Astor, and Cody, sometimes supersedes his relationship with Rita herself. For example, in the novels, Dexter continues his relationship with Rita because he realizes that Rita's children are exhibiting the same [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] tendencies he did at their age, and he tries to control their violent urges by providing them with \"guidance\" similar to that which Harry provided him. In the show, Dexter deviates from his code of only killing murderers to dispose of a [[pedophile]] who is [[stalking]] Astor.\n\nAnimals do not like Dexter, which can cause noise problems when he stalks a victim who has pets. The novels reveal that he once owned a dog that barked and growled at him until he was forced to get rid of it and a turtle that hid from him in its shell until it died of starvation.\n\nDexter occasionally behaves in a way that suggests that he does feel some rudimentary human connection. He acknowledges loyalty to family, particularly to his late adoptive father, saying: \"If I were capable of love, how I would have loved Harry.\" Since Harry's death, Dexter's only family is his sister [[Debra Morgan|Debra]], Harry and Doris' biological daughter. Dexter admits that he cannot hurt Debra or allow anyone else to harm her because he is \"fond of her\". In the [[Dexter (episode)|first episode]] of [[Dexter (season 1)|season one]], he says: \"I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb\".\n\nIn the first season, Dexter's relationship with Rita sets in motion his slow but steady introduction to human feelings, progressing further each season. During the episode \"[[Shrink Wrap (Dexter episode)|Shrink Wrap]]\", when his current target is a psychologist, Dexter infiltrates the doctor's office by posing as a patient, and the doctor astutely speculates that part of Dexter's problem in admitting to his feelings is his need for control. In the second-season finale, \"[[The British Invasion (Dexter)|The British Invasion]]\", Dexter finally admits that he needs the people in his life.<ref name=\"The British Invasion\">{{cite episode\n| title = The British Invasion | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 14, 2007| season = 2 | number = 9 }}</ref> In [[Dexter (season 3)|season three]], when he is threatened by a target, Dexter fights to live because he wants to see his unborn child. In [[Dexter (season 4)|season four]], before killing a police officer who has murdered her own husband and daughter, Dexter is overwhelmed with the realization that he does not want to lose his new family. He is also horrified when he finds out that one of his potential victims is an abusive husband and father; Dexter vehemently insists he is nothing like that and would never hurt his family. In [[Dexter (season 5)|season five]], after Rita is murdered, Dexter realizes that he genuinely loved her and is devastated by losing her.<ref name=\"My Bad\">{{cite episode| title = My Bad | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 26, 2010| season = 5 | number = 1 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Modus operandi'' ===\nIn both the books and the show, Dexter selects his victims according to his adoptive father's code and kills them only after he has discovered enough evidence to prove their guilt.  For each victim, he ritually prepares a kill site that has some symbolic relevance to the killer (e.g., killing a boxer in a [[boxing ring]] or a gambler in a casino's storage shed). He completely drapes the site in clear plastic [[tarpaulin]] to catch all spilled blood, and often adorns it with evidence or photos of his victim's crimes.\n\nThe actual capture of his victims differs between the books and the show. On the show, it usually entails approaching the victims from behind and injecting an [[anesthetic]] (specified to be an animal [[tranquilizer]] called [[Etorphine|etorphine hydrochloride]], or M99), which renders his victims temporarily unconscious.<ref name=\"Return to Sender\">{{cite episode| title = Return to Sender | episodelink = Return to Sender (Dexter) | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = May 11, 2006| season = 1 | number = 06 }}</ref> The injection is a tradition established with his first victim, the hospital nurse.<ref name=\"Popping Cherry\">{{cite episode| title = Popping Cherry | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 15, 2006| season = 1 | number = 03 }}</ref> He uses the alias [[Patrick Bateman]] (the serial killer protagonist of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' ''[[American Psycho]]'') to procure these tranquilizers.<ref name=\"Return to Sender\"/> Other times, Dexter incapacitates his target by using either his hands or a [[garrote]] to cut off blood flow to the brain. In the books (and twice in the television program), he hides in the back seat of his victim's vehicle, then wraps a noose of fishing line around his victim's throat when he sits down. Dexter then uses the threat of [[asphyxiation]] to force his victim to drive them to his prepared kill site.\n\nOnce they have arrived, he either strangles them into unconsciousness or uses the noose to drag them to the kill site proper. In such cases, he anesthetizes them once he has informed them of his judgment. When victims awaken, they are naked and secured to a table with plastic wrap, and for stronger victims, duct tape. If he has not already done so, he confronts them with narrative evidence of their crimes. In the novels, the method usually involves an extended \"exploration\" with various sharp knives; on the show, Dexter's favored method usually involves an immediately fatal wound to the chest, neck, or gut with a variety of weapons. He occasionally varies his methods to fit particular victims; he kills his brother (and fellow serial killer) Brian by cutting his throat with a dinner knife (with the manner of the death and Dexter's own hesitation at inflicting the wound causing pathologists to conclude that Brian killed himself);<ref name=\"Born Free\">{{cite episode| title = Born Free | episodelink = Born Free (Dexter) | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 17, 2006| season = 1 | number = 12 }}</ref> he stabs gang lord [[List of Dexter characters#Little Chino|Little Chino]] in the chest with a [[machete]].<ref name=\"Waiting to Exhale\">{{cite episode| title = Waiting to Exhale | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 7, 2007| season = 2 | number = 02 }}</ref> He kills Santos Jimenez\u2014the man who murdered his mother\u2014in the same manner in which his mother was killed, by dismembering him with a chainsaw.  On other occasions, he uses hammers, drills, and other power tools.\n\nJust before the murder, Dexter collects trophies from his victims so he can relive the experience. Dexter's trophy signature is to slice the victim's right cheek with a surgical scalpel to collect a small blood sample, which he preserves on a [[microscope slide]]. In the TV show, Dexter keeps blood slides from all his victims neatly organized in a wooden filing box, which he hides inside his air conditioner. In the novels, he keeps them in a [[rosewood]] box on his bookcase.\n\nUltimately, he dismembers the bodies into several pieces, stows them and the plastic sheeting in black, heavy duty, [[biodegradable]] garbage bags, then adds rocks from the dock where he keeps his boat as anchor weight, and seals the bags with duct tape. He then takes the wrapped bags out on his boat and disposes of them by dumping them overboard into the ocean at a defined location; in the TV series, his dumping ground is a small [[oceanic trench]] just offshore. In one episode, the dump site and remains are inadvertently discovered by scuba divers, so he changes tactics, cutting the bodies into smaller pieces and dumping them further offshore, where they will be dispersed by the [[Gulf Stream]].  The books give less detail about disposal, with Dexter usually improvising depending on the victim. He has dumped some victims into the ocean due to the victim's owning a boat and doing the same with their own victims, but uses anchors to weight the bags. He disposes of another body in a vat of [[hydrochloric acid]].\n\n=== General biography ===\nDexter was born on February 15, 1971 (though according to Dr. Evelyn Vogel's journal in S8 E4, Dexter's date of birth was notated as \u201c2/1/71\u201d).<ref>{{Cite episode |title=This Is the Way the World Ends |episodelink=This Is the Way the World Ends |series= Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series) |credits=[[James Manos, Jr.]] |network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |station= |airdate=December 18, 2011 |season=6 |number=12}}</ref> At the story's outset, Dexter knows very little about his life prior to being adopted by Harry Morgan (a Miami detective) and his wife Doris. Harry only tells Dexter that his parents were killed in a car accident, and Harry brought him home from the crime scene. When Dexter is seven, Harry discovers that the boy has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that Dexter is a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] with a deep need to kill. Consequently, Harry decides to channel the boy's homicidal urges in a \"positive\" direction by teaching him to be a careful, meticulous killer of people who \"deserve it\"\u2014murderers who have escaped justice. Doris died when Dexter was 16, and Harry died when Dexter was 20.<ref name=\"Our\">{{Cite episode|title=Our Father|episodelink=Dexter (season 3)#ep1|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=September 28, 2008|season=3|number=1}}</ref> In the second season, Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant James Doakes]], discovers that Dexter forsook a career in medicine to pursue blood spatter analysis, despite being top of his class at medical school.

Dexter was born out of wedlock in 1971 to a young woman named Laura (Laura Moser on the show). In the novels, Laura was involved in the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]].<ref name=\"Born Free\"/> On the show, Laura was a [[police informant]] for Harry Morgan and his secret mistress. Dexter's father (named Joseph Driscoll on the show) was in the [[US Army]] and served in the [[Vietnam War]], but later became a drug-addicted criminal. Dexter also had an older brother, named Brian.<ref name=\"Born Free\"/><ref name=\"Truth Be Told\">{{cite episode | title = Truth Be Told | episodelink = | series = Dexter | serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 12, 2006| season = 1 | number = 11 }}</ref> On October 1, 1973, Dexter and Brian witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of three drug dealers.

In the novel, Brian escapes Miami, but returns in ''[[Dexter Is Delicious]]''. On the show, however, Dexter catches and (reluctantly) kills Brian, aware that Brian would never stop trying to kill Debra or other innocent people.<ref name=\"Born Free\"/>\n\n== Character development in the book series ==\n\n=== ''Darkly Dreaming Dexter'' ===\nDoris Morgan, Dexter's adoptive mother, dies of [[cancer]] when he is 16. When Dexter reaches puberty, he realizes that he is uninterested in sex and needs instruction by his father on how to behave with women. Around this time, Harry discovers that Dexter has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that the boy has an innate need to kill. Harry decides to channel Dexter's urges in a \"positive\" direction by teaching him to kill people who \"deserve it\", and to get rid of any evidence so he does not get caught.\n\nWhen Dexter is 18, Harry is diagnosed with cancer and hospitalized. There, Harry gives Dexter his \"permission\" to kill his first human victim, a nurse who is murdering her patients with overdoses of morphine.\n\nThroughout the novel, Dexter is involved in the investigation of the \"Tamiami Butcher\", a serial killer who dismembers his victims and puts the body parts in refrigerated trucks. The killer begins leaving taunting clues for Dexter to draw him in personally. The killer kidnaps Deborah and meets with Dexter in a storage container, and reveals their true connection: he is Brian, Dexter's biological brother. Brian tells Dexter that as children, they witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of drug dealers, and were locked in a crate for two days, surrounded by dead bodies. Dexter persuades Brian to spare Deborah, and instead the two of them kill Lieutenant [[Maria LaGuerta|Migdia LaGuerta]] (this does not occur in the TV series, in which LaGuerta &mdash; whose first name is changed to \"Maria\" &mdash; is a recurring character until her death at the end of the seventh season).\n\nAt the end of the novel, Deborah learns of Dexter's secret life after he saves her from Brian. She appears to accept it, but in subsequent books feels torn between her duties as a police officer and her loyalty to Dexter, whom she loves as her real brother.\n\n=== ''Dearly Devoted Dexter'' ===\nDexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant Doakes]], suspects Dexter of being involved in LaGuerta's murder, and starts following him around.  Doakes and Dexter are soon forced to work together to stop \"Dr. Danco\", a [[psychopath]]ic surgeon who removes his victims' limbs and sensory organs, leaving them in a state of living death.\n\nDoakes' pursuit forces Dexter to spend more time with Rita and her children. While attempting to bond with Astor and Cody, he realizes that they both have \"Dark Passengers\" of their own, and he resolves to provide them with the same \"guidance\" that Harry had given him. After finding [[FBI]] agent Kyle Chutsky's ring in Dexter's pocket, Rita believes Dexter is about to propose to her, and happily accepts before Dexter can explain.\n\nAt the climax of the book, Danco kidnaps Dexter and Doakes, mutilating the latter by removing his hands, feet, and tongue. Just as Danco is about to turn his attentions to Dexter, however, Deborah bursts in and kills him, saving Dexter's life.\n\n=== ''Dexter in the Dark'' ===\nIn ''[[Dexter in the Dark]],'' the third novel of the series, third-person narrative reveals through an entity referred to as \"IT\" that the Dark Passenger is an independent agent inhabiting Dexter, rather than a [[abnormal psychology|deviant psychological construction]]. Later, Dexter realizes the Dark Passenger is related to [[Moloch]], a [[Middle East]]ern deity worshiped in [[Bible|Biblical]] times. The Dark Passenger is one of Moloch's many offspring; Moloch had many children (formed through [[human sacrifice]]), and learned to share its knowledge with them. Eventually, there were too many, and Moloch killed the majority; however, some of them escaped into the world. In the novel, Dexter learns of the Dark Passenger's true nature when it briefly \"leaves\" him, frightening him into researching possible reasons for its existence.\n\nBy now, Dexter has embraced his role as stepfather to both children, but is annoyed when thoughts of them \u2013 wondering if Cody had brushed his teeth before bed and if Astor had set out her Easter dress for picture day at her school \u2013 distract him from hunting an intended victim. By the end of the book, he has begun training Astor and Cody to be careful, efficient killers, with great success: when the novel's antagonist, a Moloch-worshipping cult leader, kidnaps the three of them, Cody saves Dexter's life by killing one of his henchmen.\n\nThe novel ends with the Dark Passenger returning to Dexter on his wedding day.\n\n=== ''Dexter by Design'' ===\n''[[Dexter by Design]]'' opens in Paris, with Dexter and Rita on their honeymoon.  There, while visiting an art gallery, Dexter and Rita see an ''[[avant-garde]]'' performance piece called \"Jennifer's Leg\" in which the artist amputates her own limb.  When they return to Miami, Dexter crosses paths with a suspicious homicide detective and a serial killer who preys on tourists. In the novel's closing paragraphs, Dexter learns that Rita is pregnant with his child.\n\n===''Dexter is Delicious''===\nIn ''[[Dexter is Delicious]]'', Dexter grapples with raising his infant daughter, Lily-Anne, and wonders if she can help restore his humanity. Brian reappears in Dexter's life, situating himself with Dexter's family. The main event for the Miami Police Department is related to the appearance of cooked, partially eaten bodies and the disappearance of a teenaged girl, Samantha. Dexter has sex with Samantha while under the influence of [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], and tries to prevent Rita from finding out while helping Deborah solve the murders.\n\nThe novel reintroduces Dexter's brother, Brian, who shows up unexpectedly at Dexter's doorstep and inserts himself into his brother's new family. Dexter is reluctant at first to let Brian back into his life, but changes his mind when he sees him bond with Astor and Cody over their shared bloodlust.\n\n===''Double Dexter''===\nIn ''[[Double Dexter]]'', Dexter is seen by an anonymous Shadow while killing a victim in a secluded house. He continues on with his life until he starts receiving threatening emails from the person who claims to have seen him over a pile of dead body parts. Instead of turning him in, the Shadow, as he is referred to, takes it upon himself to take Dexter down. While Dexter tries to find and dispose of this Shadow, he quickly finds out that this person is much more capable than he initially suspected. Dexter is eventually framed for a murder, at least circumstantially, by his still anonymous Shadow.\n\nWhile on suspension from the police force for being a 'person of interest' in a murder investigation, Dexter finally finds out who his Shadow is: Doug Crowley. When he goes to dispatch Crowley, he finds he is once again being tailed by Doakes. Realizing that no way exists to take down Crowley with Doakes on his tail, he enlists the help of his brother, Brian, and finally thinks that his problems have been taken care of.\n\nWhile Brian is dispatching Doug Crowley, Dexter goes down to Key West with his family. Despite learning from his brother that a Doug Crowley had been taken care of, he finds the body of Detective Hood, the lead detective investigating him for murder, in his hotel suite, with the only explanation being that Brian killed the wrong Doug Crowley.\n\nWhile Dexter is preoccupied with the Key West police, Crowley finally attacks Dexter by abducting his step children, Cody and Astor. Dexter hunts down Crowley to a small island off the coast of Key West. He finally gets the drop on him, and Crowley escapes with Astor on a speedboat. Dexter manages to sneak aboard and overpower Crowley, with some assistance from Astor. They shove Crowley overboard, where he is eaten by a hammerhead shark.\n\nWith Crowley dispatched, Dexter can finally focus on clearing his name in the murder investigation. He plants evidence in Hood's apartment, thoroughly discrediting him, while Doakes is now under review for excessive force and intimidating a witness. These developments leave Dexter in the clear.\n\n===''Dexter's Final Cut''===\nIn ''[[Dexter's Final Cut]]'', a famous celebrity becomes obsessed with Dexter Morgan after researching him for his new role. When the Big Ticket Network comes to Miami, Deborah and Dexter are assigned as \"technical advisors\" to the stars of the show. Deborah is shadowed by female lead Jackie Forrest and Dexter is left with over-the-hill star Robert Chase. Sensing a strangeness in him, Dexter keeps Robert at arm's length. When a series of murders leads Miami Metro's Detective Anderson through a loop, Dexter is assigned to guard Jackie.\n\nDeborah and Dexter quickly realize that the string of bodies all bear a striking resemblance to Jackie. Dexter is assigned to protect her in her hotel room. At first, things seem perfectly routine; Dexter accompanies Jackie to the station each morning and returns with her to the hotel at night, but when the killer's identity is revealed to him, Dexter's \"Dark Passenger\" leads him out into the streets in pursuit.\n\nWhile working a crime scene where police have found another body matching the pattern of Jackie's obsessed fan, Dexter notices a man fitting the description in a kayak out in the bay watching the scene. Stealing away to his boat, Dexter slips alongside the man and kills him. After a hard day's work, they return to the hotel only to be disturbed in the night by sirens; Jackie's assistant Kathy has been murdered in the room below. The murder seems to fit the pattern, but Dexter notices several errors. That night, Dexter and Jackie fall into bed together and start a brief but intense affair. Dexter thinks he has fallen in love with Jackie, and considers leaving Rita.\n\nDexter is called onto the set to appear as a minor character in the series following a conversation with Jackie and Robert. Suddenly, Dexter gets a panicked phone call from Rita: Astor has disappeared. Fearing the worst, Dexter goes in search of Robert, who had shown a suspicious interest in Astor. He questions the show's director, who confirms that Robert is a [[pedophile]]. Moments later, he finds Jackie's dead body in her trailer. Dexter then pieces it together: Robert killed Kathy after she caught him in a compromising position with Astor, and then killed Jackie when she found out what he had done. Dexter follows a hunch and heads to Rita and his new house. Robert catches him sneaking in and knocks him unconscious.\n\nWaking some time later, Dexter finds Astor and Robert together in the house. Robert has lured Astor with promises of stardom, and she appears ready to help him to kill Dexter. Thinking quickly, Dexter tells Astor that Robert will be arrested and sent to prison, and is thus useless to her. When Robert tries to take Astor as a hostage, she stabs him to death. Dexter realizes that circumstantial evidence implicates him as the murderer of Robert and Jackie, and that the only person who can exonerate him is Rita. When Dexter searches the house, however, he finds that Rita is dead, murdered by Robert. Dexter sees that his luck has finally run out, and waits for the police to arrive.\n\n===''Dexter is Dead''===\nIn the final book of the series' ''[[Dexter is Dead]]''; Dexter is in jail after being charged with Robert's crimes - thanks to the corrupt Detective Anderson, who has falsified evidence and reports to make it seem that Dexter is guilty. Only Masuoka tries to clear Dexter's good name, but he gets swatted down by everyone from the beat cops to the state attorney. Deborah, meanwhile, disowns Dexter for cheating on Rita and putting Astor in danger, and decides to take custody of his children.\n\nDexter's brother Brian bails him out of prison and gets him the best lawyer in town, but the lawyer happens to be in the pocket of a very powerful Mexican drug cartel led by a man named Raul, who is after Brian. The cartel tries to kill Dexter several times to get to Brian. Eventually, Dexter and Brian find out their lawyer sold them out to the cartel, so they kill him and all the cartel's members, save for one, whom they torture to find out where Raul is holding Cody and Astor.\n\nBrian, Deborah, and Dexter team up, storm Raul's yacht, and take the kids back. Deborah and the kids get away, but Brian is killed by a bomb and Raul shoots Dexter in the shoulder. Dexter kills Raul and sets a bomb so no evidence is left, then jumps off the boat into the water and sinks into the ocean. The book leaves it open to interpretation whether he survives.\n\n== Dexter in the television show ==\n\n=== Season one ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DexterBornFree.jpg|thumb|Dexter with his biological brother, Brian.]] -->\nBy the start of season one, Dexter is a [[Bloodstain Pattern Analysis|blood spatter analyst]] for the Miami Metro Police Department; in his \"secret life\", he is a serial killer who preys on people who are themselves murderers.

Dexter tearfully slits Brian's throat, staging the crime scene to make it look like Brian committed suicide. Eventually, the police find the body and close the case. The season ends with Dexter wondering what it would be like if everyone knew his secrets and imagining being celebrated outside the police station by an adoring crowd.<ref name=\"Born Free\"/>\n\n=== Season two ===\nIn season two, Dexter is so haunted by killing his own brother that he cannot resume killing. To make matters worse, Debra, traumatized by her ordeal with the Ice Truck Killer, moves in with Dexter, which hinders his secret life. Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant James Doakes]] ([[Erik King]]), harbors lingering suspicions about Dexter's possible connection with the Ice Truck Killer, and he begins to tail Dexter everywhere. To throw him off, Dexter reluctantly refrains from killing for a month. Just as Dexter finds a chance to kill again, over 30 bodies (Dexter's victims) are found in a Miami harbor, provoking a massive search for the so-called \"Bay Harbor Butcher\".\n\nRita soon figures out that Dexter has been lying to her and concludes that Dexter is a heroin addict, with which he goes along to hide his real secret. Rita forces him to attend [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings, where he meets [[Lila West|Lila Tournay]] ([[Jaime Murray]]), who becomes his sponsor.

Eventually, however, Dexter's desire to be with Astor and Cody compels him to ask for Rita's forgiveness; she grants it, and they get back together. Dexter learns that Lila is in fact a sociopath who attends NA meetings to vicariously experience emotions she is incapable of feeling, and tells her to leave him alone. Lila retaliates by framing Dexter's colleague and friend [[Angel Batista]] ([[David Zayas]]) for [[rape]], though he is eventually cleared.\n\nDoakes' suspicions subside some when he realizes that Dexter is attending Narcotics Anonymous, but he begins to suspect this is a cover for an even worse secret.

A struggling Dexter attempts to move on by hiring an Irish nanny to look after Harrison while he goes out to find his next kill. He settles on Boyd Fowler ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), a convicted [[rape|rapist]] whose connection to a string of missing women makes him the perfect target. Dexter kills Fowler, only to find Fowler's latest victim, a young woman named [[Lumen Pierce]] ([[Julia Stiles]]), who is still alive. After debating whether or not to kill her (and thus eliminate a potential witness), Dexter gives in to his better nature and decides to protect her.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dexter the big one.jpg|right|thumb|Dexter and Lumen are captured by Jordan Chase.]] -->\nLumen is slow to trust Dexter, but comes to realize he means her no harm. She reveals that Fowler was not the only man who raped her. As Lumen gradually becomes integrated into Dexter's life, she begs him to help her to go after her attackers; Dexter reluctantly agrees. They stalk a children's dentist and the head of security for a high-profile motivational speaker named [[Jordan Chase]] ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]). As the plot thickens, it becomes clear that Chase was also one of Lumen's attackers. Complicating the situation further is Detective [[Joey Quinn]] ([[Desmond Harrington]]), who believes that Dexter killed Rita and is getting too close to finding out Dexter's secrets.\n\nTo keep the police occupied, Dexter puts them on Fowler's trail. Dexter becomes personally acquainted with Chase and stumbles onto a photo that proves that all of Lumen's attackers (who are also guilty of [[torture|torturing]], raping, and murdering 12 other women) have known each other since childhood.\n\nDexter eventually finds a vial of blood that Chase wears around his neck. After extracting a sample, he discovers that the blood belongs to Emily Birch ([[Angela Bettis]]), the rape club's first victim. She provides Lumen and Dexter with the identity of the mysterious fourth attacker in the photo, Alex Tilden ([[Scott Grimes]]). Dexter allows Lumen to kill Tilden by stabbing him in the heart. Dexter and Lumen then become lovers, before continuing their hunt for Chase. As Lumen and Dexter plan to capture Chase, Dexter realizes cameras are in his apartment. Dexter, assuming he is being watched by Quinn, waits for him to return to the surveillance van. As Dexter opens the door to capture Quinn, Stan Liddy ([[Peter Weller]]), a private investigator Quinn had hired to tail Dexter, stuns Dexter with a taser. After Liddy calls Quinn to bust Dexter, Dexter attacks Liddy and kills him in self-defense, after Liddy tries to stab him.\n\nWhile Dexter deals with Liddy, Lumen gets a call from Emily. Emily appears frightened of Chase and threatens to call the police, but she is revealed to be setting a trap to allow Chase to capture them. Dexter returns to the apartment to find Lumen gone. He tracks Chase to the camp where the rape club had started. In a fit of emotion, he accidentally wrecks the stolen car he is driving, allowing Chase to take him prisoner. Chase brings Dexter to the building in which he is holding Lumen. As Chase is about to kill them, Dexter frees himself with a knife he had stashed and immobilizes Chase by stabbing him through his foot and into the floor. Dexter cuts Lumen free and knocks Chase out. When Chase wakes up, Dexter allows Lumen to kill him. While they are still in the kill room, preparing to move the body, Debra arrives on the scene, though her view of Dexter and Lumen is obstructed by a sheet of plastic. Dexter and Lumen, trapped, remain silent. Without requesting their identity, Debra warns them that she is about to call in backup and allows them to flee before the police arrive.\n\nThe next day, when Dexter returns from work, Lumen tells him that she no longer feels the need to kill, and they cannot be together because Dexter's homicidal urges will never leave him. She then leaves to return to the life she had before her kidnapping. The season ends with Dexter surrounded by friends and family at Harrison's first birthday party.\n\n===Season six===\nAbout a year later, Harrison is old enough to walk, and Dexter has begun searching for a preschool, though his [[atheism]] conflicts with the largely religious preschools to which he applies. He finds a greater understanding through Brother Sam ([[Mos Def]], credited as Mos and later as yasiin bey<!-- DO NOT CAPITALIZE yasiin bey AS THIS IS THE EXACT MANNER HE WAS CREDITED ON THE SHOW! -->), an ex-con and murderer whom Dexter once considered killing, who has since become a [[born-again Christian]] who counsels other ex-cons. Dexter initially sees Brother Sam's religious conversion as a scam, but Brother Sam proves himself a truly changed man, and even helps Dexter through a crisis when Harrison undergoes an [[appendectomy]].\n\nHowever, things go awry when Brother Sam is shot and mortally wounded in his garage. Dexter realizes that a friend of Sam's, Nick ([[Germaine De Leon]]), is responsible, and swears revenge. On his deathbed, Sam forgives Nick and implores Dexter to also forgive him. Dexter considers sparing Nick when he initially appears remorseful, but that proves to be an act; after Sam refuses to press charges on his deathbed, Nick brags about what he did.  An enraged Dexter drowns Nick in the surf, reawakening in him the presence of his dead brother, Brian, who begins to guide him in much the same way that Harry's presence once had.\n\nBrian convinces Dexter to go after Arthur Mitchell's son Jonah ([[Brando Eaton]]), who appears to have also become a killer. Dexter adheres to his father's code, however, causing a schism between his personalities. Dexter finally catches Jonah with the intent of killing him, but relents when he sees that Jonah feels guilty about failing to protect his sister, who committed suicide by slitting an artery in a bathtub, similar to how her father killed his victims. When Jonah and his mother discovered Jonah's sister, their mother blamed the children for their father's shortcomings. This enraged Jonah, who then killed his mother. Learning this new information, Dexter rejects Brian and reaffirms the \"Code of Harry\", leaving Jonah alive to forgive himself.\n\nIn the meantime, Dexter begins investigating \"the Doomsday Killer\", a serial killer who models his crimes after the [[Book of Revelation]]. Dexter soon finds that the murders are being committed by two people: a [[religious fanaticism|fanatically religious]] college professor named [[List of Dexter characters#James Gellar|James Gellar]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Travis Marshall]] ([[Colin Hanks]]). Dexter tracks Marshall down, but balks at killing him, believing that Marshall has a conscience and is simply being led down the wrong path. Dexter then resolves to save Marshall from himself.\n\nAfter the death of Marshall's sister, Dexter follows him to the old church and discovers Gellar's body in a freezer, concluding that Marshall had been acting alone the whole time, with Gellar as a [[dissociative identity]]. After being forced to accept Gellar's death, Marshall begins to target Dexter, managing to capture him and enact the [[lake of fire]]. Dexter escapes, however, and is rescued by a fishing boat carrying illegal immigrants bound for Florida. Marshall kidnaps Harrison to sacrifice him as the \"[[lamb of God]]\" during a solar eclipse, but Dexter rescues Harrison and takes Marshall to the old church. Debra walks into the church\u2014seeking to find Dexter after a recent meeting with a therapist helped her realize that she was in love with her adoptive brother\u2014only to see Dexter kill Marshall.<ref>{{cite episode\n| title = [[This is the Way the World Ends]] | episodelink = | series = Dexter\n| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = 2011-12-18\n| season = 6 | number = 12 }}</ref>\n\n===Season seven===\nIn the season-seven opener, Dexter tells a bewildered Debra that he killed Marshall on impulse after Marshall ambushed him.

To make matters worse, Miami-Metro Captain [[Maria LaGuerta]] ([[Lauren Velez]]) reopens the Bay Harbor Butcher case, convinced that Doakes was innocent and that Dexter is hiding something.  When Dexter tries to kill Hector Estrada ([[Nestor Serrano]]), the man who ordered Dexter's mother's murder, LaGuerta arrives at the scene, forcing him to let Estrada go so he can escape.

Sirko asks for Dexter's protection against his former associates, who fear that he will testify against them; in return, he promises Dexter that he will let him live. Dexter refuses, but ends up inadvertently coming to Sirko's aid when one of his former henchmen attacks them both.

He kidnaps and kills Estrada to lure LaGuerta in, and then knocks her unconscious, planning to shoot her to make it look like Estrada killed her. At that moment, Debra bursts in, holding Dexter at gunpoint and begging him not to go through with it. LaGuerta regains consciousness and urges Debra to kill Dexter.

Hall]], and by [[Devon Graye]], [[Dominic Janes]], and [[Maxwell Huckabee]] as a youth.\n\nIn both the novels and the TV series, Dexter is a [[forensic science|forensic]] [[blood spatter analysis|blood spatter analyst]] who works for the fictitious Miami-Metro Police Department. In his spare time, he is a [[vigilante]] [[serial killer]] who targets other murderers who have evaded the justice system. He follows a code of ethics taught to him in childhood by his adoptive father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry]], which he refers to as \"The Code\" or \"The Code of Harry\" and hinges on two principles: Dexter can only kill people after finding conclusive evidence that they are guilty of murder, and he must not get caught.\n\nDexter's novel appearances include ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]'' (2004), ''[[Dearly Devoted Dexter]]'' (2005), ''[[Dexter in the Dark]]'' (2007), ''[[Dexter by Design]]'' (2009), ''[[Dexter Is Delicious]]'' (2010), ''[[Double Dexter]]'' (2011), ''[[Dexter's Final Cut]]'' (2013), and ''[[Dexter Is Dead]]'' (2015).  The eighth and final novel in the series written by Lindsay was titled ''Dexter Is Dead'', and released in July 2015, signifying the ending of the character.\n\nIn 2006, the first novel was adapted into the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] TV series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and its companion web series ''[[Dexter: Early Cuts]]''. Season one is largely based on the first novel, ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]'' (2004), but the following seasons veered away from the rest of the book series.\n\nFor his performance as Dexter, [[Michael C. Hall]] has received critical acclaim. In 2009, he was awarded a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series or Drama]]. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' ranked Dexter Morgan number 6 on their list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011<ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Jackson |title=The 20 Best TV Characters of 2011 |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/12/the-20-best-tv-characters-of-2011.html?p=2 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |publisher=Paste Media Group|location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=December 5, 2011|access-date=June 30, 2012}}</ref> In addition, Hall was awarded with a [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Award]] for [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama|Individual Achievement in Drama]] in 2007, and was nominated five times for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]].\n\n== Characterization ==\n\n=== Psychological profile ===\nSince childhood, Dexter Morgan has felt homicidal urges directed by an inner voice he calls \"the Dark Passenger\"; when that voice cannot be ignored, he \"lets the Dark Passenger do the driving\". He abides by a moral code taught to him by his adoptive father, [[Harry Morgan (Dexter)|Harry]], in which he only allows himself to kill people who are themselves murderers.\n\nDexter considers himself emotionally divorced from the rest of humanity; in his narration, he refers to \"humans\" as if he is not one himself. He makes frequent references to an internal feeling of emptiness and says he kills to feel alive. He claims to have no feelings or [[conscience]], and that all of his emotional responses are part of a well-rehearsed act to conceal his true nature. He has no interest in romance or sex; he considers his relationship with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) [[Rita Bennett]] to be part of his \"disguise\".\n\nDexter likes children, finding them much more interesting than adults; accordingly, he treats victims who prey on children with particular wrath. His connection to Rita's children, Astor, and Cody, sometimes supersedes his relationship with Rita herself. For example, in the novels, Dexter continues his relationship with Rita because he realizes that Rita's children are exhibiting the same [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] tendencies he did at their age, and he tries to control their violent urges by providing them with \"guidance\" similar to that which Harry provided him. In the show, Dexter deviates from his code of only killing murderers to dispose of a [[pedophile]] who is [[stalking]] Astor.\n\nAnimals do not like Dexter, which can cause noise problems when he stalks a victim who has pets. The novels reveal that he once owned a dog that barked and growled at him until he was forced to get rid of it and a turtle that hid from him in its shell until it died of starvation.\n\nDexter occasionally behaves in a way that suggests that he does feel some rudimentary human connection. He acknowledges loyalty to family, particularly to his late adoptive father, saying: \"If I were capable of love, how I would have loved Harry.\" Since Harry's death, Dexter's only family is his sister [[Debra Morgan|Debra]], Harry and Doris' biological daughter. Dexter admits that he cannot hurt Debra or allow anyone else to harm her because he is \"fond of her\". In the [[Dexter (episode)|first episode]] of [[Dexter (season 1)|season one]], he says: \"I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb\".\n\nIn the first season, Dexter's relationship with Rita sets in motion his slow but steady introduction to human feelings, progressing further each season. During the episode \"[[Shrink Wrap (Dexter episode)|Shrink Wrap]]\", when his current target is a psychologist, Dexter infiltrates the doctor's office by posing as a patient, and the doctor astutely speculates that part of Dexter's problem in admitting to his feelings is his need for control. In the second-season finale, \"[[The British Invasion (Dexter)|The British Invasion]]\", Dexter finally admits that he needs the people in his life.<ref name=\"The British Invasion\">{{cite episode\n| title = The British Invasion | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 14, 2007| season = 2 | number = 9 }}</ref> In [[Dexter (season 3)|season three]], when he is threatened by a target, Dexter fights to live because he wants to see his unborn child. In [[Dexter (season 4)|season four]], before killing a police officer who has murdered her own husband and daughter, Dexter is overwhelmed with the realization that he does not want to lose his new family. He is also horrified when he finds out that one of his potential victims is an abusive husband and father; Dexter vehemently insists he is nothing like that and would never hurt his family. In [[Dexter (season 5)|season five]], after Rita is murdered, Dexter realizes that he genuinely loved her and is devastated by losing her.<ref name=\"My Bad\">{{cite episode| title = My Bad | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 26, 2010| season = 5 | number = 1 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Modus operandi'' ===\nIn both the books and the show, Dexter selects his victims according to his adoptive father's code and kills them only after he has discovered enough evidence to prove their guilt.  For each victim, he ritually prepares a kill site that has some symbolic relevance to the killer (e.g., killing a boxer in a [[boxing ring]] or a gambler in a casino's storage shed). He completely drapes the site in clear plastic [[tarpaulin]] to catch all spilled blood, and often adorns it with evidence or photos of his victim's crimes.\n\nThe actual capture of his victims differs between the books and the show. On the show, it usually entails approaching the victims from behind and injecting an [[anesthetic]] (specified to be an animal [[tranquilizer]] called [[Etorphine|etorphine hydrochloride]], or M99), which renders his victims temporarily unconscious.<ref name=\"Return to Sender\">{{cite episode| title = Return to Sender | episodelink = Return to Sender (Dexter) | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = May 11, 2006| season = 1 | number = 06 }}</ref> The injection is a tradition established with his first victim, the hospital nurse.<ref name=\"Popping Cherry\">{{cite episode| title = Popping Cherry | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 15, 2006| season = 1 | number = 03 }}</ref> He uses the alias [[Patrick Bateman]] (the serial killer protagonist of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' ''[[American Psycho]]'') to procure these tranquilizers.<ref name=\"Return to Sender\"/> Other times, Dexter incapacitates his target by using either his hands or a [[garrote]] to cut off blood flow to the brain. In the books (and twice in the television program), he hides in the back seat of his victim's vehicle, then wraps a noose of fishing line around his victim's throat when he sits down. Dexter then uses the threat of [[asphyxiation]] to force his victim to drive them to his prepared kill site.\n\nOnce they have arrived, he either strangles them into unconsciousness or uses the noose to drag them to the kill site proper. In such cases, he anesthetizes them once he has informed them of his judgment. When victims awaken, they are naked and secured to a table with plastic wrap, and for stronger victims, duct tape. If he has not already done so, he confronts them with narrative evidence of their crimes. In the novels, the method usually involves an extended \"exploration\" with various sharp knives; on the show, Dexter's favored method usually involves an immediately fatal wound to the chest, neck, or gut with a variety of weapons. He occasionally varies his methods to fit particular victims; he kills his brother (and fellow serial killer) Brian by cutting his throat with a dinner knife (with the manner of the death and Dexter's own hesitation at inflicting the wound causing pathologists to conclude that Brian killed himself);<ref name=\"Born Free\">{{cite episode| title = Born Free | episodelink = Born Free (Dexter) | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 17, 2006| season = 1 | number = 12 }}</ref> he stabs gang lord [[List of Dexter characters#Little Chino|Little Chino]] in the chest with a [[machete]].<ref name=\"Waiting to Exhale\">{{cite episode| title = Waiting to Exhale | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 7, 2007| season = 2 | number = 02 }}</ref> He kills Santos Jimenez\u2014the man who murdered his mother\u2014in the same manner in which his mother was killed, by dismembering him with a chainsaw.  On other occasions, he uses hammers, drills, and other power tools.\n\nJust before the murder, Dexter collects trophies from his victims so he can relive the experience. Dexter's trophy signature is to slice the victim's right cheek with a surgical scalpel to collect a small blood sample, which he preserves on a [[microscope slide]]. In the TV show, Dexter keeps blood slides from all his victims neatly organized in a wooden filing box, which he hides inside his air conditioner. In the novels, he keeps them in a [[rosewood]] box on his bookcase.\n\nUltimately, he dismembers the bodies into several pieces, stows them and the plastic sheeting in black, heavy duty, [[biodegradable]] garbage bags, then adds rocks from the dock where he keeps his boat as anchor weight, and seals the bags with duct tape. He then takes the wrapped bags out on his boat and disposes of them by dumping them overboard into the ocean at a defined location; in the TV series, his dumping ground is a small [[oceanic trench]] just offshore. In one episode, the dump site and remains are inadvertently discovered by scuba divers, so he changes tactics, cutting the bodies into smaller pieces and dumping them further offshore, where they will be dispersed by the [[Gulf Stream]].  The books give less detail about disposal, with Dexter usually improvising depending on the victim. He has dumped some victims into the ocean due to the victim's owning a boat and doing the same with their own victims, but uses anchors to weight the bags. He disposes of another body in a vat of [[hydrochloric acid]].\n\n=== General biography ===\nDexter was born on February 15, 1971 (though according to Dr. Evelyn Vogel's journal in S8 E4, Dexter's date of birth was notated as \u201c2/1/71\u201d).<ref>{{Cite episode |title=This Is the Way the World Ends |episodelink=This Is the Way the World Ends |series= Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series) |credits=[[James Manos, Jr.]] |network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |station= |airdate=December 18, 2011 |season=6 |episode=12}}</ref> At the story's outset, Dexter knows very little about his life prior to being adopted by Harry Morgan (a Miami detective) and his wife Doris. Harry only tells Dexter that his parents were killed in a car accident, and Harry brought him home from the crime scene. When Dexter is seven, Harry discovers that the boy has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that Dexter is a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] with a deep need to kill. Consequently, Harry decides to channel the boy's homicidal urges in a \"positive\" direction by teaching him to be a careful, meticulous killer of people who \"deserve it\"\u2014murderers who have escaped justice. Doris died when Dexter was 16, and Harry died when Dexter was 20.<ref name=\"Our\">{{Cite episode|title=Our Father|episodelink=Dexter (season 3)#ep1|series=Dexter|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=Showtime|airdate=September 28, 2008|season=3|number=1}}</ref> In the second season, Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant James Doakes]], discovers that Dexter forsook a career in medicine to pursue blood spatter analysis, despite being top of his class at medical school.

Dexter was born out of wedlock in 1971 to a young woman named Laura (Laura Moser on the show). In the novels, Laura was involved in the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]].<ref name=\"Born Free\"/> On the show, Laura was a [[police informant]] for Harry Morgan and his secret mistress. Dexter's father (named Joseph Driscoll on the show) was in the [[US Army]] and served in the [[Vietnam War]], but later became a drug-addicted criminal. Dexter also had an older brother, named Brian.<ref name=\"Born Free\"/><ref name=\"Truth Be Told\">{{cite episode | title = Truth Be Told | episodelink = | series = Dexter | serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 12, 2006| season = 1 | number = 11 }}</ref> On October 1, 1973, Dexter and Brian witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of three drug dealers.  For two days, the brothers were left in a crate, surrounded by dismembered body parts and sitting in a pool of blood.{{cref|a}}  Harry adopted the three-year-old Dexter, while Brian was left to the [[child welfare]] [[Child and family services|system]].{{cref|b}}\n\nDexter only remembers his mother's murder later in life, when he is called to an extremely bloody crime scene left by his brother\u2014who has also grown up to be a serial killer.  In the novel, Brian escapes Miami, but returns in ''[[Dexter Is Delicious]]''. On the show, however, Dexter catches and (reluctantly) kills Brian, aware that Brian would never stop trying to kill Debra or other innocent people.<ref name=\"Born Free\"/>\n\n== Character development in the book series ==\n\n=== ''Darkly Dreaming Dexter'' ===\nDoris Morgan, Dexter's adoptive mother, dies of [[cancer]] when he is 16. When Dexter reaches puberty, he realizes that he is uninterested in sex and needs instruction by his father on how to behave with women. Around this time, Harry discovers that Dexter has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that the boy has an innate need to kill. Harry decides to channel Dexter's urges in a \"positive\" direction by teaching him to kill people who \"deserve it\", and to get rid of any evidence so he does not get caught.\n\nWhen Dexter is 18, Harry is diagnosed with cancer and hospitalized. There, Harry gives Dexter his \"permission\" to kill his first human victim, a nurse who is murdering her patients with overdoses of morphine.\n\nThroughout the novel, Dexter is involved in the investigation of the \"Tamiami Butcher\", a serial killer who dismembers his victims and puts the body parts in refrigerated trucks. The killer begins leaving taunting clues for Dexter to draw him in personally. The killer kidnaps Deborah and meets with Dexter in a storage container, and reveals their true connection: he is Brian, Dexter's biological brother. Brian tells Dexter that as children, they witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of drug dealers, and were locked in a crate for two days, surrounded by dead bodies. Dexter persuades Brian to spare Deborah, and instead the two of them kill Lieutenant [[Maria LaGuerta|Migdia LaGuerta]] (this does not occur in the TV series, in which LaGuerta &mdash; whose first name is changed to \"Maria\" &mdash; is a recurring character until her death at the end of the seventh season).\n\nAt the end of the novel, Deborah learns of Dexter's secret life after he saves her from Brian. She appears to accept it, but in subsequent books feels torn between her duties as a police officer and her loyalty to Dexter, whom she loves as her real brother.\n\n=== ''Dearly Devoted Dexter'' ===\nDexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant Doakes]], suspects Dexter of being involved in LaGuerta's murder, and starts following him around.  Doakes and Dexter are soon forced to work together to stop \"Dr. Danco\", a [[psychopath]]ic surgeon who removes his victims' limbs and sensory organs, leaving them in a state of living death.\n\nDoakes' pursuit forces Dexter to spend more time with Rita and her children. While attempting to bond with Astor and Cody, he realizes that they both have \"Dark Passengers\" of their own, and he resolves to provide them with the same \"guidance\" that Harry had given him. After finding [[FBI]] agent Kyle Chutsky's ring in Dexter's pocket, Rita believes Dexter is about to propose to her, and happily accepts before Dexter can explain.\n\nAt the climax of the book, Danco kidnaps Dexter and Doakes, mutilating the latter by removing his hands, feet, and tongue. Just as Danco is about to turn his attentions to Dexter, however, Deborah bursts in and kills him, saving Dexter's life.\n\n=== ''Dexter in the Dark'' ===\nIn ''[[Dexter in the Dark]],'' the third novel of the series, third-person narrative reveals through an entity referred to as \"IT\" that the Dark Passenger is an independent agent inhabiting Dexter, rather than a [[abnormal psychology|deviant psychological construction]]. Later, Dexter realizes the Dark Passenger is related to [[Moloch]], a [[Middle East]]ern deity worshiped in [[Bible|Biblical]] times. The Dark Passenger is one of Moloch's many offspring; Moloch had many children (formed through [[human sacrifice]]), and learned to share its knowledge with them. Eventually, there were too many, and Moloch killed the majority; however, some of them escaped into the world. In the novel, Dexter learns of the Dark Passenger's true nature when it briefly \"leaves\" him, frightening him into researching possible reasons for its existence.\n\nBy now, Dexter has embraced his role as stepfather to both children, but is annoyed when thoughts of them \u2013 wondering if Cody had brushed his teeth before bed and if Astor had set out her Easter dress for picture day at her school \u2013 distract him from hunting an intended victim. By the end of the book, he has begun training Astor and Cody to be careful, efficient killers, with great success: when the novel's antagonist, a Moloch-worshipping cult leader, kidnaps the three of them, Cody saves Dexter's life by killing one of his henchmen.\n\nThe novel ends with the Dark Passenger returning to Dexter on his wedding day.\n\n=== ''Dexter by Design'' ===\n''[[Dexter by Design]]'' opens in Paris, with Dexter and Rita on their honeymoon.  There, while visiting an art gallery, Dexter and Rita see an ''[[avant-garde]]'' performance piece called \"Jennifer's Leg\" in which the artist amputates her own limb.  When they return to Miami, Dexter crosses paths with a suspicious homicide detective and a serial killer who preys on tourists. In the novel's closing paragraphs, Dexter learns that Rita is pregnant with his child.\n\n===''Dexter is Delicious''===\nIn ''[[Dexter is Delicious]]'', Dexter grapples with raising his infant daughter, Lily-Anne, and wonders if she can help restore his humanity. Brian reappears in Dexter's life, situating himself with Dexter's family. The main event for the Miami Police Department is related to the appearance of cooked, partially eaten bodies and the disappearance of a teenaged girl, Samantha. Dexter has sex with Samantha while under the influence of [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], and tries to prevent Rita from finding out while helping Deborah solve the murders.\n\nThe novel reintroduces Dexter's brother, Brian, who shows up unexpectedly at Dexter's doorstep and inserts himself into his brother's new family. Dexter is reluctant at first to let Brian back into his life, but changes his mind when he sees him bond with Astor and Cody over their shared bloodlust.\n\n===''Double Dexter''===\nIn ''[[Double Dexter]]'', Dexter is seen by an anonymous Shadow while killing a victim in a secluded house. He continues on with his life until he starts receiving threatening emails from the person who claims to have seen him over a pile of dead body parts. Instead of turning him in, the Shadow, as he is referred to, takes it upon himself to take Dexter down. While Dexter tries to find and dispose of this Shadow, he quickly finds out that this person is much more capable than he initially suspected. Dexter is eventually framed for a murder, at least circumstantially, by his still anonymous Shadow.\n\nWhile on suspension from the police force for being a 'person of interest' in a murder investigation, Dexter finally finds out who his Shadow is: Doug Crowley. When he goes to dispatch Crowley, he finds he is once again being tailed by Doakes. Realizing that no way exists to take down Crowley with Doakes on his tail, he enlists the help of his brother, Brian, and finally thinks that his problems have been taken care of.\n\nWhile Brian is dispatching Doug Crowley, Dexter goes down to Key West with his family. Despite learning from his brother that a Doug Crowley had been taken care of, he finds the body of Detective Hood, the lead detective investigating him for murder, in his hotel suite, with the only explanation being that Brian killed the wrong Doug Crowley.\n\nWhile Dexter is preoccupied with the Key West police, Crowley finally attacks Dexter by abducting his step children, Cody and Astor. Dexter hunts down Crowley to a small island off the coast of Key West. He finally gets the drop on him, and Crowley escapes with Astor on a speedboat. Dexter manages to sneak aboard and overpower Crowley, with some assistance from Astor. They shove Crowley overboard, where he is eaten by a hammerhead shark.\n\nWith Crowley dispatched, Dexter can finally focus on clearing his name in the murder investigation. He plants evidence in Hood's apartment, thoroughly discrediting him, while Doakes is now under review for excessive force and intimidating a witness. These developments leave Dexter in the clear.\n\n===''Dexter's Final Cut''===\nIn ''[[Dexter's Final Cut]]'', a famous celebrity becomes obsessed with Dexter Morgan after researching him for his new role. When the Big Ticket Network comes to Miami, Deborah and Dexter are assigned as \"technical advisors\" to the stars of the show. Deborah is shadowed by female lead Jackie Forrest and Dexter is left with over-the-hill star Robert Chase. Sensing a strangeness in him, Dexter keeps Robert at arm's length. When a series of murders leads Miami Metro's Detective Anderson through a loop, Dexter is assigned to guard Jackie.\n\nDeborah and Dexter quickly realize that the string of bodies all bear a striking resemblance to Jackie. Dexter is assigned to protect her in her hotel room. At first, things seem perfectly routine; Dexter accompanies Jackie to the station each morning and returns with her to the hotel at night, but when the killer's identity is revealed to him, Dexter's \"Dark Passenger\" leads him out into the streets in pursuit.\n\nWhile working a crime scene where police have found another body matching the pattern of Jackie's obsessed fan, Dexter notices a man fitting the description in a kayak out in the bay watching the scene. Stealing away to his boat, Dexter slips alongside the man and kills him. After a hard day's work, they return to the hotel only to be disturbed in the night by sirens; Jackie's assistant Kathy has been murdered in the room below. The murder seems to fit the pattern, but Dexter notices several errors. That night, Dexter and Jackie fall into bed together and start a brief but intense affair. Dexter thinks he has fallen in love with Jackie, and considers leaving Rita.\n\nDexter is called onto the set to appear as a minor character in the series following a conversation with Jackie and Robert. Suddenly, Dexter gets a panicked phone call from Rita: Astor has disappeared. Fearing the worst, Dexter goes in search of Robert, who had shown a suspicious interest in Astor. He questions the show's director, who confirms that Robert is a [[pedophile]]. Moments later, he finds Jackie's dead body in her trailer. Dexter then pieces it together: Robert killed Kathy after she caught him in a compromising position with Astor, and then killed Jackie when she found out what he had done. Dexter follows a hunch and heads to Rita and his new house. Robert catches him sneaking in and knocks him unconscious.\n\nWaking some time later, Dexter finds Astor and Robert together in the house. Robert has lured Astor with promises of stardom, and she appears ready to help him to kill Dexter. Thinking quickly, Dexter tells Astor that Robert will be arrested and sent to prison, and is thus useless to her. When Robert tries to take Astor as a hostage, she stabs him to death. Dexter realizes that circumstantial evidence implicates him as the murderer of Robert and Jackie, and that the only person who can exonerate him is Rita. When Dexter searches the house, however, he finds that Rita is dead, murdered by Robert. Dexter sees that his luck has finally run out, and waits for the police to arrive.\n\n===''Dexter is Dead''===\nIn the final book of the series' ''[[Dexter is Dead]]''; Dexter is in jail after being charged with Robert's crimes - thanks to the corrupt Detective Anderson, who has falsified evidence and reports to make it seem that Dexter is guilty. Only Masuoka tries to clear Dexter's good name, but he gets swatted down by everyone from the beat cops to the state attorney. Deborah, meanwhile, disowns Dexter for cheating on Rita and putting Astor in danger, and decides to take custody of his children.\n\nDexter's brother Brian bails him out of prison and gets him the best lawyer in town, but the lawyer happens to be in the pocket of a very powerful Mexican drug cartel led by a man named Raul, who is after Brian. The cartel tries to kill Dexter several times to get to Brian. Eventually, Dexter and Brian find out their lawyer sold them out to the cartel, so they kill him and all the cartel's members, save for one, whom they torture to find out where Raul is holding Cody and Astor.\n\nBrian, Deborah, and Dexter team up, storm Raul's yacht, and take the kids back. Deborah and the kids get away, but Brian is killed by a bomb and Raul shoots Dexter in the shoulder. Dexter kills Raul and sets a bomb so no evidence is left, then jumps off the boat into the water and sinks into the ocean. The book leaves it open to interpretation whether he survives.\n\n== Dexter in the television show ==\n\n=== Season one ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DexterBornFree.jpg|thumb|Dexter with his biological brother, Brian.]] -->\nBy the start of season one, Dexter is a [[Bloodstain Pattern Analysis|blood spatter analyst]] for the Miami Metro Police Department; in his \"secret life\", he is a serial killer who preys on people who are themselves murderers.

One day, Dexter receives official notification that a man named Joseph Driscoll is his biological father, and that, since Dexter is the only next of kin, he must come settle the estate and claim the body.  Debra's new boyfriend, Rudy Cooper ([[Christian Camargo]]), insists that they accompany Dexter and Rita to clean out the house.  Dexter doubts that Driscoll is his father, but while cleaning, discovers a thank-you card that he sent his blood donor as a child, as Dexter has a rare [[blood type]] ([[AB-]]).<ref name=\"Father Knows Best\">{{cite episode\n| title = Father Knows Best | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 26, 2006| season = 1 | number = 9 }}</ref> As Harry had convinced Driscoll to donate the blood anonymously, Dexter had no idea from where it had come.<ref name=\"Father Knows Best\"/> Dexter suspects his father's death was foul play, but the body is [[cremation|cremated]] before Dexter can obtain proof.<ref name=\"Father Knows Best\"/> The show reveals to the viewer that Rudy murdered Driscoll with an injection of [[insulin]] designed to mimic a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].<ref name=\"Father Knows Best\"/>\n\nDexter's rivalry with Rita's recently paroled ex-husband Paul ([[Mark Pellegrino]]) turns violent; Paul tries to fight Dexter, who knocks him unconscious.

When Dexter goes to rescue Debra, he finally recognizes Rudy as his long-lost brother, Brian Moser.\n\nBrian proposes that they begin to murder together, and leads Dexter to a bound and drugged Debra, suggests that she be their first kill. After wrestling with internal conflicts from his attachment to his biological brother and need to protect his adoptive sister, Dexter ultimately decides that his loyalty lies with Debra. Later on, Brian begins to hunt down Debra himself, but Dexter apprehends Brian and then ties him down to an operating table in Brian's apartment. Dexter tearfully slits Brian's throat, staging the crime scene to make it look like Brian committed suicide. Eventually, the police find the body and close the case. The season ends with Dexter wondering what it would be like if everyone knew his secrets and imagining being celebrated outside the police station by an adoring crowd.<ref name=\"Born Free\"/>\n\n=== Season two ===\nIn season two, Dexter is so haunted by killing his own brother that he cannot resume killing. To make matters worse, Debra, traumatized by her ordeal with the Ice Truck Killer, moves in with Dexter, which hinders his secret life. Dexter's nemesis, [[James Doakes|Sergeant James Doakes]] ([[Erik King]]), harbors lingering suspicions about Dexter's possible connection with the Ice Truck Killer, and he begins to tail Dexter everywhere. To throw him off, Dexter reluctantly refrains from killing for a month. Just as Dexter finds a chance to kill again, over 30 bodies (Dexter's victims) are found in a Miami harbor, provoking a massive search for the so-called \"Bay Harbor Butcher\".\n\nRita soon figures out that Dexter has been lying to her and concludes that Dexter is a heroin addict, with which he goes along to hide his real secret. Rita forces him to attend [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings, where he meets [[Lila West|Lila Tournay]] ([[Jaime Murray]]), who becomes his sponsor. Lila convinces him to explore his past, and while under extreme duress after confronting and killing his mother's murderer, his relationship with Lila becomes sexual. Dexter confesses to Rita, who dumps him. Lila becomes obsessed with Dexter, believing he is her soulmate. Eventually, however, Dexter's desire to be with Astor and Cody compels him to ask for Rita's forgiveness; she grants it, and they get back together. Dexter learns that Lila is in fact a sociopath who attends NA meetings to vicariously experience emotions she is incapable of feeling, and tells her to leave him alone. Lila retaliates by framing Dexter's colleague and friend [[Angel Batista]] ([[David Zayas]]) for [[rape]], though he is eventually cleared.\n\nDoakes' suspicions subside some when he realizes that Dexter is attending Narcotics Anonymous, but he begins to suspect this is a cover for an even worse secret. As Doakes gets closer to discovering the truth, Dexter provokes him into a physical altercation at work, resulting in Doakes' suspension. In \"[[The British Invasion (Dexter)|The British Invasion]]\", Doakes finally catches Dexter in the act of disposing of a dismembered body in the [[Florida Everglades]]. Dexter is forced to take Doakes captive and sets about framing him. Lila discovers the cabin in the Everglades where Dexter is holding Doakes and blows it up (with Doakes inside), to protect Dexter. The police eventually find Doakes' charred body, surrounded by Dexter's murderous paraphernalia, and conclude that Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher, much to Dexter's relief.<ref name=\"The British Invasion\"/>\n\nDexter pretends to want to run away with Lila, but she soon discovers that he intends to kill her. Lila kidnaps Astor and Cody, and when Dexter finds them at her house, she sets it on fire and leaves the three of them locked inside. Dexter manages to save the children and escape unhurt.

Dexter, afraid of what kind of father he would be, considers leaving Rita to parent alone, until Debra convinces him that he would be a great father.  After a few failed marriage proposals, Dexter proposes again by mimicking a declaration of love from a criminal.

To that end, Dexter repeatedly puts off murdering Mitchell, thwarts police efforts to apprehend him, and even saves Mitchell's life when he attempts suicide. Upon getting to know Mitchell, however, Dexter realizes that he misjudged him; after spending Thanksgiving with the Mitchell family, Dexter learns that his would-be mentor is an abusive tyrant whose family is terrified of him.

While he means that he killed her by letting Trinity know his identity, the police interpret this as an admission of direct guilt. The FBI, however, soon clear Dexter, as he was with the police at Arthur Mitchell's house at the time Rita was murdered.\n\nDexter spends the next day completely numb, unable to even fake any sort of emotion or grief. As Dexter plans to disconnect and restart, he finds himself confronted by Rankin ([[Brad Carter]]), a brash, foul-mouthed hillbilly. When Rankin insults Rita, Dexter kills him in a fit of rage. Harry tells Dexter that this act is the first human thing he has seen Dexter do since Rita's death.<ref name=\"My Bad\"/>\n\nDistraught over Rita's death, Astor and Cody leave to go live with their grandparents. A struggling Dexter attempts to move on by hiring an Irish nanny to look after Harrison while he goes out to find his next kill. He settles on Boyd Fowler ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), a convicted [[rape|rapist]] whose connection to a string of missing women makes him the perfect target. Dexter kills Fowler, only to find Fowler's latest victim, a young woman named [[Lumen Pierce]] ([[Julia Stiles]]), who is still alive. After debating whether or not to kill her (and thus eliminate a potential witness), Dexter gives in to his better nature and decides to protect her.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dexter the big one.jpg|right|thumb|Dexter and Lumen are captured by Jordan Chase.]] -->\nLumen is slow to trust Dexter, but comes to realize he means her no harm. She reveals that Fowler was not the only man who raped her. As Lumen gradually becomes integrated into Dexter's life, she begs him to help her to go after her attackers; Dexter reluctantly agrees. They stalk a children's dentist and the head of security for a high-profile motivational speaker named [[Jordan Chase]] ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]). As the plot thickens, it becomes clear that Chase was also one of Lumen's attackers. Complicating the situation further is Detective [[Joey Quinn]] ([[Desmond Harrington]]), who believes that Dexter killed Rita and is getting too close to finding out Dexter's secrets.\n\nTo keep the police occupied, Dexter puts them on Fowler's trail. Dexter becomes personally acquainted with Chase and stumbles onto a photo that proves that all of Lumen's attackers (who are also guilty of [[torture|torturing]], raping, and murdering 12 other women) have known each other since childhood.\n\nDexter eventually finds a vial of blood that Chase wears around his neck. After extracting a sample, he discovers that the blood belongs to Emily Birch ([[Angela Bettis]]), the rape club's first victim. She provides Lumen and Dexter with the identity of the mysterious fourth attacker in the photo, Alex Tilden ([[Scott Grimes]]). Dexter allows Lumen to kill Tilden by stabbing him in the heart. Dexter and Lumen then become lovers, before continuing their hunt for Chase. As Lumen and Dexter plan to capture Chase, Dexter realizes cameras are in his apartment. Dexter, assuming he is being watched by Quinn, waits for him to return to the surveillance van. As Dexter opens the door to capture Quinn, Stan Liddy ([[Peter Weller]]), a private investigator Quinn had hired to tail Dexter, stuns Dexter with a taser. After Liddy calls Quinn to bust Dexter, Dexter attacks Liddy and kills him in self-defense, after Liddy tries to stab him.\n\nWhile Dexter deals with Liddy, Lumen gets a call from Emily. Emily appears frightened of Chase and threatens to call the police, but she is revealed to be setting a trap to allow Chase to capture them. Dexter returns to the apartment to find Lumen gone. He tracks Chase to the camp where the rape club had started. In a fit of emotion, he accidentally wrecks the stolen car he is driving, allowing Chase to take him prisoner. Chase brings Dexter to the building in which he is holding Lumen. As Chase is about to kill them, Dexter frees himself with a knife he had stashed and immobilizes Chase by stabbing him through his foot and into the floor. Dexter cuts Lumen free and knocks Chase out. When Chase wakes up, Dexter allows Lumen to kill him. While they are still in the kill room, preparing to move the body, Debra arrives on the scene, though her view of Dexter and Lumen is obstructed by a sheet of plastic. Dexter and Lumen, trapped, remain silent. Without requesting their identity, Debra warns them that she is about to call in backup and allows them to flee before the police arrive.\n\nThe next day, when Dexter returns from work, Lumen tells him that she no longer feels the need to kill, and they cannot be together because Dexter's homicidal urges will never leave him. She then leaves to return to the life she had before her kidnapping. The season ends with Dexter surrounded by friends and family at Harrison's first birthday party.\n\n===Season six===\nAbout a year later, Harrison is old enough to walk, and Dexter has begun searching for a preschool, though his [[atheism]] conflicts with the largely religious preschools to which he applies. He finds a greater understanding through Brother Sam ([[Mos Def]], credited as Mos and later as yasiin bey<!-- DO NOT CAPITALIZE yasiin bey AS THIS IS THE EXACT MANNER HE WAS CREDITED ON THE SHOW! -->), an ex-con and murderer whom Dexter once considered killing, who has since become a [[born-again Christian]] who counsels other ex-cons. Dexter initially sees Brother Sam's religious conversion as a scam, but Brother Sam proves himself a truly changed man, and even helps Dexter through a crisis when Harrison undergoes an [[appendectomy]].\n\nHowever, things go awry when Brother Sam is shot and mortally wounded in his garage. Dexter realizes that a friend of Sam's, Nick ([[Germaine De Leon]]), is responsible, and swears revenge. On his deathbed, Sam forgives Nick and implores Dexter to also forgive him. Dexter considers sparing Nick when he initially appears remorseful, but that proves to be an act; after Sam refuses to press charges on his deathbed, Nick brags about what he did.  An enraged Dexter drowns Nick in the surf, reawakening in him the presence of his dead brother, Brian, who begins to guide him in much the same way that Harry's presence once had.\n\nBrian convinces Dexter to go after Arthur Mitchell's son Jonah ([[Brando Eaton]]), who appears to have also become a killer. Dexter adheres to his father's code, however, causing a schism between his personalities. Dexter finally catches Jonah with the intent of killing him, but relents when he sees that Jonah feels guilty about failing to protect his sister, who committed suicide by slitting an artery in a bathtub, similar to how her father killed his victims. When Jonah and his mother discovered Jonah's sister, their mother blamed the children for their father's shortcomings. This enraged Jonah, who then killed his mother.
