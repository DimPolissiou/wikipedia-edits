It was the band's second official live album and video, the first being 1991's ''[[Sweatin' to the Oldies: The Vandals Live|Sweatin' to the Oldies]]''. It was released in 2 packages, one a DVD with a bonus concert CD, the other a CD with a bonus DVD. Both packages contain the same discs and material, merely packaged differently so that it could be stacked on both CD and DVD shelves. It was presented as episode 9 of Kung Fu Films' ''[[The Show Must Go Off!]]'' live concert DVD series (episode 1 had also been a live Vandals concert, from their 2001 Christmas Formal). Kung Fu Films is an offshoot of Kung Fu Records, the record label started in 1996 by Vandals members [[Joe Escalante]] and [[Warren Fitzgerald]]. Having previously worked in the television and film industries, Joe Escalante acts as director and producer for nearly all of these live DVD releases.\n\nThe performance relies heavily on material from the band's albums since 1990, when the current lineup solidified, and excludes songs from their first three releases of the 1980s. As the current lineup of the Vandals grew in popularity and recognition throughout the 1990s they began to distance themselves from the material performed by earlier incarnations of the band, of which only Escalante remains. These earlier songs tended to attract an older, more violent audience which the current lineup of the band eschewed in favor of newer, younger fans attracted to their more recent output. These early songs had already been released in live format on ''Sweatin' to the Oldies'' 13 years earlier, so the band also felt that it would be redundant to rehash that part of their past.\n\nThe DVD contains numerous bonus features including band member commentaries (Escalante, Fitzgerald and singer [[Dave Quackenbush]]), a photo gallery, hidden bonus footage, English subtitles, links to additional online content, and a \"[[Josh Freese]] Cam\" option that allows the viewer to switch the camera angle at any time during the concert to one focusing directly on drummer Josh Freese, with a picture-in-picture display of his foot pedal.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| total_length    = 56:53\n\n| title1          = 43210-1\n| writer1         = [[Warren Fitzgerald]]\n| length1         = \n\n| title2          = Appreciate My Honesty\n| writer2         = Fitzgerald\n| length2         = \n\n| title3          = It's a Fact\n| writer3         = Fitzgerald\n| length3         = \n\n| title4          = An Idea for a Movie\n| writer4         = [[Joe Escalante]]\n| length4         = \n\n| title5          = Pizza Tran\n| writer5         = Escalante, Fitzgerald, [[Dave Quackenbush]], [[Josh Freese]]\n| length5         = \n\n| title6          = Caf\u00e9 405\n| writer6         = Freese\n| length6         = \n\n| title7          = Soccer Mom\n| writer7         = Freese\n| length7         = \n\n| title8          = The New You\n| writer8         = Fitzgerald, Quackenbush\n| length8         = \n\n| title9          = Marry Me\n| writer9         = Freese, Quackenbush\n| length9         = \n\n| title10         = Oi to the World\n| writer10        = Escalante\n| length10        = \n\n| title11         = N.I.M.B.Y.\n| writer11        = Escalante, Fitzgerald\n| length11        = \n\n| title12         = My Brain Tells My Body\n| writer12        = Freese\n| length12        = \n\n| title13         = People That Are Going to Hell\n| writer13        = Fitzgerald\n| length13        = \n\n| title14         = Too Much Drama\n| writer14        = [[Dexter Holland]], Escalante, Freese, Fitzgerald\n| length14        = \n\n| title15         = Disproportioned Head\n| writer15        = Fitzgerald\n| length15        = \n\n| title16         = Take it Back\n| writer16        = Quackenbush\n| length16        = \n\n| title17         = The Unseen Tears of the Albacore\n| writer17        = Escalante, Fitzgerald\n| length17        = \n\n| title18         = And Now We Dance\n| writer18        = Fitzgerald\n| length18        = \n\n| title19         = I've Got an Ape Drape\n| writer19        = Escalante\n| length19        = \n\n| title20         = Behind the Music\n| writer20        = Fitzgerald\n| length20        = \n\n| title21         = My Girlfriend's Dead\n| writer21        = Fitzgerald\n| length21        = \n\n| title22         = I Have a Date\n| note22          = originally performed by the Simpletones\n| writer22        = Jay Lansford\n| length22        = \n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Dave Quackenbush]] \u2013 vocals\n*[[Warren Fitzgerald]] \u2013 [[guitar]], backing vocals\n*[[Joe Escalante]] \u2013 [[bass guitar|bass]], backing vocals\n*[[Josh Freese]] \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n\n==Album information==\n*Record label: [[Kung Fu Records]], [[Kung Fu Films]]\n*Recorded live at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Anaheim, California]] on July 5, 2003\n\n{{The Vandals}}\n\n[[Category:The Vandals albums]]\n[[Category:2004 live albums]]\n[[Category:Kung Fu Records live albums]]\n[[Category:Albums recorded at the House of Blues]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=October 2008}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Live at the House of Blues\n| type       = [[Live album]]\n| longtype   = (with [[DVD]])\n| artist     = [[The Vandals]]\n| cover      = The Vandals - Live at the House of Blues cover.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|df=yes|January 27, 2004}}\n| recorded   = July 5, 2003\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Pop punk]]<br>[[Punk rock]]<br>[[Skate punk]]<br>[[Melodic hardcore]]<br>[[comedy rock]]\n| length     = 56:53\n| label      = [[Kung Fu Records|Kung Fu]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title = [[Internet Dating Superstuds]]\n| prev_year  = 2002\n| next_title = [[Hollywood Potato Chip]]\n| next_year  = 2004\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score =  {{Rating|4|5}} [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r678795|pure_url=yes}} link]\n}}\n'''''Live at the House of Blues''''' is a live album and video by the southern [[California]] [[punk rock]] band [[The Vandals]], released in 2004 by [[Kung Fu Records]] and [[Kung Fu Films]].

piano from the age of six<ref name=\"Adler\" /> and discovered jazz while a high school student.<ref name=\"NYT\" /> She transcribed performances by pianists [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Keith Jarrett]].<ref name=\"NYT\" /> She later reported that, \"By the eighth grade I knew I wanted to be a jazz musician.\"<ref name=\"Adler\" /> She later majored in jazz piano at the [[University of

York]].<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nIn 2009, Davis played solo concerts during a tour of Portugal.<ref name=\"NYT\" /> She followed this with a solo piano album, ''[[Aeriol Piano]]'',<ref name=\"NYT\" /> which included sections for [[prepared piano]].<ref name=\"DB13\" /> Her 2014 trio album ''[[Waiting for You to Grow]]'' was the follow-up to ''[[Good Citizen (album)|Good Citizen]]'' around five years earlier.<ref name=\"Adler\" /> She commented that, on the earlier release, \"I had this concept to make it almost like a pop record, where the tunes are really short [while] on the new record the tunes are much longer and explore multiple areas. I just wanted to write and not have any preconceived ideas\".<ref name=\"Adler\" />\n\nIn 2013, Davis composed a suite for four bass clarinets, guitar, piano, organ and drums.<ref name=\"DB13\">Bambarger, Bradley (December 2013) \"Kris Davis \u2013 New Approaches\".

Like many other northern noblemen, the Milyukovs were seriously affected by the abolition, because serfs, who could take winter jobs in the cities, were much more valuable possessions than often frozen land. The Milyukovs were forced to go into business for themselves or go broke. They started a trading company and made their name as [[merchants]] of fine furs, supplying, among others, the [[Russian Imperial Family]] and several [[Dukes in Italy, Germany and Austria|German ducal houses]]. As a matter of fact, the Milyukovs were so successful that they owned one of the first commercial [[steamship]]s in Russia. Later, during the [[October Revolution|Revolution]] of 1918, many members participated as members of [[White movement|White Army]], this branch altering the spelling of its name to Melyukov to escape prosecution by the [[Cheka]].\n\n==Prominent members of the Milyukov family==\nMilyukov family had numerous notable members throughout the centuries. Below is the list of the most illustrious members of their time.\n\nDuring the early 16th century, the most prominent one was Mikhail Ioanovich, who was a [[Falconry|Grand Falconer]] and a [[namestnik]] of [[Bely Gorod]] (1506).\n\nOne of the more illustrious Milyukovs in the 17th century was Semyon (d.&nbsp;1699), the [[Archbishop]] of [[Smolensk]], who stringently opposed the rule of Tsarevna [[Sophia Alekseyevna]] believing that it is not woman's business to rule and that brothers Peter (later [[Peter I of Russia]]) and Ivan (later [[Ivan V of Russia]]) should take over.\n.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inauka.ru/history/article57191.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312173334/http://www.inauka.ru/history/article57191.html |archivedate=2008-03-12 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, Nikolay Petrovich was a very noteworthy nobleman in Tver; his godfather was [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] himself.

They started a trading company and made their name as [[merchants]] of fine furs, supplying, among others, the [[Russian Imperial Family]] and several [[Dukes in Italy, Germany and Austria|German ducal houses]]. As a matter of fact, the Milyukovs were so successful that they owned one of the first commercial [[steamship]]s in Russia. Later, during the [[October Revolution|Revolution]] of 1918, many members participated as members of [[White movement|White Army]], this branch altering the spelling of its name to Melyukov to escape prosecution by the [[Cheka]].\n\n==Prominent members of the Milyukov family==\nMilyukov family had numerous notable members throughout the centuries. Below is the list of the most illustrious members of their time.\n\nDuring the early 16th century, the most prominent one was Mikhail Ioanovich, who was a [[Flaconry|Grand Falconer]] and a [[namestnik]] of [[Bely Gorod]] (1506).\n\nOne of the more illustrious Milyukovs in the 17th century was Semyon (d.&nbsp;1699), the [[Archbishop]] of [[Smolensk]], who stringently opposed the rule of Tsarevna [[Sophia Alekseyevna]] believing that it is not woman's business to rule and that brothers Peter (later [[Peter I of Russia]]) and Ivan (later [[Ivan V of Russia]]) should take over.\n.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inauka.ru/history/article57191.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312173334/http://www.inauka.ru/history/article57191.html |archivedate=2008-03-12 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, Nikolay Petrovich was a very noteworthy nobleman in Tver; his godfather was [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] himself.

The main manor was Poddub'ye, with two other manors, Vsekhsvyatskoye and Ostrovki to the north and south, respectively, belonging to various Milyukovs. According to early 19th century records, Poddub'ye Manor had eight houses and 651 male field serfs attached to it, while Vsekhsvyatskoye had 34 house serfs and 254 male field serfs. Ostrovki Manor had 19 house serfs with an unknown number of field serfs.<ref>http://www.putnik.ru/dosug/poddub/3.asp</ref> An interesting fact is that the House of Smirnoff (of [[Smirnoff Vodka]] fame) had a family manor right across the lake from Poddub'ye and, just like the Melyukov branch mentioned above, had to start in business shortly after the abolition of serfdom.<ref>http://www.putnik.ru/dosug/mold.asp</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Russian noble families]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Flaconry->Falconry -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milyukov"}

{"title_page": "John Houston (newspaperman)", "text_new": "'''John Houston''' (November 1850\u2013March 8, 1910) was a newspaper publisher and politician in [[British Columbia]].\n\n==Newspaper publisher==\nBorn in [[Alton, Ontario|Alton]], [[Province of Canada|Canada West]] (now [[Ontario]]), Houston's career as a newspaper publisher in British Columbia spanned twenty-two years, beginning in 1888 in the town of [[Donald, British Columbia|Donald]]. Later he would publish newspapers in [[New Westminster, British Columbia|New Westminster]], [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]], [[Rossland, British Columbia|Rossland]] and [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]]. His last paper would be printed in 1910 at [[South Fort George]]. John was married, though his wife, Edith May Keeley, didn't follow him on his constant ramblings throughout the province and stayed at their mansion in Nelson.\n\n==First mayor of Nelson==\nJohn Houston was the first mayor of Nelson, British Columbia and served from 1897 to 1905.\n\n==Political career==\nJohn Houston was a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] for [[West Kootenay-Nelson]] from 1900 to 1903 and [[Nelson City (provincial electoral district)|Nelson City]] from 1903 until 1907. During this time, he became well known for being a working-man's [[advocate]] and he often spoke against the policies of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and supported a motion to stop provincial aid to railways.\n\n==Prince Rupert==\n[[File:Empire Newspaper Office.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Empire'' newspaper office 1907]]\nHouston moved to Prince Rupert in summer 1907 to start the ''Prince Rupert Empire'' newspaper. In this paper he planned to continue his vocal opposition to the policies of the railroad, this time the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]]. The GTP knew full well of John's reputation and did not appreciate his presence in Prince Rupert\u2014their terminus, and a town they had grand designs for. Before John could print a single edition, the GTP harbor engineer impounded his printing press in a small shed on the wharf. Undeterred, John decided to have his paper published in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and when the first edition got to Prince Rupert, it carried the headline that the GTP discourages newcomers to town.  Other editions followed, and for two months, the Victoria-based ''Prince Rupert Empire'' blazed with editorials, prose and often poetry, describing the railway managers as \"tin-gods\" and accusing them of \"a thousand blunders\". After only two months of editions, the ''Empire'' had sold 10,000 copies of a paper originally meant for a population of 500. Then, with the assistance of a local constable, John liberated his press and continued publishing. [[Charles Melville Hays]], who was then the president of the Grand Trunk Pacific, arrived in Prince Rupert later that year and offered John a permit to put his building wherever he liked. But, by then, John didn't need a lot in Prince Rupert. He had filed on a mineral claim near the wharf and had built the Empire Newspaper Office. If Charles Hays had hoped that his intended cooperation with John would gain the railroad favor with the ''Empire'', he must've been sorely disappointed.  John began encouraging other people to squat on the mineral claims by the wharf, instead of buying lots in the new GTP townsite, thus creating the community of Knoxville. The Grand Trunk Pacific had had enough. When the lots at Prince Rupert went up for sale in 1909, the land John Houston's ''Empire'' was on was quietly bought by the railway themselves. John sold his newspaper for $10,000 and left for Fort George.\n\n==Fort George==\n[[File:John Houston.gif|thumb|left|300px|''Fort George Tribune'' office, John Houston on left]]\nJohn Houston arrived in Fort George in the fall of 1909 and bought property in South Fort George and began the ''Fort George Tribune''. The first edition was published on November 6, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. In 1909, South Fort George was a First Nations village, a sawmill and a Hudson's Bay Store. Less than a dozen new residents lived in the infant town-site in tent shacks.  The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, John's favorite villain, was still far away: not even across the Alberta/BC border on the eastern end of construction, and the construction from the western end at Prince Rupert had just begun. John's South Fort George articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while he sat at his printing press and worked on the newspaper. Nevertheless, whether there was little news to report or not, John was a busy man from November 1909 to March 1910. He responded to approximately 300 letters a month, written mostly by parties interested in purchasing land in the area, and he was working on formulating a platform for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. In March 1910, the work and excessively cold caught up with him and John contracted [[pneumonia]] and was pulled on a toboggan down the Blackwater Trail to the [[Quesnel, British Columbia|Quesnel]] hospital by his friend and fellow pioneer settler, William J Cooke. John died on March 8 at the hospital in Quesnel, but not before he got a chance to read his own obituary, one printed in error by the ''[[Vancouver Province]]''. His nurse, knowing his sense of humor, showed him the article, and he supposedly joked that he respected the paper and that they didn't need to make a correction because he was planning on making good on their story. John was laid to rest in Nelson, where there is a memorial in his honor.\n\n===Places named after John Houston===\n* [[Houston, British Columbia]]\n* Houston Lane in [[Prince George, British Columbia]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* ''A Thousand Blunders: The History of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in Northern British Columbia'' by Frank Leonard {{ISBN|0-7748-0552-8}}\n* ''A History of Prince George'' Rev FE Runnals\n* ''Prince George: Rivers, Railways and Timber'' Bev Christensen {{ISBN|0-89781-266-2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070213153943/http://www.houston.ca/siteengine/activepage.asp?PageID=19 District of Houston]\n* {{cite encyclopedia\n  |last=Leonard \n  |first=Frank \n  |title=John Houston\n  |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]]\n  |year=1994\n  |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=6788\n  |accessdate=2011-09-05 }}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Houston, John}}\n[[Category:British Columbia Conservative Party MLAs]]\n[[Category:People from Caledon, Ontario]]\n[[Category:1850 births]]\n[[Category:1910 deaths]]\n[[Category:Mayors of places in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Canadian newspaper editors]]\n[[Category:Canadian male journalists]]\n[[Category:Pre-Confederation Ontario people]]\n", "text_old": "'''John Houston''' (November 1850\u2013March 8, 1910) was a newspaper publisher and politician in [[British Columbia]]. \n\n==Newspaper publisher==\nBorn in [[Alton, Ontario|Alton]], [[Province of Canada|Canada West]] (now [[Ontario]]), Houston's career as a newspaper publisher in British Columbia spanned twenty-two years, beginning in 1888 in the town of [[Donald, British Columbia|Donald]].
