Bellotti remained in that position through the [[1994 Oregon Ducks football team|1994 season]], when Brooks left to coach in the [[National Football League]], and Bellotti was promoted to head coach starting with the 1995 season.\n\nBellotti's record at Oregon stands at 116\u201355.  In 2006, he passed his former boss, Rich Brooks, as the winningest football coach in Oregon's history.  He led the Ducks to their first four ten-win seasons in school history ([[2000 Oregon Ducks football team|2000]], [[2001 Oregon Ducks football team|2001]], [[2005 Oregon Ducks football team|2005]], [[2008 Oregon Ducks football team|2008]]); they had only won nine games on three occasions in the 100 years before Bellotti took over. He led the Ducks to 12 bowl games, three more than they had attended in their entire history before his arrival.  His best season was 2001, when he led the Ducks to an 11\u20131 record and a victory in the [[2002 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]].  They finished second in both major polls, the highest final ranking in school history.  The 11 wins would remain a school record until the 2010 team's 12-win season.\n\nBellotti also led Oregon to a regular season #2 ranking in the 2007 season, albeit very briefly. After achieving that ranking, the Ducks lost [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate quarterback [[Dennis Dixon]] to a season-ending knee injury, and Oregon proceeded to lose three straight games to [[2007 Arizona Wildcats football team|Arizona]], [[2007 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]], and [[Civil War (college rivalry)|arch-rival]] [[2007 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]] to close out the regular season.<ref name=\"GoDucksBio\" /> Earlier that season, Bellotti had led Oregon to a resounding 39\u20137 victory over [[2007 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] at [[Michigan Stadium|\"The Big House\"]], earning the Ducks and Dixon much national attention. Oregon also defeated #9 USC and #6 Arizona State in back-to-back games at [[Autzen Stadium]] earlier that season. Oregon recovered from their three-game losing streak following the Dixon injury by defeating [[2007 South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida]] in the [[Sun Bowl]] in dominating fashion ([[2007 Sun Bowl|56\u201321]]), thus ending a streak of four straight bowl losses for the Ducks.  In 2008, the Ducks recovered strongly from a mid-season lull to win their last four games against solid competition, including a [[Holiday Bowl]] [[2008 Holiday Bowl|win]] over 13th-ranked [[2008 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]].<ref>{{cite web|title =Oregon 2008 Schedule/Results|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/teams/schedule?teamId=2483}}</ref>  Although he only won two [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]] titles due to the latter half of his tenure being occupied by [[USC Trojans football|USC]]'s dominance of the conference, Bellotti is still credited with building Oregon into a major football power nonetheless.\n\n==Oregon athletic director==\nOn December 2, 2008, shortly after defeating the [[2008 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State Beavers]] in the [[Civil War (college football game)|Civil War]] to prevent them from clinching a [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] berth, the university announced that Bellotti would pass the head coaching position on to Offensive Coordinator [[Chip Kelly]] at some undetermined point in the future and take over as the university's athletic director at that time.<ref>{{cite web | title = UO President Announces Succession Plan for Athletics Department | date = December 2, 2008 | publisher = GoDucks.com | url = http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID=3626601 | accessdate = December 3, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090204025208/http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID=3626601 | archivedate = February 4, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first = Bob | last = Clark | title = Ducks set succession line | publisher = The Eugene Register Guard | date = December 3, 2008 | url = http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/sports/3564958-41/story.csp | accessdate = December 3, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205043110/http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/sports/3564958-41/story.csp | archive-date = December 5, 2008 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"retirement\">{{cite web | title = Bellotti To Step Aside; No Timetable Set | publisher = KPTV | date = December 2, 2008 | url = http://www.kptv.com/sports/18190153/detail.html# | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205032351/http://www.kptv.com/sports/18190153/detail.html | archivedate = December 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his tenure as athletic director, Bellotti dealt with a number of disciplinary issues involving members of the football program, including [[LeGarrette Blount]], [[LaMichael James]], and [[Jeremiah Masoli]], and fired long-time basketball coach [[Ernie Kent]], whose teams had performed poorly in recent seasons.<ref name=pi>{{cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlesports/archives/198725.asp?from=blog_last3|title=Oregon AD Bellotti steps down|date=March 19, 2010|accessdate=March 19, 2010|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}</ref>  After just nine months on the job, Bellotti announced his resignation March 19, 2010 to join ESPN as a college football analyst.

His record in the [[Northern California Athletic Conference]] was 15\u20139\u20132.<ref name=cfdw>{{cite web|url=http://michigan-football.com/ncaa/f/chichost.htm|title=Chico State Wildcats -- College Football (NCAA)}}</ref>\n\n===Oregon===\n[[University of Oregon]] head coach [[Rich Brooks]] hired Bellotti as offensive coordinator in [[1989 Oregon Ducks football team|1989]]. Bellotti remained in that position through the [[1994 Oregon Ducks football team|1994 season]], when Brooks left to coach in the [[National Football League]], and Bellotti was promoted to head coach starting with the 1995 season.\n\nBellotti's record at Oregon stands at 116\u201355.  In 2006, he passed his former boss, Rich Brooks, as the winningest football coach in Oregon's history.  He led the Ducks to their first four ten-win seasons in school history ([[2000 Oregon Ducks football team|2000]], [[2001 Oregon Ducks football team|2001]], [[2005 Oregon Ducks football team|2005]], [[2008 Oregon Ducks football team|2008]]); they had only won nine games on three occasions in the 100 years before Bellotti took over. He led the Ducks to 12 bowl games, three more than they had attended in their entire history before his arrival.  His best season was 2001, when he led the Ducks to an 11\u20131 record and a victory in the [[2002 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]].  They finished second in both major polls, the highest final ranking in school history.  The 11 wins would remain a school record until the 2010 team's 12-win season.\n\nBellotti also led Oregon to a regular season #2 ranking in the 2007 season, albeit very briefly. After achieving that ranking, the Ducks lost [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate quarterback [[Dennis Dixon]] to a season-ending knee injury, and Oregon proceeded to lose three straight games to [[2007 Arizona Wildcats football team|Arizona]], [[2007 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]], and [[Civil War (college rivalry)|arch-rival]] [[2007 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]] to close out the regular season.<ref name=\"GoDucksBio\" /> Earlier that season, Bellotti had led Oregon to a resounding 39\u20137 victory over [[2007 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] at [[Michigan Stadium|\"The Big House\"]], earning the Ducks and Dixon much national attention. Oregon also defeated #9 USC and #6 Arizona State in back-to-back games at [[Autzen Stadium]] earlier that season. Oregon recovered from their three-game losing streak following the Dixon injury by defeating [[2007 South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida]] in the [[Sun Bowl]] in dominating fashion ([[2007 Sun Bowl|56\u201321]]), thus ending a streak of four straight bowl losses for the Ducks.  In 2008, the Ducks recovered strongly from a mid-season lull to win their last four games against solid competition, including a [[Holiday Bowl]] [[2008 Holiday Bowl|win]] over 13th-ranked [[2008 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]].<ref>{{cite web|title =Oregon 2008 Schedule/Results|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/teams/schedule?teamId=2483}}</ref>  Although he only won two [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]] titles due to the latter half of his tenure being occupied by [[USC Trojans football|USC]]'s dominance of the conference, Bellotti is still credited with building Oregon into a major football power nonetheless.\n\n==Oregon athletic director==\nOn December 2, 2008, shortly after defeating the [[2008 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State Beavers]] in the [[Civil War (college football game)|Civil War]] to prevent them from clinching a [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] berth, the university announced that Bellotti would pass the head coaching position on to Offensive Coordinator [[Chip Kelly]] at some undetermined point in the future and take over as the university's athletic director at that time.<ref>{{cite web | title = UO President Announces Succession Plan for Athletics Department | date = December 2, 2008 | publisher = GoDucks.com | url = http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID=3626601 | accessdate = December 3, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090204025208/http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID=3626601 | archivedate = February 4, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first = Bob | last = Clark | title = Ducks set succession line | publisher = The Eugene Register Guard | date = December 3, 2008 | url = http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/sports/3564958-41/story.csp | accessdate = December 3, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205043110/http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/sports/3564958-41/story.csp | archive-date = December 5, 2008 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"retirement\">{{cite web | title = Bellotti To Step Aside; No Timetable Set | publisher = KPTV | date = December 2, 2008 | url = http://www.kptv.com/sports/18190153/detail.html# | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205032351/http://www.kptv.com/sports/18190153/detail.html | archivedate = December 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his tenure as athletic director, Bellotti dealt with a number of disciplinary issues involving members of the football program, including [[LeGarrette Blount]], [[LaMichael James]], and [[Jeremiah Masoli]], and fired long-time basketball coach [[Ernie Kent]], whose teams had performed poorly in recent seasons.<ref name=pi>{{cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlesports/archives/198725.asp?from=blog_last3|title=Oregon AD Bellotti steps down|date=March 19, 2010|accessdate=March 19, 2010|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}</ref>  After just nine months on the job, Bellotti announced his resignation March 19, 2010 to join ESPN as a college football analyst.

It is also a key figure with regard to [[hedge fund]]s and [[venture capital fund]]s when calculating the value of the underlying investments in these funds by investors. This may also be the same as the [[book value]] or the [[shareholders' equity|equity]] value of a business. Net asset value may represent the value of the total equity, or it may be divided by the number of [[shares outstanding]] held by investors, thereby representing the net asset value ''per share''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raymondjames.com/gloss.htm#n |author=Raymond James |title=Glossary of Investment Terms |date= August 9, 2011 |publisher=raymondjames.com}}</ref>\n\n==Generally==\nNet asset value and other accounting and recordkeeping activities are the result of the process of [[fund accounting]] (also known as securities accounting, investment accounting, and portfolio accounting). Fund accounting systems are sophisticated computerized systems used to account for investor [[Financial capital|capital]] flows in and out of a fund, purchases and sales of investments, and related investment income, gains, losses and operating expenses of the fund. The fund's investments and other assets are valued regularly; daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the fund and associated regulatory or sponsor requirements. There is no universal method or basis of [[valuation (finance)|valuing assets and liabilities]] for the purposes of calculating the net asset value used throughout the world, and the criteria used for the valuation will depend upon the circumstances, the purposes of the valuation, and any regulatory and/or accounting principles that may apply. For example, for U.S.-registered open-ended funds, investments are commonly valued each day the [[New York Stock Exchange]] is open, using closing prices (meant to represent fair value),<ref>AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide - Investment Companies May 1, 2007.</ref> typically 4:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time]]. For U.S.-registered money market funds, investments are often carried or valued at \"amortized cost\" as opposed to market value for expedience and other purposes, provided various requirements are continually met.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Guide To Understanding Mutual Funds |publisher= Investment Company Institute |url=http://www.ici.org/pdf/bro_understanding_mfs_p.pdf }}</ref>\n\nAt the completion of the valuation process and once all other appropriate accounting entries are posted, the accounting books are \"closed\", enabling a variety of information to be calculated and produced including the net asset value per share.\n\n==Open-ended funds==\nNet asset value is commonly used in the context of [[open-end fund]]s. [[Shares]] and [[Partnership|interests]] in such funds are not traded between investors, but are issued by the fund to each new investor and redeemed by the fund when an investor withdraws. A fund will issue and redeem shares and interests at a price calculated by reference to the NAV of the fund, with the intention that new investors receive a fair proportion of the fund and redeeming investors receive a fair proportion of the fund's value in cash.\n\nFor example, if a fund has a NAV of $200 million and 1 million shares in issue on a certain day, the \"NAV per share\"\u2014the price at which shares are issued\u2014is $200. A person investing $40 million on that day will therefore be given 200,000 shares. Immediately following his investment the total NAV of the fund will be $240 million, as the new investor's cash becomes part of the fund and is available for investment by the fund. The investor will then be entitled to 1/6 of whatever the fund's value is when he withdraws his investment, if in the meantime his 1/6 ownership is not altered by any further withdrawals or investments to the fund.\n\nThe valuation of the assets and liabilities of an open-ended fund is therefore very important to investors. If the NAV in the above example had, with the same assets, been calculated as $160 million (and the NAV per share as $160), the investor would have been given 250,000 shares and would become entitled to 1/5 of the fund's value.\n\nIn contrast, [[closed-end fund]]s are traded in the open market between investors and so the price of shares or interests in a closed-end fund will be whatever the parties agree it to be, which may not correspond to the fund's [https://www.indictionary.in/post/myths-indians-have-about-mutual-funds-and-lack-of-investment-knowledge-in-india-%E0%A4%AD-%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%AF-%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%B5-%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%95-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%9A NAV].

The NAV may be below the market price for the following reasons:\n\n* Accounting principles and bases of presentation of amounts in [[financial statement]]s differ worldwide, blurring the comparability of companies in various jurisdictions.  Financial statement values are typically recorded based on their local jurisdiction's related principles of accounting, which affect all the remaining points below.\n* The current value of a company's assets likely differ from the historical cost reflected in the financial statements used in NAV calculations.\n* The NAV describes the company's current asset and liability position. Investors might believe that the company has significant growth prospects, in which case they would be prepared to pay more for the company than its NAV.\n* Certain assets, such as [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] (which broadly represents a company's ability to make future profits), are not necessarily included on a [[balance sheet]] and so will not appear in an NAV calculation.\n\nA company's market value will not always be greater than its NAV. For example, analysts and management estimated that [[Liberty Media Corporation]] was trading for 30-50% below its net asset value (or \"core asset value\") in June 2007.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Where a company's market value is lower than its NAV, it may be considered more profitable to wind the company down and sell off its assets individually rather than continue to run it as a [[going concern]].\n\nIn contrast to fund valuation, the assets of a company will generally be valued for the purpose of a NAV calculation using the [[book value]], the [[historical cost]], or the [[amortization|amortised]] cost of the company's assets, or an appropriate combination of the three.\n\n==Real estate investment trusts==\nNAV is one of the valuation indices of [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs, pronounced \"Reets\"). NAV is normally quoted \"per investment unit\" where the value is divided by the number of total outstanding investment units.

The degree of premium/discount on individual investment unit prices relative to the per-unit NAV serves as the yardstick for assessment. The NAV index is synonymous to the adjusted [[price-to-book ratio]] in which factors such as unrealized losses/gains of owned properties and brand values are reflected.

Azzaro and Gracida both reside in [[Wellington, Florida]].\n\n==Biography==\nAzzaro was first awarded the highest handicap in 1994 after reaching the finals of every high goal tournament in the Palm Beach season as well as winning the U.S. Open in California. In 1995 he was lowered back to 9 after the 1994 season and U.S. Open in which teams he was on did not perform well. In 1996 after having a great season he was raised to 10 goals, a rating he held until the mid-2000s.\n\nIn 2009, he was to captain the U.S. Team against Mexico in the Camacho Cup. However he had an injury that ended his Florida season. He bounced back in the summer by captaining the Luchese team to one of the three finals of the Santa Barbara season.\n\nAmong his many accomplishments and recognitions is the standing ovation he received while playing the Palermo Open in Argentina with the La Mariana team (Sebastian Merlos, Pite Merlos, Milo Fernandez-Araujo) in 1995.  While the team lost it further cemented Azzaro as a prominent figure in Polo.\n\nTeams he has played for include the Black Bears, Maple Leafs, Michelob, Tarahumara, Gehache (U.S. Open Winner), Outback (U.S. Open Winner), Isla Carroll (U.S. Open Winner), Pegasus, Templeton, Old Pueblo, Luchese, Evergaldes, Grants Farm Manor (U.S Open Winner),  Hanalie Bay, Ellerstina, White Birch, Retama II (U.S. Open Winners), Les Liones, BTA, Red Legs, Zacara, Klentner Ranch.\n\nIt had been confirmed that in 2012 Mike Azzaro would form part of the Crab Orchard Polo team.  His role on the team will be that of the lynch pin third player on a team that includes Adolfo Cambiaso, David \"Pelon\" Stirling and team captain George Rawlings. In what ultimately disbanded the team and ended up terminating Cambiaso's relationship with Crab Orchard, Mike Azzaro was dropped from the team's lineup. Many believing Cambiaso was not interested in playing with Azzaro. That year saw Azzaro join the Zacara squad that ended up winning the US Open and him winning the MVP. The following year, in a final against Cambia's Valiente team, Mike Azzaro and Zacara (Lyndon Lea, Facundo Pieres and Magoo Laprida) once again won the US Open, further cementing Mike Azzaro's place in high goal polo. In 2011, despite a strong team and high expectations, the Crab Orchard squad of Cambiaso, Rawlings, Hilario Ulloa and South African Nachi du Plesis, failed to be the powerhouse everyone in the polo community expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://polopony.com/polo-news/palm-beach-fl-international-polo-club-lucchese-mt-brilliant-roll-over-opponents/attachment/ipc20110109-2/|title=Mike Azzaro (Mt.

Systems such as '''S''' are referred to as 1-[[qubit]] systems.]] -->\nIn Everett's formulation, a measuring apparatus '''M''' and an object system '''S''' form a composite system, each of which prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing '''M''' and '''S''' to interact. After '''S''' interacts with '''M''', it is no longer possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of '''S''' given the state of '''M''' or the relative state of '''M''' given the state of '''S'''. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of '''S''' after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of '''S'''.\n\n[[Image:Splittings-1.png|thumb|left|350px|Schematic illustration of splitting as a result of a repeated measurement.]]\nFor example, consider the smallest possible truly quantum system '''S''', as shown in the illustration. This describes for instance, the spin-state of an electron. Considering a specific axis (say the ''z''-axis) the north pole represents spin \"up\" and the south pole, spin \"down\". The superposition states of the system are described by a sphere called the [[Bloch sphere]]. To perform a measurement on '''S''', it is made to interact with another similar system '''M'''. After the interaction, the combined system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of two \"alternative histories\" of the original system '''S''', one in which \"up\" was observed and the other in which \"down\" was observed. Each subsequent binary measurement (that is interaction with a system '''M''') causes a similar split in the history tree. Thus after three measurements, the system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of 8 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 copies of the original system '''S'''.\n\n===Relative state===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nIn his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that rather than modeling an isolated quantum system subject to external observation, one could mathematically model an object as well as its observers as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by [[Paul Dirac]], [[John von Neumann]] and others, discarding altogether the ''ad hoc'' mechanism of [[wave function collapse]].\n\nSince Everett's original work, a number of similar formalisms have appeared in the literature. One is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction is not simply a description of the object's state, but is entirely equivalent to the object\u2014a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Second, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], which considers the wavefunction collapse a special kind of event that occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in an observer's memory described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is DeWitt's popularisation of Everett, who had referred to the combined observer\u2013object system as being split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a tree as shown in the graphic above. Subsequently, DeWitt introduced the term \"world\" to describe a complete measurement history of an observer, which corresponds roughly to a single branch of that tree.\n\nUnder the many-worlds interpretation, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], or relativistic analog, holds all the time everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system comprising the observer ''and'' the object. One consequence is that every observation can be thought of as causing the combined observer\u2013object's wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches, or split into many \"worlds\". Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states.\n\nIf a system is composed of two or more subsystems, the system's state will be a superposition of products of the subsystems' states. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] and can no longer be considered independent. In Everett's terminology each subsystem state was now ''correlated'' with its ''relative state'', since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.\n\n===Properties===\n\nMWI removes the observer-dependent role in the [[quantum measurement]] process by replacing [[wavefunction collapse]] with [[quantum decoherence]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} Since the observer's role lies at the heart of most if not all \"quantum paradoxes,\" this automatically resolves a number of problems; see for example the [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the [[EPR paradox]], von Neumann's \"boundary problem\", and even [[wave-particle duality]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nSince the Copenhagen interpretation requires the existence of a classical domain beyond the one described by quantum mechanics, it has been criticized as inadequate for the study of cosmology.<ref name=\"gell-man1990\"/> The MWI was developed with the explicit goal of allowing quantum mechanics to be applied to the universe as a whole, making [[quantum cosmology]] possible.<ref name=everett57/>\n\nMWI is a [[philosophical realism|realist]], [[deterministic]], and [[principle of locality|local]] theory.

When [[photon|particles of light]] (or anything else) pass through the double slit, a calculation assuming wavelike behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.\n\nSome versions of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed a process of \"[[wavefunction collapse|collapse]]\" in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse down onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to \"explain\" this phenomenon of observation. Wavefunction collapse was widely regarded as artificial and ''[[ad hoc]]''<ref>Wimmel Hermann. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I63sCgAAQBAJ Quantum Physics And Observed Reality: A Critical Interpretation Of Quantum Mechanics], p.45, World Scientific, May 26, 1992</ref>, so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.\n\nEverett's Ph.D. work provided such an interpretation. He argued that for a composite system\u2014such as a subject (the \"observer\" or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the \"observed\" system, such as a particle)\u2014the claim that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become entangled: we can only specify the state of one ''relative'' to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated ''after'' the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a ''relativity of states''.\n\nEverett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone entailed that after an observation is made each element of the [[quantum superposition]] of the combined subject\u2013object wavefunction contains two \"relative states\": a \"collapsed\" object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subject\u2013object states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, ''as if'' wavefunction collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the ''appearance'' of the object's wavefunction's collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein's early criticism of quantum theory, that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory.{{efn|\"Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed.\"\u2014[[Albert Einstein]] to [[Werner Heisenberg]], objecting to placing observables at the heart of the new quantum mechanics, during Heisenberg's 1926 lecture at Berlin; related by Heisenberg in 1968.<ref name=\"einstein26\"> [[Abdus Salam]], ''Unification of Fundamental Forces'', Cambridge University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-521-37140-6}}, pp 98\u2013101</ref>}}) Since the wavefunction merely appears to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it had collapsed. And so, invoking [[Occam's razor]], he removed the postulate of wavefunction collapse from the theory.\n\n===Testability===\n\nIn 1985, David Deutsch proposed a variant of the [[Wigner's friend]] thought experiment as a test of Many-Worlds versus the Copenhagen interpretation.<ref name=\"deutsch1985\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch |first=D. |authorlink=David Deutsch |year=1985 |title=Quantum theory as a universal physical theory |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=24 |number=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1007/BF00670071 |bibcode=1985IJTP...24....1D}}</ref> It consists of an experimenter (Wigner's friend) making a measurement on a quantum system in an isolated laboratory, and another experimenter (Wigner) who would make a measurement on the first one. According to the Many-Worlds theory, the first experimenter would end up in a macroscopic superposition of seeing one result of the measurement in one branch, and another result in another branch. The second experimenter could then interfere these two branches in order to test whether it is in fact in a macroscopic superposition, or had collapsed into a single branch, as predicted by the Copenhagen interpretation. Since then Lockwood (1989), Vaidman and others have made similar proposals.<ref name=\"vaidman_stanfordencyclopedia\">{{cite book |last=Vaidman |first=Lev |title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2018 }}</ref> These proposals require placing macroscopic objects in a coherent superposition and interfering them, a task now beyond experimental capability.\n\n==Probability and the Born rule==\n\nSince the inception of the Many-Worlds interpretation physicists have been puzzled about the role of probability in the theory. As put by Wallace, there are two facets to the question:<ref name=\"wallace2003\"/> the ''incoherence problem'', which asks why should we assign probabilities at all to outcomes that are certain to occur in some worlds, and the ''quantitative problem'', which asks why should the probabilities be given by the [[Born rule]]. \n\nEverett tried to answer these questions in the very paper that introduced Many-Worlds. To address the ''incoherence problem'', he argued that an observer that made a sequence of measurements on a quantum system will in general have an apparently random sequence of results in their memory, which justifies the use of probabilities to describe the measurement process.<ref name=everett56/>{{rp|69-70}} To address the ''quantitative problem'', Everett proposed a derivation of the Born rule based on the properties that a measure on the branches of the wavefunction should have.<ref name=everett56/>{{rp|70-72}} His derivation has been criticized as relying on unmotivated assumptions.<ref name=ballentine1973>{{cite journal |author1=L.

Without this the theory was ambiguous, as a quantum state can be equally well be described (e.g.) as having a well-defined position, or as being a superposition of two delocalised states. The assumption that the preferred basis to use is the one coming from a measurement of position results in worlds having objects in well-defined positions, instead of worlds with delocalised objects (which would be grossly incompatible with experiment). This special role for measurements is problematic for the theory, as it contradicts Everett and DeWitt's goal of having a reductionist theory, and undermines their criticism of the ill-defined measurement postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation.<ref name=ballentine1973/><ref name=skyrms1976>{{cite journal |author1=Brian Skyrms |authorlink1=Brian Skyrms |title=Possible Worlds, Physics and Metaphysics |journal=Philosophical Studies |date=1976 |volume=30 |pages=323\u2013332 |doi=10.1007/BF00357930}}</ref> This is known today as the ''preferred basis problem''.\n\nThe preferred basis problem has been solved, according to Saunders and Wallace, among others,<ref name=saunders2010>{{Cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Simon|chapter=Many Worlds?

Systems such as '''S''' are referred to as 1-[[qubit]] systems.]] -->\nIn Everett's formulation, a measuring apparatus '''M''' and an object system '''S''' form a composite system, each of which prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing '''M''' and '''S''' to interact. After '''S''' interacts with '''M''', it is no longer possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of '''S''' given the state of '''M''' or the relative state of '''M''' given the state of '''S'''. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of '''S''' after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of '''S'''.\n\n[[Image:Splittings-1.png|thumb|left|350px|Schematic illustration of splitting as a result of a repeated measurement.]]\nFor example, consider the smallest possible truly quantum system '''S''', as shown in the illustration. This describes for instance, the spin-state of an electron. Considering a specific axis (say the ''z''-axis) the north pole represents spin \"up\" and the south pole, spin \"down\". The superposition states of the system are described by a sphere called the [[Bloch sphere]]. To perform a measurement on '''S''', it is made to interact with another similar system '''M'''. After the interaction, the combined system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of two \"alternative histories\" of the original system '''S''', one in which \"up\" was observed and the other in which \"down\" was observed. Each subsequent binary measurement (that is interaction with a system '''M''') causes a similar split in the history tree. Thus after three measurements, the system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of 8 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 copies of the original system '''S'''.\n\n===Relative state===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nIn his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that rather than modeling an isolated quantum system subject to external observation, one could mathematically model an object as well as its observers as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by [[Paul Dirac]], [[John von Neumann]] and others, discarding altogether the ''ad hoc'' mechanism of [[wave function collapse]].\n\nSince Everett's original work, a number of similar formalisms have appeared in the literature. One is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction is not simply a description of the object's state, but is entirely equivalent to the object\u2014a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Second, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], which considers the wavefunction collapse a special kind of event that occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in an observer's memory described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is DeWitt's popularisation of Everett, who had referred to the combined observer\u2013object system as being split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a tree as shown in the graphic above. Subsequently, DeWitt introduced the term \"world\" to describe a complete measurement history of an observer, which corresponds roughly to a single branch of that tree.\n\nUnder the many-worlds interpretation, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], or relativistic analog, holds all the time everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system comprising the observer ''and'' the object. One consequence is that every observation can be thought of as causing the combined observer\u2013object's wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches, or split into many \"worlds\". Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states.\n\nIf a system is composed of two or more subsystems, the system's state will be a superposition of products of the subsystems' states. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] and can no longer be considered independent. In Everett's terminology each subsystem state was now ''correlated'' with its ''relative state'', since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.\n\n===Properties===\n\nMWI removes the observer-dependent role in the [[quantum measurement]] process by replacing [[wavefunction collapse]] with [[quantum decoherence]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} Since the observer's role lies at the heart of most if not all \"quantum paradoxes,\" this automatically resolves a number of problems; see for example the [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the [[EPR paradox]], von Neumann's \"boundary problem\", and even [[wave-particle duality]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nSince the Copenhagen interpretation requires the existence of a classical domain beyond the one described by quantum mechanics, it has been criticized as inadequate for the study of cosmology.<ref name=\"gell-man1990\"/> The MWI was developed with the explicit goal of allowing quantum mechanics to be applied to the universe as a whole, making [[quantum cosmology]] possible.<ref name=everett57/>\n\nMWI is a [[philosophical realism|realist]], [[deterministic]], and [[principle of locality|local]] theory.

When [[photon|particles of light]] (or anything else) pass through the double slit, a calculation assuming wavelike behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.\n\nSome versions of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed a process of \"[[wavefunction collapse|collapse]]\" in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse down onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to \"explain\" this phenomenon of observation. Wavefunction collapse was widely regarded as artificial and ''[[ad hoc]]''<ref>Wimmel Hermann. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I63sCgAAQBAJ Quantum Physics And Observed Reality: A Critical Interpretation Of Quantum Mechanics], p.45, World Scientific, May 26, 1992</ref>, so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.\n\nEverett's Ph.D. work provided such an interpretation. He argued that for a composite system\u2014such as a subject (the \"observer\" or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the \"observed\" system, such as a particle)\u2014the claim that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become entangled: we can only specify the state of one ''relative'' to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated ''after'' the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a ''relativity of states''.\n\nEverett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone entailed that after an observation is made each element of the [[quantum superposition]] of the combined subject\u2013object wavefunction contains two \"relative states\": a \"collapsed\" object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subject\u2013object states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, ''as if'' wavefunction collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the ''appearance'' of the object's wavefunction's collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein's early criticism of quantum theory, that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory.{{efn|\"Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed.\"\u2014[[Albert Einstein]] to [[Werner Heisenberg]], objecting to placing observables at the heart of the new quantum mechanics, during Heisenberg's 1926 lecture at Berlin; related by Heisenberg in 1968.<ref name=\"einstein26\"> [[Abdus Salam]], ''Unification of Fundamental Forces'', Cambridge University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-521-37140-6}}, pp 98\u2013101</ref>}}) Since the wavefunction merely appears to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it had collapsed. And so, invoking [[Occam's razor]], he removed the postulate of wavefunction collapse from the theory.\n\n===Testability===\n\nIn 1985, David Deutsch proposed a variant of the [[Wigner's friend]] thought experiment as a test of Many-Worlds versus the Copenhagen interpretation.<ref name=\"deutsch1985\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch |first=D. |authorlink=David Deutsch |year=1985 |title=Quantum theory as a universal physical theory |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=24 |number=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1007/BF00670071 |bibcode=1985IJTP...24....1D}}</ref> It consists of an experimenter (Wigner's friend) making a measurement on a quantum system in an isolated laboratory, and another experimenter (Wigner) who would make a measurement on the first one. According to the Many-Worlds theory, the first experimenter would end up in a macroscopic superposition of seeing one result of the measurement in one branch, and another result in another branch. The second experimenter could then interfere these two branches in order to test whether it is in fact in a macroscopic superposition, or had collapsed into a single branch, as predicted by the Copenhagen interpretation. Since then Lockwood (1989), Vaidman and others have made similar proposals.<ref name=\"vaidman_stanfordencyclopedia\">{{cite book |last=Vaidman |first=Lev |title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2018 }}</ref> These proposals require placing macroscopic objects in a coherent superposition and interfering them, a task now beyond experimental capability.\n\n==Probability and the Born rule==\n\nSince the inception of the Many-Worlds interpretation physicists have been puzzled about the role of probability in the theory. As put by Wallace, there are two facets to the question:<ref name=\"wallace2003\"/> the ''incoherence problem'', which asks why should we assign probabilities at all to outcomes that are certain to occur in some worlds, and the ''quantitative problem'', which asks why should the probabilities be given by the [[Born rule]]. \n\nEverett tried to answer these questions in the very paper that introduced Many-Worlds. To address the ''incoherence problem'', he argued that an observer that made a sequence of measurements on a quantum system will in general have an apparently random sequence of results in their memory, which justifies the use of probabilities to describe the measurement process.<ref name=everett56/>{{rp|69-70}} To address the ''quantitative problem'', Everett proposed a derivation of the Born rule based on the properties that a measure on the branches of the wavefunction should have.<ref name=everett56/>{{rp|70-72}} His derivation has been criticized as relying on unmotivated assumptions.<ref name=ballentine1973>{{cite journal |author1=L.

Without this the theory was ambiguous, as a quantum state can be equally well be described (e.g.) as having a well-defined position, or as being a superposition of two delocalised states. The assumption that the preferred basis to use is the one coming from a measurement of position results in worlds having objects in well-defined positions, instead of worlds with delocalised objects (which would be grossly incompatible with experiment).
