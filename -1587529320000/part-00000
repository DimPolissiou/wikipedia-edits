In 1940 the school had become overcrowded and the district was divided at the [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk River]], with the west side of town attending the new [[Stonewall Jackson High School (Kanawha County, West Virginia)|Stonewall Jackson High School]] (\"The Wall\").  During the 1980s, enrollment at both schools dropped.  In 1989, Capital High School opened, combining the students of these two longtime rivals.  The name \"Capital\" derives from the fact that the school primarily serves the bulk of West Virginia's capital city, Charleston.\n\nThe first site considered was near [[Laidley Field]], next to the [[West Virginia State Capitol]].  This was abandoned in favor of a Track and Field Hall of Fame (which was never built) and a second site was selected on Greenbrier Street near the airport. However, when an airplane crashed on this site, it was abandoned, and today is an office park. The board then decided on a location on a hilltop about five miles from town that was formerly a [[country club]] for golfing and had a swimming pool. Although located in a rural setting, it is typically considered an inner-city school due the majority of its students coming from an inner-city environment. This system of busing from an urban location to a closed campus in a remote setting was successful in controlling many urban problems and was later copied by [[Huntington High School (West Virginia)|Huntington High School]] and Wheeling Park High School.\n\nIt is a modern school, built in 1989. It has a closed campus. It has a student population of around 1,400. Capital High School is Kanawha County's magnet school for the performing arts. It is the only high school in Kanawha County to offer a performing arts class every period of the day.\n\n==Achievements==\n\nFrom its establishment, Capital High School has a history of excellence in both academic and athletic competitions.   \n\n''<u>Academic</u>''\n\n* State Science Bowl champions in 2006 and 2008 and third runner-up in 2007.\n* S.C.O.R.E.S, a competition involving a multitude of subjects ranging from basic academic subjects to physical conditioning, champions in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. Schools from all over the state participate.\n* First place winners of the Marshall Math Examination in 2007, a three-hour exam using extended reasoning and critical thinking. Schools from West Virginia and the surrounding area participated.\n* Fourth place state Quiz bowl team in 2007 and first place in 2008.\n* First place local ACS (American Chemical Society) Competition winners in 2008.\n* 2015 West Virginia Quiz Bowl Champions\n\n''<u>Athletic</u>''\n\n*1989, 1991, 1995 & 2014 Class AAA Football State Champions\n* 1992, 1998 & 2003 Boys' Soccer State Champions\n* 2000 & 2001 Boys' Basketball State Champions\n*2001 & 2002 Girls' Basketball State Champions \n*2001 Volleyball State Champion\n*1991,1992, 2000 & 2002 Boys' Track & Field State Champions\n*1991, 2000, 2003 & 2004 Girls' Track & Field State Champions\n*2015 Boys' Lacrosse - West Virginia Scholastic Lacrosse Association Champions\n\n==''Phantom of the Opera'' production==\n\nIn 2007, Capital High was chosen by [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] Theatricals as one of six pilot schools to perform ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. The schools were chosen to determine how well amateur groups could perform the musical. The Capital Performing Arts Centre hosted five shows from May 1 to May 4, 2008.  Members of each performing arts group were involved in the production.\n\n==Performing arts==\n\nCapital High is Kanawha County's magnet school for the performing arts, offering a class in performing arts every period of the day. These include The Capital High Dance Company, the Capital High Theatre Department, the Capital High V.I.P.s (Voices In Perfection) Show Choir, the Capital High Orchestra, and \"The Pride of Capital High\" Marching and Concert Band as well as the Capital High School Jazz Ensemble. Each group has won numerous awards throughout the state of West Virginia, as well as outside of the state.\n\nThe Capital High Theatre Department is directed by Jeffery Haught. In 2015, the Capital High School Theatre Department won Outstanding Technical School and Outstanding Technical Theatre student at the West Virginia State Thespian Festival.\n\nThe Capital High Dance Company, accompanied by the Capital High Jazz Band, was selected to perform at \"Arts Alive: The Best of West Virginia,\" held on April 28, 2008 at the Maier Foundation Performance Hall at the [[Clay Center, West Virginia|Clay Center for the Arts and Sciences]]. The Capital High Dance Company has also performed at the WV Dance Festival, the WV Secondary Dance Alliance Weekend Celebration, SCORES, and for Festival 2009. They have also won numerous awards over the years. The director is Tabitha A. Moore.\n\nThe Capital High V.I.P.s (Voices In Perfection) Show Choir have won numerous grand championships and awards since the school's opening in 1989. The director is Kathleen G. Corbett, who has been the Director of Vocal Music since the school's opening. Corbett is also the head of Capital's Performing Arts Department.\n\nThe Capital High Orchestra, combined with the [[South Charleston High School]]  Orchestra, took First Place High School Orchestra and Best Overall Orchestra at Music in the Parks competition. They were also invited to the 2009 National Orchestra Festival held March 18\u201321, 2009 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The director is Dr. Jeffrey Lipscomb.\n\n\"The Pride of Capital High\" Marching Band is the result of hard-working students. With the first marching competition season came two Grand Championships, a marching style second to none, and what is called the trademark bow. Since the school's opening, the Pride of Capital High has won over 70 Grand Championships. The Pride of Capital High, along with the seven other public high schools in Kanawha County, compete in the [[Gazette-Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival]]. 2007 marked the tenth win for the band at the festival and the Class of 2008 became the first in to win the festival every year (including when the school was grades 10 through 12). In 2008, the band won the festival again and became the first band since 1984 to have won the festival for five consecutive years. They broke this record in 2009 and continued a winning streak until 2015, an eleven consecutive win streak with an overall of eighteen wins (1989\u201390, 1993, 1995, 1997, 2002, 2004\u201314, 2016). The band has had five girls named Miss Kanawha Majorette at the festival (in 1991, 1999, 2002, 2009, 2014). In the 2006\u20132007 academic school year, The Pride of Capital High went undefeated with a 5-0 winning streak, the first time the band went undefeated. The band has also performed for numerous Governors of West Virginia, two Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States, including former Vice President [[Al Gore]] and former Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2008. They have marched in the [[Indianapolis 500]] Pageant Parade, the 2005 [[Chicago]] State Street Thanksgiving Day Parade, the [[Citrus Bowl (game)|Citrus Bowl]] Parade (all three were nationally televised) in [[Universal Studios Orlando]], and [[Walt Disney World]]. The current Director of Bands is Brianna Blankenship. Former directors include William R. \"Bobby\" Jenks and Robert M. \"Bob\" Scott; the latter had been the Director of Bands since the school opened in 1989 until his retirement in 2011.\n\nThe Concert Band has received superior ratings at the Region IV High School Adjudications (which is also hosted by the school) since the school's opening in 1989. In 2010, the concert band served as the Honor Band for the West Virginia Music Educators Association All-State Conference festival held in Charleston that year.\n\nThe Jazz Band plays numerous times throughout the school year for community and school events and have won several awards. In 2008, the Jazz Band was the accompaniment for the Capital High Dance Company at Arts Alive: The Best of West Virginia. The two pieces they played for the Dance Company were \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\" and \"Bandstand Boogie\". The Jazz Band meets after school once a week after the marching season has ended and during the club/activity period. The Jazz Band is the first instrumental group formed for Capital High in the spring of 1989, before the school opened. It consisted of musicians from Charleston High School and Stonewall Jackson High School. The ensemble's first performance was in [[Florida]] on spring break of 1989 at [[Boardwalk and Baseball]] in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]]. The Capital High Instrumental Music Department had a performance before there was a school. The Jazz Band has since performed on board premiere Cruise Line & Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, the Governor's Christmas Tree Lighting, the Governor's Inaugural Parade and numerous venues around the city and state.\n\nEvery year, Capital High students have been selected, by audition, to be in one of several honors groups, including the West Virginia All-State Chorus, the West Virginia All-State Orchestra, the West Virginia All-State Band, the Kanawha County All-County Chorus, the Kanawha County All-County Orchestra, the Kanawha County All-County Band, the Kanawha County All-County Jazz Band, the [[West Virginia University|WVU]] Honor Band, the WVU Honor Orchestra, the [[Virginia Tech]] Honor Band, and other honors groups throughout West Virginia.\n\n==Sports==\n\nCapital High offers a number of sports throughout fall, winter, and spring.\n\n;Fall sports:\n*Cheer\n*Cross country\n*Football\n*Golf\n*Boys' soccer\n*Girls' soccer\n*Volleyball\n;Winter sports:\n*Boys' basketball\n*Girls' basketball\n*Swimming\n*Wrestling\n;Spring sports:\n*Baseball\n*Boys' Lacrosse\n*Girls' Lacrosse\n*Softball\n*Tennis\n*Track & field\n*Ice Hockey\n*Halo5 \n*Egames\n\n==Notable alumni==\n<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\nOnly people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here as notable people.

These include The Capital High Dance Company, the Capital High Theatre Department, the Capital High V.I.P.s (Voices In Perfection) Show Choir, the Capital High Orchestra, and \"The Pride of Capital High\" Marching and Concert Band as well as the Capital High School Jazz Ensemble. Each group has won numerous awards throughout the state of West Virginia, as well as outside of the state.\n\nThe Capital High Theatre Department is directed by Jeffery Haught. In 2015, the Capital High School Theatre Department won Outstanding Technical School and Outstanding Technical Theatre student at the West Virginia State Thespian Festival.\n\nThe Capital High Dance Company, accompanied by the Capital High Jazz Band, was selected to perform at \"Arts Alive: The Best of West Virginia,\" held on April 28, 2008 at the Maier Foundation Performance Hall at the [[Clay Center, West Virginia|Clay Center for the Arts and Sciences]]. The Capital High Dance Company has also performed at the WV Dance Festival, the WV Secondary Dance Alliance Weekend Celebration, SCORES, and for Festival 2009. They have also won numerous awards over the years. The director is Tabitha A. Moore.\n\nThe Capital High V.I.P.s (Voices In Perfection) Show Choir have won numerous grand championships and awards since the school's opening in 1989. The director is Kathleen G. Corbett, who has been the Director of Vocal Music since the school's opening. Corbett is also the head of Capital's Performing Arts Department.\n\nThe Capital High Orchestra, combined with the [[South Charleston High School]]  Orchestra, took First Place High School Orchestra and Best Overall Orchestra at Music in the Parks competition. They were also invited to the 2009 National Orchestra Festival held March 18\u201321, 2009 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The director is Dr. Jeffrey Lipscomb.\n\n\"The Pride of Capital High\" Marching Band is the result of hard-working students. With the first marching competition season came two Grand Championships, a marching style second to none, and what is called the trademark bow. Since the school's opening, the Pride of Capital High has won over 70 Grand Championships. The Pride of Capital High, along with the seven other public high schools in Kanawha County, compete in the [[Gazette-Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival]]. 2007 marked the tenth win for the band at the festival and the Class of 2008 became the first in to win the festival every year (including when the school was grades 10 through 12). In 2008, the band won the festival again and became the first band since 1984 to have won the festival for five consecutive years. They broke this record in 2009 and continued a winning streak until 2015, an eleven consecutive win streak with an overall of eighteen wins (1989\u201390, 1993, 1995, 1997, 2002, 2004\u201314, 2016). The band has had five girls named Miss Kanawha Majorette at the festival (in 1991, 1999, 2002, 2009, 2014). In the 2006\u20132007 academic school year, The Pride of Capital High went undefeated with a 5-0 winning streak, the first time the band went undefeated. The band has also performed for numerous Governors of West Virginia, two Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States, including former Vice President [[Al Gore]] and former Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2008. They have marched in the [[Indianapolis 500]] Pageant Parade, the 2005 [[Chicago]] State Street Thanksgiving Day Parade, the [[Citrus Bowl (game)|Citrus Bowl]] Parade (all three were nationally televised) in [[Universal Studios Orlando]], and [[Walt Disney World]]. The current Director of Bands is Brianna Blankenship. Former directors include William R. \"Bobby\" Jenks and Robert M. \"Bob\" Scott; the latter had been the Director of Bands since the school opened in 1989 until his retirement in 2011.\n\nThe Concert Band has received superior ratings at the Region IV High School Adjudications (which is also hosted by the school) since the school's opening in 1989. In 2010, the concert band served as the Honor Band for the West Virginia Music Educators Association All-State Conference festival held in Charleston that year.\n\nThe Jazz Band plays numerous times throughout the school year for community and school events and have won several awards. In 2008, the Jazz Band was the accompaniment for the Capital High Dance Company at Arts Alive: The Best of West Virginia. The two pieces they played for the Dance Company were \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\" and \"Bandstand Boogie\". The Jazz Band meets after school once a week after the marching season has ended and during the club/activity period. The Jazz Band is the first instrumental group formed for Capital High in the spring of 1989, before the school opened. It consisted of musicians from Charleston High School and Stonewall Jackson High School. The ensemble's first performance was in [[Florida]] on spring break of 1989 at [[Boardwalk and Baseball]] in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]]. The Capital High Instrumental Music Department had a performance before there was a school. The Jazz Band has since performed on board premiere Cruise Line & Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, the Governor's Christmas Tree Lighting, the Governor's Inaugural Parade and numerous venues around the city and state.\n\nEvery year, Capital High students have been selected, by audition, to be in one of several honors groups, including the West Virginia All-State Chorus, the West Virginia All-State Orchestra, the West Virginia All-State Band, the Kanawha County All-County Chorus, the Kanawha County All-County Orchestra, the Kanawha County All-County Band, the Kanawha County All-County Jazz Band, the [[West Virginia University|WVU]] Honor Band, the WVU Honor Orchestra, the [[Virginia Tech]] Honor Band, and other honors groups throughout West Virginia.\n\n==Sports==\n\nCapital High offers a number of sports throughout fall, winter, and spring.\n\n;Fall sports:\n*Cheer\n*Cross country\n*Football\n*Golf\n*Boys' soccer\n*Girls' soccer\n*Volleyball\n;Winter sports:\n*Boys' basketball\n*Girls' basketball\n*Swimming\n*Wrestling\n;Spring sports:\n*Baseball\n*Boys' Lacrosse\n*Girls' Lacrosse\n*Softball\n*Tennis\n*Track & field\n*Ice Hockey\n*Halo5 \n*Egames\n\n==Notable alumni==\n<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\nOnly people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here as notable people.

Hooke was one of the founders and directors of CCSDS.\n\nWhile IP-like SCPS protocols are feasible for short hops, such as ground station to orbiter, [[rover (space exploration)|rover]] to lander, lander to orbiter, probe to flyby, and so on, [[delay-tolerant networking]] is needed to get information from one region of the [[Solar System]] to another. It becomes apparent that the concept of a \"region\" is a natural architectural factoring of the Interplanetary Internet.\n\nA \"region\" is an area where the characteristics of communication are the same.<ref name=\"sunset\">[http://sunset.usc.edu/gsaw/gsaw2003/s3/hooke.pdf Interplanetary Internet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Region characteristics include communications, security, the maintenance of resources, perhaps ownership, and other factors.<ref name=\"sunset\" /> The Interplanetary Internet is a \"network of regional internets\".\n\nWhat is needed then, is a standard way to achieve end-to-end communication through multiple regions in a disconnected, variable-delay environment using a generalized suite of protocols. Examples of regions might include the terrestrial Internet as a region, a region on the surface of the Moon or Mars, or a ground-to-orbit region.\n\nThe recognition of this requirement led to the concept of a \"bundle\" as a high-level way to address the generalized Store-and-Forward problem. Bundles are an area of new protocol development in the upper layers of the [[Osi model|OSI model]], above the [[Osi model#Layer 4: transport layer|Transport Layer]] with the goal of addressing the issue of bundling store-and-forward information so that it can reliably traverse radically dissimilar environments constituting a \"network of regional internets\".\n\n[[Delay-tolerant networking]] (DTN) was designed to enable standardized communications over long distances and through time delays. At its core is something called the Bundle Protocol (BP), which is similar to the Internet Protocol, or IP, that serves as the heart of the Internet here on Earth.  The big difference between the regular Internet Protocol (IP) and the Bundle Protocol is that IP assumes a seamless end-to-end data path, while BP is built to account for errors and disconnections \u2014 glitches that commonly plague deep-space communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/18405-interplanetary-internet-robot-space-station.html|title=Space Station Astronaut Drives Robot on Earth via 'Interplanetary Internet'|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBundle Service Layering, implemented as the Bundling protocol suite for [[delay-tolerant networking]], will provide general purpose delay-tolerant protocol services in support of a range of applications: custody transfer, segmentation and reassembly, end-to-end reliability, end-to-end security, and end-to-end routing among them.

CFDP is an international standard for automatic, reliable file transfer in both directions. CFDP should not be confused with [[Coherent file distribution protocol|Coherent File Distribution Protocol]], which has the same acronym and is an [[IETF]]-documented experimental protocol for rapidly deploying files to multiple targets in a highly networked environment.\n\nIn addition to reliably copying a file from one entity (such as a spacecraft or ground station) to another entity, CFDP has the capability to reliably transmit arbitrary small messages defined by the user, in the [[metadata]] accompanying the file, and to reliably transmit commands relating to file system management that are to be executed automatically on the remote end-point entity (such as a spacecraft) upon successful reception of a file.\n\n==Protocol==\nThe Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems ([[CCSDS]]) packet telemetry standard defines the protocol used for the transmission of spacecraft instrument data over the deep-space channel. Under this standard, an image or other data sent from a spacecraft instrument is transmitted using one or more packets.\n\n=== CCSDS packet definition ===\nA packet is a block of data with length that can vary between successive packets, ranging from 7\nto 65,542 bytes, including the packet header.\n* Packetized data is transmitted via frames, which are fixed-length data blocks. The size of a frame, including frame header and control information, can range up to 2048 bytes.\n* Packet sizes are fixed during the development phase.\nBecause packet lengths are variable but frame lengths are fixed, packet boundaries usually do not coincide with frame boundaries.\n\n=== Telecom processing notes ===\nData in a frame is typically protected from channel errors by error-correcting codes.\n* Even when the channel errors exceed the correction capability of the error-correcting code, the presence of errors is nearly always detected by the error-correcting code or by a separate error-detecting code.\n* Frames for which uncorrectable errors are detected are marked as undecodable and typically are deleted.\n\n=== Handling data loss ===\nDeleted undecodable whole frames are the principal type of data loss that affects compressed data sets. In general, there would be little to gain from attempting to use compressed data from a frame marked as undecodable.\n* When errors are present in a frame, the bits of the subband pixels are already decoded before the first bit error will remain intact, but all subsequent decoded bits in the segment usually will be completely corrupted; a single bit error is often just as disruptive as many bit errors.\n* Furthermore, compressed data usually are protected by powerful, long-blocklength error-correcting codes, which are the types of codes most likely to yield substantial fractions of bit errors throughout those frames that are undecodable.\n\nThus, frames with detected errors would be essentially unusable even if they were not deleted by the frame processor.\n\nThis data loss can be compensated for with the following mechanisms.\n* If an erroneous frame escapes detection, the decompressor will blindly use the frame data as if they were reliable, whereas in the case of detected erroneous frames, the decompressor can base its reconstruction on incomplete, but not misleading, data.\n* However, it is extremely rare for an erroneous frame to go undetected.\n* For frames coded by the CCSDS [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction|Reed\u2013Solomon code]], fewer than 1 in 40,000 erroneous frames can escape detection.\n* All frames not employing the Reed\u2013Solomon code use a [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) error-detecting code, which has an undetected frame-error rate of less than 1 in 32,000.\n\n==Implementation==\nThe InterPlanetary Internet Special Interest Group of the [[Internet Society]] has worked on defining protocols and standards that would make the IPN possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipnsig.org|title=InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group (IPNSIG)|publisher=}}</ref> The Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG) is the primary group researching [[Delay-tolerant networking]] (DTN).

Bundles are an area of new protocol development in the upper layers of the [[Osi model|OSI model]], above the [[Osi model#Layer 4: transport layer|Transport Layer]] with the goal of addressing the issue of bundling store-and-forward information so that it can reliably traverse radically dissimilar environments constituting a \"network of regional internets\".\n\n[[Delay-tolerant networking]] (DTN) was designed to enable standardized communications over long distances and through time delays. At its core is something called the Bundle Protocol (BP), which is similar to the Internet Protocol, or IP, that serves as the heart of the Internet here on Earth.  The big difference between the regular Internet Protocol (IP) and the Bundle Protocol is that IP assumes a seamless end-to-end data path, while BP is built to account for errors and disconnections \u2014 glitches that commonly plague deep-space communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/18405-interplanetary-internet-robot-space-station.html|title=Space Station Astronaut Drives Robot on Earth via 'Interplanetary Internet'|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBundle Service Layering, implemented as the Bundling protocol suite for [[delay-tolerant networking]], will provide general purpose delay-tolerant protocol services in support of a range of applications: custody transfer, segmentation and reassembly, end-to-end reliability, end-to-end security, and end-to-end routing among them. The Bundle Protocol was first tested in space on the [[UK-DMC|UK-DMC satellite]] in 2008.<ref>[http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/publications/ Use of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Bundle Protocol from Space] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513145740/http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/publications/ |date=2008-05-13 }}, L.Wood ''et al.'', Conference paper IAC-08-B2.3.10, 59th International Astronautical Congress, Glasgow, September 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.sstl.co.uk/Press/UK-DMC-satellite-first-to-transfer-sensor-data-fro UK-DMC satellite first to transfer sensor data from space using 'bundle' protocol], press release, [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]], 11 September 2008.</ref>\n\n[[File:Deep Impact HRI.jpeg|thumb|right|210px|The ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' mission]] An example of one of these end-to-end applications flown on a space mission is the [[CCSDS File Delivery Protocol]] (CFDP), used on the comet mission, ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]''. CFDP is an international standard for automatic, reliable file transfer in both directions. CFDP should not be confused with [[Coherent file distribution protocol|Coherent File Distribution Protocol]], which has the same acronym and is an [[IETF]]-documented experimental protocol for rapidly deploying files to multiple targets in a highly networked environment.\n\nIn addition to reliably copying a file from one entity (such as a spacecraft or ground station) to another entity, CFDP has the capability to reliably transmit arbitrary small messages defined by the user, in the [[metadata]] accompanying the file, and to reliably transmit commands relating to file system management that are to be executed automatically on the remote end-point entity (such as a spacecraft) upon successful reception of a file.\n\n==Protocol==\nThe Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems ([[CCSDS]]) packet telemetry standard defines the protocol used for the transmission of spacecraft instrument data over the deep-space channel. Under this standard, an image or other data sent from a spacecraft instrument is transmitted using one or more packets.\n\n=== CCSDS packet definition ===\nA packet is a block of data with length that can vary between successive packets, ranging from 7\nto 65,542 bytes, including the packet header.\n* Packetized data is transmitted via frames, which are fixed-length data blocks. The size of a frame, including frame header and control information, can range up to 2048 bytes.\n* Packet sizes are fixed during the development phase.\nBecause packet lengths are variable but frame lengths are fixed, packet boundaries usually do not coincide with frame boundaries.\n\n=== Telecom processing notes ===\nData in a frame is typically protected from channel errors by error-correcting codes.\n* Even when the channel errors exceed the correction capability of the error-correcting code, the presence of errors is nearly always detected by the error-correcting code or by a separate error-detecting code.\n* Frames for which uncorrectable errors are detected are marked as undecodable and typically are deleted.\n\n=== Handling data loss ===\nDeleted undecodable whole frames are the principal type of data loss that affects compressed data sets. In general, there would be little to gain from attempting to use compressed data from a frame marked as undecodable.\n* When errors are present in a frame, the bits of the subband pixels are already decoded before the first bit error will remain intact, but all subsequent decoded bits in the segment usually will be completely corrupted; a single bit error is often just as disruptive as many bit errors.\n* Furthermore, compressed data usually are protected by powerful, long-blocklength error-correcting codes, which are the types of codes most likely to yield substantial fractions of bit errors throughout those frames that are undecodable.\n\nThus, frames with detected errors would be essentially unusable even if they were not deleted by the frame processor.\n\nThis data loss can be compensated for with the following mechanisms.\n* If an erroneous frame escapes detection, the decompressor will blindly use the frame data as if they were reliable, whereas in the case of detected erroneous frames, the decompressor can base its reconstruction on incomplete, but not misleading, data.\n* However, it is extremely rare for an erroneous frame to go undetected.\n* For frames coded by the CCSDS [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction|Reed\u2013Solomon code]], fewer than 1 in 40,000 erroneous frames can escape detection.\n* All frames not employing the Reed\u2013Solomon code use a [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) error-detecting code, which has an undetected frame-error rate of less than 1 in 32,000.\n\n==Implementation==\nThe InterPlanetary Internet Special Interest Group of the [[Internet Society]] has worked on defining protocols and standards that would make the IPN possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipnsig.org|title=InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group (IPNSIG)|publisher=}}</ref> The Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG) is the primary group researching [[Delay-tolerant networking]] (DTN).
