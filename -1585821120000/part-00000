{"title_page": "Ambovent", "text_new": "'''AmboVent''' (Official name: AmboVent 1690.108) is an [[open source]] automatic controlled [[ventilator]] device, designed to respond to the worldwide [[2019\u201320_coronavirus_pandemic_related_shortages#Mechanical_ventilation|shortages]] in mechanical ventilation devices as a result of the [[Covid-19]] respiratory disease epidemic outbreak caused by [[Coronavirus]]. The AmboVent respirator is engineered to be mass produced at low costs, using off-the-shelf components, without the need for complicated assembly lines. The solution, proposed by a team of Israeli engineers and medical experts, undergone rigorous engineering and medical testing.\n\n==Background==\nThe AmboVent system was developed as a solution capable of automatically and repeatedly squeeze a [[Bag valve mask]] (BVM), sometimes known by the proprietary name \"Ambu bag\" or generically as a \"manual resuscitator\" or \"self-inflating bag\", to generate a simple but effective alternative ventilator, for use in extreme situations. The system can operate with any Ambu (or other manufacturers) BVM, sizes 1100 - 1475 cm{{sup|3}} volume.\n\nThe R&D task was initiated by the [[Israeli Air Force]] Electronics and Teleprocessing Base (Unit 108) and others such as First Israel Robotics and various experts and mentors who joined the endeavor on voluntary basis. This ad hoc team work, together as an open organization, aiming at providing in ultra-short time, a viable, usable, simple and intuitive to use mechanical ventilator. The device is being developed in open code, on a non-profit basis, to enable free and simple mass productions by anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nJoint Partners in this project include MDA Israel, Ichilov Medical Center Tel Aviv, The Israeli Airforce, MASHA 7000 and other Israeli experts and mentors coming from various disciplines to collectively advance the project on voluntary basis.\n\n==Specifications==\n* Manual selection of tidal volume by choosing percentage of squeeze from full volume of bag (100%) ranging from 30% to 100% of full squeeze capacity. For example, choosing 60% on the dial means the device pushes out every cycle 60% of the full volume capacity of the BVM bag.\n* Enable selection of 9 different respiratory rates from 6-24 cycles per minute, increasing by steps of 2.\n* Compatible with Ambu and other commonly used self-inflating BVM bags, ranging between 1,100 to 1,475 cc.\n* Maximum inhalation pressure setting ranging between 30 to 70 cmH{{sub|2}}O, increasing by steps of 10.\n* Predetermined I:E time ratio of 1:2. Can be changed in the program.\n* Compliance with standard [[Positive_end-expiratory_pressure|Positive End-Expiratory Pressure]] (PEEP) valves.\n* In events of resistance during inhalation (abnormal rise in air pressure) the bag squeezing process stops and regains inhalation in the following cycle.\n* Insulation of electrical and electronic parts to prevent the chance of sparking (in pure oxygen-rich ventilation environment).\n* The ventilation bellows and piping connected to it are not part of the product and need to be provided by the medical center.\n\n==Functionality==\n* Compliance with the use, connection, parts and integration of ventilation piping available in medical facilities.\n* Compact and lightweight.

The ingredients were [[flatbread]] known as ''[[tortas de gazpacho]]'' and a [[stew]] prepared with ''Silene vulgaris'' leaves.<ref>[http://www.mis-recetas.org/recetas/show/5011-gazpachos-manchegos-viudos ''Gazpacho viudo'' recipe]</ref> Other dishes prepared with these leaves in Spain include ''\"potaje de [[chickpea|garbanzos]] y collejas\"'', ''\"[[Scrambled eggs|huevos revueltos]] con collejas\"'' and ''\"[[rice|arroz]] con collejas\"''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of plants with edible leaves]]\n*[[Castilian-Manchego cuisine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dipalme.org/Servicios/Anexos/anexosiea.nsf/VAnexos/IEA-HART-c30/$File/HART-c30.pdf Guisado de collejas]\n*[http://www.mis-recetas.org/recetas/show/1533-arroz-con-collejas Arroz con collejas]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q511103}}\n\n[[Category:Silene|vulgaris]]\n[[Category:Flora of Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Saponaceous plants]]\n", "name_user": "Luca.denardi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eItaly", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silene_vulgaris"}

He became well known for his tabloid nickname, '''\"Dirty Den\"'''.\n\nDen is the original landlord of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] from [[Albert Square]] - the local community of [[Walford]], a fictionalized borough in [[East London]] - who first appeared back when the show debuted on 19 February 1985. From then onwards, the character had a stormy love-hate relationship with his alcoholic first wife [[Angie Watts|Angie]] ([[Anita Dobson]]); after nearly 19 years of marriage, Den discovered that Angie lied to him about having six months to live and got revenge by giving divorce papers to her in the 1996 Christmas Day episode that was watched by more than half of the UK population at the time. While his marriage with Angie became was finished beyond repair, Den continued to develop a close interaction with their adopted daughter [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) - whom he grew fondly devoted towards throughout his time on the programme. Den soon became involved in storylines that mostly contributes to the character's magnanimous and \"bad boy\" persona. This involves Den getting Sharon's best friend, [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]), pregnant - which issued a durable feud with Michelle's mother [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) in the process; teaming up with longtime companion [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]) to force their enemy [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) out of Walford for causing trouble around the square; and getting revenge on business rival [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]) for raping Pete's beloved wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]).\n\nIn 23 February 1989, Den was apparently [[Kill off|killed off]] after getting involved with The Firm - a criminal organization who ended up trying to have him murdered in light of the character's imprisonment for having one of its members help him get revenge against Willmott-Brown. However, the character resurfaced 14 years later on 29 September 2003 when Sharon discovers that Den had survived the assassination and moving on to [[Spain]] afterwards. The development of Den's return to the show is contributed with the introductions of his and Michelle's daughter [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]] ([[Scarlett Alice Johnson]]), as well as Den's biological son [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) and later the character's manipulative second wife [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman|Tracy-Ann Oberman]]).\n\nDuring his second stint on the programme, Den repeatedly clashed with Dennis over his romantic feelings with Sharon - which sparked a longstanding father-son conflict between them that escalates after Den discovers that Dennis killed his mob boss [[Jack Dalton (EastEnders)|Jack Dalton]] ([[Hywel Bennett]]), and later destroys his relationship with local resident [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) by getting her to lie to Dennis that she is pregnant with their baby. Additionally, Den established a rivalry with Sharon's ex-boyfriend [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) that ends with him framing the latter for armed robbery; formed a mutual friendship with Pauline's colleague [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]); slept with Phil's ex-wife [[Kate Mitchell|Kate Morton]] ([[Jill Halfpenny]]) during her relationship with Pete and Kathy's son [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]); became publicly humiliated after losing a high-stakes poker game to the square's crime kingpin [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]); and conned Phil's sister [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) into relinquishing her ownership of The Queen Vic back to him by blackmailing her lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]]).\n\nDen was ultimately killed-off for good on 18 February 2005, the show's 20th anniversary episode that also featured Andy being murdered by his gangland successor [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) - who would later have Dennis killed on New Year's Eve 2005. During the show's 20th anniversary episode, Chrissie conspired with Sam and Zoe to get revenge on Den for the way how his antics had victimized them. They did so by destroying his relationship with Sharon, an act which prompted Den to attack Chrissie that resulted Zoe ended up hitting him with Pauline's dog doorstop; this seemingly killed Den until he regained concussions and was fatally [[Blunt trauma|bludgeoned]] to death by Chrissie. The character's death was watched by 17 million viewers - nearly 1/3 of the British population - and would later serve as an impact of concluding the [[Mitchell family|Mitchell]] and [[Watts family|Watts]] family friction; wherein Sharon teamed up with Phil, along with his brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and their mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]), to exonerate Sam after Chrissie framed her for Den's murder.\n\nHis character has been described by ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Louise Berridge]] as being arguably one of the most iconic soap characters ever.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Storylines==\n===1985\u20131989===\n[[File:Den Ange Divorce.jpg|right|thumb|200px|On Christmas Day 1986, 30.1 million viewers watched as Den served [[Angie Watts|Angie]] with divorce papers.]]\n\nDen Watts and his wife [[Angie Watts|Angie]] ([[Anita Dobson]]) are landlords of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] in [[Albert Square]], [[Walford]]. Den also has a mistress, [[Jan Hammond]] ([[Jane How]]). He gets [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]), the 16-year-old best friend of his adoptive daughter [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), pregnant - but she refuses to name the father, fearing repercussions for Den and herself. Den and Angie's relationship starts to fall apart when she meets Jan, but when Angie attempts suicide, Den ends his relationship with Jan despite preferring it to be the other way around. When Michelle gives birth to their daughter, [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]], she refuses to give Den any contact with her - though he financially supports Michelle in secret. For many years the secret is kept hidden but Michelle's mother, [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] ([[Wendy Richard]]), is one of the first to realize the truth, igniting a feud between her and Den, which intensifies when he admits to her in January 1988 that he is indeed Vicki's father and she slaps him in response.\n\nDen makes plans to leave Angie permanently; hoping to stop him, Angie claims that she is dying and has only six months to live in October that year. Den chooses to stay with her and tries to rebuild their relationship, promising to be there for her until her death. He takes Angie to [[Venice]] for a second honeymoon, but liaises with Jan, who is also there. Feeling guilty about her lie, Angie gets drunk on the way home via the [[Orient Express]] and admits to a barman that she is not dying, unaware that Den has overheard her drunken confession. He bides his time and gets revenge by serving her divorce papers on Christmas Day.\n\nThe couple's divorce is finalised in 1987 and Angie damages Den by demanding a large divorce settlement. Den runs The Queen Vic alone, initially assisted by Jan, but this relationship ends when Jan grows disillusioned with Den's treatment of her. Den has a fling with The Queen Vic's caterer, [[Magda Czajkowski]] ([[Kathryn Apanowicz]]), but is scorned when she eventually opts to date [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]) instead. When he discovers that they are seeing each other, he punches Simon, sacks him and throws him out of his home in The Queen Vic. He gets revenge on the two by manipulating an immature Simon into flirting with other women when his relationship with Magda hits a rocky road. Simon eventually starts seeing [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]), and his rejection hurts Magda. Den uses this opportunity. He feigns mock sympathy and seduces her, but before he gets her into bed, he tells her that he has to go on an errand. He instructs Magda to \"get ready\" for him, telling her that he will be back soon. He then leaves Magda undressed and waiting in his bed for hours, before instructing Simon's mother, [[Pat Butcher|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St Clement]]), to inform her that he is otherwise engaged, leaving her humiliated.\n\nWhilst single again, Den begins to realise that The Queen Vic's trade is floundering without Angie. With some meddling from Sharon, Den and Angie decide to reunite as business partners and she returns to live at The Queen Vic. However, it is short-lived, because Angie falls in love with her friend, [[List of EastEnders characters (1988)#Sonny|Sonny]]. Realising that Angie is planning to leave him, Den visits a solicitor and makes certain that Angie has no claim on The Queen Vic. Angie leaves [[Walford]] for Spain in May 1988 with nothing, and they never see or hear anything of each other again.\n\nHaving had a lengthy association with the criminal organisation known as The Firm, Den's involvement escalates over the summer of 1988. He hands over the tenancy of The Queen Vic to Pat and [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and takes over Strokes wine bar, which he runs with [[Joanne Francis]] ([[Pamela Salem]]). The wine bar is merely a front to the Firm's illegal gambling den. When [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) is raped by [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), Den manipulates a Firm member, [[Brad Williams (EastEnders)|Brad Williams]] (Jonathan Stratt), to burn down The Dagmar (Wilmott-Brown's wine bar) in revenge and the next day, he smugly hints to Wilmott-Brown that he organised it before pinning him against a wall and threatening him. This, however, is against the Firm's wishes so when the police investigation starts suspecting the Firm's involvement and what the Strokes wine bar is really used for, the Firm's bosses force Den to take the blame for the arson in order to distance their organisation from the attack. They take Den to a safe house in [[Manchester]], promising to alter his identity, but Den realises this is a cover and that the Firm are planning to kill him. Den escapes and hands himself in to the police to save his life and is remanded in custody in September 1988 at [[Dickens Hill]] prison.\n\nIn Dickens Hill, Den struggles initially, as many inmates refuse to trust him. Homosexual inmate [[Queenie Price]] (John Labanowski) takes an instant dislike to Den and suspects him of being a \"grass\", leading to Queenie and his friends beating him up in his cell. Despite this, Den unveils Queenie as the true prison-snitch and gains respect, rising through the ranks to become \"No.1\" of his landing. On the outside, the Firm still feel that Den is a liability; fearing that he will tell the police about their dealings and decide that Den has to die.[[Image:DEN DAFFS.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Den was shot by a man carrying a gun, hidden in a bunch of daffodils.]] They ambush and kidnap Den when he is being accompanied to trial on 23 February 1989 but Den escapes again and makes plans to leave the country. He contacts Michelle, requesting that they meet by a canal where they have held secret meetings in the past, so he can say goodbye to her and Vicki. Unaware that the Firm is following her, Michelle unwittingly brings them to Den and he is shot by a man who is hiding a gun in a bunch of daffodils. A splash is heard, indicating that Den has fallen into the canal. The police search for Den's body but don't find anything until Sharon finds Den's signet ring for sale on a market stall in April 1990 and requests that the canal be searched again, unaware that Den was not wearing it when he was shot.<ref>EastEnders Revealed \"The Return of Dirty Den\"</ref> This time, a body is found, and Sharon identifies it as Den.\n\n===2003\u20132005===\nIn the intervening years, Sharon and Vicki grow up, although not always living in Walford, and in early 2003, they discover that Den has a son he did not know of, [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), who joins them in Walford. Dennis was the product of Den's fling 30 years earlier with a woman named Paula Rickman.\n\nLike Den, Dennis has involvement with The Firm, and after some digging he discovers that Den is not actually dead; after surviving the shooting in 1989, Den fled to Spain with help from Jan and went under cover. Hearing this, Vicki traces Den and brings him back to Walford in September 2003. Sharon has mixed emotions: upset and anger, having assumed him dead for so many years. Den explains that the body found in the canal was that of Vinnicombe, a senior member of The Firm, who was murdered as punishment for Den's escape and dumped in the canal, his teeth having been bricked out to prevent dental identification. Vinnicombe's body had wrongly been identified as that of Den, and Jan had assisted in this cover-up by planting Den's signet ring by the canal. Den's grievances with The Firm are pardoned by its acting boss, [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]). Eventually, Sharon forgives him and Den returns to live in Walford to assist Sharon in managing her nightclub. Police soon learn of Den's return to Walford and promptly arrest him for perverting the course of justice. However, Den remains silent during intense questioning and the police ultimately decide not to charge him for any offense.\n\nDen gets embroiled in a feud with Sharon's former boyfriend, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), after hearing that Phil hit her and also arranged for Dennis to be beaten up by a gang. As revenge, Den sleeps with Phil's sister [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) - then dumps her promptly. He later promises another of Phil's former girlfriends, [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]), that he will help her get back her daughter [[Louise Mitchell|Louise]], who is in Phil's custody. After Phil plants drugs in the club and nearly gets it shut down, Den fakes a truce and talks Phil into accompanying him and Dennis on a warehouse robbery. Den bides his time and organises a scam to get Phil imprisoned. During the robbery, Den takes the money and obstructs Phil's getaway, resulting in Phil getting caught by the police and remanded. Den then helps Lisa flee the country with Louise, after Phil's current wife, [[Kate Mitchell|Kate]] ([[Jill Halfpenny]]), hands her over to Lisa after deciding to cut all ties with Phil. The feud brings Dennis closer to his father. Having lost his wife, his daughter and his freedom, Phil manages to escape several weeks later, confronting Den on Christmas Day; after an intense brawl in which Den hits Phil with a chair in order to avoid being killed, Den pays Phil off and he flees. Den then spends the rest of Christmas happily with his family, before leaving for Spain on Boxing Day to tie up some loose ends.\n\nFamily problems arise when Den returns three months later, and discovers that Sharon and Dennis are in a romantic relationship; Den accuses it of being incest, despite Sharon and Dennis not being blood-related. During an intense meeting between the two in The Queen Vic, Den calmly attempts to persuade Dennis to break up with Sharon, but when this fails, he turns nasty and mocks Dennis for believing that their bonding at Christmas was real. This leaves Dennis deeply upset but he recovers, and again refuses to break up with Sharon, leading to Den hurling him through some doors in The Queen Vic. Dennis laughs this off and tells Den that he is leaving to return to Sharon. Playing his last card, Den goads Dennis about his neglected childhood and implies that he suffered sexual abuse whilst in care, successfully provoking Dennis into accidentally hitting Sharon (who had just arrived) whilst trying to attack Den. A guilt-ridden Den later apologises and explains his reasons for not wanting his son and daughter together, because he wants both of them in his life, and he cannot have that if they are sleeping together. Den then tries to explain to Dennis that his feelings for Sharon are simply misguided due to the abuse he suffered as a child, which leaves Dennis confused and he decides to break up with Sharon in order to have a father-son relationship.\n\nIn 2004, it is revealed that Den had remarried whilst in Spain in 1999, and his estranged wife [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman|Tracy-Ann Oberman]]) arrives in Walford to collect some money from him. They then continue their romantic relationship and despite Sharon's heartache over Dennis, the Watts family reform their close bond. Den plays a heroic role when a fairground collapses in Walford and he saves numerous residents. He also tells Pete's son [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) that [[Garry Hobbs]]' ([[Ricky Groves]]) baby, [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Kevin Curran), is actually his and encourages him to be a father to him - with Den himself knowing how much a strain his own absence had on Dennis' life. Ian eventually accepts Bobby as his son and asks Den to be godfather at the christening.\n\nHowever, Den still cannot remain monogamous, and when Chrissie discovers that he has been sleeping with Kate, she leaves Walford. Furious with Den, Sharon and Vicki leave on holiday and contrary to his claims, Den is also troubled by Chrissie's departure. To cope with this, Den becomes more reckless and tries to reassert his bachelor status. He hosts a poker game at his house which eventually turns serious when only him and Andy Hunter remain. In a bid to get the Vic back, Den puts his house and club on the line but is narrowly beaten by Andy. Andy neglects to take Den's stake, but does tell Den to get his life sorted.\n\nLooking for revenge on Andy, Den convinces Pat to help him pull a scam in Andy's bookies, where Pat happens to work. The scam is initially successful and Den celebrates. However, Andy discovers the scam and humiliates Den in the Vic by revealing the poker game, just as Sharon returns. The next day, Dennis sends Den home from the club after he nearly gets into a fight with one of his own bouncers. Whilst at home, Den makes a pass at Dennis' girlfriend, Zoe, which Dennis witnesses. After receiving some harsh words, Den punches Dennis and leaves the house, where he sees a few teenagers breaking into the laundrette. After saving Dot, the two have a heart-to-heart, and Den agrees to call Chrissie. Upon meeting with Chrissie, Den decides he needs to get some time away and returns to Spain.\n\nDen returns in November 2004, apparently a new man. He apologises to Ian, Pat and his family. He also forces an older boyfriend of Vicki's to leave after discovering he cheated on her. Chrissie agrees to get back with Den after much convincing, but threatens to kill him if he ever cheats again.\n\nTo rebuild his family, Den attempts to regain The Queen Vic from the Mitchells just before Christmas 2004, by blackmailing their lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]]) into convincing Sam that Phil, who is still on the run, needs immediate money. Sam sells The Queen Vic to Den at a vastly reduced price and he reinstates his family at the pub in time for Christmas. Den re-cements his villainous status by kicking the Moon family out on Christmas Eve. With his pub back and his family together, Den looks to the future.\n\nThings go awry when Den discovers that Sharon and Dennis have resumed their affair and are planning on leaving for the United States, unless he can accept them both as a couple. In order to split them up, Den persuades [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) to lie that she is pregnant with Dennis's baby. Den's plan completely backfires when Sharon decides to leave alone instead, as she was unwilling to allow Dennis to leave his unborn child. While trying to persuade Sharon to stay, a panicking Den tells her that he does not have half the feelings for Vicki that he does for her, not realizing that Vicki was behind him and overheard everything. Vicki then decides to leave with Sharon. Den is horrified to have lost both of his daughters at Christmas, ironically because of his own lies and deceit.\n\n[[Image:Dens death77.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] kneeling over Den's corpse during the 20th anniversary episode. Consolidated figures reveal the episode was seen by over 17 million viewers (nearly 1/3 of the British population).<ref name=\"Telegraph article\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3653188/EastEnders-was-just-the-start.html|title=EastEnders was just the start|author=Raphael, Amy|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London, England |date=17 June 2006|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>]]\n\nIn apparent retribution towards Dennis for inadvertently being the cause of Sharon's departure, Den continues his baby lie with Zoe to ensure that Dennis stays. With Sharon gone, Den becomes more evil and twisted than ever, ignoring Chrissie's pleads to being thankful for the family he has. A week into the New Year, Den manipulates Zoe into having sex with him so she that can get pregnant and pretend the baby is that of Dennis. Following this, an ashamed Zoe attempts to back out of their arrangement, but Den spitefully blackmails her into continuing the lie, revealing his intention to cause misery for her and Dennis for causing Sharon's departure. When Zoe decides to tell Chrissie, Den laughs off the threat and reveals he does not care about his marriage. With no options left and desperate to keep Dennis, Zoe carries on the lie with Den.\n\nDuring this time, Den pretends to care for Dennis, who finally begins to see him as a father figure. Dennis also looks forward to the being a father and even begins to feel love for Zoe, who he had initially shunned out of his feelings for Sharon. However, when Dennis eventually catches Zoe and Den in bed together, he rejects the two of them and packs his bags. Despite this, Den appears pleased.\n\nIn the wake of this, Dennis leaves in search of Sharon - but not before telling Chrissie about Zoe and Den's affair, who does not reveal to Den that she knows. Instead, Chrissie slowly plans her revenge and when Zoe discovers she is pregnant with Den's child, Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, not letting on that she knows Den is the baby's father. She also concocts a plan of revenge to gain ownership of The Queen Vic from Den. She recruits Zoe and Sam (both also scorned by Den) and they confront him after closing time at The Queen Vic, one evening in February 2005. Den taunts them all for their weaknesses and refuses to sign over The Queen Vic, even when Chrissie threatens to reveal Den's true character to the rest of the Square. Den smugly admits to everything he's done but is left stunned when Sharon emerges from the shadows - Chrissie has lured her back from America with the pretence that Den was seriously ill. Despite Den's desperate explanations, Sharon disowns Den and leaves in a cab. In a rage, Den violently throws Chrissie against a fruit machine and is only stopped by Zoe, who hits him over the head with an iron doorstop in The Queen Vic, presumably killing him. Minutes later, whilst Sam and Zoe go upstairs, Den stirs and grabs Chrissie's ankle, telling her, \"You'll never get me out of The Vic!\" Chrissie responds by striking over the head again and he dies moments later.\n\nSam secretly witnesses the fatal blow, but Chrissie continues to allow Zoe to think it is she who has killed Den. The three women bury Den in The Queen Vic cellar and concrete it over. Arguments between the women occur, and Sam and Chrissie become embroiled in a feud to regain ownership of The Queen Vic, with Sam blackmailing Chrissie and digging up Den's body in the hope that Chrissie will be imprisoned, and Chrissie subsequently framing Sam for Den's murder, which leads to Sam's imprisonment. Sharon eventually learns the truth when Phil and his brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) - who had previously been married to Sharon during Den's 14-year absence - return to help their mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) bring down Chrissie and prove Sam innocent. It is then that both the Mitchell and Watts families have found themselves entangled in a conflict with Den's old friend, [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) - a local mob boss who recently usurped Andy from his position as Walford's reigning crime kingpin; on the night of Den's murder, Johnny killed Andy by throwing him off a motorway flyover. After working together to extract CCTV footage of Chrissie confessing Den's murder to her boyfriend [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]) in Johnny's nightclub, Dennis and Sharon help the Mitchells prove Sam's innocence; the police are called and Chrissie is arrested after Sharon intercepts her attempt to flee the country via the airport, and avenges Den's death by punching her whilst blurting out the last words she told Den before his murder.\n\nFollowing Chrissie's arrest, she is sentenced to life imprisonment after pleading guilty, and Den is finally given a proper burial in his \"original\" grave next to Angie.\n\nIn 2015, it is revealed Den was once in a gang which included Phil's father Eric Mitchell - along with his partner-in-crime [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) and their associates: Henry Hubbard and [[Ted Hills]] ([[Brian Croucher]]). It soon transpires that Gavin is actually Sharon's biological father, and that Den had apparently done a deal with Gavin: he would adopt Sharon in exchange for Gavin partaking one of Den's criminal jobs.\n\n==Character creation==\n\n===Background===\nDen Watts was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. The character of Den was originally going to be named Jack<ref name=\"insidestory\">{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|author2=Holland, Tony |authorlink2=Tony Holland |title= EastEnders - The Inside Story |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=978-0-563-20601-9|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> and he, his wife and adopted daughter were to be the occupants of the soap's local pub, now famously known as [[The Queen Vic]]. Holland, who had worked as a barman in his youth, called upon his own personal experiences to invent the Watts family and the pub they lived in.<ref name=\"insidestory\" /> Holland and Smith had always been critical of the way pubs had been portrayed on television feeling they lacked vitality and life, so they were determined that their pub and occupants were going to be more realistic.<ref name=\"insidestory\" /> The Watts were seen by Holland as integral to the show's success, partly because he had already guessed that the pub was going to be a monstrous battleground where emotions would run high on a regular basis, and also because the occupants would be providing the majority of the drama.<ref name=\"insidestory\" />\n\nDen's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''. In this passage, Den will be referred to as Jack, his wife as Pearl, his daughter as Tracey and his dog as Prince (known now as Angie, Sharon and [[Roly]] respectively).\n\n:\"Jack and Pearl are not criminals. They're not angels either. Villains perhaps? Well, he certainly is. They've been married for fifteen years, and haven't had sex with each other for thirteen of them. The marriage is a front for the sake of the pub's image. The daughter, Tracey is adopted\u2014maybe for the same reason. They have a dog too\u2014Prince\u2014an [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatian]]...Even with a marriage on the rocks, Jack still likes the area. His mates are here, it's friendly and it's his territory. \"Local lad makes good\"...People look up to him. If you've dragged yourself up by the scruff of the neck and moved up a notch, you need a few people around you who didn't quite make it, or you might as well be invisible. He's had a mistress for five years...Unlike Pearl, she's a very up-market woman, a lady, real class. Jack's her bit of rough, and they're happy. They actually talk. With Pearl, you shout - or shut up...He's a smart dresser. Changes his shirt twice a day and his shoes sparkle. He runs a good pub. He's firm and fair with the staff (if you've got any problems\u2014go to him, not her.) The cellars are well organised and spotless. His masculinity is the key to his character. It was called into question at an early stage in his marriage and he's defended it ever since. Some call him a ladies' man (because of his good looks) others - a man's man...He's a con man and has the gift of the gab. He can defend himself smartly in a brawl. (He's only ever thumped Pearly once.) You can accept Jack being a snob\u2014because it's not malicious: it's done with a grin. Like Pearl, he's also trapped by is background...Jack and Pearl's relationship is pretty heated...The smooth public face (workers in pubs are always on stage); the trial reconciliations; the rows; the fights and the tears...Will Jack ever bring his mistress into the pub, which is Pearl's territory?

Grantham had previously appeared on the London Fringe in a stage play Robinson had written. His only TV appearance at that point had been as Kiston, a small part in a 1984 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' directed by Robinson. Julia Smith remembered that she had taught Grantham at the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]] and regarded him as a \"mature student\", although she had never seen him \"in action\".<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> They needed the character of Den to have \"panache, charisma and electricity\". They were initially uncertain about casting Grantham, but they both felt that the actor had \"something\", which they went on to describe as a \"tensed up internal emotion of some sort, that was being held in. There was something behind the eyes, too. Barely contained violence almost...\"<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>\n\nAfter a successful reading with the actress Jean Fennell (who was originally cast as Angie), he was offered the part. However, shortly afterwards Grantham contacted Smith and asked to speak to her urgently. He revealed that he had been found guilty of killing a [[Germany|German]] taxi driver while on [[British Army|army]] service in 1967, and spent 10 years in prison. Although there were fears that if this story got out the resultant publicity would do enormous damage to the programme and the BBC, Smith decided not to withdraw Grantham from the role. In her opinion, he had paid the full penalty that society requires for a mistake committed in his past and it was a \"[[Christianity|Christian]] duty to forgive\".<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>\n\nThe story found its way into the British press much faster than expected. Three days after the transmission of episode one, ''EastEnders'' made the front page of a national newspaper for the first time with the headline \"EASTENDERS STAR IS A KILLER.\" The security gates at [[Elstree Studios]] (where ''EastEnders'' is filmed) were swamped with [[journalist]]s and [[photographer]]s, and so began a \"double-edged\" relationship between ''EastEnders'' and the popular press.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> The devisers of the programme were quick to realise that whilst a newspaper's publicity may sometimes boost a soap's position in the ratings, it could equally help to tarnish it. In conjunction, soaps could help to sell newspapers, and from then on stories about ''EastEnders'' and the cast began to fill their pages.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> Grantham was hounded by the press and the BBC was forced to put out a statement supporting him and their decision to employ a convicted murderer. In order to keep the press at bay, Grantham was smuggled out of the studios by the back route and decoy cars were used to lure the press away from his home, all of which put an increasing strain on the actor. Eventually the furore quietened down, but it never went away entirely and nearly every article written about the actor during his first stint in the show referenced his past. The press began to blur the characters in the show with the actors and it was at this point that Julia Smith \u2013 in an attempt to dispel confusion about reality and fiction \u2013 introduced the rule that no actor was ever to appear in public \"in character\".<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>\n\n==Character development and impact==\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Grantham, the Watts, with [[Anita Dobson]] as the newly appointed Angie, were the surprise hit characters of the show. Angie and Den were a live-wire couple whose on/off relationship made the Queen Vic pub exciting and unpredictable and the viewers tuned in their millions to watch the destruction of their relationship on-screen. Den's clashes with Angie brought ''EastEnders'' to a peak of popularity and toppled rival soap ''[[Coronation Street]]'' from the top of the ratings chart.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1992|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\n===\"Dirty Den\"===\nIn 1985, Den was the first person to speak on the first episode of ''EastEnders'': \"Stinks in here dunnit?\" just before he found out that [[Reg Cox]] (Johnnie Clayton) had been murdered. Early on in the series, the character of Den became central to the programme and was the focus of a controversial storyline involving the teenage pregnancy of [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]). Press interest in the show escalated as journalists continuously tried to predict who had fathered Michelle's baby. In true [[whodunnit]] fashion, the audience had been kept in the dark as to the real identity of the father and were given teasers implicating several residents on the Square. The audience finally discovered the culprit in episode 66 of the programme, October 1985. The episode was written by series co-creator/script editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, and was considered to be a landmark episode in the show's history. Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square in the early half of the episode: [[Tony Carpenter]] ([[Oscar James]]), [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nejdet Salih]]), [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] ([[Ross Davidson]]) and Den Watts. As Michelle waited by their rendezvous point a car pulled up and finally the fluffy white legs of Roly the poodle bounded out of the car, and gave it all away: Den Watts was the man meeting Michelle and it was he who had fathered her baby. It was when Den was revealed as the father that his famous nickname \"Dirty Den\" was created by the British press. The rest of the episode consisted of just one long scene, where Den and Michelle discussed whether or not to keep the baby. Up to that time it was the longest scene ever done in a soap-opera, lasting fifteen minutes. For a series that in its first eight months of existence had established a reputation for being fast-moving and rapidly cut, this was a bold experiment.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> It relied on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for over half an episode. Tony Holland's handling of the awkward scene between a teenage girl and the father of her best friend is deemed as one of the highlights of ''EastEnders'' first year.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The finishing touch was the use of an alternative end title music, a variation of the normal one which replaced the dramatic drum beats with a longer, gentler piano solo introduction.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAfter this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper [[cartoon]]s as it moved more and more into the public mainstream. One such cartoon showed the British [[Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], telling her cabinet that the best way to alert the country to the dangers of [[AIDS]] was to give the disease to Den.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>\n\n===Den and Angie mania===\nDuring 1986 the series became dominated by Den and Angie's storylines and the focus of the programme was very much concentrated on their combustible relationship. The emphasis began early in 1986 with the arrival of Den's mistress [[Jan Hammond]] ([[Jane How]]). Jan had been a powerful off-screen presence for the first year, a menacing voice at the end of the telephone, which severely affected the mood of both Den and Angie and kept the audience on edge every time the phone rang. Jan's physical arrival at the Vic in January 1986 was one of the show's dramatic highlights.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Her invasion of Angie's territory was a springboard to future emotional fireworks and a precursor to Angie's further dependence on alcohol and her attempted [[suicide]].\n\nDen and Angie's traumatic [[EastEnders two-hander episodes#Den and Angie (16 October 1986)|two-hander]] episode in October 1986 was another risky experiment for ''EastEnders'' \u2014 A thirty-minute episode with only two people in it had never been attempted in a soap before.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Holland and Smith feared that the episode would not hold up, however press and audience alike were in agreement that it did.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Once it was done, it set a precedent and the programme has featured two-handers ever since. The episode was structured like a \"tennis match\" between Angie and Den, with a non-speaking window-cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. It began with Den trying to tell Angie that he wanted a divorce. Angie was shocked and for a moment defeated, but she then dropped her bombshell and told Den that she only had six months to live. At first Den didn't believe her, but eventually Angie's hysterical performance convinced him. He crumbled and promised to stay with her and only after he left did Angie smile in triumph, letting the audience in on her secret that it was all a big lie. Written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird, this episode is considered to be one of the finest episodes in ''EastEnders''' catalogue.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nThe Den/Angie/Jan triangle was to continue for many months. The climax was a trip to [[Venice]] when Angie \u2013 convinced that Den had finished with his mistress \u2013 was taken there for a second honeymoon, returning to London on the [[Orient Express]]. This gave the writers and producers an opportunity to open the show up from the confines of Albert Square.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> However the trip to Venice was fraught with problems and Dobson, Grantham and Jane How were hounded by the press at all times. Their photographs appeared in British newspapers, thus ruining the shock surprise that Tony Holland had created, by including Den's mistress in the episode.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> Despite huge efforts from all involved the Venice episodes were only moderately successful, although the revelations discovered by Den in the episode set the scene for one of ''EastEnders''' most renowned episodes, which aired on Christmas Day that year.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> After over-hearing his wife confess that her illness was fabricated, Den filed for divorce. 30.1 million viewers tuned in on Christmas Day in 1986, to witness Den handing Angie her divorce papers, giving the soap its highest ever episode rating, which has yet to be beaten by any other plotline from any other soap in the UK.<ref name=\"XMAS86\">\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19861225.shtml EastEnders Xmas 86] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825101316/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19861225.shtml |date=25 August 2006 }}\", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-21.</ref>\n\nThis storyline saw the separation of Den and Angie. Holland and Smith had anticipated that Den and Angie would be popular, but they had not guessed how hysterical the reaction to them would be. It was decided that Den and Angie would have to be played down for a while so that other characters would have the opportunity to shine through.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> The next few years saw Den and Angie struggle to get by without each other and eventually they reunited as business partners.\n\n===Arrest and demise===\nHowever, at the beginning of 1988 [[Anita Dobson]] decided that she wanted to move on after three years of playing Angie. She made her final appearance in May that year. [[Leslie Grantham]] had also decided that he wanted to move on, but [[Julia Smith]] didn't want the programme to suffer the double blow of losing both Den and Angie so close together. The solution to the problem was one of the soap's most complicated and creative exercises, that required intricate planning.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The idea was to enable Den to stay as an on-screen presence into 1989, while keeping Grantham working for ''EastEnders'' only until the autumn of 1988. [[Tony Holland]] and writer/editor Bill Lyons came up with a story to put Den in prison for a year, intending that material recorded in a block of intensive filming would then be included in the programme for the rest of the year. The programme didn't want to make Den into a criminal, however, so he had to be put in prison for doing something that could be justified to the viewing public \u2013 otherwise there would be no sympathy for him.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The answer lay in a storyline that was running with another character \u2013 the rape of [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]). After simultaneously getting in way over his head with a criminal organisation (The Firm), Den torched Kathy's rapist's winebar in retaliation, and was then made to take the blame for the deed by the firm. After he refused, went on the run, and was nearly killed by the firm's heavies, Den turned himself into the police and was put on remand at [[Dickens Hill]] prison in September 1988. For the next five months he was seen, in the company of a small group of new but ultimately short-lived characters also confined in the prison, on a regular basis in ''EastEnders''. This material was shot in less than a month at [[Dartmoor Prison]], [[Devon]]. When these segments were written and recorded, they were done so entirely in isolation and in advance - the production team had no real idea of other material that would have to fit around it.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nThe character was eventually to bow out on 23 February 1989 in one of the programme's most famous episodes which attracted well over 20 million viewers. After being abducted by a group of gangsters who ambushed the taxi taking him to court, Den escaped from his captors and returned to the famous canal (in [[Alperton]]) for one last rendezvous with Michelle. The episode ended with Den being shot by a member of the firm (who was carrying a gun concealed in a bunch of [[daffodil]]s) and then falling into the canal. The scene where Den actually hit the water had to be taped at the BBC's [[Ealing]] Film Studios using a water tank, because the waters of the [[Grand Union Canal]] were deemed unsafe. When the episode was finished, however, Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, requested that the final shot be removed to allow for the possibility of Den returning in the future. In protest, [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]] had their names taken off the episode's credits. Den's exit ended up being the creators' final contribution to the show.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\n===Controversial return===\nHowever, after 14 years presumed dead, executive-producer [[Louise Berridge]] made the highly controversial decision to reintroduce the character to the series and reunite him with his daughter Sharon, played by [[Letitia Dean]]. Grantham has alleged that the producers of ''EastEnders'' asked him to reprise the role many times since 1991, but he turned each offer down as he was unhappy with the returning storylines. Subsequent offers between 1995 and 2001 were also rejected because Den's screen family were no longer in the show and Grantham felt that a return at this time would have been little more than a publicity stunt. However, he accepted Berridge's offer to return in 2002 as he approved of the storyline and because Den had family ties within the cast - his adoptive daughter Sharon had returned after six years away, his other daughter Vicki was due to return, and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) - the son Den hadn't known existed - was also due to join.\n\nThe reintroduction of Den was part of a plan by scriptwriters to fight back against the continued success of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s long-running soap, ''Coronation Street''. The character made his \"dramatic return\" in an episode that aired on 29 September 2003.<ref>\"[http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/content_objectid=13457355_method=full_siteid=106694_headline=-HUNK-DENNIS-ON-HIS-ROMP-WITH-SHARON-name_page.html HUNK DENNIS ON HIS ROMP WITH SHARON]\", ''Sunday Mirror''.

After a successful Christmas storyline, Grantham took a short break from the show after securing a lengthy contract.<ref>\"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031005/ai_n12586279 'Dirty' Dirty Tactics; EastEnders defied belief by raising Den Watts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121214215/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031005/ai_n12586279 |date=21 November 2007 }}\", ''Sunday Herald''.

Grantham was subsequently suspended for two months and his character departed on 30 August, before returning on the episode broadcast on 11 November. Newly appointed executive-producer [[Kathleen Hutchison]] then made the decision to axe the character and he was killed off in a high-profile storyline, which saw his body buried in the cellar of The Queen Vic.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3988347.stm Dirty Den actor leaves EastEnders]\", ''BBC''.

Jordan had started working at ''EastEnders'' in 1989, after Den had already left the series. Jordan had always wanted to write material for Den and Angie and so he campaigned for the return of Den for many years.<ref name=\"jordan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/21+years+of+EastEnders%3a+SECRETS+OF+WALFORD%3b+EXCLUSIVE+SCRIPTWRITER...-a0142121208|title=21 years of EastEnders|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|first=Jane|last=Simon|date=16 February 2006|accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref> He told the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', \"At story conferences I'd say, 'How do we know he's dead? They never found a body'. Eventually, just to shut me up, they made me write an episode where Den's body was found and identified by his ring.\"<ref name=\"jordan\"/> Jordan finally got his way in 2003; however, according to the writer, [[Leslie Grantham]]'s internet sex scandal spelled the demise of the character. Commenting on this, Jordan said, \"If [the scandal] hadn't come out I think it would have worked and he'd still be in the show. When I saw him on screen after those revelations came out, suddenly I couldn't believe in the character any more. I was starting to love the character and buying into all of it, but after that I saw him as [[Leslie Grantham]] - not Den Watts. He was older, and flawed in all the wrong ways. I think a lot of viewers felt the same, and the cast as well, probably.\"<ref name=\"jordan\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nDespite the controversy surrounding Grantham, the character of Den remains one of the most popular and high-profile characters in ''EastEnders'' history and was voted the 75th greatest television character of all time in a [[Channel 4]] poll.<ref>\"[http://www.thecustard.tv/linksandlists/100characters.html 100 Greatest Television Characters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215114222/http://www.thecustard.tv/linksandlists/100characters.html |date=15 December 2007 }}\", ''Custard.tv - Channel 4 poll''.

Leslie Grantham had played Kiston in an early television role in the ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''.\n\nThe 2006 episode of ''Doctor Who'' entitled \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\" features a scene where [[Peggy Mitchell]] tells the \"ghost\" of Den to \"get outta my pub!\" as the only spirits that will be served are vodka, whiskey and gin.

He became well known for his tabloid nickname, '''\"Dirty Den\"'''.\n\nDen is the original landlord of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] from [[Albert Square]] - the local community of [[Walford]], a fictionalized borough in [[East London]] - who first appeared back when the show debuted on 19 February 1985. From then onwards, the character had a stormy love-hate relationship with his alcoholic first wife [[Angie Watts|Angie]] ([[Anita Dobson]]); after nearly 19 years of marriage, Den discovered that Angie lied to him about having six months to live and got revenge by giving divorce papers to her in the 1996 Christmas Day episode that was watched by more than half of the UK population at the time. While his marriage with Angie became was finished beyond repair, Den continued to develop a close interaction with their adopted daughter [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) - whom he grew fondly devoted towards throughout his time on the programme. Den soon became involved in storylines that mostly contributes to the character's magnanimous and \"bad boy\" persona. This involves Den getting Sharon's best friend, [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]), pregnant - which issued a durable feud with Michelle's mother [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) in the process; teaming up with longtime companion [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]) to force their enemy [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) out of Walford for causing trouble around the square; and getting revenge on business rival [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]) for raping Pete's beloved wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]).\n\nIn 23 February 1989, Den was apparently [[Kill off|killed off]] after getting involved with The Firm - a criminal organization who ended up trying to have him murdered in light of the character's imprisonment for having one of it's members help him get revenge against Willmott-Brown. However, the character resurfaced 14 years later on 29 September 2003 when Sharon discovers that Den had survived the assassination and moving on to [[Spain]] afterwards. The development of Den's return to the show is contributed with the introductions of his and Michelle's daughter [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]] ([[Scarlett Alice Johnson]]), as well as Den's biological son [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) and later the character's manipulative second wife [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman|Tracy-Ann Oberman]]).\n\nDuring his second stint on the programme, Den repeatedly clashed with Dennis over his romantic feelings with Sharon - which sparked a longstanding father-son conflict between them that escalates after Den discovers that Dennis killed his mob boss [[Jack Dalton (EastEnders)|Jack Dalton]] ([[Hywel Bennett]]), and later destroys his relationship with local resident [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) by getting her to lie to Dennis that she is pregnant with their baby. Additionally, Den established a rivalry with Sharon's ex-boyfriend [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) that ends with him framing the latter for armed robbery; formed a mutual friendship with Pauline's colleague [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]); slept with Phil's ex-wife [[Kate Mitchell|Kate Morton]] ([[Jill Halfpenny]]) during her relationship with Pete and Kathy's son [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]); became publicly humiliated after losing a high-stakes poker game to the square's crime kingpin [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]); and conned Phil's sister [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) into relinquishing her ownership of The Queen Vic back to him by blackmailing her lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]]).\n\nDen was ultimately killed-off for good on 18 February 2005, the show's 20th anniversary episode that also featured Andy being murdered by his gangland successor [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) - who would later have Dennis killed on New Years Eve 2005. During the show's 20th anniversary episode, Chrissie conspired with Sam and Zoe to get revenge on Den for the way how his antics had victimized them. They did so by destroying his relationship with Sharon, an act which prompted Den to attack Chrissie that resulted Zoe ended up hitting him with Pauline's dog doorstop; this seemingly killed Den until he regained concussions and was fatally [[Blunt trauma|bludgeoned]] to death by Chrissie. The character's death was watched by 17 million viewers - nearly 1/3 of the British population - and would later serve as an impact of concluding the [[Mitchell family|Mitchell]] and [[Watts family|Watts]] family friction; wherein Sharon teamed up with Phil, along with his brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and their mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]), to exonerate Sam after Chrissie framed her for Den's murder.\n\nHis character has been described by ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Louise Berridge]] as being arguably one of the most iconic soap characters ever.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Storylines==\n===1985\u20131989===\n[[File:Den Ange Divorce.jpg|right|thumb|200px|On Christmas Day 1986, 30.1 million viewers watched as Den served [[Angie Watts|Angie]] with divorce papers.]]\n\nDen Watts and his wife [[Angie Watts|Angie]] ([[Anita Dobson]]) are landlords of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] in [[Albert Square]], [[Walford]].

For many years the secret is kept hidden but Michelle's mother, [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] ([[Wendy Richard]]), is one of the first to realize the truth, igniting a feud between her and Den, which intensifies when he admits to her in January 1988 that he is indeed Vicki's father and she slaps him in response.\n\nDen makes plans to leave Angie permanently; hoping to stop him, Angie claims that she is dying and has only six months to live in October that year. Den chooses to stay with her and tries to rebuild their relationship, promising to be there for her until her death. He takes Angie to [[Venice]] for a second honeymoon, but liaises with Jan, who is also there. Feeling guilty about her lie, Angie gets drunk on the way home via the [[Orient Express]] and admits to a barman that she is not dying, unaware that Den has overheard her drunken confession. He bides his time and gets revenge by serving her divorce papers on Christmas Day.\n\nThe couple's divorce is finalised in 1987 and Angie damages Den by demanding a large divorce settlement. Den runs The Queen Vic alone, initially assisted by Jan, but this relationship ends when Jan grows disillusioned with Den's treatment of her. Den has a fling with The Queen Vic's caterer, [[Magda Czajkowski]] ([[Kathryn Apanowicz]]), but is scorned when she eventually opts to date [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]) instead. When he discovers that they are seeing each other, he punches Simon, sacks him and throws him out of his home in The Queen Vic. He gets revenge on the two by manipulating an immature Simon into flirting with other women when his relationship with Magda hits a rocky road. Simon eventually starts seeing [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]), and his rejection hurts Magda. Den uses this opportunity. He feigns mock sympathy and seduces her, but before he gets her into bed, he tells her that he has to go on an errand. He instructs Magda to \"get ready\" for him, telling her that he will be back soon. He then leaves Magda undressed and waiting in his bed for hours, before instructing Simon's mother, [[Pat Butcher|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St Clement]]), to inform her that he is otherwise engaged, leaving her humiliated.\n\nWhilst single again, Den begins to realise that The Queen Vic's trade is floundering without Angie. With some meddling from Sharon, Den and Angie decide to reunite as business partners and she returns to live at The Queen Vic. However, it is short-lived, because Angie falls in love with her friend, [[List of EastEnders characters (1988)#Sonny|Sonny]]. Realising that Angie is planning to leave him, Den visits a solicitor and makes certain that Angie has no claim on The Queen Vic. Angie leaves [[Walford]] for Spain in May 1988 with nothing, and they never see or hear anything of each other again.\n\nHaving had a lengthy association with the criminal organisation known as The Firm, Den's involvement escalates over the summer of 1988. He hands over the tenancy of The Queen Vic to Pat and [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and takes over Strokes wine bar, which he runs with [[Joanne Francis]] ([[Pamela Salem]]). The wine bar is merely a front to the Firm's illegal gambling den. When [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) is raped by [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), Den manipulates a Firm member, [[Brad Williams (EastEnders)|Brad Williams]] (Jonathan Stratt), to burn down The Dagmar (Wilmott-Brown's wine bar) in revenge and the next day, he smugly hints to Wilmott-Brown that he organised it before pinning him against a wall and threatening him. This, however, is against the Firm's wishes so when the police investigation starts suspecting the Firm's involvement and what the Strokes wine bar is really used for, the Firm's bosses force Den to take the blame for the arson in order to distance their organisation from the attack. They take Den to a safe house in [[Manchester]], promising to alter his identity, but Den realises this is a cover and that the Firm are planning to kill him. Den escapes and hands himself in to the police to save his life and is remanded in custody in September 1988 at [[Dickens Hill]] prison.\n\nIn Dickens Hill, Den struggles initially, as many inmates refuse to trust him. Homosexual inmate [[Queenie Price]] (John Labanowski) takes an instant dislike to Den and suspects him of being a \"grass\", leading to Queenie and his friends beating him up in his cell. Despite this, Den unveils Queenie as the true prison-snitch and gains respect, rising through the ranks to become \"No.1\" of his landing. On the outside, the Firm still feel that Den is a liability; fearing that he will tell the police about their dealings and decide that Den has to die.[[Image:DEN DAFFS.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Den was shot by a man carrying a gun, hidden in a bunch of daffodils.]] They ambush and kidnap Den when he is being accompanied to trial on 23 February 1989 but Den escapes again and makes plans to leave the country. He contacts Michelle, requesting that they meet by a canal where they have held secret meetings in the past, so he can say goodbye to her and Vicki. Unaware that the Firm is following her, Michelle unwittingly brings them to Den and he is shot by a man who is hiding a gun in a bunch of daffodils. A splash is heard, indicating that Den has fallen into the canal. The police search for Den's body but don't find anything until Sharon finds Den's signet ring for sale on a market stall in April 1990 and requests that the canal be searched again, unaware that Den was not wearing it when he was shot.<ref>EastEnders Revealed \"The Return of Dirty Den\"</ref> This time, a body is found, and Sharon identifies it as Den.\n\n===2003\u20132005===\nIn the intervening years, Sharon and Vicki grow up, although not always living in Walford, and in early 2003, they discover that Den has a son he did not know of, [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), who joins them in Walford. Dennis was the product of Den's fling 30 years earlier with a woman named Paula Rickman.\n\nLike Den, Dennis has involvement with The Firm, and after some digging he discovers that Den is not actually dead; after surviving the shooting in 1989, Den fled to Spain with help from Jan and went under cover. Hearing this, Vicki traces Den and brings him back to Walford in September 2003. Sharon has mixed emotions: upset and anger, having assumed him dead for so many years. Den explains that the body found in the canal was that of Vinnicombe, a senior member of The Firm, who was murdered as punishment for Den's escape and dumped in the canal, his teeth having been bricked out to prevent dental identification. Vinnicombe's body had wrongly been identified as that of Den, and Jan had assisted in this cover-up by planting Den's signet ring by the canal. Den's grievances with The Firm are pardoned by its acting boss, [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]). Eventually, Sharon forgives him and Den returns to live in Walford to assist Sharon in managing her nightclub. Police soon learn of Den's return to Walford and promptly arrest him for perverting the course of justice. However, Den remains silent during intense questioning and the police ultimately decide not to charge him for any offense.\n\nDen gets embroiled in a feud with Sharon's former boyfriend, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), after hearing that Phil hit her and also arranged for Dennis to be beaten up by a gang. As revenge, Den sleeps with Phil's sister [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) - then dumps her promptly. He later promises another of Phil's former girlfriends, [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]), that he will help her get back her daughter [[Louise Mitchell|Louise]], who is in Phil's custody. After Phil plants drugs in the club and nearly gets it shut down, Den fakes a truce and talks Phil into accompanying him and Dennis on a warehouse robbery. Den bides his time and organises a scam to get Phil imprisoned. During the robbery, Den takes the money and obstructs Phil's getaway, resulting in Phil getting caught by the police and remanded. Den then helps Lisa flee the country with Louise, after Phil's current wife, [[Kate Mitchell|Kate]] ([[Jill Halfpenny]]), hands her over to Lisa after deciding to cut all ties with Phil. The feud brings Dennis closer to his father. Having lost his wife, his daughter and his freedom, Phil manages to escape several weeks later, confronting Den on Christmas Day; after an intense brawl in which Den hits Phil with a chair in order to avoid being killed, Den pays Phil off and he flees. Den then spends the rest of Christmas happily with his family, before leaving for Spain on Boxing Day to tie up some loose ends.\n\nFamily problems arise when Den returns three months later, and discovers that Sharon and Dennis are in a romantic relationship; Den accuses it of being incest, despite Sharon and Dennis not being blood-related. During an intense meeting between the two in The Queen Vic, Den calmly attempts to persuade Dennis to break up with Sharon, but when this fails, he turns nasty and mocks Dennis for believing that their bonding at Christmas was real. This leaves Dennis deeply upset but he recovers, and again refuses to break up with Sharon, leading to Den hurling him through some doors in The Queen Vic. Dennis laughs this off and tells Den that he is leaving to return to Sharon. Playing his last card, Den goads Dennis about his neglected childhood and implies that he suffered sexual abuse whilst in care, successfully provoking Dennis into accidentally hitting Sharon (who had just arrived) whilst trying to attack Den. A guilt-ridden Den later apologises and explains his reasons for not wanting his son and daughter together, because he wants both of them in his life, and he cannot have that if they are sleeping together. Den then tries to explain to Dennis that his feelings for Sharon are simply misguided due to the abuse he suffered as a child, which leaves Dennis confused and he decides to break up with Sharon in order to have a father-son relationship.\n\nIn 2004, it is revealed that Den had remarried whilst in Spain in 1999, and his estranged wife [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman|Tracy-Ann Oberman]]) arrives in Walford to collect some money from him. They then continue their romantic relationship and despite Sharon's heartache over Dennis, the Watts family reform their close bond. Den plays a heroic role when a fairground collapses in Walford and he saves numerous residents. He also tells Pete's son [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) that [[Garry Hobbs]]' ([[Ricky Groves]]) baby, [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Kevin Curran), is actually his and encourages him to be a father to him - with Den himself knowing how much a strain his own absence had on Dennis' life. Ian eventually accepts Bobby as his son and asks Den to be godfather at the christening.\n\nHowever, Den still cannot remain monogamous, and when Chrissie discovers that he has been sleeping with Kate, she leaves Walford. Furious with Den, Sharon and Vicki leave on holiday and contrary to his claims, Den is also troubled by Chrissie's departure. To cope with this, Den becomes more reckless and tries to reassert his bachelor status. He hosts a poker game at his house which eventually turns serious when only him and Andy Hunter remain. In a bid to get the Vic back, Den puts his house and club on the line but is narrowly beaten by Andy. Andy neglects to take Den's stake, but does tell Den to get his life sorted.\n\nLooking for revenge on Andy, Den convinces Pat to help him pull a scam in Andy's bookies, where Pat happens to work. The scam is initially successful and Den celebrates. However, Andy discovers the scam and humiliates Den in the Vic by revealing the poker game, just as Sharon returns. The next day, Dennis sends Den home from the club after he nearly gets into a fight with one of his own bouncers. Whilst at home, Den makes a pass at Dennis' girlfriend, Zoe, which Dennis witnesses. After receiving some harsh words, Den punches Dennis and leaves the house, where he sees a few teenagers breaking into the laundrette. After saving Dot, the two have a heart-to-heart, and Den agrees to call Chrissie. Upon meeting with Chrissie, Den decides he needs to get some time away and returns to Spain.\n\nDen returns in November 2004, apparently a new man. He apologises to Ian, Pat and his family. He also forces an older boyfriend of Vicki's to leave after discovering he cheated on her. Chrissie agrees to get back with Den after much convincing, but threatens to kill him if he ever cheats again.\n\nTo rebuild his family, Den attempts to regain The Queen Vic from the Mitchells just before Christmas 2004, by blackmailing their lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]]) into convincing Sam that Phil, who is still on the run, needs immediate money. Sam sells The Queen Vic to Den at a vastly reduced price and he reinstates his family at the pub in time for Christmas. Den re-cements his villainous status by kicking the Moon family out on Christmas Eve. With his pub back and his family together, Den looks to the future.\n\nThings go awry when Den discovers that Sharon and Dennis have resumed their affair and are planning on leaving for the United States, unless he can accept them both as a couple. In order to split them up, Den persuades [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) to lie that she is pregnant with Dennis's baby. Den's plan completely backfires when Sharon decides to leave alone instead, as she was unwilling to allow Dennis to leave his unborn child. While trying to persuade Sharon to stay, a panicking Den tells her that he does not have half the feelings for Vicki that he does for her, not realizing that Vicki was behind him and overheard everything. Vicki then decides to leave with Sharon. Den is horrified to have lost both of his daughters at Christmas, ironically because of his own lies and deceit.\n\n[[Image:Dens death77.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] kneeling over Den's corpse during the 20th anniversary episode. Consolidated figures reveal the episode was seen by over 17 million viewers (nearly 1/3 of the British population).<ref name=\"Telegraph article\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3653188/EastEnders-was-just-the-start.html|title=EastEnders was just the start|author=Raphael, Amy|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London, England |date=17 June 2006|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>]]\n\nIn apparent retribution towards Dennis for inadvertently being the cause of Sharon's departure, Den continues his baby lie with Zoe to ensure that Dennis stays. With Sharon gone, Den becomes more evil and twisted than ever, ignoring Chrissie's pleads to being thankful for the family he has. A week into the New Year, Den manipulates Zoe into having sex with him so she that can get pregnant and pretend the baby is that of Dennis. Following this, an ashamed Zoe attempts to back out of their arrangement, but Den spitefully blackmails her into continuing the lie, revealing his intention to cause misery for her and Dennis for causing Sharon\u2019s departure. When Zoe decides to tell Chrissie, Den laughs off the threat and reveals he doesn\u2019t care about his marriage. With no options left and desperate to keep Dennis, Zoe carries on the lie with Den.\n\nDuring this time, Den pretends to care for Dennis, who finally begins to see him as a father figure. Dennis also looks forward to the being a father and even begins to feel love for Zoe, who he had initially shunned out of his feelings for Sharon. However, when Dennis eventually catches Zoe and Den in bed together, he rejects the two of them and packs his bags. Despite this, Den appears pleased.\n\nIn the wake of this, Dennis leaves in search of Sharon - but not before telling Chrissie about Zoe and Den's affair, who doesn\u2019t reveal to Den that she knows. Instead, Chrissie slowly plans her revenge and when Zoe discovers she is pregnant with Den's child, Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, not letting on that she knows Den is the baby's father. She also concocts a plan of revenge to gain ownership of The Queen Vic from Den. She recruits Zoe and Sam (both also scorned by Den) and they confront him after closing time at The Queen Vic, one evening in February 2005. Den taunts them all for their weaknesses and refuses to sign over The Queen Vic, even when Chrissie threatens to reveal Den's true character to the rest of the Square. Den smugly admits to everything he's done but is left stunned when Sharon emerges from the shadows - Chrissie has lured her back from America with the pretence that Den was seriously ill. Despite Den's desperate explanations, Sharon disowns Den and leaves in a cab. In a rage, Den violently throws Chrissie against a fruit machine and is only stopped by Zoe, who hits him over the head with an iron doorstop in The Queen Vic, presumably killing him. Minutes later, whilst Sam and Zoe go upstairs, Den stirs and grabs Chrissie's ankle, telling her, \"You'll never get me out of The Vic!\" Chrissie responds by striking over the head again and he dies moments later.\n\nSam secretly witnesses the fatal blow, but Chrissie continues to allow Zoe to think it is she who has killed Den. The three women bury Den in The Queen Vic cellar and concrete it over. Arguments between the women occur, and Sam and Chrissie become embroiled in a feud to regain ownership of The Queen Vic, with Sam blackmailing Chrissie and digging up Den's body in the hope that Chrissie will be imprisoned, and Chrissie subsequently framing Sam for Den's murder, which leads to Sam's imprisonment. Sharon eventually learns the truth when Phil and his brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) - who had previously been married to Sharon during Den's 14-year absence - return to help their mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) bring down Chrissie and prove Sam innocent. It is then that both the Mitchell and Watts families have found themselves entangled in a conflict with Den's old friend, [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) - a local mob boss who recently usurped Andy from his position as Walford's reigning crime kingpin; on the night of Den's murder, Johnny killed Andy by throwing him off a motorway flyover. After working together to extract CCTV footage of Chrissie confessing Den's murder to her boyfriend [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]) in Johnny's nightclub, Dennis and Sharon help the Mitchells prove Sam's innocence; the police are called and Chrissie is arrested after Sharon intercepts her attempt to flee the country via the airport, and avenges Den's death by punching her whilst blurting out the last words she told Den before his murder.\n\nFollowing Chrissie's arrest, she is sentenced to life imprisonment after pleading guilty, and Den is finally given a proper burial in his \"original\" grave next to Angie.\n\nIn 2015, it is revealed Den was once in a gang which included Phil's father Eric Mitchell - along with his partner-in-crime [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) and their associates: Henry Hubbard and [[Ted Hills]] ([[Brian Croucher]]). It soon transpires that Gavin is actually Sharon's biological father, and that Den had apparently done a deal with Gavin: he would adopt Sharon in exchange for Gavin partaking one of Den's criminal jobs.\n\n==Character creation==\n\n===Background===\nDen Watts was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. The character of Den was originally going to be named Jack<ref name=\"insidestory\">{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|author2=Holland, Tony |authorlink2=Tony Holland |title= EastEnders - The Inside Story |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=978-0-563-20601-9|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> and he, his wife and adopted daughter were to be the occupants of the soap's local pub, now famously known as [[The Queen Vic]]. Holland, who had worked as a barman in his youth, called upon his own personal experiences to invent the Watts family and the pub they lived in.<ref name=\"insidestory\" /> Holland and Smith had always been critical of the way pubs had been portrayed on television feeling they lacked vitality and life, so they were determined that their pub and occupants were going to be more realistic.<ref name=\"insidestory\" /> The Watts were seen by Holland as integral to the show's success, partly because he had already guessed that the pub was going to be a monstrous battleground where emotions would run high on a regular basis, and also because the occupants would be providing the majority of the drama.<ref name=\"insidestory\" />\n\nDen's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''. In this passage, Den will be referred to as Jack, his wife as Pearl, his daughter as Tracey and his dog as Prince (known now as Angie, Sharon and [[Roly]] respectively).\n\n:\"Jack and Pearl are not criminals. They're not angels either. Villains perhaps? Well, he certainly is. They've been married for fifteen years, and haven't had sex with each other for thirteen of them. The marriage is a front for the sake of the pub's image. The daughter, Tracey is adopted\u2014maybe for the same reason. They have a dog too\u2014Prince\u2014an [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatian]]...Even with a marriage on the rocks, Jack still likes the area. His mates are here, it's friendly and it's his territory. \"Local lad makes good\"...People look up to him. If you've dragged yourself up by the scruff of the neck and moved up a notch, you need a few people around you who didn't quite make it, or you might as well be invisible. He's had a mistress for five years...Unlike Pearl, she's a very up-market woman, a lady, real class. Jack's her bit of rough, and they're happy. They actually talk. With Pearl, you shout - or shut up...He's a smart dresser. Changes his shirt twice a day and his shoes sparkle. He runs a good pub. He's firm and fair with the staff (if you've got any problems\u2014go to him, not her.) The cellars are well organised and spotless. His masculinity is the key to his character. It was called into question at an early stage in his marriage and he's defended it ever since. Some call him a ladies' man (because of his good looks) others - a man's man...He's a con man and has the gift of the gab. He can defend himself smartly in a brawl. (He's only ever thumped Pearly once.) You can accept Jack being a snob\u2014because it's not malicious: it's done with a grin. Like Pearl, he's also trapped by is background...Jack and Pearl's relationship is pretty heated...The smooth public face (workers in pubs are always on stage); the trial reconciliations; the rows; the fights and the tears...Will Jack ever bring his mistress into the pub, which is Pearl's territory? Will Pearl accept too many free drinks from punters and lose control in public?...They were lovers. They are husband and wife. There was affection...love...if it came to it, could they give each other up? The private grins and winks to each other when they're working as a team\u2014which usually means taking money. The love turning to hatred...Jack the lad and the artificial Pearl...They're an electric couple.\" (page 74).<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>\n\n===Casting controversy===\n''EastEnders''<nowiki>'</nowiki> lead director [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] recommended the actor [[Leslie Grantham]] for the part. Grantham had previously appeared on the London Fringe in a stage play Robinson had written. His only TV appearance at that point had been as Kiston, a small part in a 1984 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' directed by Robinson. Julia Smith remembered that she had taught Grantham at the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]] and regarded him as a \"mature student\", although she had never seen him \"in action\".<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> They needed the character of Den to have \"panache, charisma and electricity\". They were initially uncertain about casting Grantham, but they both felt that the actor had \"something\", which they went on to describe as a \"tensed up internal emotion of some sort, that was being held in. There was something behind the eyes, too. Barely contained violence almost...\"<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>\n\nAfter a successful reading with the actress Jean Fennell (who was originally cast as Angie), he was offered the part. However, shortly afterwards Grantham contacted Smith and asked to speak to her urgently. He revealed that he had been found guilty of killing a [[Germany|German]] taxi driver while on [[British Army|army]] service in 1967, and spent 10 years in prison. Although there were fears that if this story got out the resultant publicity would do enormous damage to the programme and the BBC, Smith decided not to withdraw Grantham from the role. In her opinion, he had paid the full penalty that society requires for a mistake committed in his past and it was a \"[[Christianity|Christian]] duty to forgive\".<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>\n\nThe story found its way into the British press much faster than expected. Three days after the transmission of episode one, ''EastEnders'' made the front page of a national newspaper for the first time with the headline \"EASTENDERS STAR IS A KILLER.\" The security gates at [[Elstree Studios]] (where ''EastEnders'' is filmed) were swamped with [[journalist]]s and [[photographer]]s, and so began a \"double-edged\" relationship between ''EastEnders'' and the popular press.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> The devisers of the programme were quick to realise that whilst a newspaper's publicity may sometimes boost a soap's position in the ratings, it could equally help to tarnish it. In conjunction, soaps could help to sell newspapers, and from then on stories about ''EastEnders'' and the cast began to fill their pages.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> Grantham was hounded by the press and the BBC was forced to put out a statement supporting him and their decision to employ a convicted murderer. In order to keep the press at bay, Grantham was smuggled out of the studios by the back route and decoy cars were used to lure the press away from his home, all of which put an increasing strain on the actor. Eventually the furore quietened down, but it never went away entirely and nearly every article written about the actor during his first stint in the show referenced his past. The press began to blur the characters in the show with the actors and it was at this point that Julia Smith \u2013 in an attempt to dispel confusion about reality and fiction \u2013 introduced the rule that no actor was ever to appear in public \"in character\".<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>\n\n==Character development and impact==\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Grantham, the Watts, with [[Anita Dobson]] as the newly appointed Angie, were the surprise hit characters of the show. Angie and Den were a live-wire couple whose on/off relationship made the Queen Vic pub exciting and unpredictable and the viewers tuned in their millions to watch the destruction of their relationship on-screen. Den's clashes with Angie brought ''EastEnders'' to a peak of popularity and toppled rival soap ''[[Coronation Street]]'' from the top of the ratings chart.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1992|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\n===\"Dirty Den\"===\nIn 1985, Den was the first person to speak on the first episode of ''EastEnders'': \"Stinks in here dunnit?\" just before he found out that [[Reg Cox]] (Johnnie Clayton) had been murdered. Early on in the series, the character of Den became central to the programme and was the focus of a controversial storyline involving the teenage pregnancy of [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]). Press interest in the show escalated as journalists continuously tried to predict who had fathered Michelle's baby. In true [[whodunnit]] fashion, the audience had been kept in the dark as to the real identity of the father and were given teasers implicating several residents on the Square. The audience finally discovered the culprit in episode 66 of the programme, October 1985. The episode was written by series co-creator/script editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, and was considered to be a landmark episode in the show's history. Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square in the early half of the episode: [[Tony Carpenter]] ([[Oscar James]]), [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nejdet Salih]]), [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] ([[Ross Davidson]]) and Den Watts. As Michelle waited by their rendezvous point a car pulled up and finally the fluffy white legs of Roly the poodle bounded out of the car, and gave it all away: Den Watts was the man meeting Michelle and it was he who had fathered her baby. It was when Den was revealed as the father that his famous nickname \"Dirty Den\" was created by the British press. The rest of the episode consisted of just one long scene, where Den and Michelle discussed whether or not to keep the baby. Up to that time it was the longest scene ever done in a soap-opera, lasting fifteen minutes. For a series that in its first eight months of existence had established a reputation for being fast-moving and rapidly cut, this was a bold experiment.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> It relied on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for over half an episode. Tony Holland's handling of the awkward scene between a teenage girl and the father of her best friend is deemed as one of the highlights of ''EastEnders'' first year.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The finishing touch was the use of an alternative end title music, a variation of the normal one which replaced the dramatic drum beats with a longer, gentler piano solo introduction.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAfter this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper [[cartoon]]s as it moved more and more into the public mainstream. One such cartoon showed the British [[Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], telling her cabinet that the best way to alert the country to the dangers of [[AIDS]] was to give the disease to Den.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>\n\n===Den and Angie mania===\nDuring 1986 the series became dominated by Den and Angie's storylines and the focus of the programme was very much concentrated on their combustible relationship. The emphasis began early in 1986 with the arrival of Den's mistress [[Jan Hammond]] ([[Jane How]]). Jan had been a powerful off-screen presence for the first year, a menacing voice at the end of the telephone, which severely affected the mood of both Den and Angie and kept the audience on edge every time the phone rang. Jan's physical arrival at the Vic in January 1986 was one of the show's dramatic highlights.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Her invasion of Angie's territory was a springboard to future emotional fireworks and a precursor to Angie's further dependence on alcohol and her attempted [[suicide]].\n\nDen and Angie's traumatic [[EastEnders two-hander episodes#Den and Angie (16 October 1986)|two-hander]] episode in October 1986 was another risky experiment for ''EastEnders'' \u2014 A thirty-minute episode with only two people in it had never been attempted in a soap before.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Holland and Smith feared that the episode would not hold up, however press and audience alike were in agreement that it did.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Once it was done, it set a precedent and the programme has featured two-handers ever since. The episode was structured like a \"tennis match\" between Angie and Den, with a non-speaking window-cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. It began with Den trying to tell Angie that he wanted a divorce. Angie was shocked and for a moment defeated, but she then dropped her bombshell and told Den that she only had six months to live. At first Den didn't believe her, but eventually Angie's hysterical performance convinced him. He crumbled and promised to stay with her and only after he left did Angie smile in triumph, letting the audience in on her secret that it was all a big lie. Written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird, this episode is considered to be one of the finest episodes in ''EastEnders''' catalogue.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nThe Den/Angie/Jan triangle was to continue for many months. The climax was a trip to [[Venice]] when Angie \u2013 convinced that Den had finished with his mistress \u2013 was taken there for a second honeymoon, returning to London on the [[Orient Express]]. This gave the writers and producers an opportunity to open the show up from the confines of Albert Square.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> However the trip to Venice was fraught with problems and Dobson, Grantham and Jane How were hounded by the press at all times. Their photographs appeared in British newspapers, thus ruining the shock surprise that Tony Holland had created, by including Den's mistress in the episode.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> Despite huge efforts from all involved the Venice episodes were only moderately successful, although the revelations discovered by Den in the episode set the scene for one of ''EastEnders''' most renowned episodes, which aired on Christmas Day that year.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> After over-hearing his wife confess that her illness was fabricated, Den filed for divorce. 30.1 million viewers tuned in on Christmas Day in 1986, to witness Den handing Angie her divorce papers, giving the soap its highest ever episode rating, which has yet to be beaten by any other plotline from any other soap in the UK.<ref name=\"XMAS86\">\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19861225.shtml EastEnders Xmas 86] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825101316/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19861225.shtml |date=25 August 2006 }}\", ''BBC''.

Holland and Smith had anticipated that Den and Angie would be popular, but they had not guessed how hysterical the reaction to them would be. It was decided that Den and Angie would have to be played down for a while so that other characters would have the opportunity to shine through.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> The next few years saw Den and Angie struggle to get by without each other and eventually they reunited as business partners.\n\n===Arrest and demise===\nHowever, at the beginning of 1988 [[Anita Dobson]] decided that she wanted to move on after three years of playing Angie. She made her final appearance in May that year. [[Leslie Grantham]] had also decided that he wanted to move on, but [[Julia Smith]] didn't want the programme to suffer the double blow of losing both Den and Angie so close together. The solution to the problem was one of the soap's most complicated and creative exercises, that required intricate planning.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The idea was to enable Den to stay as an on-screen presence into 1989, while keeping Grantham working for ''EastEnders'' only until the autumn of 1988. [[Tony Holland]] and writer/editor Bill Lyons came up with a story to put Den in prison for a year, intending that material recorded in a block of intensive filming would then be included in the programme for the rest of the year. The programme didn't want to make Den into a criminal, however, so he had to be put in prison for doing something that could be justified to the viewing public \u2013 otherwise there would be no sympathy for him.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The answer lay in a storyline that was running with another character \u2013 the rape of [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]). After simultaneously getting in way over his head with a criminal organisation (The Firm), Den torched Kathy's rapist's winebar in retaliation, and was then made to take the blame for the deed by the firm. After he refused, went on the run, and was nearly killed by the firm's heavies, Den turned himself into the police and was put on remand at [[Dickens Hill]] prison in September 1988. For the next five months he was seen, in the company of a small group of new but ultimately short-lived characters also confined in the prison, on a regular basis in ''EastEnders''. This material was shot in less than a month at [[Dartmoor Prison]], [[Devon]]. When these segments were written and recorded, they were done so entirely in isolation and in advance - the production team had no real idea of other material that would have to fit around it.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nThe character was eventually to bow out on 23 February 1989 in one of the programme's most famous episodes which attracted well over 20 million viewers. After being abducted by a group of gangsters who ambushed the taxi taking him to court, Den escaped from his captors and returned to the famous canal (in [[Alperton]]) for one last rendezvous with Michelle. The episode ended with Den being shot by a member of the firm (who was carrying a gun concealed in a bunch of [[daffodil]]s) and then falling into the canal. The scene where Den actually hit the water had to be taped at the BBC's [[Ealing]] Film Studios using a water tank, because the waters of the [[Grand Union Canal]] were deemed unsafe. When the episode was finished, however, Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, requested that the final shot be removed to allow for the possibility of Den returning in the future. In protest, [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]] had their names taken off the episode's credits. Den's exit ended up being the creators' final contribution to the show.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\n===Controversial return===\nHowever, after 14 years presumed dead, executive-producer [[Louise Berridge]] made the highly controversial decision to reintroduce the character to the series and reunite him with his daughter Sharon, played by [[Letitia Dean]]. Grantham has alleged that the producers of ''EastEnders'' asked him to reprise the role many times since 1991, but he turned each offer down as he was unhappy with the returning storylines. Subsequent offers between 1995 and 2001 were also rejected because Den's screen family were no longer in the show and Grantham felt that a return at this time would have been little more than a publicity stunt. However, he accepted Berridge's offer to return in 2002 as he approved of the storyline and because Den had family ties within the cast - his adoptive daughter Sharon had returned after six years away, his other daughter Vicki was due to return, and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) - the son Den hadn't known existed - was also due to join.\n\nThe reintroduction of Den was part of a plan by scriptwriters to fight back against the continued success of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s long-running soap, ''Coronation Street''. The character made his \"dramatic return\" in an episode that aired on 29 September 2003.<ref>\"[http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/content_objectid=13457355_method=full_siteid=106694_headline=-HUNK-DENNIS-ON-HIS-ROMP-WITH-SHARON-name_page.html HUNK DENNIS ON HIS ROMP WITH SHARON]\", ''Sunday Mirror''.

After a successful Christmas storyline, Grantham took a short break from the show after securing a lengthy contract.<ref>\"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031005/ai_n12586279 'Dirty' Dirty Tactics; EastEnders defied belief by raising Den Watts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121214215/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031005/ai_n12586279 |date=21 November 2007 }}\", ''Sunday Herald''.

Grantham was subsequently suspended for two months and his character departed on 30 August, before returning on the episode broadcast on 11 November. Newly appointed executive-producer [[Kathleen Hutchison]] then made the decision to axe the character and he was killed off in a high-profile storyline, which saw his body buried in the cellar of The Queen Vic.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3988347.stm Dirty Den actor leaves EastEnders]\", ''BBC''.

Jordan had started working at ''EastEnders'' in 1989, after Den had already left the series. Jordan had always wanted to write material for Den and Angie and so he campaigned for the return of Den for many years.<ref name=\"jordan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/21+years+of+EastEnders%3a+SECRETS+OF+WALFORD%3b+EXCLUSIVE+SCRIPTWRITER...-a0142121208|title=21 years of EastEnders|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|first=Jane|last=Simon|date=16 February 2006|accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref> He told the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', \"At story conferences I'd say, 'How do we know he's dead? They never found a body'. Eventually, just to shut me up, they made me write an episode where Den's body was found and identified by his ring.\"<ref name=\"jordan\"/> Jordan finally got his way in 2003; however, according to the writer, [[Leslie Grantham]]'s internet sex scandal spelled the demise of the character. Commenting on this, Jordan said, \"If [the scandal] hadn't come out I think it would have worked and he'd still be in the show. When I saw him on screen after those revelations came out, suddenly I couldn't believe in the character any more. I was starting to love the character and buying into all of it, but after that I saw him as [[Leslie Grantham]] - not Den Watts. He was older, and flawed in all the wrong ways. I think a lot of viewers felt the same, and the cast as well, probably.\"<ref name=\"jordan\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nDespite the controversy surrounding Grantham, the character of Den remains one of the most popular and high-profile characters in ''EastEnders'' history and was voted the 75th greatest television character of all time in a [[Channel 4]] poll.<ref>\"[http://www.thecustard.tv/linksandlists/100characters.html 100 Greatest Television Characters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215114222/http://www.thecustard.tv/linksandlists/100characters.html |date=15 December 2007 }}\", ''Custard.tv - Channel 4 poll''.

Leslie Grantham had played Kiston in an early television role in the ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''.\n\nThe 2006 episode of ''Doctor Who'' entitled \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\" features a scene where [[Peggy Mitchell]] tells the \"ghost\" of Den to \"get outta my pub!\" as the only spirits that will be served are vodka, whiskey and gin. Given that the episode later reveals the \"ghosts\" to be fully converted [[Cybermen]], [[Leslie Grantham]] is not seen in this episode.\n\nIn 1986, the duo Whisky and Sofa released a single called \"Dirty Den\", with lyrics making direct references to the character.\n\nIn an episode of the fifth season of ''[[Old Harry's Game]]'', Satan (the main character), takes control of the BBC and, in an effort to improve human morality, decides to insert moral messages into ''EastEnders'', including reintroducing Den as a \"force for good\", when executives challenge Den's reintroduction, stating that he can no longer feature in the show as he was murdered, Satan replies dismissively \"Oh, he's always being murdered\", a reference to Den's 2003 resurrection.\n\nIn the ''[[Gavin & Stacey]]'' Christmas special, Bryn, played by [[Rob Brydon]], mentions that he stopped watching EastEnders when Den returned to the show in 2003.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of EastEnders characters (1985)|List of ''EastEnders'' characters (1985)]]\n*[[List of soap opera villains]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{EEcharlink|den-watts}}\n\n{{EastEnders characters|past}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Watts, Den}}\n[[Category:EastEnders characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional bartenders]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Watts family]]\n[[Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees]]\n[[Category:Fictional murdered people in soap operas]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling - it's->its,typo(s) fixed: New Years Eve \u2192 New Year's Eve, doesn\u2019t \u2192 doesn't (2), \u2019s \u2192 's / expansion", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den_Watts"}

John Brown''''' was a criminal trial held in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town, Virginia]] in October 1859 to prosecute [[abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] for his involvement in a [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid]] on the United States federal [[arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]]. (Since 1863, both Charles Town and Harpers Ferry are in [[History of West Virginia|West Virginia]].) On October 16\u201318, 1859, Brown led 21 armed men, 5 blacks and 16 white, to Harpers Ferry, an important [[railroad junction]]. His goal was to seize the federal arsenal there and then lead a slave insurrection across the South. Brown and his men engaged in a two-day standoff with local militia and federal troops, in which ten of his men were shot or killed, five were captured, and five escaped.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2940.html\n|title=Africans in America\n|chapter=The raid on Harpers Ferry\n|publisher=[[PBS]]\n|author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]\n|year=1998}}</ref> Brown was captured and put on trial in a Virginia state court for treason, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty on all counts, and hanged on December 2.\n\nThanks to the recently-invented [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], Brown's trial was the first to be reported nationally. Considering its aftermath, it was arguably the most important criminal trial in the history of the country, for it was closely related to the war that quickly followed. More than Brown's raid, his trial determined the fate of the Union. According to Brian McGinty, the \"Brown of history\" was thus born in his trial. Had Brown died before his trial, he would have been \"condemned as a madman and relegated to a footnote of history\". Robert McGlone added that \"the trial did magnify and exalt his image. But Brown's own efforts to fashion his ultimate public persona began long before the raid and culminated only in the weeks that followed his dramatic speech at his sentencing.\"<ref name=McGlone>{{cite article\n|title=Retrying John Brown: Was Virginia Justice \"Fair\"?\n|first=Robert E.\n|last=McGlone\n|magazine=[[Reviews in American History]]\n|volume=3\n|number=2\n|pages=292-298\n|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/441179}}</ref> After the sentencing, Brown, glad for the publicity, gave interviews to anyone who wanted to talk to him.\n\n==Trial==\n===Venue===\nBrown did not face federal charges. There were no federal court facilities nearby, and transporting the injured Brown and the other defendants to a large city and maintaining them there would have been difficult and expensive. And what would this gain? Murder was not a federal crime, and a federal indictment for treason or fomenting slave insurrection would have caused a political crisis (because so many abolitionists would have denounced it). Under Virginia law, fomenting a slave insurrection was clearly and unequivocally a crime. And the defendants could be tried where they were, in Charles Town. \"[[President Buchanan]] was indifferent to where Brown and his men were tried. ...Virginia Governor [[Henry A. Wise|Henry Wise]], on the other hand, was 'adamant' that the insurgents pay for their crimes through his state's judicial system.\"<ref name=McGlone/>{{rp|292}}\n\nThe trial, then, took place in the county courthouse in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], not to be confused with [[Charleston, West Virginia]], the state capital. Charles Town is the county seat of [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County, Virginia]], about {{convert|7|mi}} west of Harpers Ferry. Since 1863 Jefferson County, including Harpers Ferry and Charles Town, is in West Virginia.\n\nA \"large armed force\" was stationed at Charles Town \"to prevent attempts at rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|295}} Brown was brought into court \"accompanied by a body of armed men. Cannon were stationed in front of the court house, and an armed guard were {{sic}} patrolling round the jail.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|301}}\n\n===Grand jury===\nBrown faced a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] on Tuesday, October 25, 1859, just eight days after his capture in the armory. The grand jury was also considering the other prisoners to be tried with Brown: [[Aaron Dwight Stevens|Aaron Stephens]], [[Barclay Coppock|Edwin Coppie]], [[Shields Green]], and [[John Anthony Copeland Jr.|John Copland]]. At 5 PM the grand jury reported they had not yet finished questioning of witnesses, and the hearing was adjourned until the next day.  On October 26 the grand jury returned a true [[bill of indictment]] against Brown and the other defendants, charging them with:\n* \"Conspiring with negroes to produce insurrection\"\n* [[Treason laws in the United States|Treason]] against the Commonwealth of Virginia\n* Murder<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|298}}\n\n[[File:Trial of John Brown.jpg|thumb|350px|Trial of John Brown]]\n\n===Counsel===\nThe next question was what legal counsel Brown was to have. The Court assigned two \"Virginians and pro-slavery men\", John Faulkner and Lawson Botts, as counsel for him and the other accused. Brown did not accept them; he told the judge that he had sent for counsel, \"who have not had time to reach here\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|293}}\n\n{{quote|I did not ask for any quarter at the time I was taken; I did not ask to have my life spared.

Brown stated that he did not wish to use an insanity defense, as had been proposed to him.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|309}} A court-appointed lawyer said that a Virginia court could only try Brown for acts committed in Virginia, not in Maryland or the federal arsenal. State counsel denied this was relevant.\n\nBrown, having received by telegraph news from a lawyer in Ohio, asked for a delay of one day; this was denied. The state attorney said that Brown's real motive was \"to give to his friends the time and opportunity to organize a rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|310}}\n\nOn Friday, October 28, \"Mr. Hoyt, a young Boston lawyer, arrived as a volunteer counsel for John Brown\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|317}}\n\n====Prosecution====\nThe prosecuting attorney was [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]].\n\nThe central prosecution witness in the trial was Colonel [[Lewis Washington]], of [[George Washington|President Washington]]'s family, who had been kidnapped out of his home and held hostage near the Federal Armory. His slaves were militarily \"[[impressment|impressed]]\" ([[conscription in the United States|conscripted]]) by Brown, but they took no active part in the insurrection. Other local witnesses testified to the seizure of the Federal Armory, the appearance of Virginia militia groups, and shootings on the railroad bridge. Other evidence described the U.S. Marines' raid on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad engine house occupied by Brown and his men. U.S. Army Colonel Robert E. Lee and cavalry officer [[J. E. B. Stuart]] led the Marine raid, and it freed the hostages and ended the standoff. Lee did not appear at the trial to testify, but instead filed an affidavit to the court with his account of the Marines raid.\n\nThe manuscript evidence was of particular interest to the judge and jury. Many documents were found on the Maryland farm rented by John Brown under the alias Isaac Smith. These included a [[Provisional Constitution]] for a new state, which Brown and his officers had signed. These documents clinched the treason and pre-meditated murder charges against Brown. The defense called no witnesses, and Brown himself did not testify.\n\nThe prosecution concluded its examination of witnesses. The defense called witnesses, but they did not appear as subpoenas had not been served on them. Mr. Hoyt said that other counsel for Brown would arrive that evening. Both court-appointed attorneys then resigned, and the trial was adjourned until the next day.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|323}}\n\n====Defense====\nThe trial resumed on Saturday, October 29. Two lawyers for Brown appeared, one from Washington and the other from Ohio. They asked for a few hours to read the indictment and the testimony so far given; thus was denied.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|325\u2013326}} The defense called six witnesses.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|326\u2013328}}\n\n\n [[George Henry Hoyt|George H. Hoyt]], another prominent lawyer, arrived a few days later from Massachusetts and took a hesitant role in the closing days of the trial. Hoyt was hired to defend Brown by John W. Le Barnes, one of the abolitionists who had given money to Brown in the past. Samuel Chilton, a lawyer from Washington D.C., was also brought in as Brown's legal counsel.  Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, arrived late in the trial on October 31 and delivered the defense's closing argument.\n\nThe defense claimed that the Harpers Ferry Federal Armory was not on Virginia property, but since the murdered townspeople had died in the streets outside the perimeter of the Federal facility, this carried little weight with the jury. John Brown's lack of official citizenship in Virginia was presented as a defense against treason against the State. Judge Parker dispatched this claim by reference to \"rights and responsibilities\" and the overlapping citizenship requirements between the Federal union and the various states. John Brown, an American citizen, could be found guilty of treason against Virginia on the basis of his temporary residence there during the days of the insurrection.\n\nThree other substantive defense tactics failed. One claimed that since the insurrection was aimed at the U.S. government it could not be proved treason against Virginia. Since Brown and his men had fired upon Virginia troops and police, this point was mooted. His lawyers also said that since no slaves had joined the insurrection, the charge of leading a slave insurrection should be thrown out. The jury apparently did not favor this claim, either.\n\nExtenuating circumstances were claimed by the defense when they stressed that Colonel Washington and the other hostages were not harmed and were in fact protected by Brown during the siege. This claim was not persuasive as Colonel Washington testified that he had seen men die of gunshot wounds and had been confined for days.\n\nThe final plea by the defense team for mercy concerned the circumstances surrounding the death of two of John Brown's men, who were apparently fired upon and killed by the Virginia militia while under a flag of truce. The armed community surrounding the Federal Arsenal did not hold their fire when Brown's men emerged to parley. This incident is noticeable upon a close reading of the published testimony, but is generally neglected in more popular accounts. If the rebels under a flag of truce were fired upon, it did not appear to be a major issue to the biased judge and jury.\n\n===The verdict===\nThe prosecution began its closing argument on Friday, concluding on Monday, October 31.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|333}} The jury retired to consider its verdict.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|334\u2013336}}\n\nThe jury deliberated for only 45 minutes. When it returned, according to the report in the ''[[New York Herald]]'', \"the only calm and unruffled countenance there\" was that of Brown.

He said yes and rose from his cot, supported by three courtroom officers, because of his wounds.\n\n{{quote|I have, may it please the court, a few words to say.\n\nIn the first place, I deny everything but what I have all along admitted, the design on my part to free the slaves. I intended certainly to have made a clean thing of that matter, as I did last winter, when I went into Missouri and there took slaves without the snapping of a gun on either side, moved them through the country, and finally left them in Canada. I designed to have done the same thing again, on a larger scale. That was all I intended. I never did intend murder, or treason, or the destruction of property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make insurrection.\n\nI have another objection; and that is, it is unjust that I should suffer such a penalty. Had I interfered in the manner which I admit, and which I admit has been fairly proved (for I admire the truthfulness and candor of the greater portion of the witnesses who have testified in this case), had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, sister, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right; and every man in this court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment.\n\nThis court acknowledges, as I suppose, the validity of the law of God. I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the Bible, or at least the New Testament. That teaches me that all things whatsoever I would that men should do to me, I should do even so to them {{bracket|{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=7|verse=12}}}}. It teaches me, further, to \"remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them\" {{bracket|{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Hebrews|chapter=13|verse=3}}}}. I endeavored to act up to that instruction. I say, I am yet too young to understand that God is any respecter of persons. I believe that to have interfered as I have done as I have always freely admitted I have done in behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong, but right. Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit; so let it be done!\n\nLet me say one word further.\n\nI feel entirely satisfied with the treatment I have received on my trial. Considering all the circumstances and animosity toward me, it has been fair and more generous than I expected. But I feel no consciousness of guilt. I have stated from the first [day] what was my intention and what was not. I never had any design against the life of any person, nor any disposition to commit treason, or excite slaves to rebel, or make any general insurrection. I never encouraged any man to do so, but always discouraged any idea of that kind.\n\nLet me say, also, a word in regard to the statements made by some of those connected with me. I hear it has been stated by some of them that I have induced them to join me. But the contrary is true. I do not say this to injure them, but as regretting their weakness. There is not one of them but joined me of his own accord, and the greater part of them at their own expense. A number of them I never saw, and never had a word of conversation with, till the day they came to me; and that was for the purpose I have stated.\n\nNow I have done.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340\u2013342}}}}\n\nUnder Virginia law a month was to elapse between the sentence of death and its execution. Governor Wise resisted pressures to abbreviate it because, he said, he did not want anyone saying that John Brown's rights had not been fully respected. During the month between his conviction and his execution, Brown wrote many letters, most of which, and a few to him, were collected and published in 1860.<ref name=Redpath>{{cite book\n|title=The public life of Capt.

[[John Wilkes Booth]] and Thomas Jackson (the future [[Stonewall Jackson]]) were present, along with 2,000 Federal troops and militia. On the short trip from the jail to the gallows he was protected on both sides by lines of troups, to prevent an armed rescue. Spectators and reporters were kept far enough away that he could not talk to them, and he made no final statement from the gallows. His last known words are those on a note, passed to a jailor who asked for an autograph:\n\n<blockquote>Charlestown, Va. 2nd December, 1859.

John Brown''''' was a criminal trial held in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town, Virginia]] in October 1859 to prosecute [[abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] for his involvement in a [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid]] on the United States federal [[arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]]. (Since 1863, both Charles Town and Harpers Ferry are in [[History of West Virginia|West Virginia]].) On October 16\u201318, 1859, Brown led 21 armed men, 5 blacks and 16 white, to Harpers Ferry, an important [[railroad junction]]. His goal was to seize the federal arsenal there and then lead a slave insurrection across the South. Brown and his men engaged in a two-day standoff with local militia and federal troops, in which ten of his men were shot or killed, five were captured, and five escaped.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2940.html\n|title=Africans in America\n|chapter=The raid on Harpers Ferry\n|publisher=[[PBS]]\n|author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]\n|year=1998}}</ref> Brown was captured and put on trial in a Virginia state court for treason, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty on all counts, and hanged on December 2.\n\nThanks to the recently-invented [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], Brown's trial was the first to be reported nationally. Considering its aftermath, it was arguably the most important criminal trial in the history of the country, for it was closely related to the war that quickly followed. More than Brown's raid, his trial determined the fate of the Union. According to Brian McGinty, the \"Brown of history\" was thus born in his trial. Had Brown died before his trial, he would have been \"condemned as a madman and relegated to a footnote of history\". Robert McGlone added that \"the trial did magnify and exalt his image. But Brown's own efforts to fashion his ultimate public persona began long before the raid and culminated only in the weeks that followed his dramatic speech at his sentencing.\"<ref name=McGlone>{{cite article\n|title=Retrying John Brown: Was Virginia Justice \"Fair\"?\n|first=Robert E.\n|last=McGlone\n|magazine=[[Reviews in American History]]\n|volume=3\n|number=2\n|pages=292-298\n|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/441179}}</ref> After the sentencing, Brown, glad for the publicity, gave interviews to anyone who wanted to talk to him.\n\n==Trial==\n===Venue===\nBrown did not face federal charges. There were no federal court facilities nearby, and transporting the injured Brown and the other defendants to a large city and maintaining them there would have been difficult and expensive. And what would this gain? Murder was not a federal crime, and a federal indictment for treason or fomenting slave insurrection would have caused a political crisis (because so many abolitionists would have denounced it). Under Virginia law, fomenting a slave insurrection was clearly and unequivocally a crime. And the defendants could be tried where they were, in Charles Town. \"[[President Buchanan]] was indifferent to where Brown and his men were tried. ...Virginia Governor [[Henry A. Wise|Henry Wise]], on the other hand, was 'adamant' that the insurgents pay for their crimes through his state's judicial system.\"<ref name=McGlone/>{{rp|292}}\n\nThe trial, then, took place in the county courthouse in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], not to be confused with [[Charleston, West Virginia]], the state capital. Charles Town is the county seat of [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County, Virginia]], about {{convert|7|mi}} west of Harpers Ferry. Since 1863 Jefferson County, including Harpers Ferry and Charles Town, is in West Virginia.\n\nA \"large armed force\" was stationed at Charles Town \"to prevent attempts at rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|295}} Brown was brought into court \"accompanied by a body of armed men. Cannon were stationed in front of the court house, and an armed guard were {{sic}} patrolling round the jail.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|301}}\n\n===Grand jury===\nBrown faced a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] on Tuesday, October 25, 1859, just eight days after his capture in the armory. The grand jury was also considering the other prisoners to be tried with Brown: [[Aaron Dwight Stevens|Aaron Stephens]], [[Barclay Coppock|Edwin Coppie]], [[Shields Green]], and [[John Anthony Copeland Jr.|John Copland]]. At 5 PM the grand jury reported they had not yet finished questioning of witnesses, and the hearing was adjourned until the next day.  On October 26 the grand jury returned a true [[bill of indictment]] against Brown and the other defendants, charging them with:\n* \"Conspiring with negroes to produce insurrection\"\n* [[Treason laws in the United States|Treason]] against the Commonwealth of Virginia\n* Murder<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|298}}\n\n[[File:Trial of John Brown.jpg|thumb|350px|Trial of John Brown]]\n\n===Counsel===\nThe next question was what legal counsel Brown was to have. The Court assigned two \"Virginians and pro-slavery men\", John Faulkner and Lawson Botts, as counsel for him and the other accused. Brown did not accept them; he told the judge that he had sent for counsel, \"who have not had time to reach here\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|293}}\n\n{{quote|I did not ask for any quarter at the time I was taken; I did not ask to have my life spared.

Brown stated that he did not wish to use an insanity defense, as had been proposed to him.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|309}} A court-appointed lawyer said that a Virginia court could only try Brown for acts committed in Virginia, not in Maryland or the federal arsenal. State counsel denied this was relevant.\n\nBrown, having received by telegraph news from a lawyer in Ohio, asked for a delay of one day; this was denied. The state attorney said that Brown's real motive was \"to give to his friends the time and opportunity to organize a rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|310}}\n\nOn Friday, October 28, \"Mr. Hoyt, a young Boston lawyer, arrived as a volunteer counsel for John Brown\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|317}}\n\n====Prosecution====\nThe prosecuting attorney was [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]].\n\nThe central prosecution witness in the trial was Colonel [[Lewis Washington]], of [[George Washington|President Washington]]'s family, who had been kidnapped out of his home and held hostage near the Federal Armory. His slaves were militarily \"[[impressment|impressed]]\" ([[conscription in the United States|conscripted]]) by Brown, but they took no active part in the insurrection. Other local witnesses testified to the seizure of the Federal Armory, the appearance of Virginia militia groups, and shootings on the railroad bridge. Other evidence described the U.S. Marines' raid on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad engine house occupied by Brown and his men. U.S. Army Colonel Robert E. Lee and cavalry officer [[J. E. B. Stuart]] led the Marine raid, and it freed the hostages and ended the standoff. Lee did not appear at the trial to testify, but instead filed an affidavit to the court with his account of the Marines raid.\n\nThe manuscript evidence was of particular interest to the judge and jury. Many documents were found on the Maryland farm rented by John Brown under the alias Isaac Smith. These included a [[Provisional Constitution]] for a new state, which Brown and his officers had signed. These documents clinched the treason and pre-meditated murder charges against Brown. The defense called no witnesses, and Brown himself did not testify.\n\nThe prosecution concluded its examination of witnesses. The defense called witnesses, but they did not appear as subpoenas had not been served on them. Mr. Hoyt said that other counsel for Brown would arrive that evening. Both court-appointed attorneys then resigned, and the trial was adjourned until the next day.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|323}}\n\n====Defense====\nThe trial resumed on Saturday, October 29. Two lawyers for Brown appeared, one from Washington and the other from Ohio. They asked for a few hours to read the indictment and the testimony so far given; thus was denied.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|325\u2013326}} The defense called six witnesses.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|326\u2013328}}\n\n\n [[George Henry Hoyt|George H. Hoyt]], another prominent lawyer, arrived a few days later from Massachusetts and took a hesitant role in the closing days of the trial. Hoyt was hired to defend Brown by John W. Le Barnes, one of the abolitionists who had given money to Brown in the past. Samuel Chilton, a lawyer from Washington D.C., was also brought in as Brown's legal counsel.  Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, arrived late in the trial on October 31 and delivered the defense's closing argument.\n\nThe defense claimed that the Harpers Ferry Federal Armory was not on Virginia property, but since the murdered townspeople had died in the streets outside the perimeter of the Federal facility, this carried little weight with the jury. John Brown's lack of official citizenship in Virginia was presented as a defense against treason against the State. Judge Parker dispatched this claim by reference to \"rights and responsibilities\" and the overlapping citizenship requirements between the Federal union and the various states. John Brown, an American citizen, could be found guilty of treason against Virginia on the basis of his temporary residence there during the days of the insurrection.\n\nThree other substantive defense tactics failed. One claimed that since the insurrection was aimed at the U.S. government it could not be proved treason against Virginia. Since Brown and his men had fired upon Virginia troops and police, this point was mooted. His lawyers also said that since no slaves had joined the insurrection, the charge of leading a slave insurrection should be thrown out. The jury apparently did not favor this claim, either.\n\nExtenuating circumstances were claimed by the defense when they stressed that Colonel Washington and the other hostages were not harmed and were in fact protected by Brown during the siege. This claim was not persuasive as Colonel Washington testified that he had seen men die of gunshot wounds and had been confined for days.\n\nThe final plea by the defense team for mercy concerned the circumstances surrounding the death of two of John Brown's men, who were apparently fired upon and killed by the Virginia militia while under a flag of truce. The armed community surrounding the Federal Arsenal did not hold their fire when Brown's men emerged to parley. This incident is noticeable upon a close reading of the published testimony, but is generally neglected in more popular accounts. If the rebels under a flag of truce were fired upon, it did not appear to be a major issue to the biased judge and jury.\n\n===The verdict===\nThe prosecution began its closing argument on Friday, concluding on Monday, October 31.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|333}} The jury retired to consider its verdict.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|334\u2013336}}\n\nThe jury deliberated for only 45 minutes. When it returned, according to the report in the ''[[New York Herald]]'', \"the only calm and unruffled countenance there\" was that of Brown. When the jury reported that it found him guilty of all charges, \"not the slightest sound was heard in the vast crowd\".<ref name=Liberator041159>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]\n|title=The Harper's Ferry Tragedy.

E. Housman''', was an English [[classics|classical scholar]] and poet, best known to the general public for his cycle of poems ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]''. Lyrical and almost [[epigram]]matic in form, the poems wistfully evoke the dooms and disappointments of youth in the English countryside.<ref>[http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/e-housman A E Housman, ''The Poetry Archive'']</ref> Their beauty, simplicity and distinctive imagery appealed strongly to [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] taste, and to many early 20th-century English composers both before and after the [[First World War]]. Through their song-settings, the poems became closely associated with that era, and with [[Shropshire]] itself.\n\nHousman was one of the foremost classicists of his age and has been ranked as one of the greatest scholars who ever lived.<ref>'a man who turned out to be not only the great English classical scholar of his time but also one of the few real and great scholars anywhere at any time'.

Though Housman obtained a first in classical [[Moderations]] in 1879,  his dedication to textual analysis led him to neglect the ancient history and philosophy that formed part of the [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] curriculum. Accordingly, he failed his [[Final examination|Finals]] and had to return humiliated in [[Michaelmas term]] to resit the exam and at least gain a lower-level [[Academic degree#United Kingdom|pass degree]].<ref>{{web cite|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZb90uvtg20C&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=housman+%22pass+degree%22&source=bl&ots=CctOVhE8IX&sig=FMbcea86vq6P_KE40oGUpPjzEc0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlyYia8bTYAhWiYd8KHVeIAMIQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&q=housman%20%22pass%20degree%22&f=false|title=''A.

When he returned briefly to England in 1889, to marry, Housman was not invited to the wedding and knew nothing about it until the couple had left the country. Adalbert Jackson died in 1892 and Housman commemorated him in a poem published as \"XLII \u2013 A.J.J.\" of ''[[More Poems]]'' (1936).\n\nMeanwhile, Housman pursued his classical studies independently, and published scholarly articles on [[Horace]], [[Propertius]], [[Ovid]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]].<ref Name=\"Poets\" /> He also completed an edition of Propertius, which however was rejected by both the OUP and Macmillan in 1885, and was destroyed after his death. He gradually acquired such a high reputation that in 1892 he was offered and accepted the professorship of Latin at [[University College London]] (UCL).<ref Name=\"Poets\" /> When, during his tenure, an immensely rare  [[Coverdale Bible]] of 1535 was discovered in the UCL library and presented  to the Library Committee, Housman <ref>Blocksidge, Martin.

''Collected Poems and Selected Prose''|date=1989|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|page=18}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Housman's early work and his responsibilities as a professor included both [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], he began to specialise in Latin poetry. When asked later why he had stopped writing about Greek verse, he responded, \"I found that I could not attain to excellence in both.\"<ref>Gow (Cambridge 1936) p. 5</ref> In 1911 he took the [[Kennedy Professorship of Latin]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he remained for the rest of his life. G. P. Goold, Classics Professor at University College, wrote of Housman's accomplishments: <blockquote>The legacy of Housman's scholarship is a thing of permanent value; and that value consists less in obvious results, the establishment of general propositions about Latin and the removal of scribal mistakes, than in the shining example he provides of a wonderful mind at work \u2026 He was and may remain the last great textual critic.<ref Name=\"PF\" /></blockquote> Between 1903 and 1930 Housman published his critical edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius's]] ''Astronomicon'' in five volumes. He also edited works by [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] (1905) and [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] (1926).\n\nMany colleagues were unnerved by his scathing attacks on those he thought guilty of shoddy scholarship.<ref Name=\"Poets\" /> In his paper \"The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism\" (1921) Housman wrote: \"A textual critic engaged upon his business is not at all like Newton investigating the motion of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for fleas.\" He declared many of his contemporary scholars to be stupid, lazy, vain, or all three, saying: \"Knowledge is good, method is good, but one thing beyond all others is necessary; and that is to have a head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders, and brains, not pudding, in your head.\"<ref Name=\"PF\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/a-e-housman Poetry Foundation profile]</ref><ref>\"The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism\", (1921) Housman</ref>\n\n[[File:Housman Grave.JPG|thumb|Housman's grave at St Laurence's Church in Ludlow.

Gow]] quoted examples of these attacks, noting that they \"were often savage in the extreme\".<ref>Gow (Cambridge 1936) p. 24</ref> Gow also related how Housman intimidated students, sometimes reducing the women to tears. According to Gow, Housman could never remember the names of female students, maintaining that \"had he burdened his memory by the distinction between Miss Jones and Miss Robinson, he might have forgotten that between the second and fourth declension\". One of the notable frequenters of his lectures at Cambridge was [[Enoch Powell]].<ref>Gow (Cambridge 1936) p. 18</ref>\n\n[[File:Housman Grave Clip2.jpg|left|thumb|Housman's grave marker]]\nIn his private life Housman enjoyed [[gastronomy]], flying in aeroplanes and making frequent visits to France, where he read \"books which were banned in Britain as pornographic\".<ref>Graves (1979) p. 155.</ref> But he struck [[A.

After one publisher had turned it down, he helped subsidise its publication in 1896. At first selling slowly, it rapidly became a lasting success. Its appeal to English musicians had helped to make it widely known before [[World War I]], when its themes struck a powerful chord with English readers. The book has been in print continuously since May 1896.<ref>Peter Parker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p7dvBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Housman Country''], London 2016, Chapter 1</ref>\n\nThe poems are marked by pessimism and preoccupation with death, without religious consolation (Housman had become an atheist while still an undergraduate.) Housman wrote many of them while living in [[Highgate]], London, before ever visiting Shropshire, which he presented in an idealised pastoral light as his 'land of lost content'.<ref>A. E.

His early work was an influence on many British [[War Poets|poets]] who became famous by their writing about the war, and he himself wrote several poems as occasional verse to commemorate the war dead. This included his ''Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries'', honouring the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], an elite but small force of professional soldiers sent to Belgium at the start of the war. In the early 1920s, when Moses Jackson was dying in Canada, Housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems so that Jackson could read them before his death.<ref Name =\"Poets\" /> These later poems, mostly written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in ''A Shropshire Lad'' but lack its consistency. He published his new collection as ''[[Last Poems]]'' (1922), feeling that his inspiration was exhausted and that he should not publish more in his lifetime. \n\nAfter Housman's death in 1936, his brother, [[Laurence Housman|Laurence]] published further poems in ''More Poems'' (1936), ''A. E .H.: Some Poems, Some Letters and a Personal Memoir by his Brother'' (1937), and ''Collected Poems'' (1939). ''A. E. H.'' includes humorous verse such as a parody of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow's]] poem [[Excelsior (Longfellow)|''Excelsior'']]. Housman also wrote a parodic ''Fragment of a Greek Tragedy'', in English, published posthumously with humorous poems under the title ''Unkind to Unicorns''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Unkind to Unicorns |publisher=Silent Books |location=Cambridge |year=1995 |editor=J. Roy Birch and Norman Page}}</ref>\n\n[[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]] quoted a letter written late in Housman's life that described the genesis of his poems:\n{{Quote | Poetry was for him \u2026'a morbid secretion', as the pearl is for the oyster. The desire, or the need, did not come upon him often, and it came usually when he was feeling ill or depressed; then whole lines and stanzas would present themselves to him without any effort, or any consciousness of composition on his part. Sometimes they wanted a little alteration, sometimes none; sometimes the lines needed in order to make a complete poem would come later, spontaneously or with 'a little coaxing'; sometimes he had to sit down and finish the poem with his head.  That... was a long and laborious process.<ref Name=\"Sparrow\" />}}\n\nSparrow himself adds, \"How difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory analysis may be judged by considering the last poem in ''A Shropshire Lad''. Of its four stanzas, Housman tells us that two were 'given' him ready made; one was coaxed forth from his subconsciousness an hour or two later; the remaining one took months of conscious composition. No one can tell for certain which was which.\"<ref Name=\"Sparrow\">''Collected Poems'' Penguin, Harmondsworth (1956), preface by John Sparrow.</ref>\n\n===''De Amicitia'' (Of Friendship)===\nIn 1942 Laurence Housman also deposited an essay entitled \"A. E. Housman's 'De Amicitia'\" (there is a link to the text, below in this article, under \"Further reading\") in the [[British Library]], with the proviso that it was not to be published for 25 years. The essay discussed A. E. Housman's homosexuality and his love for Moses Jackson.<ref>Summers ed. 1995, 371.</ref> Despite the conservative nature of the times and his own caution in public life, Housman was quite open in his poetry, and especially in ''A Shropshire Lad'', about his deeper sympathies. Poem XXX of that sequence, for instance, speaks of how \"Fear contended with desire\": \"Others, I am not the first, / Have willed more mischief than they durst\". In ''More Poems'', he buries his love for Moses Jackson in the very act of commemorating it, as his feelings of love are not reciprocated and must be carried unfulfilled to the grave:<ref>Summers (1995) p372.</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|\nBecause I liked you better\n    Than suits a man to say,\nIt irked you, and I promised\n    To throw the thought away.\n\nTo put the world between us\n    We parted, stiff and dry;\n\"Good-bye,\" said you, \"forget me.\"\n    \"I will, no fear,\" said I.\n\nIf here, where clover whitens\n    The dead man's knoll, you pass,\nAnd no tall flower to meet you\n    Starts in the trefoiled grass,\n\nHalt by the headstone naming\n    The heart no longer stirred,\nAnd say the lad that loved you\n    Was one that kept his word.<ref>{{cite book |last=Housman |first=A.

In 1904 the cycle ''A Shropshire Lad'' was set by [[Arthur Somervell]], who had begun to develop the concept of the English [[song-cycle]] in his version of [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s \"[[Maud and other poems|Maud]]\" a little previously. [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] produced his well-known settings of six songs, the cycle ''[[On Wenlock Edge (song cycle)|On Wenlock Edge]]'', for [[string quartet]], [[tenor]] and piano in 1909. Between 1909 and 1911 [[George Butterworth]] produced settings in two collections, ''[[Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad]]'' and ''[[Bredon Hill and Other Songs]]''.

When he returned briefly to England in 1889, to marry, Housman was not invited to the wedding and knew nothing about it until the couple had left the country. Adalbert Jackson died in 1892 and Housman commemorated him in a poem published as \"XLII \u2013 A.J.J.\" of ''[[More Poems]]'' (1936).\n\nMeanwhile, Housman pursued his classical studies independently, and published scholarly articles on [[Horace]], [[Propertius]], [[Ovid]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]].<ref Name=\"Poets\" /> He also completed an edition of Propertius, which however was rejected by both the OUP and Macmillan in 1885,and was destroyed after his death.

When asked later why he had stopped writing about Greek verse, he responded, \"I found that I could not attain to excellence in both.\"<ref>Gow (Cambridge 1936) p. 5</ref> In 1911 he took the [[Kennedy Professorship of Latin]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he remained for the rest of his life. G. P.

He also edited works by [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] (1905) and [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] (1926).\n\nMany colleagues were unnerved by his scathing attacks on those he thought guilty of shoddy scholarship.<ref Name=\"Poets\" /> In his paper \"The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism\" (1921) Housman wrote: \"A textual critic engaged upon his business is not at all like Newton investigating the motion of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for fleas.\" He declared many of his contemporary scholars to be stupid, lazy, vain, or all three, saying: \"Knowledge is good, method is good, but one thing beyond all others is necessary; and that is to have a head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders, and brains, not pudding, in your head.\"<ref Name=\"PF\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/a-e-housman Poetry Foundation profile]</ref><ref>\"The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism\", (1921) Housman</ref>\n\n[[File:Housman Grave.JPG|thumb|Housman's grave at St Laurence's Church in Ludlow.

According to Gow, Housman could never remember the names of female students, maintaining that \"had he burdened his memory by the distinction between Miss Jones and Miss Robinson, he might have forgotten that between the second and fourth declension\". One of the notable frequenters of his lectures at Cambridge was [[Enoch Powell]].<ref>Gow (Cambridge 1936) p. 18</ref>\n\n[[File:Housman Grave Clip2.jpg|left|thumb|Housman's grave marker]]\nIn his private life Housman enjoyed [[gastronomy]], flying in aeroplanes and making frequent visits to France, where he read \"books which were banned in Britain as pornographic\".<ref>Graves (1979) p. 155.</ref> But he struck [[A. C. Benson]], a fellow don, as being \"descended from a long line of maiden aunts\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Critchley (1988).</ref>\nHis feelings about his poetry were ambivalent and he certainly treated it as secondary to his scholarship. He did not speak in public about his poems until 1933, when he gave a lecture \"The Name and Nature of Poetry\", arguing there that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than to the intellect.\n\nHousman died, aged 77, in Cambridge. His ashes are buried just outside [[St Laurence's Church, Ludlow]], Shropshire.<ref Name=\"Poets\" /><ref>Wilson, Scott.

After one publisher had turned it down, he helped subsidise its publication in 1896. At first selling slowly, it rapidly became a lasting success. Its appeal to English musicians had helped to make it widely known before [[World War I]], when its themes struck a powerful chord with English readers. The book has been in print continuously since May 1896.<ref>Peter Parker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p7dvBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Housman Country''], London 2016, Chapter 1</ref>\n\nThe poems are marked by pessimism and preoccupation with death, without religious consolation (Housman had become an atheist while still an undergraduate.) Housman wrote many of them while living in [[Highgate]], London, before ever visiting Shropshire, which he presented in an idealised pastoral light as his 'land of lost content'.<ref>A. E. Housman, ''A Shropshire Lad'', XL</ref> Housman himself acknowledged that \"No doubt I have been unconsciously influenced by the Greeks and Latins, but [the] chief sources of which I am conscious are Shakespeare's songs, the Scottish Border ballads, and [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]].\"<ref>Richard Stokes, ''The Penguin Book of English Song'', 2016, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EoKmCgAAQBAJ&lpg=RA3-PR51&ots=J1yNAAGEap&dq=%22I%20was%20born%20in%20Worcestershire%2C%20not%20Shropshire%2C%20where%20I%20have%20never%20spent%20much%20time.%20%22&pg=RA3-PR51#v=onepage&q=%22I%20was%20born%20in%20Worcestershire,%20not%20Shropshire,%20where%20I%20have%20never%20spent%20much%20time.%20%22&f=false p. li]</ref>\n\n===Later collections===\nHousman began collecting a new set of poems after the First World War. His early work was an influence on many British [[War Poets|poets]] who became famous by their writing about the war, and he himself wrote several poems as occasional verse to commemorate the war dead. This included his ''Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries'', honouring the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], an elite but small force of professional soldiers sent to Belgium at the start of the war. In the early 1920s, when Moses Jackson was dying in Canada, Housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems so that Jackson could read them before his death.<ref Name =\"Poets\" /> These later poems, mostly written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in ''A Shropshire Lad'' but lack its consistency. He published his new collection as ''[[Last Poems]]'' (1922), feeling that his inspiration was exhausted and that he should not publish more in his lifetime. \n\nAfter Housman's death in 1936, his brother, [[Laurence Housman|Laurence]] published further poems in ''More Poems'' (1936), ''A. E .H.: Some Poems, Some Letters and a Personal Memoir by his Brother'' (1937), and ''Collected Poems'' (1939). ''A. E. H.'' includes humorous verse such as a parody of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow's]] poem [[Excelsior (Longfellow)|''Excelsior'']]. Housman also wrote a parodic ''Fragment of a Greek Tragedy'', in English, published posthumously with humorous poems under the title ''Unkind to Unicorns''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Unkind to Unicorns |publisher=Silent Books |location=Cambridge |year=1995 |editor=J. Roy Birch and Norman Page}}</ref>\n\n[[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]] quoted a letter written late in Housman's life that described the genesis of his poems:\n{{Quote | Poetry was for him \u2026'a morbid secretion', as the pearl is for the oyster. The desire, or the need, did not come upon him often, and it came usually when he was feeling ill or depressed; then whole lines and stanzas would present themselves to him without any effort, or any consciousness of composition on his part. Sometimes they wanted a little alteration, sometimes none; sometimes the lines needed in order to make a complete poem would come later, spontaneously or with 'a little coaxing'; sometimes he had to sit down and finish the poem with his head.  That... was a long and laborious process.<ref Name=\"Sparrow\" />}}\n\nSparrow himself adds, \"How difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory analysis may be judged by considering the last poem in ''A Shropshire Lad''. Of its four stanzas, Housman tells us that two were 'given' him ready made; one was coaxed forth from his subconsciousness an hour or two later; the remaining one took months of conscious composition. No one can tell for certain which was which.\"<ref Name=\"Sparrow\">''Collected Poems'' Penguin, Harmondsworth (1956), preface by John Sparrow.</ref>\n\n===''De Amicitia'' (Of Friendship)===\nIn 1942 Laurence Housman also deposited an essay entitled \"A. E. Housman's 'De Amicitia'\" (there is a link to the text, below in this article, under \"Further reading\") in the [[British Library]], with the proviso that it was not to be published for 25 years. The essay discussed A. E. Housman's homosexuality and his love for Moses Jackson.<ref>Summers ed. 1995, 371.</ref> Despite the conservative nature of the times and his own caution in public life, Housman was quite open in his poetry, and especially in ''A Shropshire Lad'', about his deeper sympathies. Poem XXX of that sequence, for instance, speaks of how \"Fear contended with desire\": \"Others, I am not the first, / Have willed more mischief than they durst\". In ''More Poems'', he buries his love for Moses Jackson in the very act of commemorating it, as his feelings of love are not reciprocated and must be carried unfulfilled to the grave:<ref>Summers (1995) p372.</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|\nBecause I liked you better\n    Than suits a man to say,\nIt irked you, and I promised\n    To throw the thought away.\n\nTo put the world between us\n    We parted, stiff and dry;\n\"Good-bye,\" said you, \"forget me.\"\n    \"I will, no fear,\" said I.\n\nIf here, where clover whitens\n    The dead man's knoll, you pass,\nAnd no tall flower to meet you\n    Starts in the trefoiled grass,\n\nHalt by the headstone naming\n    The heart no longer stirred,\nAnd say the lad that loved you\n    Was one that kept his word.<ref>{{cite book |last=Housman |first=A.

In 1904 the cycle ''A Shropshire Lad'' was set by [[Arthur Somervell]], who had begun to develop the concept of the English [[song-cycle]] in his version of [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s \"[[Maud and other poems|Maud]]\" a little previously. [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] produced his well-known settings of six songs, the cycle ''[[On Wenlock Edge (song cycle)|On Wenlock Edge]]'', for [[string quartet]], [[tenor]] and piano in 1909. Between 1909 and 1911 [[George Butterworth]] produced settings in two collections, ''[[Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad]]'' and ''[[Bredon Hill and Other Songs]]''. He also wrote the orchestral [[tone poem]] ''A Shropshire Lad'', first performed at [[Leeds]] Festival in 1912.<ref>[[Arthur Eaglefield Hull]], ''A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians'' Dent, London (1924), 73.</ref>\n\n[[Ivor Gurney]] was another composer who made renowned settings of Housman's poems. Towards the end of [[World War I]] he was working on his cycle ''Ludlow and Teme'', for voice and string quartet (published in 1919),<ref>Kate Kennedy, \"Ambivalent Englishness: Ivor Gurney's song cycle Ludlow and Teme\", ''First World War Studies'',  Volume 2, 2011, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19475020.2011.555471?journalCode=rfww20 \u2013 Issue 1: Literature and Music of the First World War]</ref> and went on to compose the eight-song cycle ''The Western Playland'' in 1921.<ref>[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/assemble_texts.html?SongCycleId=5 Lieder Net archive]</ref> One more  who set Housman songs at this period was [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] in the song cycle, ''[[The Land of Lost Content (John Ireland)|The Land of Lost Content]]'' (1920{{ndash}}21). Even composers not directly associated with the 'pastoral' tradition, such as [[Arnold Bax]], [[Lennox Berkeley]] and [[Arthur Bliss]], were attracted to Housman's poetry. A 1976 catalogue listed 400 musical settings of Housman's poems.<ref>Palmer and Banfield 2001.</ref> As of 2016, Lieder Net Archive records 606 settings of 187 texts.<ref>LNA, [http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_name_list.html?Type=Authors&Letter=H list of authors]</ref>\n\n==Commemorations==\nThe earliest commemoration of Housman was in the chapel of Trinity College in Cambridge, where there is a memorial brass on the south wall.<ref>[http://trinitycollegechapel.com/brasses-h-k  Trinity College chapel]</ref> The Latin inscription was composed by his colleague there, [[A. S. F. Gow]], who was also the author of a biographical and bibliographical sketch published immediately following his death.<ref>''A.E.Housman, Classical Scholar'', Bloomsbury 2009, N.

Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"[[Theotokos]]\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress \"[[modesty|modestly]]\" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.\n\n[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n:<blockquote>\"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'\"</blockquote>In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> How gender roles are honored is largely cultural.

It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.<ref name=\":1\" /> Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages.<ref name=\":1\"/> Traditional gendered roles view the man as a \u201cpro-creator, a protector, and a provider,\u201d and the woman as \u201cpretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.\u201d <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Marriage and Families: Changes, Choices, and Constrains|last=Benokraits|first=Nijole|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn=978-0-13-034177-8|location=New Jersey|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/marriagesfamilie0004beno}}</ref> Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views.

Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings.

Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179\u2013180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}</ref>\n\nIt has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]].

These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. Young girls in an experiment of this journal article describe pictures on women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake. They are dressed in little and revealing clothing which sexualised the women and expose their thin figures, that are gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.\n\nIt has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children's preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aubrey |first1=Jennifer Stevens |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |title=The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions. |journal=Media Psychology |date=May 2004 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013142 |doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1}}</ref> In another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited, the underrepresentation of women in children's television shows between 1930 and 1960 is examined. While studies between 1960 and 1990 show an increase in the representation of women in television, studies conducted between 1990 and 2005, a time when women were considered to be equal to men by some, show no change in the representation of women in children's television shows. Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171\u2013180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}</ref>\n\n====Social Interaction====\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''. Routledge.</ref>\n\n====Changing gender roles in marriage====\nOver the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.<ref name=\":0\"/> Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.<ref name=\":0\"/> \n\nAfter around the year 1980, divorce rates in the United States stabilized.<ref name=\":03\">{{cite journal | last1 = Greenstein | first1 = Theodore N | year = | title = Gender Ideology, Marital Disruption, and the Employment of Married Women | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 31\u201342 }}</ref> Scholars in the area of sociology explain that this stabilization was due to several factors including, but not limited to, the shift in gender roles,. The attitude concerning the shift in gender roles can be classified into two perspectives: traditional and egalitarian. Traditional attitudes uphold designated responsibilities for the sexes- wives raise the children and keep the home nice, and men are the breadwinners.

Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\n* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,\n* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and\n* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722\u201341 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles.

In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that \"gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture\". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that \"women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means\".<ref name=\"Bag\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641\u201372 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}</ref> The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups \u2014 for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.\n\n==Communication==\n{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}\nGender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.\n\nCommunication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}</ref> Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.<ref>DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough.

She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.\n\nMen, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A.

Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.\n\nGender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe second study looked at gender labelling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]]. The media tends to focus on the seductress woman's sex appeal and physical appearance in opposition to her policy stances and [[rhetoric]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlin|first=Diana B.|authorlink=Diana Carlin|date=Fall 2009|title=Have You Come a Long Way, Baby?

[[Implicit stereotypes]] are the unconscious influence of attitudes a person may or may not be aware that they hold. A person is influenced by these attitudes even though they are not aware. Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.\n\nThese implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the [[Implicit-association test]] (IAT).\n\nOne example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females. It has been found that men have stronger positive associations with mathematics than women, while women have stronger negative associations with mathematics and the more strongly a woman associates herself with the female gender identity, the more negative her association with mathematics.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = Brian A. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = Mahzarin R. | last3 = Greenwald | first3 = Anthony G. | title = Math = male, me = female, therefore math \u2260 me | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 44\u201359 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.83.1.44 | date = July 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.463.6120 | pmid = 12088131 }}</ref>\n\nThese associations have been disputed for their biological connection to gender and have been attributed to social forces that perpetuate stereotypes such as aforementioned stereotype that men are better at mathematics than women.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYw7ZZzCqNYC&pg=PR5#v=onepage&q=males+better+at+math|title=Myths Of Gender: Biological Theories About Women And Men, Revised Edition|first=Anne|last=Fausto-Sterling|date=4 August 2008|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=22 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780786723904}}</ref>\n\nThis particular stereotype has been found in American children as early as second grade.<ref name=\"Cvencek\" />\n\nThe same test with Singaporean children found that the strength of their mathematics-gender stereotype and their gender identity predicted the association between individuals and mathematical ability.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cvencek | first1 = Dario | last2 = Meltzoff | first2 = Andrew N. | last3 = Kapur | first3 = Manu | title = Cognitive consistency and math\u2013gender stereotypes in Singaporean children | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 117 | pages = 73\u201391 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2013.07.018 | pmid = 24141205 | date = January 2014 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nIt has been shown that this stereotype also reflects mathematical performance: a study was done on the worldwide scale and it was found that the strength of this mathematics-gender stereotype in varying countries correlates with 8th graders' scores on the [[TIMSS]], a standardized math and science achievement test that is given worldwide.

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities.

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"<ref>''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}</ref>\n\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]\u2019s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, \u201cabasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.\u201d<ref>Shuttleworth, Sally. \"Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era.\" Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science.

In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

[[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress \"[[modesty|modestly]]\" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.\n\n[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n:<blockquote>\"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'\"</blockquote>In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> How gender roles are honored is largely cultural.

It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.<ref name=\":1\" /> Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages.<ref name=\":1\"/> Traditional gendered roles view the man as a \u201cpro-creator, a protector, and a provider,\u201d and the woman as \u201cpretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.\u201d <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Marriage and Families: Changes, Choices, and Constrains|last=Benokraits|first=Nijole|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn=978-0-13-034177-8|location=New Jersey|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/marriagesfamilie0004beno}}</ref> Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views.

Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings.

Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179\u2013180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}</ref>\n\nIt has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]].

These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. Young girls in an experiment of this journal article describe pictures on women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake. They are dressed in little and revealing clothing which sexualised the women and expose their thin figures, that are gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.\n\nIt has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children's preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aubrey |first1=Jennifer Stevens |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |title=The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions. |journal=Media Psychology |date=May 2004 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013142 |doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1}}</ref> In another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited, the underrepresentation of women in children's television shows between 1930 and 1960 is examined.

Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171\u2013180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}</ref>\n\n====Social Interaction====\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''. Routledge.</ref>\n\n====Changing gender roles in marriage====\nOver the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.<ref name=\":0\"/> Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.<ref name=\":0\"/> \n\nAfter around the year 1980, divorce rates in the United States stabilized.<ref name=\":03\">Greenstein, Theodore N. \u201cGender Ideology, Marital Disruption, and the Employment of Married Women.\u201d ''Journal of Marriage and Family'', vol. 57, no. 1, 1995, pp. 31\u201342.</ref> Scholars in the area of sociology explain that this stabilization was due to several factors including, but not limited to, the shift in gender roles,. The attitude concerning the shift in gender roles can be classified into two perspectives: traditional and egalitarian. Traditional attitudes uphold designated responsibilities for the sexes- wives raise the children and keep the home nice, and men are the breadwinners.

Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\n* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,\n* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and\n* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722\u201341 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles. Supporting Hofstede's 1980 findings, that \"high masculinity cultures are associated with low percentages of women holding professional and technical employment\", test values for work-related egalitarianism were lower for Chinese than for Americans.<ref>Hofstede</ref>{{Specify|date=July 2016}} This is supported by the proportion of women that held professional jobs in China (far less than that of America), the data clearly indicating the limitations on opportunities open to women in contemporary Eastern society. In contrast, there was no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and Americans regarding domestic gender roles.\n\nA study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions.<ref name=\"Bag\"/> The United States was considered a more 'independence-based culture', while China was considered ''''''inter'''''dependence-based'. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that \"gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture\". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that \"women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means\".<ref name=\"Bag\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641\u201372 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}</ref> The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups \u2014 for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.\n\n==Communication==\n{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}\nGender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.\n\nCommunication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}</ref> Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.<ref>DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough.

Baltimore, MD, US: Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref> In her study, she noted women smile and laugh more and have a better understanding of nonverbal cues. She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.\n\nMen, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A. H. (2000). Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nMcQuiston and Morris also noted a major difference in men and women's nonverbal communication.

Cengage Learning.</ref> She believes that in addition to female and male communication cultures, there are also specific communication cultures for African Americans, older people, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], gay men, lesbians, and people with disabilities. According to Wood, it is generally thought that biological sex is behind the distinct ways of communicating, but in her opinion the root of these differences is \"gender\".<ref>Wood, J (2010) Gendered lives: Communication, gender and culture.

Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.\n\nGender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

On the other hand, it is known masculinity is associated with aggressive behavior in all mammals, and most likely explains at least part of the fact that masculine people are more likely to express their sexual interest. This is known as the [[Challenge hypothesis]].\n\nVarious studies show different communication strategies with a feminine person refusing a masculine person's sexual interest.

The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe second study looked at gender labelling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the \u201cGender Labeling Test\u201d, had more traditional family values. These two studies, conducted by Beverly I. Fagot, Mar D.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]]. The media tends to focus on the seductress woman's sex appeal and physical appearance in opposition to her policy stances and [[rhetoric]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlin|first=Diana B.|authorlink=Diana Carlin|date=Fall 2009|title=Have You Come a Long Way, Baby?

[[Implicit stereotypes]] are the unconscious influence of attitudes a person may or may not be aware that they hold. A person is influenced by these attitudes even though they are not aware. Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.\n\nThese implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the [[Implicit-association test]] (IAT).\n\nOne example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females. It has been found that men have stronger positive associations with mathematics than women, while women have stronger negative associations with mathematics and the more strongly a woman associates herself with the female gender identity, the more negative her association with mathematics.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = Brian A. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = Mahzarin R. | last3 = Greenwald | first3 = Anthony G. | title = Math = male, me = female, therefore math \u2260 me | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 44\u201359 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.83.1.44 | date = July 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.463.6120 | pmid = 12088131 }}</ref>\n\nThese associations have been disputed for their biological connection to gender and have been attributed to social forces that perpetuate stereotypes such as aforementioned stereotype that men are better at mathematics than women.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYw7ZZzCqNYC&pg=PR5#v=onepage&q=males+better+at+math|title=Myths Of Gender: Biological Theories About Women And Men, Revised Edition|first=Anne|last=Fausto-Sterling|date=4 August 2008|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=22 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780786723904}}</ref>\n\nThis particular stereotype has been found in American children as early as second grade.<ref name=\"Cvencek\" />\n\nThe same test with Singaporean children found that the strength of their mathematics-gender stereotype and their gender identity predicted the association between individuals and mathematical ability.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cvencek | first1 = Dario | last2 = Meltzoff | first2 = Andrew N. | last3 = Kapur | first3 = Manu | title = Cognitive consistency and math\u2013gender stereotypes in Singaporean children | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 117 | pages = 73\u201391 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2013.07.018 | pmid = 24141205 | date = January 2014 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nIt has been shown that this stereotype also reflects mathematical performance: a study was done on the worldwide scale and it was found that the strength of this mathematics-gender stereotype in varying countries correlates with 8th graders' scores on the [[TIMSS]], a standardized math and science achievement test that is given worldwide.

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities.

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"<ref>''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}</ref>\n\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]\u2019s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, \u201cabasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.\u201d<ref>Shuttleworth, Sally. \"Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era.\" Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science.

In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].
