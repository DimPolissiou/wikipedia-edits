While Obrecht obtains the records, Nathan and Maxie realize the medical records are inconsistent with the [[Cassadine family]]'s genetic history and a DNA test later confirms that Nathan is not a Cassadine after all. Obrecht is forced to admit that [[List of General Hospital characters (1990s)#Cesar Faison|Cesar Faison]] ([[Anders Hove (actor)|Anders Hove]]) is Nathan's biological father. Lulu convinces Nathan to do an expos\u00e9 on him as Faison's son to help the authorities lure him out of hiding. Maxie fears the danger that Faison could bring to their doorstep, but Nathan is determined to bring his father to justice. As expected, Faison shows up and takes Maxie and her boss [[Peter August]] ([[Wes Ramsey]]) hostage. Nathan comes to Maxie's rescue only to be shot by Faison. While he survives emergency surgery, Nathan dies in recovery shortly after professing his love for Maxie. He was buried with full policeman honors.

[[Trevor Khan]], {{smaller|[[New South Wales Legislative Council|MLC]]}}\n}}\nThe '''president of the New South Wales Legislative Council''' is the presiding officer of the upper house of the [[Parliament of New South Wales]], the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. The presiding officer of the lower house is the [[Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly|speaker of the Legislative Assembly]]. The role of President has generally been a partisan office, filled by the governing party of the time. As of May 2017 the president is [[John Ajaka]].\n\n==Election==\nThe president is elected by the Council in a secret ballot. The Clerk of the Council conducts the election. The Presidency has always been a partisan office and the nominee of the government party has nearly always been elected\u2014although this cannot be guaranteed since the government of the day does not necessarily have a majority in the Council. The president is assisted by an elected deputy president. The traditional practice has been that the government nominates an MLC to be elected as President, and the Opposition nominates an MLC to be Deputy President. However, as with now, this is not always the case.\n\n==Impartiality==\nThe president has a casting vote (in the event of an equality of votes). Like the speaker, the president continues to attend party meetings, and at general elections stands as a party candidate. On the other hand, the president does not usually take part in debates in the Council and does not speak in public on party-political issues. He or she is expected to conduct the business of the Council in an impartial and dignified manner.\n\nSection 22I of the NSW Constitution states that ''\"All questions arising in the Legislative Council shall be decided by a majority of the votes of the Members present other than the President or other Member presiding and when the votes are equal the President or other Member presiding shall have a casting vote.\"''\n\n==Role==\nThe president\u2019s principal duty is to preside over the Council, although he or she is assisted in this by the deputy president and a panel of acting deputy presidents, who usually preside during routine debates. The occupant of the chair must maintain order in the Council, uphold the [[rules of order|Standing Orders]] (rules of procedure) and protect the rights of backbench councillors. The president, in conjunction with the speaker of the Legislative Assembly, also administers [[Parliament House, Sydney]], with the assistance of administrative staff.\n\nAlthough the president does not have the same degree of disciplinary power as the speaker does, the Council is not as rowdy as most Australian legislative chambers, and thus his or her disciplinary powers are seldom exercised.\n\n==Perquisites and ceremony==\n[[File:President of the Council John Peden presiding over the state opening of the NSW Parliament, 18 September 1929.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Sir John Peden (1929\u20131946) in the full traditional dress presiding over the State Opening of Parliament, 18 September 1929.]]\nFollowing the Westminster tradition inherited from the [[House of Lords of the United Kingdom]], the traditional dress of the speaker includes components of [[Court dress]] such as the black silk lay-type gown (similar to a [[Queen's Counsel]] gown), a wing collar and a lace jabot or bands (another variation included a white bow tie with a lace jabot), bar jacket, and a full-bottomed wig.\n\nThe dress of speakers has often variated according to the party in power, but is determinate on the personal choice of the speaker. Most Labor party presidents eschewed the wig while retaining the court dress, while conservative and independent speakers tended to wear the full dress.\n\nThe president, currently, no longer wears the full traditional court dress outfit. Max Willis (1991-1998) was the last president to do so. From 1998 to 2011, all the presidents opted not to wear any dress at all, preferring normal business attire. However, upon his election, President Harwin returned to tradition by wearing the gown during question time and on significant occasions such as the Opening of Parliament. However, there is nothing stopping any given speaker, if they choose to do so, from assuming traditional court dress or anything they deem appropriate.\n\n==List of presidents of the Legislative Council==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#!!President!!Party affiliation!!Term start!!Term end || Time in office\n|-\n| 1 || The Hon.

No British newspaper would publish the Maxwell allegations because of his well-known [[Slander and libel|litigiousness]].

Evans read out a statement from Seymour Hersh, who said he had documentation showing meetings between Davies, unnamed Mossad officers, and \"Cindy\" (Cheryl Bentov), the woman who lured Vanunu to Rome. It transpired that Matthew Evans and Seymour Hersh had themselves been the subject of a sting operation by Joe Flynn, [[Fleet Street]]'s most celebrated [[Confidence trick|con man]].

Evans read out a statement from Seymour Hersh, who said he had documentation showing meetings between Davies, unnamed Mossad officers, and \"Cindy\" (Cheryl Bentov), the woman who lured Vanunu to Rome. It transpired that Matthew Evans and Seymour Hersh had themselves been the subject of a sting operation by Joe Flynn, [[Fleet Street]]'s most celebrated [[Confidence trick|con man]]. Evans had met Flynn in Amsterdam, paying him \u00a31,200 for the forged documents.\n\n====October Surprise====\nBen-Menashe testified in 1991 that he had personally witnessed [[George H. W.

Ben-Menashe produced a videotape of conversations between himself and Tsvangirai in London, England, and Montreal, where the latter appeared to ask for Ben-Menashe's help as a political consultant. Unbeknownst to Tsvangirai, Ben-Menashe's Montreal consultancy firm at the time, Dickens and Madson, was working for Mugabe, and tapes of the ambiguous conversation were passed to the Zimbabwean authorities, who charged Tsvangirai with [[treason]], which is punishable by death in that country.<ref name=Meldrum>Meldrum, Andrew; MacAskill, Ewan; McGreal, Chris; and Barkham, Patrick.
