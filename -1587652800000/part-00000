At its renaming as a Royal Corps in 1918 it was both a supply and repair corps.  In the supply area it had responsibility for weapons, armoured vehicles and other military equipment, ammunition and clothing and certain minor functions such as laundry, mobile baths and photography. The RAOC was also responsible for a major element of the repair of Army equipment.  In 1942 the latter function was transferred to the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME) and the vehicle storage and spares responsibilities of the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] were in turn passed over to the RAOC.  The RAOC retained repair responsibilities for ammunition, clothing and certain ranges of general stores.  In 1964 the [[McLeod Reorganisation of Army Logistics]] resulted in the RAOC absorbing petroleum, rations and accommodation stores functions from the Royal Army Service Corps as well as the [[Army Fire Service]], barrack services, sponsorship of [[NAAFI]] (EFI) and the management of [[staff clerk]]s from the same Corps.  On 5 April 1993, the RAOC was one of the corps that amalgamated to form The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC).\n\nThe permanent establishment of an [[Ordnance Office]] long predated that of a [[standing army]] in Britain; it has therefore been claimed that 'in a wide sense, as heirs to the master-[[bowyers]], master-[[Fletcher (occupation)|fletchers]], master-[[carpenters]] and master-[[Metalsmith|smiths]] who, in mediaeval days, were responsible as Officers of Ordnance for the care and provision of warlike mat\u00e9riel, and to their successors the storekeepers, [[clerk]]s, [[Armed-forces artificer|artificers]], [[armourers]] and [[Storeman|storemen]] of the Board of Ordnance, the R.A.O.C. can claim a far longer continuous history and more ancient lineage than any other unit of the British Army'.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\">{{cite book |last1=Forbes |first1=Major General A. |title=The History of the Army Ordnance Services, vol.

Thereafter followed thirty years of fluctuating allocation of responsibilities and a great variety of titles of both corps and individuals. This complex, convoluted and largely unsatisfactory period insofar as Army logistics was concerned was summarised in 1889 as follows: \n{{quote|'The English Ordnance Department goes back into an older history than the Army.  There were Master Generals of the Ordnance and Boards of Ordnance centuries before there were [[Secretary of State for War|Secretaries of State for War]] or [[Commanders-in-Chief]].

The Storekeeper's department, on the other hand, was part of the [[Civilian|civil]] establishment, though (as with much of the Board's activity) troops were involved in various aspects of its operation when not [[Military deployment|deployed]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Hogg1963\" /> In any case, modern distinctions between civilian and military personnel were not so clear cut for those serving under the Board: its officers, [[military engineers|engineers]] and [[artillerymen]] received their commissions or patents from the [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], as did the Storekeepers, artificers and storemen. Though civilians, the Storekeepers were provided with uniform, akin to that of the Royal Artillery, described in 1833 as a blue coat with red stand-collar and cuffs, gold [[epaulettes]] indicating rank and blue trousers with a gold stripe, worn with a gold-[[Hilt|hilted]] sword and a [[cocked hat]]; Clerks on the establishment wore the same uniform but without epaulettes. After [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] they were given relative rank (for the purpose of allotting appropriate quarters): Storekeepers to rank as lieutenant colonel, Deputy Storekeepers as major (if in independent charge) or else captain, Assistant Storekeepers as lieutenant and Clerks as a non-commissioned officer.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> The Storekeepers and their Deputies had oversight of the [[Board of Ordnance#Storage and supply: the Ordnance Yards|Ordnance Yards]], both at home and abroad, however they were never deployed in the [[theatre of war]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/royal-naval-dockyard-staff/|title=Royal Naval dockyard staff|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance====\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Woolwich Warren (the future [[Royal Arsenal]]) had outgrown the [[Tower of London]] as the main ordnance storage depot in the realm.<ref name=Hogg1963>{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=Brigadier O.F.G. |year=1963 |title=The Royal Arsenal Woolwich |volume=Volume I |location=London |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref> In times of war, the Board of Ordnance Storekeepers found themselves responsible for conveying guns, ammunition and certain other items to the troops [[Field of battle|in the field]] (whereas provision of food, supplies and other equipment was largely dependent on the [[Commissariat]], a department of [[HM Treasury]]). Until 1792, the transport and issue of weapons and ammunition to troops in the [[theatre of war]] was achieved by the formation of [[artillery train]]s, as and where required. In that year, with Britain about to engage in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the Board sought to place this ''ad hoc'' arrangement on a permanent footing by establishing a '''Field Train Department'''. A Lieutenant-General of the Royal Artillery served as its Commandant and a Major-General as his Deputy, but otherwise its personnel were uniformed civilians: under a Senior [[Commissary]] based at Woolwich were Commissaries, Assistant Commissaries, Clerks of Stores and Conductors of Stores (equivalent to [[Major]]s, [[Captain (Army)|Captains]], [[subalterns]] and [[NCOs]] respectively).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" /> In peace time nothing more than a small [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of officers was maintained (at the headquarters in Woolwich), but in time of war they were supplemented by recruits from the Ordnance Storekeeper's department to serve in the field; thus the strength of the Department varied dramatically, from 4 or 5 (during the peaceful years 1828-1853) to 346 at its peak in 1813. Each recruit received special training in the handling of munitions. During the Crimean War a number of Sergeants were seconded from the Royal Artillery to serve as [[Conductor (military appointment)|Military Conductors]] in addition to the civilian staff.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\">{{cite book |last1=Steer |first1=Brigadier Frank |title=To The Warrior His Arms: the story of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1918-1993 |date=2005 |publisher=Pen & Sword |location=Barnsley, S. Yorks}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers, the Field Train Department had additional responsibilities: it provided them with pay, clothing, medical supplies and camp equipment when deployed (while the Commissariat provided their food and [[forage]]).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\">{{cite book |last1=Sharpe |first1=L. C. |title=The Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance |date=1993 |publisher=Royal Logistic Corps museum}}</ref> The Field Train Department provided the Royal Engineers with their [[pontoon bridge]]s and other specialist equipment, and (until the formation of a separate Corps of Artillery Drivers) provided for the movement of [[artillery piece]]s in the field (other than those pertaining to the [[Royal Horse Artillery]]). For the duration of conflict the Department's personnel accompanied the Artillery and Engineer units in the field providing them with logistic support (including repair facilities).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\nBetween 1795 and 1815, the Field Train served in thirty expeditions and campaigns.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> In peacetime, the civilians and sergeants returned to their former duties, but the cadre of officers was retained; they were based initially in the Royal Arsenal, and then in the [[Royal Artillery Barracks#Related institutions in Woolwich|Grand Depot]] (just off [[Woolwich Common]]) where the guns were stored ready for deployment. At the start of the Crimean War, the Ordnance Field Train was [[mobilized]] once again. An parallel supply corps within the Army (the [[Royal Waggon Train]], first established in 1794) had been disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in 1833, however, and its responsibilities devolved again to the Commissariat (which was by now more attuned to peacetime operations than warfare);<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> after a well-publicised series of logistical failings the Commissariat and the Board of Ordnance, as well as the command-structure of the army itself, were all strongly criticised, leading (among other things) to the abolition of the Board (in 1855) and its Field Train Department (in 1859, its officers having transferred to the new Military Store Department).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\n===After Crimea===\nIn the years following the Crimean War three corps can be identified as the direct predecessors of the RAOC.  The '''Military Store Department''' (MSD) created in 1861 granted military commissions and provided officers to manage stores inventories.  In parallel a subordinate corps of warrant officers and sergeants, the '''Military Store Clerks Corps''' (MSC), was also created to carry out clerical duties.  These small corps (235 officers in the MSD and 44 MSC) were based largely at the [[Tower of London]], [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Weedon Bec]], but were also deployable on active service. They were supplemented in 1865 by the establishment at Woolwich of a '''Military Store Staff Corps'''  (MSSC) to provide soldiers:<ref>HED Harris ' the First Five Hundred Years', RAOC School, Blackdown 1962. pp65-67</ref> initially 200-strong, it had more than doubled in size by 1869, with units in Portsmouth, Devonport, Aldershot, Dublin and Chatham as well as at Woolwich and the Tower.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />\n\nIn 1870 a further reorganisation, ostensibly to simplify management, resulted in the MSD, MSC and MSSC being grouped with the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]] (ASC) under the [[Control Department]].  The officers remained a separate branch (Ordnance or Military Stores) in the Control Department but the soldiers were absorbed into the ASC.  This arrangement lasted until 1876.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of Army Ordnance Services', Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 151-152</ref>\n\nThe Control Department was disbanded in 1876.  The Ordnance/Military Store officers joined a newly created '''Ordnance Stores Department''' (OSD).  Five years later, in 1881, the soldiers also left the ASC and became the '''Ordnance Store Corps''' (OSC).  In 1894 there were further changes.  The OSD was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Department''' (AOD) and absorbed the Inspectors of Machinery from the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA).  In parallel the OSC was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Corps''' (AOC) and at the same time absorbed the Corps of Armourers and the RA's Armament Artificers.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 153-5</ref>\n\nIn 1918 the AOD and AOC amalgamated to form the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and for the first time officers and soldiers served in the same organisation; it received the \"Royal\" prefix in recognition of their service during the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/royal-army-ordnance-corps|title=Royal Army Ordnance Corps|publisher=National Army Museum|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ordnance Services Organisation before 1914==\n[[File:Greenwich Heritage Centre, Woolwich - RA & RMA exhibition 26 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Red Barracks, Woolwich]]\n===Depots and other installations===\nThe earliest depot for military stores was the [[Tower of London]], headquarters of the [[Ordnance Office]], which for many centuries sufficed to hold the country's central stocks of artillery, gunpowder, small arms and ammunition albeit in unsatisfactory circumstances. The Tower continued to be used for storage into the 19th century, but in 1671 the Board of Ordnance acquired a parcel of land at [[Woolwich]] which soon supplanted the Tower to become the Board's main ordnance storage depot; manufacture as well as storage of guns and ammunition took place on the site, which was later named the [[Royal Arsenal]]. In 1760 the Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established at [[Purfleet]], replacing the Tower as Britain's central repository of gunpowder. In 1808 a modern purpose-built depot was constructed at [[Weedon Bec|Weedon]], alongside the Grand Union Canal, to serve as a safe repository for guns and ammunition;<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol I. p192</ref> and in 1813 a new Grand Storehouse was opened in the Royal Arsenal, containing multiple warehouses for all kinds of military stores. When [[Woolwich Dockyard]] closed in 1869, the entire dockyard site was taken over by the War Office to become a vast ordnance stores complex, annexed (and [[Royal Arsenal Railway|linked by rail]]) to the ordnance stores in the Royal Arsenal; large stocks of barrack stores, [[Horse harness|harnesses]], [[accoutrements]] and other general stores were transferred to Woolwich Dockyard from the Tower at this time. At the same time the Military Store Department moved its headquarters from the Tower to the Red Fort at Woolwich (which had originally been built as the infirmary for the adjacent [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich|Royal Marine Barracks]], linked to the nearby Dockyard);<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semark|first1=H.W.|title=The Royal Naval Armament Depots of Priddy's Hard, Elson, Frater and Bedenham, 1768\u20131977|date=1997|publisher=Hampshire County Council|location=Winchester|page=124}}</ref> as [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich#Red Barracks|Red Barracks]], it would continue to serve as the [[Regimental depot|regimental Depot]], headquarters and home of the ordnance corps for the next fifty years. Finally, by about 1887, large stocks of small arms were moved from the Tower of London to Weedon, leaving the Tower to serve as a repository of ancient arms and armour and as a small Ordnance centre for troops in London.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />  \n\n[[File:Selby, Old MOD Ordnance Depot - geograph.org.uk - 159590.jpg|thumb|right|The former [[Barlby]] Ordnance Depot, dating from 1889 (one of a number of small depots established at that time).]]\nIn addition to these central depots, ordnance yards in the naval and garrison towns of [[Chatham Dockyard#The Gun Wharf|Chatham]], [[Gunwharf Quays|Portsmouth]] and [[HMNB Devonport#Morice Yard (New Gun Wharf)|Plymouth]] held reserve stocks of camp equipment, entrenching tools, small-arms and ammunition, accoutrements, harness and saddlery (similar stores were also provided at Dublin, Gibraltar and Malta). During the Crimean War, however, these arrangements proved unequal to the task of equipping an army with speed at a time of [[mobilization]]. After the war an Ordnance station was established as part of the new training camp at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]]: a hutted encampment was provided for troops to practise combined training, alongside a depot to furnish them with field stores.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> In the 1880s an effort was made to decentralise the reserves of equipment; as many as sixty-two small regional centres were set up, in an effort to bring stores closer to the units that would use them. Later, with the establishment of larger camps and garrisons in the early 20th century, these were consolidated into eighteen larger Ordnance stations. At the same time, during the period from the 1860s to 1914, various depots were established to support the Army throughout the world (with the notable exception of India where the Indian Army managed its own parallel organisation in [[Ordnance Depot Quetta, Rawalpindi and Karachi]] (then British India and now Pakistan), the Indian Army Ordnance Corps (IAOC). In 1881 there were detachments in Dublin, [[Jersey]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canada]], [[St Helena]], [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Straits Settlements]].

Both the sheer scale of the war and the increasing technical complexity created an organisational structure that, in its outlines, survives until today.  The depots at Woolwich, Weedon and Pimlico were supplemented by the wholesale takeover of warehouses throughout the country and in early 1915 a depot was established at [[Vauxhall Barracks|Didcot]] to be the major focus for the receipt and distribution of RAOC stores.  Ammunition storage was also expanded dramatically and the former peacetime magazines at places such as Purfleet, [[Portsmouth]] and [[Plymouth]] were supplemented by purpose built depots at [[Bramley Camp|Bramley]], [[Altrincham]], [[Credenhill]] and Didcot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heraldseries.co.uk/news/15078695.a-brief-history-of-the-army-in-didcot-by-david-taylor-of-didcot-district-archaeological-historical-society/|title=A brief history of the Army in Didcot by David Taylor of Didcot & District Archaeological & Historical Society|date=8 February 2017|publisher=The Herald|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army on the Western Front, 1914-1918 Q10020.jpg|thumb|right|Inside a Base Supply Depot at Vendroux, 1917.]]\nOn the Western Front a highly successful logistic infrastructure, largely rail based, was created to support the front.  Parallel systems, but of less complexity, supported operations in Italy.

In the 1920s the RAOC's principal depots were Bramley (ammunition), [[Chilwell]] (general and surplus stores), [[ROF Rotherwas|Hereford]] (ammunition), Pimlico (clothing), Woolwich (gun stores and ammunition) and Weedon (small arms).<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" /> In 1922 the RAOC headquarters, regimental depot and School of Instruction moved from Woolwich to [[Hilsea Barracks]] on the edge of Portsmouth. (The School provided education and training in all aspects of the Corps' work, with the exception of ammunition which was taught at Bramley, where the [[Army School of Ammunition]] was opened that same year.) The [[Royal Army Clothing Depot]], Pimlico, closed in 1932 and its stock was mostly transferred to Didcot.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roper |first1=Michael |title=The Records of the War Office and Related Departments, 1660-1964 |date=1998 |publisher=Public Record Office |location=Kew, Surrey |page=177}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s re-armament and the mechanisation of the Army led to a redesign of the UK base.  A Central Ordnance Depot (COD) and workshop to support vehicles, built on the site of the First World War [[National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell]], opened in 1937.  The operation of this depot was notable in that it mirrored and tried to improve on best civilian practice at the time; this became a hallmark of RAOC development in the following decades. [[Branston Depot|COD Branston]] was established in 1938, initially to serve as the Army's main clothing store, freeing up space at COD Didcot. At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] there were five CODs: Branston, Chilwell, Didcot, Weedon and Woolwich.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\n[[File:Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) women working on a Churchill tank at a Royal Army Ordnance Corps depot, 10 October 1942.

The more mobile nature of the Second World War also led to the creation of units at divisional and corps level with higher levels of mobility.  The most notable of these was the ordnance field park, principally carrying vehicle and technical stores spares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/royal-army-ordnance-corps/field-parks.html|title=Ordnance Field Parks 1 to 19|publisher=British Army units 1945 on|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Post-war to 1993==\n[[File:Wheelbarrow bomb disposal device being operated by a team from 321 EOD MOD 45159057.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wheelbarrow (robot)|Wheelbarrow]] bomb disposal device being operated by a team from [[321 EOD Squadron RLC|321 EOD Coy]] RAOC, Northern Ireland 1978.]]\nDuring the war the RAOC HQ (together with the RAOC School) had moved from Hilsea to [[Middleton Stoney]] (Bicester); in 1946 it moved again to Matthew Barracks, [[Tidworth Camp|Tidworth]] and shortly afterwards to [[Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut|Deepcut]]. The [[regimental depot]] was also moved from Hilsea, in 1946, to [[Feltham Barracks]], Middlesex; in 1955 it too moved to Deepcut.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" /> Hilsea, which had been used by the US Army during the war, continued to be used (alongside Deepcut) as a training facility for RAOC-enlisted [[National Service Act 1948|National Service]] recruits; with National Service coming to an end the Barracks closed in 1962 (but not before serving again, temporarily, as the regimental depot from 1960-1962 while Deepcut was being rebuilt).<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nA major task that fell to the RAOC in the wake of the war was disposal of ammunition. As well as disposing of large amounts of surplus stock from depots at home, and returning in good order sites that had been requisitioned for the duration of the war, RAOC units were heavily involved in clearing ammunition from Germany's former depots and dealing with live devices still in the field. The RAOC's skills in bomb disposal were later put to increasing use in dealing with terrorist devices at home as well as in conflict zones overseas. The training of Ammunition Examiners, [[Ammunition Technician]]s and [[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s at the [[Army School of Ammunition]] became progressively more specialised during the 1950s and '60s. In May 1970 a section of [[321 EOD Squadron RLC|321 EOD Unit]] was sent to [[Northern Ireland]] to support the local ammunition inspectorate in dealing with [[improvised explosive devices]]; what was initially a 6-month deployment marked the start of a much longer involvement through [[the Troubles]].<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nIn the period 1945\u201393 the RAOC, as with the rest of the Army, reduced greatly in size and closed its worldwide bases as garrisons withdrew. At the same time, there was considerable development of warehousing techniques and information technology (the first move towards [[computer]]isation came with the opening of an [[Automated data medium|Automated Data Processing]] Installation at Chilwell in 1963 and one at Bicester the following year.) In the mid-1960s new recruits were informed that 'The RAOC occupies nearly 90 different locations in the UK alone and world wide uses 86,000,000 square feet of storage space. Over 1,000,000 different items are held in stock and over 11,000,000 issues are made in a year'.<ref name=\"Notes\">[https://rnzaoc.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/50102626-raocbookletmcleod.pdf ''Notes on the Royal Army Ordnance Corps''], published in the wake of the 1964 McLeod changes.</ref> By 1980 the RAOC was reduced to two CODs at Bicester and Donnington (COD Chilwell was closing, CODs [[Branston, Staffordshire|Branston]] and Didcot had closed in 1963 and Weedon in 1965 after being downgraded from a COD in 1957), two CADs at Kineton and Longtown (Nesscliffe had closed in 1959, Corsham in 1963 and Bramley in 1974) and three Central Vehicle Depots: [[Ludgershall, Wiltshire|Ludgershall]] for 'A' (armoured) vehicles, and [[Ashchurch]] and [[Hilton, Derbyshire|Hilton]] for 'B' ('soft-skinned') vehicles<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1986/mar/18/raoc-hilton RAOC Hilton (Historic Hansard: House of Commons debate, 18 March 1986).]</ref> (CVD [[Marchington]] having closed in 1965, CVDs [[Feltham]] and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] in the early 1970s).<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nAcross the UK the structure of smaller Regional Depots, Ordnance Support Units (OSUs), Training Materiel Parks, supply depots and Ammunition Sub-Depots was steadily run down.

DOS was also a title given to senior RAOC officers at major commands such as [[Middle East Command]], [[21st Army Group]] and in more recent times BAOR.  After the [[Somerville Logistic Reorganisation Committee Report]] of 1977 the head of the corps was re-titled Director General Ordnance Services (DGOS).

At its renaming as a Royal Corps in 1918 it was both a supply and repair corps.  In the supply area it had responsibility for weapons, armoured vehicles and other military equipment, ammunition and clothing and certain minor functions such as laundry, mobile baths and photography. The RAOC was also responsible for a major element of the repair of Army equipment.  In 1942 the latter function was transferred to the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME) and the vehicle storage and spares responsibilities of the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] were in turn passed over to the RAOC.  The RAOC retained repair responsibilities for ammunition, clothing and certain ranges of general stores.  In 1964 the [[McLeod Reorganisation of Army Logistics]] resulted in the RAOC absorbing petroleum, rations and accommodation stores functions from the Royal Army Service Corps as well as the [[Army Fire Service]], barrack services, sponsorship of [[NAAFI]] (EFI) and the management of [[staff clerk]]s from the same Corps.  On 5 April 1993, the RAOC was one of the corps that amalgamated to form The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC).\n\nThe permanent establishment of an [[Ordnance Office]] long predated that of a [[standing army]] in Britain; it has therefore been claimed that 'in a wide sense, as heirs to the master-[[bowyers]], master-[[Fletcher (occupation)|fletchers]], master-[[carpenters]] and master-[[Metalsmith|smiths]] who, in mediaeval days, were responsible as Officers of Ordnance for the care and provision of warlike mat\u00e9riel, and to their successors the storekeepers, [[clerk]]s, [[Armed-forces artificer|artificers]], [[armourers]] and [[Storeman|storemen]] of the Board of Ordnance, the R.A.O.C. can claim a far longer continuous history and more ancient lineage than any other unit of the British Army'.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\">{{cite book |last1=Forbes |first1=Major General A. |title=The History of the Army Ordnance Services, vol.

Thereafter followed thirty years of fluctuating allocation of responsibilities and a great variety of titles of both corps and individuals. This complex, convoluted and largely unsatisfactory period insofar as Army logistics was concerned was summarised in 1889 as follows: \n{{quote|'The English Ordnance Department goes back into an older history than the Army.

The Storekeeper's department, on the other hand, was part of the [[Civilian|civil]] establishment, though (as with much of the Board's activity) troops were involved in various aspects of its operation when not [[Military deployment|deployed]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Hogg1963\" /> In any case, modern distinctions between civilian and military personnel were not so clear cut for those serving under the Board: its officers, [[military engineers|engineers]] and [[artillerymen]] received their commissions or patents from the [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], as did the Storekeepers, artificers and storemen. Though civilians, the Storekeepers were provided with uniform, akin to that of the Royal Artillery, described in 1833 as a blue coat with red stand-collar and cuffs, gold [[epaulettes]] indicating rank and blue trousers with a gold stripe, worn with a gold-[[Hilt|hilted]] sword and a [[cocked hat]]; Clerks on the establishment wore the same uniform but without epaulettes. After [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] they were given relative rank (for the purpose of allotting appropriate quarters): Storekeepers to rank as lieutenant colonel, Deputy Storekeepers as major (if in independent charge) or else captain, Assistant Storekeepers as lieutenant and Clerks as a non-commissioned officer.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> The Storekeepers and their Deputies had oversight of the [[Board of Ordnance#Storage and supply: the Ordnance Yards|Ordnance Yards]], both at home and abroad, however they were never deployed in the [[theatre of war]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/royal-naval-dockyard-staff/|title=Royal Naval dockyard staff|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance====\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Woolwich Warren (the future [[Royal Arsenal]]) had outgrown the [[Tower of London]] as the main ordnance storage depot in the realm.<ref name=Hogg1963>{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=Brigadier O.F.G. |year=1963 |title=The Royal Arsenal Woolwich |volume=Volume I |location=London |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref> In times of war, the Board of Ordnance Storekeepers found themselves responsible for conveying guns, ammunition and certain other items to the troops [[Field of battle|in the field]] (whereas provision of food, supplies and other equipment was largely dependent on the [[Commissariat]], a department of [[HM Treasury]]). Until 1792, the transport and issue of weapons and ammunition to troops in the [[theatre of war]] was achieved by the formation of [[artillery train]]s, as and where required. In that year, with Britain about to engage in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the Board sought to place this ''ad hoc'' arrangement on a permanent footing by establishing a '''Field Train Department'''. A Lieutenant-General of the Royal Artillery served as its Commandant and a Major-General as his Deputy, but otherwise its personnel were uniformed civilians: under a Senior [[Commissary]] based at Woolwich were Commissaries, Assistant Commissaries, Clerks of Stores and Conductors of Stores (equivalent to [[Major]]s, [[Captain (Army)|Captains]], [[subalterns]] and [[NCOs]] respectively).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" /> In peace time nothing more than a small [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of officers was maintained (at the headquarters in Woolwich), but in time of war they were supplemented by recruits from the Ordnance Storekeeper's department to serve in the field; thus the strength of the Department varied dramatically, from 4 or 5 (during the peaceful years 1828-1853) to 346 at its peak in 1813. Each recruit received special training in the handling of munitions. During the Crimean War a number of Sergeants were seconded from the Royal Artillery to serve as [[Conductor (military appointment)|Military Conductors]] in addition to the civilian staff.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\">{{cite book |last1=Steer |first1=Brigadier Frank |title=To The Warrior His Arms: the story of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1918-1993 |date=2005 |publisher=Pen & Sword |location=Barnsley, S. Yorks}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers, the Field Train Department had additional responsibilities: it provided them with pay, clothing, medical supplies and camp equipment when deployed (while the Commissariat provided their food and [[forage]]).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\">{{cite book |last1=Sharpe |first1=L. C. |title=The Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance |date=1993 |publisher=Royal Logistic Corps museum}}</ref> The Field Train Department provided the Royal Engineers with their [[pontoon bridge]]s and other specialist equipment, and (until the formation of a separate Corps of Artillery Drivers) provided for the movement of [[artillery piece]]s in the field (other than those pertaining to the [[Royal Horse Artillery]]). For the duration of conflict the Department's personnel accompanied the Artillery and Engineer units in the field providing them with logistic support (including repair facilities).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\nBetween 1795 and 1815, the Field Train served in thirty expeditions and campaigns.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> In peacetime, the civilians and sergeants returned to their former duties, but the cadre of officers was retained; they were based initially in the Royal Arsenal, and then in the [[Royal Artillery Barracks#Related institutions in Woolwich|Grand Depot]] (just off [[Woolwich Common]]) where the guns were stored ready for deployment. At the start of the Crimean War, the Ordnance Field Train was [[mobilized]] once again. An parallel supply corps within the Army (the [[Royal Waggon Train]], first established in 1794) had been disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in 1833, however, and its responsibilities devolved again to the Commissariat (which was by now more attuned to peacetime operations than warfare);<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> after a well-publicised series of logistical failings the Commissariat and the Board of Ordnance, as well as the command-structure of the army itself, were all strongly criticised, leading (among other things) to the abolition of the Board (in 1855) and its Field Train Department (in 1859, its officers having transferred to the new Military Store Department).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\n===After Crimea===\nIn the years following the Crimean War three corps can be identified as the direct predecessors of the RAOC.  The '''Military Store Department''' (MSD) created in 1861 granted military commissions and provided officers to manage stores inventories.  In parallel a subordinate corps of warrant officers and sergeants, the '''Military Store Clerks Corps''' (MSC), was also created to carry out clerical duties.  These small corps (235 officers in the MSD and 44 MSC) were based largely at the [[Tower of London]], [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Weedon Bec]], but were also deployable on active service. They were supplemented in 1865 by the establishment at Woolwich of a '''Military Store Staff Corps'''  (MSSC) to provide soldiers:<ref>HED Harris ' the First Five Hundred Years', RAOC School, Blackdown 1962. pp65-67</ref> initially 200-strong, it had more than doubled in size by 1869, with units in Portsmouth, Devonport, Aldershot, Dublin and Chatham as well as at Woolwich and the Tower.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />\n\nIn 1870 a further reorganisation, ostensibly to simplify management, resulted in the MSD, MSC and MSSC being grouped with the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]] (ASC) under the [[Control Department]].  The officers remained a separate branch (Ordnance or Military Stores) in the Control Department but the soldiers were absorbed into the ASC.  This arrangement lasted until 1876.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of Army Ordnance Services', Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 151-152</ref>\n\nThe Control Department was disbanded in 1876.  The Ordnance/Military Store officers joined a newly created '''Ordnance Stores Department''' (OSD).  Five years later, in 1881, the soldiers also left the ASC and became the '''Ordnance Store Corps''' (OSC).  In 1894 there were further changes.  The OSD was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Department''' (AOD) and absorbed the Inspectors of Machinery from the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA).  In parallel the OSC was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Corps''' (AOC) and at the same time absorbed the Corps of Armourers and the RA's Armament Artificers.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 153-5</ref>\n\nIn 1918 the AOD and AOC amalgamated to form the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and for the first time officers and soldiers served in the same organisation; it received the \"Royal\" prefix in recognition of their service during the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/royal-army-ordnance-corps|title=Royal Army Ordnance Corps|publisher=National Army Museum|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ordnance Services Organisation before 1914==\n[[File:Greenwich Heritage Centre, Woolwich - RA & RMA exhibition 26 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Red Barracks, Woolwich]]\n===Depots and other installations===\nThe earliest depot for military stores was the [[Tower of London]], headquarters of the [[Ordnance Office]], which for many centuries sufficed to hold the country's central stocks of artillery, gunpowder, small arms and ammunition albeit in unsatisfactory circumstances. The Tower continued to be used for storage into the 19th century, but in 1671 the Board of Ordnance acquired a parcel of land at [[Woolwich]] which soon supplanted the Tower to become the Board's main ordnance storage depot; manufacture as well as storage of guns and ammunition took place on the site, which was later named the [[Royal Arsenal]]. In 1760 the Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established at [[Purfleet]], replacing the Tower as Britain's central repository of gunpowder. In 1808 a modern purpose-built depot was constructed at [[Weedon Bec|Weedon]], alongside the Grand Union Canal, to serve as a safe repository for guns and ammunition;<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol I. p192</ref> and in 1813 a new Grand Storehouse was opened in the Royal Arsenal, containing multiple warehouses for all kinds of military stores. When [[Woolwich Dockyard]] closed in 1869, the entire dockyard site was taken over by the War Office to become a vast ordnance stores complex, annexed (and [[Royal Arsenal Railway|linked by rail]]) to the ordnance stores in the Royal Arsenal; large stocks of barrack stores, [[Horse harness|harnesses]], [[accoutrements]] and other general stores were transferred to Woolwich Dockyard from the Tower at this time. At the same time the Military Store Department moved its headquarters from the Tower to the Red Fort at Woolwich (which had originally been built as the infirmary for the adjacent [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich|Royal Marine Barracks]], linked to the nearby Dockyard);<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semark|first1=H.W.|title=The Royal Naval Armament Depots of Priddy's Hard, Elson, Frater and Bedenham, 1768\u20131977|date=1997|publisher=Hampshire County Council|location=Winchester|page=124}}</ref> as [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich#Red Barracks|Red Barracks]], it would continue to serve as the [[Regimental depot|regimental Depot]], headquarters and home of the ordnance corps for the next fifty years. Finally, by about 1887, large stocks of small arms were moved from the Tower of London to Weedon, leaving the Tower to serve as a repository of ancient arms and armour and as a small Ordnance centre for troops in London.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />  \n\n[[File:Selby, Old MOD Ordnance Depot - geograph.org.uk - 159590.jpg|thumb|right|The former [[Barlby]] Ordnance Depot, dating from 1889 (one of a number of small depots established at that time).]]\nIn addition to these central depots, ordnance yards in the naval and garrison towns of [[Chatham Dockyard#The Gun Wharf|Chatham]], [[Gunwharf Quays|Portsmouth]] and [[HMNB Devonport#Morice Yard (New Gun Wharf)|Plymouth]] held reserve stocks of camp equipment, entrenching tools, small-arms and ammunition, accoutrements, harness and saddlery (similar stores were also provided at Dublin, Gibraltar and Malta). During the Crimean War, however, these arrangements proved unequal to the task of equipping an army with speed at a time of [[mobilization]]. After the war an Ordnance station was established as part of the new training camp at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]]: a hutted encampment was provided for troops to practise combined training, alongside a depot to furnish them with field stores.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> In the 1880s an effort was made to decentralise the reserves of equipment; as many as sixty-two small regional centres were set up, in an effort to bring stores closer to the units that would use them. Later, with the establishment of larger camps and garrisons in the early 20th century, these were consolidated into eighteen larger Ordnance stations. At the same time, during the period from the 1860s to 1914, various depots were established to support the Army throughout the world (with the notable exception of India where the Indian Army managed its own parallel organisation in [[Ordnance Depot Quetta, Rawalpindi and Karachi]] (then British India and now Pakistan), the Indian Army Ordnance Corps (IAOC). In 1881 there were detachments in Dublin, [[Jersey]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canada]], [[St Helena]], [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Straits Settlements]].

The operation of this depot was notable in that it mirrored and tried to improve on best civilian practice at the time; this became a hallmark of RAOC development in the following decades. [[Branston Depot|COD Branston]] was established in 1938, initially to serve as the Army's main clothing store, freeing up space at COD Didcot.

The [[regimental depot]] was also moved from Hilsea, in 1946, to [[Feltham Barracks]], Middlesex; in 1955 it too moved to Deepcut.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" /> Hilsea, which had been used by the US Army during the war, continued to be used (alongside Deepcut) as a training facility for RAOC-enlisted [[National Service Act 1948|National Service]] recruits; with National Service coming to an end the Barracks closed in 1962 (but not before serving again, temporarily, as the regimental depot from 1960-1962 while Deepcut was being rebuilt).<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nA major task that fell to the RAOC in the wake of the war was disposal of ammunition. As well as disposing of large amounts of surplus stock from depots at home, and returning in good order sites that had been requisitioned for the duration of the war, RAOC units were heavily involved in clearing ammunition from Germany's former depots and dealing with live devices still in the field. The RAOC's skills in bomb disposal were later put to increasing use in dealing with terrorist devices at home as well as in conflict zones overseas. The training of Ammunition Examiners, [[Ammunition Technician]]s and [[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s at the [[Army School of Ammunition]] became progressively more specialised during the 1950s and '60s. In May 1970 a section of [[321 EOD Squadron RLC|321 EOD Unit]] was sent to [[Northern Ireland]] to support the local ammunition inspectorate in dealing with [[improvised explosive devices]]; what was initially a 6-month deployment marked the start of a much longer involvement through [[the Troubles]].<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nIn the period 1945\u201393 the RAOC, as with the rest of the Army, reduced greatly in size and closed its worldwide bases as garrisons withdrew. At the same time, there was considerable development of warehousing techniques and information technology (the first move towards [[computer]]isation came with the opening of an [[Automated data medium|Automated Data Processing]] Installation at Chilwell in 1963 and one at Bicester the following year.) In the mid-1960s new recruits were informed that 'The RAOC occupies nearly 90 different locations in the UK alone and world wide uses 86,000,000 square feet of storage space. Over 1,000,000 different items are held in stock and over 11,000,000 issues are made in a year'.<ref name=\"Notes\">[https://rnzaoc.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/50102626-raocbookletmcleod.pdf ''Notes on the Royal Army Ordnance Corps''], published in the wake of the 1964 McLeod changes.</ref> By 1980 the RAOC was reduced to two CODs at Bicester and Donnington (COD Chilwell was closing, CODs [[Branston, Staffordshire|Branston]] and Didcot had closed in 1963 and Weedon in 1965 after being downgraded from a COD in 1957), two CADs at Kineton and Longtown (Nesscliffe had closed in 1959, Corsham in 1963 and Bramley in 1974) and three Central Vehicle Depots: [[Ludgershall, Wiltshire|Ludgershall]] for 'A' (armoured) vehicles, and [[Ashchurch]] and [[Hilton, Derbyshire|Hilton]] for 'B' ('soft-skinned') vehicles<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1986/mar/18/raoc-hilton RAOC Hilton (Historic Hansard: House of Commons debate, 18 March 1986).]</ref> (CVD [[Marchington]] having closed in 1965, CVDs [[Feltham]] and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] in the early 1970s).<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nAcross the UK the structure of smaller Regional Depots, Ordnance Support Units (OSUs), Training Materiel Parks, supply depots and Ammunition Sub-Depots was steadily run down. A reconfiguration in the late 1960s provided four Regional Depots ([[Thatcham railway station#Thatcham Ordnance Depot|Thatcham]], Hereford, [[Catterick Garrison|Catterick]] and [[Forthside Barracks|Stirling]]) and nine OSUs: Aldershot, [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], [[Burscough]], [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester]], [[Feltham]], [[Old Dalby]], Thetford, Tidworth and Woolwich (which had been downgraded following the closure of the [[Royal Ordnance Factory]] and the sale of the old Dockyard).

After 1981 in [[NATO]] assigned units, principally those in [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR), the standard NATO system was adopted with all appointments elsewhere changing the following year.\n\nThe senior RAOC appointment was Director Equipment and Ordnance Stores (DEOS) \u2212 always a [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] \u2212 which during the 1920s became Director Ordnance Services (DOS). DOS was also a title given to senior RAOC officers at major commands such as [[Middle East Command]], [[21st Army Group]] and in more recent times BAOR.  After the [[Somerville Logistic Reorganisation Committee Report]] of 1977 the head of the corps was re-titled Director General Ordnance Services (DGOS). Following the huge expansion of the RAOC in the [[Second World War]] the senior RAOC major general was designated Controller Ordnance Services (COS) from 1942<ref>Brigadier AH Fernyhough 'History of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1920-45' RAOC.

All RAOC appointments gave the staff grade (e.g. Staff Officer Grade 2: SO2 suffixed with the word Sup), the head of corps in a headquarters irrespective of rank was titled Comd Sup.

In the first regular March session, Republicans superseded the Crittenden Resolution, removing the prohibition against emancipation of slaves.{{sfn | Neely | page=210}}\n\nIn South Carolina, Gen. [[David Hunter]], issued a General Order in early May 1862 freeing all slaves in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. President Lincoln quickly rescinded the order, reserving this \"supposed power\" to his own discretion if it were indispensable to saving the Union.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lprbscsm&fileName=scsm0579/lprbscsmscsm0579.db \"Presidential Proclamation May 19, 1862\"], Abraham Lincoln's response to General Hunter's General Order Number Eleven. [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] was to be outside the police functions of field commanders.</ref> Later in the same month without directly disobeying Lincoln's prohibition against emancipation, General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] at [[Fort Monroe#1860\u201361|Fort Monroe]] Virginia declared slaves escaped into his lines as \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] of war\", that is, forfeit to their rebel owners.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/magazine/mag-03CivilWar-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 New York Times: \"How Slavery Really Ended in America\"] Viewed November 9, 2011.</ref> On May 24, Congress followed General Butler's lead, and passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|First Confiscation Act]] in August, freeing slaves used for rebellion.<ref name=\"McPherson, p. 57-58\">McPherson, p. 57-58</ref>\n\nIn Missouri, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], the 1856 Republican nominee for President, exceeded his authority as a General, declaring that all slaves held by rebels within his military district would be freed.<ref name=\"McPherson, p. 57-58\"/> Republican majorities in Congress responded on opening day of the December Session. Sen. [[Lyman Trumbull]] introduced a bill for confiscation of rebel property and emancipation for their slaves. \"Acrimonious debate on confiscation proved a major preoccupation\" of Congress.{{sfn | Neely | page=210}} On March 13, 1862, Congress directed the armies of the United States to stop enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act. The next month, the Congress [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act|abolished slavery in the District of Columbia]] with compensation for loyal citizens. An additional [[Confiscation Acts|Confiscation Act in July]] declared free all slaves held by citizens in rebellion, but it had no practical effect without addressing where the act would take effect, or how ownership was to be proved.{{sfn | Neely | page=214}}\n\nLincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation was issued September 22, 1862.{{sfn | Neely | page=214}} It became the principal issue before the public in the mid-term elections that year for the 38th Congress. But Republican majorities in both houses held (see 'Congress as a campaign machine' below), and the Republicans actually increased their majority in the Senate.<ref>McPherson, p. 142</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 1863, the war measure by executive proclamation directed the army and the navy to treat all escaped slaves as free when entering Union lines from territory still in rebellion. The measure would take effect when the escaped slave entered Union lines and loyalty of the previous owner was irrelevant.<ref>{{url| https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/transcript.html}}</ref> Congress passed enabling legislation to carry out the Proclamation including \"Freedman's Bureau\" legislation.<ref>{{cite web | last=Blaine | first=James G. | title=Memoir re-published on the National Archives webpage | url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/treasures_of_congress/text/page12_text.html}}</ref> The practical effect was a massive internal evacuation of Confederate slave labor, and augmenting Union Army teamsters, railroad crews and infantry for the duration of the Civil War.\n\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=2>\nFile:Benjamin F Wade - Brady-Handy.jpg|<center>Sen.

Eight thick volumes of testimony were filled with investigations of Union defeats and contractor scandals.\n\nThey were highly charged with partisan opinions \"vehemently expressed\" by chair Benjamin Wade of Ohio, Representative George Washington Julian of Indiana, and Zachariah Chandler of Michigan.{{sfn | Neely | page=212\u2013213}}\n\nSen. Chandler, who had been one of McClellan's advocates promoting his spectacular rise,<ref>McPherson, p. 76</ref> particularly documented criticism of McClellan's Peninsular Campaign with its circuitous maneuvering, endless entrenchment and murderous camp diseases. It led to support for his dismissal.\n\nA congressional committee could ruin a reputation, without itself having any military expertise. It would create the modern Congressional era in which generals fought wars with Congress looking over their shoulders, \"and with public opinion following closely behind.\"{{sfn | Neely | page=212\u2013213}}\n\n=== Republican Platform goals ===\n\nRepublican majorities in both houses, apart from pro-union Democrats, and without vacant southern delegations, were able to enact their party platform. These included the [[Legal Tender Act]], February 20, 1862, and increases in the tariff that amounted to protective tariffs. The Homestead Act, May 20, 1862, for government lands, and the Morrill Land Grant Act, July 2, 1862, for universities promoting practical arts in agriculture and mining, had no immediate war purpose. But they would have long range effects, as would the [[Pacific Railroad Act]], July 1, 1862, for a transcontinental railroad.{{sfn | Neely | page=211}}\n\nTreasury innovations were driven by Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]] and necessity of war.

Party congressional committees stayed in Washington during national campaigns, keeping an open flow of subsidized literature pouring back into the home districts.{{sfn | Neely | page=213}}\n\nNevertheless, like other Congresses in the 1850s and 1860s, this Congress would see less than half of its membership reelected.<ref>{{cite web | last=Erickson | first=Stephen C. | title=The Entrenching of Incumbency: Reelections in the U.S. House of Representatives, 1790-1994 | work=The Cato Journal | date=Winter 1995 | url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj14n3-2.html | access-date=November 4, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623031741/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj14n3-2.html | archive-date=June 23, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nThe characteristic turmoil found in the \"3rd Party Period, 1855-1896\" stirred political party realignment in the North even in the midst of civil war.

In the first regular March session, Republicans superseded the Crittenden Resolution, removing the prohibition against emancipation of slaves.{{sfn | Neely | page=210}}\n\nIn South Carolina, Gen. [[David Hunter]], issued a General Order in early May 1862 freeing all slaves in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. President Lincoln quickly rescinded the order, reserving this \"supposed power\" to his own discretion if it were indispensable to saving the Union.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lprbscsm&fileName=scsm0579/lprbscsmscsm0579.db \"Presidential Proclamation May 19, 1862\"], Abraham Lincoln's response to General Hunter's General Order Number Eleven. [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] was to be outside the police functions of field commanders.</ref> Later in the same month without directly disobeying Lincoln's prohibition against emancipation, General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] at [[Fort Monroe#1860\u201361|Fort Monroe]] Virginia declared slaves escaped into his lines as \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] of war\", that is, forfeit to their rebel owners.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/magazine/mag-03CivilWar-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 New York Times: \"How Slavery Really Ended in America\"] Viewed November 9, 2011.</ref> On May 24, Congress followed General Butler's lead, and passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|First Confiscation Act]] in August, freeing slaves used for rebellion.<ref name=\"McPherson, p. 57-58\">McPherson, p. 57-58</ref>\n\nIn Missouri, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], the 1856 Republican nominee for President, exceeded his authority as a General, declaring that all slaves held by rebels within his military district would be freed.<ref name=\"McPherson, p. 57-58\"/> Republican majorities in Congress responded on opening day of the December Session. Sen. [[Lyman Trumbull]] introduced a bill for confiscation of rebel property and emancipation for their slaves. \"Acrimonious debate on confiscation proved a major preoccupation\" of Congress.{{sfn | Neely | page=210}} On March 13, 1862, Congress directed the armies of the United States to stop enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act. The next month, the Congress [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act|abolished slavery in the District of Columbia]] with compensation for loyal citizens. An additional [[Confiscation Acts|Confiscation Act in July]] declared free all slaves held by citizens in rebellion, but it had no practical effect without addressing where the act would take effect, or how ownership was to be proved.{{sfn | Neely | page=214}}\n\nLincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation was issued September 22, 1862.{{sfn | Neely | page=214}} It became the principal issue before the public in the mid-term elections that year for the 38th Congress. But Republican majorities in both houses held (see 'Congress as a campaign machine' below), and the Republicans actually increased their majority in the Senate.<ref>McPherson, p. 142</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 1863, the war measure by executive proclamation directed the army and the navy to treat all escaped slaves as free when entering Union lines from territory still in rebellion.

Subsequently, the ''Quarterly'' was published independently with a board of editors composed of many prominent figures in American forestry in the early part of the 20th century, including Editor-in-Chief Bernhard Fernow and [[Carl Schenck]], founder of the [[Biltmore Forest School]].\n\n==Defunding of the College==\n{{See also|People v. Brooklyn Cooperage Co.}}\nThe fledgling college of forestry soon became mired in controversy, centered around [[Bernhard Fernow|Fernow's]] management of the forest lands given to Cornell by the state \"for experiments in forestry\". Soon after his appointment as Dean, Fernow moved quickly to establish a [[demonstration forest]] on the {{convert|30000|acre|km2}} of land in the [[Adirondack Park|Adirondack forests]] acquired by Cornell with the authorization for the new college. The site was near Axton, New York, location of an old lumber settlement originally called Axe-town, in [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]].\n\nFernow's plan called for [[clearcutting]] the tract at the rate of several thousand acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with the [[Brookyn Cooperage Company]] for the project to be viable. Under terms of the contract, the firm was to take the logs and [[cordwood]] from the forest land for a 15-year period. (In the 1890s, the more valuable [[red spruce]] trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods.) Fernow had a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}}-long railroad spur built from Axton to [[Tupper Lake, New York|Tupper Lake]] in order to deliver logs to the company's facility. The firm turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into [[methanol]] and [[charcoal]], through a process called [[destructive distillation]].\n\nThe contract proved to be profitable and beneficial for the company only. To his credit, Fernow established the first [[tree nursery]] in New York State at Axton. But Cornell gained insufficient funds from the relationship to fully replant the clear-cut areas. Most of the non-native conifer species that were planted, such as [[Norway spruce]], did not do well for years, with a denuded area resulting.\n\nThe demonstration forest, near Saranac Lake, drew heated opposition from neighboring land owners.<ref name=donald>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0L8LAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=Brooklyn+Cooperage+Company%5D&source=bl&ots=3FNnwghrFu&sig=aVmNAw0naLbeOJqb9l1Gyk4E0Eo&hl=en&ei=QpejSuORNoTYsQOvlImNDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2#v=onepage&q=Brooklyn%20Cooperage%20Company%5D&f=false|title=''A history of the Adirondacks, Volume 2''|first=Alfred Lee|last=Donaldson|pages=202\u2013207|publisher=Century Co|year=1921}}</ref> Smoke from the burning of brush and logging slash, along with Fernow's disposition toward landowners from nearby Saranac Lake further alienated the public.<ref>Gove, B. 2005.

In its findings, the commission concluded that \"the college has exceeded the original intention of the State when the tract was granted the university for conducting [[Silviculture|silvicultural]] experiments.\"<ref name=\"Christopher 2002. p 31\">Christopher, Angus. 2002.

In his statement, Governor Odell said: \"The operations of the College of Forestry have been subjected to grave criticism, as they have practically denuded the forest lands of the State without compensating benefits. I deem it wise therefore to withhold approval of this item until a more scientific and more reasonable method is pursued in the forestry of the lands now under the control of Cornell University.\"<ref>Lincoln, Charles Z. ed., ''Messages from the Governors'', vol.

Despite the bad news, the dance went on. Fernow and the forestry students offered to carry on the school. However, Cornell's Board of Trustees and President Schurman, despite Bailey's urgings to the contrary, decided to close the doors of the Forestry College. In June, 1903, instruction in the College ceased and the faculty was dismissed.<ref>Rodgers, p. 371.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Cornell Fernow Hall September 2008.jpg|300px|thumb|left|alt=Fernow Hall, Cornell text|Fernow Hall, Cornell University]]\n\n==Forestry Studies continue at Cornell==\n{{See also|New York State College of Forestry at Cornell}}\nForestry continued at Cornell,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/bailey/cornellag/cornellag_9.html |title=Liberty Hyde Bailey - A Man for All Seasons |publisher=Rmc.library.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}</ref> \nwith Dean [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] adding a Department of Forestry to the [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell University]] in 1910\u201311.

Brooklyn Cooperage Co.}}\nThe fledgling college of forestry soon became mired in controversy, centered around [[Bernhard Fernow|Fernow's]] management of the forest lands given to Cornell by the state \"for experiments in forestry\". Soon after his appointment as Dean, Fernow moved quickly to establish a [[demonstration forest]] on the {{convert|30000|acre|km2}} of land in the [[Adirondack Park|Adirondack forests]] acquired by Cornell with the authorization for the new college. The site was near Axton, New York, location of an old lumber settlement originally called Axe-town, in [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]].\n\nFernow's plan called for [[clearcutting]] the tract at the rate of several thousand acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with the [[Brookyn Cooperage Company]] for the project to be viable. Under terms of the contract, the firm was to take the logs and [[cordwood]] from the forest land for a 15-year period. (In the 1890s, the more valuable [[red spruce]] trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods.) Fernow had a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}}-long railroad spur built from Axton to [[Tupper Lake, New York|Tupper Lake]] in order to deliver logs to the company's facility. The firm turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into [[methanol]] and [[charcoal]], through a process called [[destructive distillation]].\n\nThe contract proved to be profitable and beneficial for the company only. To his credit, Fernow established the first [[tree nursery]] in New York State at Axton. But Cornell gained insufficient funds from the relationship to fully replant the clear-cut areas. Most of the non-native conifer species that were planted, such as [[Norway spruce]], did not do well for years, with a denuded area resulting.\n\nThe demonstration forest, near Saranac Lake, drew heated opposition from neighboring land owners.<ref name=donald>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0L8LAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=Brooklyn+Cooperage+Company%5D&source=bl&ots=3FNnwghrFu&sig=aVmNAw0naLbeOJqb9l1Gyk4E0Eo&hl=en&ei=QpejSuORNoTYsQOvlImNDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2#v=onepage&q=Brooklyn%20Cooperage%20Company%5D&f=false|title=''A history of the Adirondacks, Volume 2''|first=Alfred Lee|last=Donaldson|pages=202\u2013207|publisher=Century Co|year=1921}}</ref> Smoke from the burning of brush and logging slash, along with Fernow's disposition toward landowners from nearby Saranac Lake further alienated the public.<ref>Gove, B. 2005.

In his statement, Governor Odell said: \"The operations of the College of Forestry have been subjected to grave criticism, as they have practically denuded the forest lands of the State without compensating benefits.

In 1910, Marshall became a [[Syracuse University]] Trustee and confided in Syracuse University Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James R. Day]] his desire to have a forestry school at the University. Marshall was designated by his fellow trustees to lobby Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes|Charles E. Hughes]] towards such an end:\n\n:...one of the greatest duties of State and National Governments is that of conserving our natural resources. First among these are our forests... there is no greater subject as to which there is more widespread ignorance, than that of forest conservation and the planting of forests.... The State of New York... is the owner of millions of acres of forest lands which are in constant jeopardy, and which is beginning to suffer the consequences of the evils of deforestation... [The State] is under an imperative duty to ... call a halt to the wild rage for destruction which seems to grow by what it feeds upon.... If the bill should become a law, it is the intention of the Board of Trustees of Syracuse University to select ... a number of gentlemen who are enthusiastic in their desire to further the great cause of forest conservation...<ref>Marshall, Louis.

In 1972, with burgeoning public interest in [[environmental education]], the College's name was changed again, to the [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry]] (SUNY-ESF). Today, the college retains a close relationship with [[Syracuse University]], but is autonomous, unlike some other state-supported colleges at private institutions in New York state. ESF students not only take courses, enroll in concurrent degree programs, and enjoy other benefits of the college's association with Syracuse University, but also may take courses at Cornell's state-funded colleges, and at the SUNY [[Upstate Medical University]].\n\n==Postwar boom==\nAccording to Greene and Barron, \"By 1960, the college had become the largest forestry school in the country, with an enrollment exceeding seven hundred students\".<ref>Greene and Barron, p. 107.</ref>\n\n==The resuscitation of the American chestnut==\nThe [[United States Forest Service]] had declared the [[American chestnut]] dead and advised cutting any trees having salvageable lumber.<ref>Freinkel, Susan.

This view was widely rejected by medieval scholars, but has found some acceptance in modern times.<ref name=EoQ/>\n\n===== Cupbearers in paradise =====\n\nSome Quranic verses describing the paradise refer to \"immortal boys\" (56:17, 76:19) or \"young men\" (52:24) who serve [[Wine#Islam|wine]] to the [[Blessing#Islam|blessed]].

This doctrine contains a passage by the scholar and hadith collector [[An-Nawawi]]:<blockquote>A mukhannath is the one (\"male\") who carries in his movements, in his appearance and in his language the characteristics of a woman. There are two types; the first is the one in whom these characteristics are innate, he did not put them on by himself, and therein is no guilt, no blame and no shame, as long as he does not perform any (illicit) act or exploit it for money (prostitution etc.).

Before that time, Ottoman societal norms accepted homoerotic relations as normal, despite condemnation of homosexuality by religious scholars. The Ottoman Sultanic law (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') tended to equalize the treatment of hetero- and homosexuals. Dream interpretation literature accepted homosexuality as natural, and ''[[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat|karagoz]]'', the principal character of popular puppet theater, engaged in both active and passive gay sex. However, in the 19th century, Ottoman society started to be influenced by European ideas about sexuality as well as the criticism leveled at the Ottoman society by European authors for its sexual and gender norms, including homosexuality. This criticism associated the weakness of the Ottoman state and corruption of the Ottoman government with Ottoman sexual corruption. By the 1850s, these ideas were prompting embarrassment and self-censorship among the Ottoman public regarding traditional attitudes toward sex in general and homosexuality in particular. Dream interpretation literature declined, the puppet theater was purged of its coarser elements, and homoeroticism began to be regarded as abnormal and shameful.}}</ref> In [[Iran]], several hundred political opponents were executed in the aftermath of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]] on accusations of homosexuality, and homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in Iran's ''Islamic Penal Code'', enacted in 1991.

Imam Muhsin Hendricks is also considered as the world's first openly queer Imam.  His activism grew since then and the organization became public in 1998.  It soon grew into an international organization with annual international retreats of up to 120 international delegates meeting annually in Cape Town to discuss issues pertaining to LGBTIQ Muslims.  In 2018 after having served the organization for 20 years her resigned after detecting corruption in the organization and being maliciously and wrongfully accused of mismanagement of funds.  He, along with other queer Muslims who left the old Al-Fitrah Foundation founded a new organization in 2018 called Al-Ghurbaah Foundation. Imam Muhsin Hendricks also administers the Compassion-centred Islamic Network (CCI Network) which is a global network that seeks to connect and create a stronger voice for queer Muslims amongst activists, academics, Islamic scholars and religious leaders (Imams).  Currently, the organization's main focus is working with religious leaders (Imams) while serving the needs of the queer Muslim community globally.

Before that time, Ottoman societal norms accepted homoerotic relations as normal, despite condemnation of homosexuality by religious scholars. The Ottoman Sultanic law (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') tended to equalize the treatment of hetero- and homosexuals. Dream interpretation literature accepted homosexuality as natural, and ''[[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat|karagoz]]'', the principal character of popular puppet theater, engaged in both active and passive gay sex. However, in the 19th century, Ottoman society started to be influenced by European ideas about sexuality as well as the criticism leveled at the Ottoman society by European authors for its sexual and gender norms, including homosexuality. This criticism associated the weakness of the Ottoman state and corruption of the Ottoman government with Ottoman sexual corruption. By the 1850s, these ideas were prompting embarrassment and self-censorship among the Ottoman public regarding traditional attitudes toward sex in general and homosexuality in particular. Dream interpretation literature declined, the puppet theater was purged of its coarser elements, and homoeroticism began to be regarded as abnormal and shameful.}}</ref> In [[Iran]], several hundred political opponents were executed in the aftermath of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]] on accusations of homosexuality, and homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in Iran's ''Islamic Penal Code'', enacted in 1991.

Imam Muhsin Hendricks is also considered as the world's first openly queer Imam.  His activism grew since then and the organization became public in 1998.  It soon grew into an international organization with annual international retreats of up to 120 international delegates meeting annually in Cape Town to discuss issues pertaining to LGBTIQ Muslims.  In 2018 after having served the organization for 20 years her resigned after detecting corruption in the organization and being maliciously and wrongfully accused of mismanagement of funds.  He, along with other queer Muslims who left the old Al-Fitrah Foundation founded a new organization in 2018 called Al-Ghurbaah Foundation. Imam Muhsin Hendricks also administers the Compassion-centred Islamic Network (CCI Network) which is a global network that seeks to connect and create a stronger voice for queer Muslims amongst activists, academics, Islamic scholars and religious leaders (Imams).  Currently, the organization's main focus is working with religious leaders (Imams) while serving the needs of the queer Muslim community globally.  Al-Ghurbaah Foundation also runs an inclusive mosque called Masjidul Ghurbaah which is open to anyone who wants to connect spiritually regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or belief.\n\n\n* In November 2012, a prayer room was set up in Paris by gay Islamic scholar and founder of the group 'Homosexual Muslims of France' [[Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed]]. It was described by the press as the first gay-friendly mosque in Europe. The reaction from the rest of the Muslim community in France has been mixed.

Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]]. Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages ([[Burgher arms]]). Specific traditions of [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] also develop in the late medieval period. Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to [[municipal coats of arms]] by the 16th century.\n\nWestern heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nWith the decline of European monarchies in favour of [[Republicanism]] in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern [[national flag]]s and [[national emblem]]s adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition.\n\n==Current practice==\n[[File:1952 Trygve Lie Resigns.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Escutcheons]] in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] hall, on which the national arms were to be rendered<ref>https://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/704/0070477.html</ref>]]\nHeraldry flourishes in the modern world; institutions, companies, and private persons continue using coats of arms as their pictorial identification.

Heraldry aficionados participate in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], medieval revivals, [[micronation]]s and other related projects. Modern armigers use heraldry to express ancestral and personal heritage as well as professional, academic, civic, and national pride. Little is left of class identification in modern heraldry, where the emphasis is more than ever on expression of identity.<ref>{{harvp|Slater|2003|p=238}}</ref>\n\nHeraldry continues to build on its rich tradition in [[academia]], [[government]], guilds and [[professional associations]], religious institutions, and the military. Nations and their subdivisions \u2013 provinces, states, counties, cities, etc. \u2013 continue to build on the traditions of civic heraldry. The [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, and other religious institutions maintain the traditions of [[ecclesiastical heraldry]] for clergy, religious orders, and schools.\n\nMany of these institutions have begun to employ blazons representing modern objects unknown in the medieval world. For example, some heraldic symbols issued by the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] incorporate symbols such as guns, airplanes, or locomotives. Some scientific institutions incorporate symbols of modern science such as the [[Symbol (chemistry)|atom]] or particular scientific instruments. The arms of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] uses traditional heraldic symbols to depict the harnessing of atomic power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=CUdMRj7qOr8C&pg=PA21&dq=atom+symbol+in+heraldry&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihiN2D48XTAhVB_IMKHa4CClwQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&q=atom%20symbol%20in%20heraldry&f=false|title=Heraldic Design: A Handbook for Students|last=Child|first=Heather|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=9780806300719|language=en}}</ref> Locations with strong associations to particular industries may incorporate associated symbols. The coat of arms of [[Stenungsund Municipality]] in Sweden, pictured right, incorporates a hydrocarbon molecule, alluding to the historical significance of the petrochemical industry in the region.\n\nHeraldry in countries with heraldic authorities continues to be regulated generally by [[Law of heraldic arms|laws]] granting rights to arms and recognizing possession of arms as well as protecting against their misuse. Countries without heraldic authorities usually treat coats of arms as creative property in the manner of [[logo]]s, offering protection under [[copyright law]]s. This is the case in [[Nigerian heraldry|Nigeria]], where most of the components of its heraldic system are otherwise unregulated.\n\nAmong the states ruled by communist regimes, emblems [[Socialist heraldry|resembling the Soviet design]] were adopted in all the [[Warsaw Pact]] states except [[Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and Poland and [[Karelia]]. Since 1989, some of the ex-[[Communist state]]s, as [[Coat of arms of Romania|Romania]] or [[Coat of arms of Russia|Russia]] have reused their original pre-communist heraldry, often with only the symbols of monarchy removed. Other countries such as [[National emblem of Belarus|Belarus]] and [[Emblem of Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] have retained their communist coats of arms or at least kept some of the old heraldry.\n\nWith the independence of the modern nation states of the [[Arab World]] from the First World War onwards, European traditions of heraldry were partially adopted for state emblems. These emblems often involve the [[star and crescent]] symbol taken from the [[Ottoman flag]].\nOther commonly seen symbols are birds, chiefly the [[Eagle of Saladin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/egyptianstudies/2011/05/04/coat-of-arms/|title=Coat of Arms (Eagle of Saladin)|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2015|publisher=Macaulay Honors College}}</ref> and the [[Hawk of Quraish]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} These symbols can be found on the [[Coat of Arms of Egypt]], and [[Coat of Arms of Syria|Syria]], amongst others.\n\n[[Coats of arms and emblems of Africa|Sub-Saharan African flags and emblems]] after [[decolonisation]] often chose emblems based on regional traditions or wildlife. Symbols of a ritual significance according to local custom were generally favoured, such as the [[leopard]] in the arms of [[Benin]], [[Malawi]], [[Somalia]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and, in the form of the black panther, of [[Gabon]].\n\nIn [[Kenya]], the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word [[Harambee]] (lit. \"Let us come together\") is used as a motto in the country's coat of arms. In [[Botswana]] and [[Lesotho]], meanwhile, the word [[Botswana Pula|Pula]] (lit. \"Rain\") is used in like fashion.\n\nIn the coat of arms of [[Swaziland]], a [[lion]] and an [[elephant]] serve as supporters. They are each intended to represent the king and the queen mother respectively, the nation's joint heads of state.\n\n===Variations===\n==== Depending on category of armiger ====\n* [[National coat of arms|National]]\n** [[Arms of dominion|Dominion]]\n** [[Civic heraldry|Civic]]\n* [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|Ecclesiastical]]\n** [[Papal armorial|Papal]]\n* [[Burgher arms|Burgher]]\n* [[Women in heraldry|Female]]\n* [[Attributed arms|Attributed]]\n*[[Arms of alliance|Alliance]]\n*[[Heraldic courtesy|Courtesy]]\n*[[Naval heraldry|Naval]]\n*[[Jewish heraldry|Jewish]]\n\n====Depending on geography====\n{{Main|National heraldic styles}}\nThe emergence of heraldry occurred across [[western Europe]] almost simultaneously in the various countries. Originally, heraldic style was very similar from country to country.<ref>Davies, T. R. (Spring 1976). \"Did National Heraldry Exist?\". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''NS II''' (97): 16.</ref> Over time, heraldic tradition diverged into four broad styles: German-Nordic, Gallo-British, Latin, and Eastern.<ref>{{harvp|von Warnstedt|1970|p=128}}</ref> In addition it can be argued that newer national heraldic traditions, such as [[South Africa]]n and Canadian, have emerged in the 20th century.<ref>Alan Beddoe, revised by Strome Galloway. ''Beddoe's Canadian Heraldry''. (Mika Publishing Company, Belleville: 1981).</ref>\n\n==General concepts==\nThese general concepts apply for armorial bearings and, in practice to a lesser extent, [[vexillology]].\n\n===Blazon===\n{{Main|Blazon}}\nTo \"blazon\" arms means to describe them using the formal language of heraldry. This language has its own vocabulary and [[syntax]], or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. The verb comes from the [[Middle English]] ''blasoun'', itself a derivative of the French ''blason'' meaning \"shield\". The system of [[blazon]]ing arms used in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries today was developed by heraldic officers in the [[Middle Ages]]. The blazon includes a description of the arms contained within the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] or shield, the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] where present, [[motto]] and other insignia. Complex rules, such as the [[rule of tincture]], apply to the physical and artistic form of newly created arms, and a thorough understanding of these rules is essential to the art of heraldry. Though heraldic forms initially were broadly similar across Europe, several national styles had developed by the end of the [[Middle Ages]], and artistic and blazoning styles today range from the very simple to extraordinarily complex.\n\nThe [[blazon]] is the formal description of the escutcheon, and may also be extended to describe the other devices in the achievement. The blazon of the escutcheon may traditionally also be used to decorate [[Banner of arms|banners]], [[Mantle and pavilion (heraldry)|mantles]], garments ([[surcoat]]s, [[tabard]]s, [[robe]]s and [[caparison]]s), furniture and structural elements.\n\n===Tinctures===\n{{Main|Tincture (heraldry)}}\n[[File:Heraldic tincture.jpg|thumb|Coloured and monochrome [[Hatching (heraldry)|hatched]] version of heraldic devices]]\nOne of the most distinctive qualities of heraldry is the use of a limited palette of colours and patterns, usually referred to as [[tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]].  These are divided into three categories, known as ''metals'', ''colours'', and ''furs''.{{efn-lr|Technically, the word ''tincture'' applies specifically to the colours, rather than to the metals or the furs; but for lack of another term including all three, it is regularly used in this extended sense.}}<ref>{{harvp|Fox-Davies|1909|p=70}}</ref>\n\n{{Tinctures}}\n\n===Differencing and cadency===\n{{Main|Cadency}}\nCadency is any systematic way to distinguish [[Coat of arms|arms]] displayed by [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s of the holder of a [[coat of arms]] when those family members have not been granted arms in their own right.  Cadency is necessary in heraldic systems in which a given design may be owned by only one person at any time, generally the head of the senior line of a particular family.  As an [[armiger]]'s arms may be used 'by courtesy', either by children or spouses, while they are still living, some form of differencing may be required so as not to confuse them with the original ''undifferenced'' or \"plain coat\" arms. Historically, arms were only heritable by males and therefore cadency marks had no relevance to daughters; in the modern era, Canadian and Irish heraldry include daughters in cadency. These differences are formed by adding to the arms small and inconspicuous marks called ''brisures'', similar to [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]]s but smaller. They are placed on the [[Fess|fess-point]], or [[chief (heraldry)|in-chief]] in the case of the label.<ref name=\"Britannica-11-p704\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 9th edition (1884), vol. 11, p. 704</ref> Brisures are generally exempt from the [[rule of tincture]]. One of the best examples of usage from the medieval period is shown on the seven Beauchamp cadets in the stained-glass windows of [[Collegiate_Church_of_St_Mary,_Warwick|St Mary's Church]], Warwick.<ref name=\"Britannica-11-p704\" />\n\n===Roll of arms===\n{{Main|Roll of arms}}\n[[File:Hyghalmen Roll Late 1400s.jpg|thumb|upright|The German ''[[Hyghalmen Roll]]'' was made in the late 15th century and illustrates the German practice of repeating themes from the arms in the crest. (See [[Roll of arms]]).]]\nA roll of arms (or armorial) is a collection of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], usually consisting of rows of painted pictures of shields, each shield accompanied by the name of the person bearing the arms.\n\nThe oldest extant armorials date to the mid 13th century, and armorial manuscripts continued to be produced throughout the [[Early Modern period]].\n''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' of 1605 was an early instance of a printed armorial. Medieval armorials usually include a few hundred coats of arms, in the late medieval period sometimes up to some 2,000. In the early modern period,  the larger armorials develop into encyclopedic projects, with the  ''Armorial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de France'' (1696), commissioned by [[Louis XIV of France]], listing more than 125,000 coats of arms. In the modern period, the tradition develops into projects of heraldic dictionaries edited in multiple volumes, such as the ''Dictionary of British Arms''  in four volumes (1926\u20132009), or ''J. Siebmacher's gro\u00dfes Wappenbuch'' in seven volumes (1854\u20131967).\n\nArmorials can be \"occasional\", relating to a specific event such as a tournament; \"institutional\", associated with foundations, such as that of an [[order of chivalry]], \"regional\", collecting the arms of the nobility of a given region, \"illustrative\", in the context of a specific narrative or chronicle, or \"general\", with the aim of an encyclopedic collection.<ref>''A New Dictionary of Heraldry'', 1987</ref>\nA roll of arms arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical [[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinaries]] and [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]]) grouped together as a tool to aid identification, is known as an [[ordinary of arms]] (or simply as an ordinary).\n\n===Armiger===\n{{Main|Armiger}}\nAn armiger is a person entitled to use a [[achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]] (e.g., bear arms, an \"armour-bearer\") either by hereditary right, grant, matriculation, or assumption of arms. Such a person is said to be ''armigerous''. A [[family]] or a [[clan]] likewise.\n\nThe Latin word ''armiger'' literally means \"arms-bearer\". In high and late medieval England, the word referred to an [[esquire]] attendant upon a [[knight]], but bearing his own unique armorial device. <ref>''Dictionary of Chivalry'', Uden. Kestrel Books, Harmondsworth, 1968. {{ISBN|0-7226-5372-7}}</ref>\n\n''Armiger'' was also used as a Latin [[cognomen]], and is now found as a rare surname in English-speaking countries.\n\nToday, the term ''armiger'' is well-defined only within jurisdictions, such as [[Canada]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where heraldry is regulated by the state or a heraldic body, such as the [[College of Arms]], the [[Chief Herald of Canada]], the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] or the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland]]. A person can be so entitled either by proven (and typically [[agnatic]]) descent from a person with a right to bear a [[heraldic achievement]], or by virtue of a grant of arms to himself. Merely sharing the same family name of an armiger is insufficient.\n\nMost of the time, the usage of a heraldic achievement is governed by legal restrictions; these restrictions are independent of the copyright status and independent of a coat of arms depiction. A coat of arms represents its owner. Though it can be freely represented, it cannot be appropriated, or used in such a way as to create a confusion with or a prejudice to its owner.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], titles of nobility are regulated by law but heraldry is not. In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] the nobility has had, since 1762, the prerogative to use an open helmet, while others use a closed helmet.\n\n==Devices==\nThis section describes the various '''heraldic devices''', also referred to as '''armory''' or '''armorial bearings''', that an armiger may be granted. This always includes an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], and may also include external devices, if posessed.\n\nThe term ('''coat of''') '''arms''' technically refers to the ([[blazon]] of the) escutcheon, but the phrase is commonly used to refer to the entire ('''armorial'''/'''heraldic''') '''achievement''' ('''of arms'''), i.e. full display of armorial devices.<ref>{{ Citation\n | last1=Boutell\n | first1=Charles \n | last2=Charles Fox-Davies\n | first2=Arthur \n | lastauthoramp=yes\n | title=The handbook to English heraldry\n | publisher=Reeves & Turner\n | place=\n | volume=\n | edition=\n | year=1914\n | quote=Achievement, or Achievement of Arms.

Many ancient armorial bearings consist of nothing else.\n\nThe word is used in two related senses. First, as the shield on which a [[coat of arms]] is displayed; second, a shield can itself be a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] within a coat of arms.\n\nEscutcheon shapes are derived from actual shields used by [[knight]]s in combat, and thus are varied and developed by region and by era. As this shape has been regarded as a war-like device appropriate to men only, British ladies customarily bear their arms upon a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]], or diamond-shape, while clergymen and ladies in continental Europe bear theirs on a [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]], or oval. Other shapes are in use, such as the [[roundel (heraldry)|roundel]] commonly used for arms granted to [[Aboriginal Canadians]] by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] or the [[Nguni shield]] used in [[Coats of arms and emblems of Africa|African heraldry]].\n\nThough it can be used as a charge on its own, the most common use of an escutcheon charge is to display another coat of arms as a form of [[Heraldry#Marshalling|marshalling]]. These escutcheons are usually given the same shape as the main shield. When there is only one such shield, it is sometimes called an ''inescutcheon''.\n\n===Externally, if possessed===\nFrom a very early date, illustrations of arms were frequently embellished with [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] placed above the shields.  These in turn came to be decorated with fan-shaped or sculptural crests, often incorporating elements from the shield of arms; as well as a wreath or [[torse]], or sometimes a [[coronet]], from which depended the lambrequin or [[mantling]]. To these elements, modern heraldry often adds a [[motto]] displayed on a ribbon, typically below the shield. The helmet is borne of right, and forms no part of a grant of arms; it may be assumed without authority by anyone entitled to bear arms, together with mantling and whatever motto the armiger may desire. The crest, however, together with the torse or coronet from which it arises, must be granted or confirmed by the relevant heraldic authority.<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\">{{harvp|Fox-Davies|1909|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\nIf the bearer is entitled to the ribbon, collar, or badge of a knightly order, it may encircle or depend from the shield. Some arms, particularly those of the nobility, are further embellished with supporters, heraldic figures standing alongside or behind the shield; often these stand on a [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]], typically a mound of earth and grass, on which other [[heraldic badge|badges]], symbols, or [[heraldic flag|heraldic banners]] may be displayed.  The most elaborate achievements sometimes display the entire coat of arms beneath a pavilion, an embellished tent or canopy of the type associated with the medieval tournament.,<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\"/> though this is only very rarely found in English or Scots achievements.\n\nTypes of accompanying, external devices are listed below.\n\n====Helm/crest/''galero''====\n{{Main|Helmet (heraldry)|Crest (heraldry)|Galero}}\n[[File:Cavalieredicasata.JPG|thumb|upright|A knight with an eagle crest at the [[Saracen Joust]] in [[Arezzo]], Tuscany.]]\nThe helmet or ''helm'' is situated above the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and bears the [[torse]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]. The style of helmet displayed varies according to [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|rank]] and [[social status]], and these styles developed over time, in step with the development of actual military [[Helmet|helmets]].<ref>[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 202.</ref><ref name=\"FD303\">[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], p. 303.</ref> In some traditions, especially [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German and Nordic heraldry]], two or three helmets (and sometimes more) may be used in a single [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement of arms]], each representing a [[fief]] to which the bearer has a right.  For this reason, the helmets and crests in German and Nordic arms are considered to be essential to the coat of arms and are never separated from it.\n\nOpen-visored or barred helmets are typically reserved to the highest ranks of nobility, while lesser nobility and [[burgher arms|burghers]] typically assume closed helms.<ref name=\"FD303\" /> While these classifications remained relatively constant, the specific forms of all these helmets varied and evolved over time.<ref name=\"FD303\" /> \n\nIn [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], bishops and other [[clergy]] use a [[mitre]] or other rank-appropriate ecclesiastical hat in place of a helmet.<ref>[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 75.</ref>\n\nIn [[English language|English]] the word \"crest\" is commonly (but erroneously) used to refer to an entire heraldic achievement of armorial bearings. The technical use of the heraldic term [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] refers to just one component of a complete achievement. The crest rests on top of a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] which itself rests on the most important part of the achievement: the shield.\n\nThe modern crest has grown out of the three-dimensional figure placed on the top of the mounted knights' helms as a further means of identification. In most heraldic traditions, a woman does not display a crest, though this tradition is being relaxed in some heraldic jurisdictions, and the stall plate of Lady Marion Fraser in the Thistle Chapel in St Giles, Edinburgh, shows her coat on a lozenge but with helmet, crest, and motto.\n\nThe crest is usually found on a [[torse|wreath]] of twisted cloth and sometimes within a [[coronet]]. Crest-coronets are generally simpler than coronets of rank, but several specialized forms exist; for example, in [[Canada]], descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s are entitled to use a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others).\n\nWhen the helm and crest are shown, they are usually accompanied by a [[mantling]]. This was originally a cloth worn over the back of the helmet as partial protection against heating by sunlight. Today it takes the form of a stylized cloak hanging from the helmet.<ref>{{harvp|Gwynn-Jones|1998|p=124}}</ref> Typically in British heraldry, the outer surface of the mantling is of the principal colour in the shield and the inner surface is of the principal metal, though peers in the United Kingdom use standard colourings (Gules doubled Argent \u2013 Red/White) regardless of rank or the colourings of their arms. The mantling is sometimes conventionally depicted with a ragged edge, as if damaged in combat, though the edges of most are simply decorated at the emblazoner's discretion.\n\nClergy often refrain from displaying a helm or crest in their [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|heraldic achievements]]. Members of the clergy may display appropriate headwear. This often takes the form of a small crowned, wide brimmed hat called a [[galero]] with the colours and tassels denoting rank; or, in the case of [[Papal coats of arms]] until the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005, an elaborate triple crown known as a [[tiara]]. Benedict broke with tradition to substitute a [[mitre]] in [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|his arms]]. Orthodox and Presbyterian clergy do sometimes adopt other forms of head gear to ensign their shields. In the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, clergy members may pass crests on to their offspring, but rarely display them on their own shields.\n\n====Mottoes and slogans====\n{{Main|Motto|Slogan (heraldry)}}\nAn armorial [[motto]] is a phrase or collection of words intended to describe the motivation or intention of the armigerous person or corporation. This can form a pun on the family name as in [[Thomas Nevile]]'s motto ''Ne vile velis''. Mottoes are generally changed at will and do not make up an integral part of the armorial achievement. Mottoes can typically be found on a scroll under the shield. In [[Scottish heraldry]], where the motto is granted as part of the [[blazon]], it is usually shown on a scroll above the crest, and may not be changed at will. A motto may be in any language.\n\n====Supporters====\n{{Main|Supporter}}\n[[File:App0084.jpg|thumb|upright|A lion supporting the [[Symbols of Brussels|arms of the City of Brussels]]]]\n[[Supporters]] are human or animal figures or, very rarely, inanimate objects, usually placed on either side of a coat of arms as though supporting it. In many traditions, these have acquired strict guidelines for use by certain social classes. On the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], there are often fewer restrictions on the use of supporters.<ref>{{harvp|Neubecker|1976|pp=186}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, only [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]], a few baronets, senior members of orders of knighthood, and some corporate bodies are granted supporters. Often, these can have local significance or a historical link to the armiger.\n\n====Crown/coronet====\n{{Main|Crown (heraldry)|Coronet}}\nIf the armiger has the title of [[baron]], hereditary [[knight]], or higher, he may display a coronet of rank above the shield. In the United Kingdom, this is shown between the shield and helmet, though it is often above the crest in Continental heraldry.\n\n====Order====\n{{Main|Order (distinction)}}\nAnother addition that can be made to a coat of arms is the insignia of a baronet or of an order of knighthood. This is usually represented by a collar or similar band surrounding the shield. When the arms of a knight and his wife are shown in one achievement, the insignia of knighthood surround the husband's arms only, and the wife's arms are customarily surrounded by an ornamental garland of leaves for visual balance.<ref>Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest''. (MacGibbon & Kee, London: 1960), 358.</ref>\n\n==== Banners ====\n{{Main|Heraldic flag|Banner of arms}}\n[[File:Banners of Knights of the Thistle.jpg|thumb|upright|Banners of [[Knights of the Thistle]] displayed in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]]]\n[[Flag]]s are used to identify ships (where they are called [[ensign]]s), embassies and such, and they use the same [[Tincture (heraldry)|colors]] and designs found in heraldry, but they are not usually considered to be heraldic. A country may have both a [[national flag]] and a national coat of arms, and the two may not look alike at all. For example, the [[flag of Scotland]] (St Andrew's Cross) has a white [[saltire]] on a blue [[field (heraldry)|field]], but the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms of Scotland]] has a red lion within a double [[wiktionary:tressure|tressure]] on a [[Or (heraldry)|gold (or)]] field.\n\n==== Compartment ====\n{{Main|Compartment (heraldry)}}\nA compartment is a design placed under the [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]], usually rocks, a grassy mount (''mount vert''), or some sort of other landscape upon which the [[supporters]] are depicted as standing.{{sfn|Woodcock|Robinson|1990|p=106}} Care must be taken to distinguish true compartments from items upon which supporters are merely resting one or more feet, or, sometimes, mere heraldic badges or pure decoration under the shield, and, conversely, care must also be taken in very unusual cases such as the [[coat of arms of Belize]], in which what may be taken to be a crest, the mahogany tree rising above the shield, is really part of the compartment.  It is sometimes said to represent the land held by the bearer.  As an official part of the blazon it is a comparatively late feature of heraldry, often derived from the need to have different supporters for different families or entities, although sometimes the compartment is treated in the [[blazon]] separately from the supporters.\n\n====Mantling====\n{{Main|Mantling}}\nMantling or \"lambrequin\" (its name in French) is drapery tied to the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] above the shield. In paper heraldry it is a depiction of the protective cloth covering (often of [[linen]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=8827 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] \u2013 Mantling</ref>) worn by [[knight]]s from their helmets to stave off the elements, and, secondarily, to decrease the effects of sword-blows against the helmet in battle, from which it is usually shown tattered or cut to shreds; less often it is shown as an intact drape, principally in those cases where clergy use a helmet and mantling (to symbolise that, despite the perhaps contradictory presence of the helmet, they have not been involved in combat), although this is usually the artist's discretion and done for decorative rather than symbolic reasons.\n\nGenerally, mantling is blazoned ''mantled x, doubled'' [lined] ''y''; the cloth has two sides, one of a [[Tincture_(heraldry)#Colours|colour]] and the other of a [[Tincture_(heraldry)#Metals|metal]].

However, there have been other historical cultures which have used symbols and emblems to represent families or individuals, and in some cases these symbols have been adopted into Western heraldry. For example, the [[coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire]] incorporated the royal [[tughra]] as part of its [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], along with such traditional Western heraldic elements as the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]].\n\n====Greek symbols====\nAncient Greeks were among the first civilizations to use symbols consistently in order to identify a warrior, clan or a state.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The first record of a shield blazon is illustrated in [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''.\n\n====Mon====\n{{Main|Mon (emblem)}}\n{{nihongo|'''Mon'''|\u7d0b|}}, also {{nihongo|'''monsh\u014d'''|\u7d0b\u7ae0|}}, {{nihongo|'''mondokoro'''|\u7d0b\u6240|}}, and {{nihongo|'''kamon'''|\u5bb6\u7d0b|}}, are [[Japan]]ese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual or family. While ''mon'' is an encompassing term that may refer to any such device, ''kamon'' and ''mondokoro'' refer specifically to emblems used to identify a family.{{Elucidate|reason=This is the same as previously stated, so what is the difference with mon and monsh\u014d? |date=February 2016}} An authoritative ''mon'' reference compiles Japan's 241 general categories of ''mon'' based on structural resemblance (a single ''mon'' may belong to multiple categories), with 5116 distinct individual ''mon'' (it is however well acknowledged that there exist lost or obscure ''mon'' that are not in this compilation).<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u5bb6\u7d0b\u5927\u5168 |publisher={{lang|ja|\u68a7\u6850\u66f8\u9662}} |year=2004 |ISBN=434003102X}}</ref><ref>Some 6939 ''mon'' are [https://x181.secure.ne.jp/~x181007/kamon/goodslist.cgi listed here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028043638/http://x181.secure.ne.jp/~x181007/kamon/goodslist.cgi |date=2016-10-28 }}.</ref>\n\nThe devices are similar to the [[Heraldic badge|badges]] and [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] in European heraldic tradition, which likewise are used to identify individuals and families.  ''Mon'' are often referred to as [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]] in Western literature, another European heraldic device similar to the ''mon'' in function.\n\n====Socialist heraldry====\n{{Main|Socialist heraldry}}\n'''Socialist heraldry''', also called '''communist heraldry''', consists of emblems in a style typically adopted by [[communist state]]s and characterized by [[communist symbolism]]. Although commonly called ''[[coat of arms|coats of arms]]'', most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional heraldic sense and should therefore, in a strict sense, not be called arms at all.<ref name=\"von Volborth\">{{harvp|von Volborth|1981|page= 11}}</ref> Many communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of [[European heraldry]] in order to distance themselves from the [[monarchy|monarchies]] that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] was the first state to use socialist heraldry, beginning at its creation in 1922. The style became more widespread after [[World War II]], when many other communist states were established. Even a few non-socialist states have adopted the style, for various reasons\u2014usually because [[Wars of national liberation|communists had helped them to gain independence]]\u2014but also when no apparent connection to a Communist nation exists, such as the [[emblem of Italy]].<ref name=\"von Volborth\"/><ref name=\"von Volborth 1972\">{{cite book |last= von Volborth|first= Carl-Alexander|author-link1= Carl-Alexander von Volborth| date= 1972 | title= Alverdens heraldik i farver | language=Danish | others=Editor and translator from English to Danish: [[Sven Tito Achen]] | location= Copenhagen | publisher=Politikens Forlag |page= 158|isbn= 87 567 1685 0}}</ref> After the fall of the Soviet Union and the other communist states in Eastern Europe in 1989\u20131991, this style of heraldry was often abandoned for the old heraldic practices, with many (but not all) of the new governments reinstating the traditional heraldry that was previously cast aside.\n\n====Tamgas====\n{{Main|Tamga}}\nA '''tamga''' or '''tamgha''' \"stamp, seal\" ({{lang-mn|\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0433\u0430}}, [[turkic languages|Turkic:]] tamga) is an abstract [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] or [[Seal (emblem)|stamp]] used by [[Eurasian nomad]]ic peoples and by cultures influenced by them. The tamga was normally the emblem of a particular tribe, clan or family. They were common among the Eurasian nomads throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages (including [[Alans]], [[Mongols]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Turkic peoples]]). Similar \"tamga-like\" symbols were sometimes also adopted by sedentary peoples adjacent to the Pontic-Caspian steppe both in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]],<ref>Ottfried Neubecker.

One could also adopt the tamga of one's master or ruler, therefore signifying said master's patronage. Outside of denoting ownership, tamgas also possessed religious significance, and were used as [[talisman]]s to protect one from curses (it was believed that, as symbols of family, tamgas embodied the power of one's heritage). Tamgas depicted geometric shapes, images of animals, items, or [[glyph]]s. As they were usually inscribed using heavy and unwieldy instruments, such as knives or brands, and on different surfaces (meaning that their appearance could vary somewhat), tamgas were always simple and stylised, and needed to be laconic and easily recognisable.<ref>\u0422\u0410\u041c\u0413\u0410 (\u043a \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0430). \u0412.\u0421. \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0445, No 7, \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0440, 2001, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 75\u201386)</ref>\n\n====Tughras====\n{{Main|Tughra}}\n{{Further|Coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire}}\nEvery sultan of the Ottoman Empire had his own monogram, called the tughra, which served as a royal symbol. A coat of arms in the European heraldic sense was created in the late 19th century. Hampton Court requested from Ottoman Empire the coat of arms to be included in their collection. As the coat of arms had not been previously used in Ottoman Empire, it was designed after this request and the final design was adopted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II on April 17, 1882. It included two flags: the flag of the Ottoman Dynasty, which had a crescent and a star on red base, and the flag of the Islamic Caliph, which had three crescents on a green base.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book|ref=harv |last=Pimbley |first=Arthur Francis |year=1908 |title=Pimbley's dictionary of heraldry |publisher=Pimbley|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry}}\n* {{cite web\n| accessdate = 2011-05-16\n| publisher = An Tir College of Heralds\n| title = What is an Achievement?\n| quote = An 'achievement' is a full formal display of a coat of arms.\n| url = http://www.antirheralds.org/display/achievements/achievements.html\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110420025929/http://antirheralds.org/display/achievements/achievements.html\n| archivedate = 20 April 2011\n| url-status = dead\n| df = dmy-all\n}}\n\n; Books\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |author-link=Charles Boutell |last=Boutell |first=Charles |year=1890 |url = https://archive.org/details/heraldryancientm00boutrich |editor-first=S.

These five devices ([[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], [[tabard]], [[caparison]], [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]]/[[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] and [[Banner of arms|banner]]) are decorated with the same [[blazon]] ([[Charge (heraldry)|charges]]).]]\n\nHeraldry was developed in the European [[High Middle Ages]],<ref name=\"CGH 1\u201318\"/> closely associated with the [[Royal court|courtly]] culture of [[chivalry]], [[Latin Church|Latin Christianity]], the [[Crusades]], [[feudalism|feudal]] [[nobility|aristocracy]], and [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchy]] of the time. Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]]. Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages ([[Burgher arms]]). Specific traditions of [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] also develop in the late medieval period. Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to [[municipal coats of arms]] by the 16th century.\n\nWestern heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nWith the decline of European monarchies in favour of [[Republicanism]] in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern [[national flag]]s and [[national emblem]]s adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition.\n\n==Current practice==\n[[File:1952 Trygve Lie Resigns.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Escutcheons]] in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] hall, on which the national arms were to be rendered<ref>https://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/704/0070477.html</ref>]]\nHeraldry flourishes in the modern world; institutions, companies, and private persons continue using coats of arms as their pictorial identification. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the English [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]], Scotland's [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], and the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland|Chief Herald of Ireland]] continue making grants of arms.<ref>See the [http://college-of-arms.gov.uk/#newsletter College of Arms newsletter] for quarterly samplings of English grants and the [http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm Chief Herald of Ireland's webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004045906/http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm |date=2006-10-04 }} for recent Irish grants.</ref> There are heraldic authorities in [[Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|Canada]],<ref>See the [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/main.asp?lang=e Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada].</ref> South Africa, Spain, and Sweden that grant or register coats of arms. In [[South African heraldry|South Africa]], the right to armorial bearings is also determined by [[Roman Dutch law]], due to its origins as a 17th-century colony of the Netherlands.<ref>Cornelius Pama. ''Heraldry of South African families: coats of arms/crests/ancestry.'' (Balkema, Cape Town: 1972)</ref>\n\nHeraldic societies abound in Africa, Asia, Australasia, the Americas and Europe. Heraldry aficionados participate in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], medieval revivals, [[micronation]]s and other related projects. Modern armigers use heraldry to express ancestral and personal heritage as well as professional, academic, civic, and national pride. Little is left of class identification in modern heraldry, where the emphasis is more than ever on expression of identity.<ref>{{harvp|Slater|2003|p=238}}</ref>\n\nHeraldry continues to build on its rich tradition in [[academia]], [[government]], guilds and [[professional associations]], religious institutions, and the military. Nations and their subdivisions &ndash; provinces, states, counties, cities, etc. &ndash; continue to build on the traditions of civic heraldry. The [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, and other religious institutions maintain the traditions of [[ecclesiastical heraldry]] for clergy, religious orders, and schools.\n\nMany of these institutions have begun to employ blazons representing modern objects unknown in the medieval world. For example, some heraldic symbols issued by the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] incorporate symbols such as guns, airplanes, or locomotives. Some scientific institutions incorporate symbols of modern science such as the [[Symbol (chemistry)|atom]] or particular scientific instruments. The arms of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] uses traditional heraldic symbols to depict the harnessing of atomic power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=CUdMRj7qOr8C&pg=PA21&dq=atom+symbol+in+heraldry&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihiN2D48XTAhVB_IMKHa4CClwQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&q=atom%20symbol%20in%20heraldry&f=false|title=Heraldic Design: A Handbook for Students|last=Child|first=Heather|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=9780806300719|language=en}}</ref> Locations with strong associations to particular industries may incorporate associated symbols. The coat of arms of [[Stenungsund Municipality]] in Sweden, pictured right, incorporates a hydrocarbon molecule, alluding to the historical significance of the petrochemical industry in the region.\n\nHeraldry in countries with heraldic authorities continues to be regulated generally by [[Law of heraldic arms|laws]] granting rights to arms and recognizing possession of arms as well as protecting against their misuse. Countries without heraldic authorities usually treat coats of arms as creative property in the manner of [[logo]]s, offering protection under [[copyright law]]s. This is the case in [[Nigerian heraldry|Nigeria]], where most of the components of its heraldic system are otherwise unregulated.\n\nAmong the states ruled by communist regimes, emblems [[Socialist heraldry|resembling the Soviet design]] were adopted in all the [[Warsaw Pact]] states except [[Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and Poland and [[Karelia]]. Since 1989, some of the ex-[[Communist state]]s, as [[Coat of arms of Romania|Romania]] or [[Coat of arms of Russia|Russia]] have reused their original pre-communist heraldry, often with only the symbols of monarchy removed. Other countries such as [[National emblem of Belarus|Belarus]] and [[Emblem of Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] have retained their communist coats of arms or at least kept some of the old heraldry.\n\nWith the independence of the modern nation states of the [[Arab World]] from the First World War onwards, European traditions of heraldry were partially adopted for state emblems. These emblems often involve the [[star and crescent]] symbol taken from the [[Ottoman flag]].\nOther commonly seen symbols are birds, chiefly the [[Eagle of Saladin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/egyptianstudies/2011/05/04/coat-of-arms/|title=Coat of Arms (Eagle of Saladin)|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2015|publisher=Macaulay Honors College}}</ref> and the [[Hawk of Quraish]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} These symbols can be found on the [[Coat of Arms of Egypt]], and [[Coat of Arms of Syria|Syria]], amongst others.\n\n[[Coats of arms and emblems of Africa|Sub-Saharan African flags and emblems]] after [[decolonisation]] often chose emblems based on regional traditions or wildlife. Symbols of a ritual significance according to local custom were generally favoured, such as the [[leopard]] in the arms of [[Benin]], [[Malawi]], [[Somalia]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and, in the form of the black panther, of [[Gabon]].\n\nIn [[Kenya]], the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word [[Harambee]] (lit. \"Let us come together\") is used as a motto in the country's coat of arms. In [[Botswana]] and [[Lesotho]], meanwhile, the word [[Botswana Pula|Pula]] (lit. \"Rain\") is used in like fashion.\n\nIn the coat of arms of [[Swaziland]], a [[lion]] and an [[elephant]] serve as supporters. They are each intended to represent the king and the queen mother respectively, the nation's joint heads of state.\n\n===Variations===\n==== Depending on category of armiger ====\n* [[National coat of arms|National]]\n** [[Arms of dominion|Dominion]]\n** [[Civic heraldry|Civic]]\n* [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|Ecclesiastical]]\n** [[Papal armorial|Papal]]\n* [[Burgher arms|Burgher]]\n* [[Women in heraldry|Female]]\n* [[Attributed arms|Attributed]]\n*[[Arms of alliance|Alliance]]\n*[[Heraldic courtesy|Courtesy]]\n*[[Naval heraldry|Naval]]\n*[[Jewish heraldry|Jewish]]\n\n====Depending on geography====\n{{Main|National heraldic styles}}\nThe emergence of heraldry occurred across [[western Europe]] almost simultaneously in the various countries. Originally, heraldic style was very similar from country to country.<ref>Davies, T. R. (Spring 1976). \"Did National Heraldry Exist?\". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''NS II''' (97): 16.</ref> Over time, heraldic tradition diverged into four broad styles: German-Nordic, Gallo-British, Latin, and Eastern.<ref>{{harvp|von Warnstedt|1970|p=128}}</ref> In addition it can be argued that newer national heraldic traditions, such as [[South Africa]]n and Canadian, have emerged in the 20th century.<ref>Alan Beddoe, revised by Strome Galloway. ''Beddoe's Canadian Heraldry''. (Mika Publishing Company, Belleville: 1981).</ref>\n\n==General concepts==\nThese general concepts apply for armorial bearings and, in practice to a lesser extent, [[vexillology]].\n\n===Blazon===\n{{Main|Blazon}}\nTo \"blazon\" arms means to describe them using the formal language of heraldry. This language has its own vocabulary and [[syntax]], or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. The verb comes from the [[Middle English]] ''blasoun'', itself a derivative of the French ''blason'' meaning \"shield\". The system of [[blazon]]ing arms used in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries today was developed by heraldic officers in the [[Middle Ages]]. The blazon includes a description of the arms contained within the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] or shield, the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] where present, [[motto]] and other insignia. Complex rules, such as the [[rule of tincture]], apply to the physical and artistic form of newly created arms, and a thorough understanding of these rules is essential to the art of heraldry. Though heraldic forms initially were broadly similar across Europe, several national styles had developed by the end of the [[Middle Ages]], and artistic and blazoning styles today range from the very simple to extraordinarily complex.\n\nThe [[blazon]] is the formal description of the escutcheon, and may also be extended to describe the other devices in the achievement. The blazon of the escutcheon may traditionally also be used to decorate [[Banner of arms|banners]], [[Mantle and pavilion (heraldry)|mantles]], garments ([[surcoat]]s, [[tabard]]s, [[robe]]s and [[caparison]]s), furniture and structural elements.\n\n===Tinctures===\n{{Main|Tincture (heraldry)}}\n[[File:Heraldic tincture.jpg|thumb|Coloured and monochrome [[Hatching (heraldry)|hatched]] version of heraldic devices]]\nOne of the most distinctive qualities of heraldry is the use of a limited palette of colours and patterns, usually referred to as [[tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]].  These are divided into three categories, known as ''metals'', ''colours'', and ''furs''.{{efn-lr|Technically, the word ''tincture'' applies specifically to the colours, rather than to the metals or the furs; but for lack of another term including all three, it is regularly used in this extended sense.}}<ref>{{harvp|Fox-Davies|1909|p=70}}</ref>\n\n{{Tinctures}}\n\n===Differencing and cadency===\n{{Main|Cadency}}\nCadency is any systematic way to distinguish [[Coat of arms|arms]] displayed by [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s of the holder of a [[coat of arms]] when those family members have not been granted arms in their own right.  Cadency is necessary in heraldic systems in which a given design may be owned by only one person at any time, generally the head of the senior line of a particular family.  As an [[armiger]]'s arms may be used 'by courtesy', either by children or spouses, while they are still living, some form of differencing may be required so as not to confuse them with the original ''undifferenced'' or \"plain coat\" arms. Historically, arms were only heritable by males and therefore cadency marks had no relevance to daughters; in the modern era, Canadian and Irish heraldry include daughters in cadency. These differences are formed by adding to the arms small and inconspicuous marks called ''brisures'', similar to [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]]s but smaller. They are placed on the [[Fess|fess-point]], or [[chief (heraldry)|in-chief]] in the case of the label.<ref name=\"Britannica-11-p704\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 9th edition (1884), vol. 11, p. 704</ref> Brisures are generally exempt from the [[rule of tincture]]. One of the best examples of usage from the medieval period is shown on the seven Beauchamp cadets in the stained-glass windows of [[Collegiate_Church_of_St_Mary,_Warwick|St Mary's Church]], Warwick.<ref name=\"Britannica-11-p704\" />\n\n===Roll of arms===\n{{Main|Roll of arms}}\n[[File:Hyghalmen Roll Late 1400s.jpg|thumb|upright|The German ''[[Hyghalmen Roll]]'' was made in the late 15th century and illustrates the German practice of repeating themes from the arms in the crest. (See [[Roll of arms]]).]]\nA roll of arms (or armorial) is a collection of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], usually consisting of rows of painted pictures of shields, each shield accompanied by the name of the person bearing the arms.\n\nThe oldest extant armorials date to the mid 13th century, and armorial manuscripts continued to be produced throughout the [[Early Modern period]].\n''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' of 1605 was an early instance of a printed armorial. Medieval armorials usually include a few hundred coats of arms, in the late medieval period sometimes up to some 2,000. In the early modern period,  the larger armorials develop into encyclopedic projects, with the  ''Armorial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de France'' (1696), commissioned by [[Louis XIV of France]], listing more than 125,000 coats of arms. In the modern period, the tradition develops into projects of heraldic dictionaries edited in multiple volumes, such as the ''Dictionary of British Arms''  in four volumes (1926&ndash;2009), or ''J. Siebmacher's gro\u00dfes Wappenbuch'' in seven volumes (1854&ndash;1967).\n\nArmorials can be \"occasional\", relating to a specific event such as a tournament; \"institutional\", associated with foundations, such as that of an [[order of chivalry]], \"regional\", collecting the arms of the nobility of a given region, \"illustrative\", in the context of a specific narrative or chronicle, or \"general\", with the aim of an encyclopedic collection.<ref>''A New Dictionary of Heraldry'', 1987</ref>\nA roll of arms arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical [[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinaries]] and [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]]) grouped together as a tool to aid identification, is known as an [[ordinary of arms]] (or simply as an ordinary).\n\n===Armiger===\n{{Main|Armiger}}\nAn armiger is a person entitled to use a [[achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]] (e.g., bear arms, an \"armour-bearer\") either by hereditary right, grant, matriculation, or assumption of arms. Such a person is said to be ''armigerous''. A [[family]] or a [[clan]] likewise.\n\nThe Latin word ''armiger'' literally means \"arms-bearer\". In high and late medieval England, the word referred to an [[esquire]] attendant upon a [[knight]], but bearing his own unique armorial device. <ref>''Dictionary of Chivalry'', Uden. Kestrel Books, Harmondsworth, 1968. {{ISBN|0-7226-5372-7}}</ref>\n\n''Armiger'' was also used as a Latin [[cognomen]], and is now found as a rare surname in English-speaking countries.\n\nToday, the term ''armiger'' is well-defined only within jurisdictions, such as [[Canada]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where heraldry is regulated by the state or a heraldic body, such as the [[College of Arms]], the [[Chief Herald of Canada]], the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] or the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland]]. A person can be so entitled either by proven (and typically [[agnatic]]) descent from a person with a right to bear a [[heraldic achievement]], or by virtue of a grant of arms to himself. Merely sharing the same family name of an armiger is insufficient.\n\nMost of the time, the usage of a heraldic achievement is governed by legal restrictions; these restrictions are independent of the copyright status and independent of a coat of arms depiction. A coat of arms represents its owner. Though it can be freely represented, it cannot be appropriated, or used in such a way as to create a confusion with or a prejudice to its owner.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], titles of nobility are regulated by law but heraldry is not. In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] the nobility has had, since 1762, the prerogative to use an open helmet, while others use a closed helmet.\n\n==Devices==\nThis section describes the various '''heraldic devices''', also referred to as '''armory''' or '''armorial bearings''', that an armiger may be granted. This always includes an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], and may also include external devices, if posessed.\n\nThe term ('''coat of''') '''arms''' technically refers to the ([[blazon]] of the) escutcheon, but the phrase is commonly used to refer to the entire ('''armorial'''/'''heraldic''') '''achievement''' ('''of arms'''), i.e. full display of armorial devices.<ref>{{ Citation\n | last1=Boutell\n | first1=Charles \n | last2=Charles Fox-Davies\n | first2=Arthur \n | lastauthoramp=yes\n | title=The handbook to English heraldry\n | publisher=Reeves & Turner\n | place=\n | volume=\n | edition=\n | year=1914\n | quote=Achievement, or Achievement of Arms.

Many ancient armorial bearings consist of nothing else.\n\nThe word is used in two related senses. First, as the shield on which a [[coat of arms]] is displayed; second, a shield can itself be a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] within a coat of arms.\n\nEscutcheon shapes are derived from actual shields used by [[knight]]s in combat, and thus are varied and developed by region and by era. As this shape has been regarded as a war-like device appropriate to men only, British ladies customarily bear their arms upon a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]], or diamond-shape, while clergymen and ladies in continental Europe bear theirs on a [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]], or oval. Other shapes are in use, such as the [[roundel (heraldry)|roundel]] commonly used for arms granted to [[Aboriginal Canadians]] by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] or the [[Nguni shield]] used in [[Coats of arms and emblems of Africa|African heraldry]].\n\nThough it can be used as a charge on its own, the most common use of an escutcheon charge is to display another coat of arms as a form of [[Heraldry#Marshalling|marshalling]]. These escutcheons are usually given the same shape as the main shield. When there is only one such shield, it is sometimes called an ''inescutcheon''.\n\n===Externally, if possessed===\nFrom a very early date, illustrations of arms were frequently embellished with [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] placed above the shields.  These in turn came to be decorated with fan-shaped or sculptural crests, often incorporating elements from the shield of arms; as well as a wreath or [[torse]], or sometimes a [[coronet]], from which depended the lambrequin or [[mantling]]. To these elements, modern heraldry often adds a [[motto]] displayed on a ribbon, typically below the shield. The helmet is borne of right, and forms no part of a grant of arms; it may be assumed without authority by anyone entitled to bear arms, together with mantling and whatever motto the armiger may desire. The crest, however, together with the torse or coronet from which it arises, must be granted or confirmed by the relevant heraldic authority.<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\">{{harvp|Fox-Davies|1909|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\nIf the bearer is entitled to the ribbon, collar, or badge of a knightly order, it may encircle or depend from the shield. Some arms, particularly those of the nobility, are further embellished with supporters, heraldic figures standing alongside or behind the shield; often these stand on a [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]], typically a mound of earth and grass, on which other [[heraldic badge|badges]], symbols, or [[heraldic flag|heraldic banners]] may be displayed.  The most elaborate achievements sometimes display the entire coat of arms beneath a pavilion, an embellished tent or canopy of the type associated with the medieval tournament.,<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\"/> though this is only very rarely found in English or Scots achievements.\n\nTypes of accompanying, external devices are listed below.\n\n====Helm/crest/''galero''====\n{{Main|Helmet (heraldry)|Crest (heraldry)|Galero}}\n[[File:Cavalieredicasata.JPG|thumb|upright|A knight with an eagle crest at the [[Saracen Joust]] in [[Arezzo]], Tuscany.]]\nThe helmet or ''helm'' is situated above the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and bears the [[torse]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]. The style of helmet displayed varies according to [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|rank]] and [[social status]], and these styles developed over time, in step with the development of actual military [[Helmet|helmets]].<ref>[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 202.</ref><ref name=\"FD303\">[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], p. 303.</ref> In some traditions, especially [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German and Nordic heraldry]], two or three helmets (and sometimes more) may be used in a single [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement of arms]], each representing a [[fief]] to which the bearer has a right.  For this reason, the helmets and crests in German and Nordic arms are considered to be essential to the coat of arms and are never separated from it.\n\nOpen-visored or barred helmets are typically reserved to the highest ranks of nobility, while lesser nobility and [[burgher arms|burghers]] typically assume closed helms.<ref name=\"FD303\" /> While these classifications remained relatively constant, the specific forms of all these helmets varied and evolved over time.<ref name=\"FD303\" /> \n\nIn [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], bishops and other [[clergy]] use a [[mitre]] or other rank-appropriate ecclesiastical hat in place of a helmet.<ref>[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 75.</ref>\n\nIn [[English language|English]] the word \"crest\" is commonly (but erroneously) used to refer to an entire heraldic achievement of armorial bearings. The technical use of the heraldic term [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] refers to just one component of a complete achievement. The crest rests on top of a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] which itself rests on the most important part of the achievement: the shield.\n\nThe modern crest has grown out of the three-dimensional figure placed on the top of the mounted knights' helms as a further means of identification. In most heraldic traditions, a woman does not display a crest, though this tradition is being relaxed in some heraldic jurisdictions, and the stall plate of Lady Marion Fraser in the Thistle Chapel in St Giles, Edinburgh, shows her coat on a lozenge but with helmet, crest, and motto.\n\nThe crest is usually found on a [[torse|wreath]] of twisted cloth and sometimes within a [[coronet]]. Crest-coronets are generally simpler than coronets of rank, but several specialized forms exist; for example, in [[Canada]], descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s are entitled to use a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others).\n\nWhen the helm and crest are shown, they are usually accompanied by a [[mantling]]. This was originally a cloth worn over the back of the helmet as partial protection against heating by sunlight. Today it takes the form of a stylized cloak hanging from the helmet.<ref>{{harvp|Gwynn-Jones|1998|p=124}}</ref> Typically in British heraldry, the outer surface of the mantling is of the principal colour in the shield and the inner surface is of the principal metal, though peers in the United Kingdom use standard colourings (Gules doubled Argent - Red/White) regardless of rank or the colourings of their arms. The mantling is sometimes conventionally depicted with a ragged edge, as if damaged in combat, though the edges of most are simply decorated at the emblazoner's discretion.\n\nClergy often refrain from displaying a helm or crest in their [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|heraldic achievements]]. Members of the clergy may display appropriate headwear. This often takes the form of a small crowned, wide brimmed hat called a [[galero]] with the colours and tassels denoting rank; or, in the case of [[Papal coats of arms]] until the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005, an elaborate triple crown known as a [[tiara]]. Benedict broke with tradition to substitute a [[mitre]] in [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|his arms]]. Orthodox and Presbyterian clergy do sometimes adopt other forms of head gear to ensign their shields. In the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, clergy members may pass crests on to their offspring, but rarely display them on their own shields.\n\n====Mottoes and slogans====\n{{Main|Motto|Slogan (heraldry)}}\nAn armorial [[motto]] is a phrase or collection of words intended to describe the motivation or intention of the armigerous person or corporation. This can form a pun on the family name as in [[Thomas Nevile]]'s motto ''Ne vile velis''. Mottoes are generally changed at will and do not make up an integral part of the armorial achievement. Mottoes can typically be found on a scroll under the shield. In [[Scottish heraldry]], where the motto is granted as part of the [[blazon]], it is usually shown on a scroll above the crest, and may not be changed at will. A motto may be in any language.\n\n====Supporters====\n{{Main|Supporter}}\n[[File:App0084.jpg|thumb|upright|A lion supporting the [[Symbols of Brussels|arms of the City of Brussels]]]]\n[[Supporters]] are human or animal figures or, very rarely, inanimate objects, usually placed on either side of a coat of arms as though supporting it. In many traditions, these have acquired strict guidelines for use by certain social classes. On the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], there are often fewer restrictions on the use of supporters.<ref>{{harvp|Neubecker|1976|pp=186}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, only [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]], a few baronets, senior members of orders of knighthood, and some corporate bodies are granted supporters. Often, these can have local significance or a historical link to the armiger.\n\n====Crown/coronet====\n{{Main|Crown (heraldry)|Coronet}}\nIf the armiger has the title of [[baron]], hereditary [[knight]], or higher, he may display a coronet of rank above the shield. In the United Kingdom, this is shown between the shield and helmet, though it is often above the crest in Continental heraldry.\n\n====Order====\n{{Main|Order (distinction)}}\nAnother addition that can be made to a coat of arms is the insignia of a baronet or of an order of knighthood. This is usually represented by a collar or similar band surrounding the shield. When the arms of a knight and his wife are shown in one achievement, the insignia of knighthood surround the husband's arms only, and the wife's arms are customarily surrounded by an ornamental garland of leaves for visual balance.<ref>Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest''. (MacGibbon & Kee, London: 1960), 358.</ref>\n\n==== Banners ====\n{{Main|Heraldic flag|Banner of arms}}\n[[File:Banners of Knights of the Thistle.jpg|thumb|upright|Banners of [[Knights of the Thistle]] displayed in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]]]\n[[Flag]]s are used to identify ships (where they are called [[ensign]]s), embassies and such, and they use the same [[Tincture (heraldry)|colors]] and designs found in heraldry, but they are not usually considered to be heraldic. A country may have both a [[national flag]] and a national coat of arms, and the two may not look alike at all. For example, the [[flag of Scotland]] (St Andrew's Cross) has a white [[saltire]] on a blue [[field (heraldry)|field]], but the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms of Scotland]] has a red lion within a double [[wiktionary:tressure|tressure]] on a [[Or (heraldry)|gold (or)]] field.\n\n==== Compartment ====\n{{Main|Compartment (heraldry)}}\nA compartment is a design placed under the [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]], usually rocks, a grassy mount (''mount vert''), or some sort of other landscape upon which the [[supporters]] are depicted as standing.{{sfn|Woodcock|Robinson|1990|p=106}} Care must be taken to distinguish true compartments from items upon which supporters are merely resting one or more feet, or, sometimes, mere heraldic badges or pure decoration under the shield, and, conversely, care must also be taken in very unusual cases such as the [[coat of arms of Belize]], in which what may be taken to be a crest, the mahogany tree rising above the shield, is really part of the compartment.  It is sometimes said to represent the land held by the bearer.  As an official part of the blazon it is a comparatively late feature of heraldry, often derived from the need to have different supporters for different families or entities, although sometimes the compartment is treated in the [[blazon]] separately from the supporters.\n\n====Mantling====\n{{Main|Mantling}}\nMantling or \"lambrequin\" (its name in French) is drapery tied to the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] above the shield. In paper heraldry it is a depiction of the protective cloth covering (often of [[linen]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=8827 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] - Mantling</ref>) worn by [[knight]]s from their helmets to stave off the elements, and, secondarily, to decrease the effects of sword-blows against the helmet in battle, from which it is usually shown tattered or cut to shreds; less often it is shown as an intact drape, principally in those cases where clergy use a helmet and mantling (to symbolise that, despite the perhaps contradictory presence of the helmet, they have not been involved in combat), although this is usually the artist's discretion and done for decorative rather than symbolic reasons.\n\nGenerally, mantling is blazoned ''mantled x, doubled'' [lined] ''y''; the cloth has two sides, one of a [[Tincture_(heraldry)#Colours|colour]] and the other of a [[Tincture_(heraldry)#Metals|metal]]. The mantling is usually in the main colours of the shield, or else in the [[livery]] colours that symbolize the entity bearing the arms, though there are exceptions, with occasional tinctures differing from these, or occasional examples in which the outside of the mantling is per pale of two colours<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20158.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011659/http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20158.gif |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> or both the inside and outside are per pale,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetijelkepek.hu/onkormanyzat-ocsod_en.shtml|title=National and historical symbols of Hungary|first=National Infocommunications Service Company Limited by|last=Shares|date=|website=www.nemzetijelkepek.hu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> and even rarer examples of other divisions,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sitio oficial de Sutamarchan en Boyaca, Colombia|url=http://sutamarchan-boyaca.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=m-g1--&m=f|accessdate=2007-10-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714163157/http://sutamarchan-boyaca.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=m-g1--&m=f|archivedate=2012-07-14}}</ref> and there is a perhaps unique example in which the lining of the mantling is per pale of the two metals<ref>{{cite web|title=College of Arms: The Arms and Badge of Professor S.

It still holds true frequently in [[Germany]].\n\nThere are rare examples where the mantling is blazoned to complement the armiger's coat of arms, mimicking the ordinaries and charges on the escutcheon.

However, there have been other historical cultures which have used symbols and emblems to represent families or individuals, and in some cases these symbols have been adopted into Western heraldry. For example, the [[coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire]] incorporated the royal [[tughra]] as part of its [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], along with such traditional Western heraldic elements as the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]].\n\n====Greek symbols====\nAncient Greeks were among the first civilizations to use symbols consistently in order to identify a warrior, clan or a state.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The first record of a shield blazon is illustrated in [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''.\n\n====Mon====\n{{Main|Mon (emblem)}}\n{{nihongo|'''Mon'''|\u7d0b|}}, also {{nihongo|'''monsh\u014d'''|\u7d0b\u7ae0|}}, {{nihongo|'''mondokoro'''|\u7d0b\u6240|}}, and {{nihongo|'''kamon'''|\u5bb6\u7d0b|}}, are [[Japan]]ese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual or family. While ''mon'' is an encompassing term that may refer to any such device, ''kamon'' and ''mondokoro'' refer specifically to emblems used to identify a family.{{Elucidate|reason=This is the same as previously stated, so what is the difference with mon and monsh\u014d? |date=February 2016}} An authoritative ''mon'' reference compiles Japan's 241 general categories of ''mon'' based on structural resemblance (a single ''mon'' may belong to multiple categories), with 5116 distinct individual ''mon'' (it is however well acknowledged that there exist lost or obscure ''mon'' that are not in this compilation).<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u5bb6\u7d0b\u5927\u5168 |publisher={{lang|ja|\u68a7\u6850\u66f8\u9662}} |year=2004 |ISBN=434003102X}}</ref><ref>Some 6939 ''mon'' are [https://x181.secure.ne.jp/~x181007/kamon/goodslist.cgi listed here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028043638/http://x181.secure.ne.jp/~x181007/kamon/goodslist.cgi |date=2016-10-28 }}.</ref>\n\nThe devices are similar to the [[Heraldic badge|badges]] and [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] in European heraldic tradition, which likewise are used to identify individuals and families.  ''Mon'' are often referred to as [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]] in Western literature, another European heraldic device similar to the ''mon'' in function.\n\n====Socialist heraldry====\n{{Main|Socialist heraldry}}\n'''Socialist heraldry''', also called '''communist heraldry''', consists of emblems in a style typically adopted by [[communist state]]s and characterized by [[communist symbolism]]. Although commonly called ''[[coat of arms|coats of arms]]'', most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional heraldic sense and should therefore, in a strict sense, not be called arms at all.<ref name=\"von Volborth\">{{harvp|von Volborth|1981|page= 11}}</ref> Many communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of [[European heraldry]] in order to distance themselves from the [[monarchy|monarchies]] that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] was the first state to use socialist heraldry, beginning at its creation in 1922. The style became more widespread after [[World War II]], when many other communist states were established. Even a few non-socialist states have adopted the style, for various reasons\u2014usually because [[Wars of national liberation|communists had helped them to gain independence]]\u2014but also when no apparent connection to a Communist nation exists, such as the [[emblem of Italy]].<ref name=\"von Volborth\"/><ref name=\"von Volborth 1972\">{{cite book |last= von Volborth|first= Carl-Alexander|author-link1= Carl-Alexander von Volborth| date= 1972 | title= Alverdens heraldik i farver | language=Danish | others=Editor and translator from English to Danish: [[Sven Tito Achen]] | location= Copenhagen | publisher=Politikens Forlag |page= 158|isbn= 87 567 1685 0}}</ref> After the fall of the Soviet Union and the other communist states in Eastern Europe in 1989\u20131991, this style of heraldry was often abandoned for the old heraldic practices, with many (but not all) of the new governments reinstating the traditional heraldry that was previously cast aside.\n\n====Tamgas====\n{{Main|Tamga}}\nA '''tamga''' or '''tamgha''' \"stamp, seal\" ({{lang-mn|\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0433\u0430}}, [[turkic languages|Turkic:]] tamga) is an abstract [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] or [[Seal (emblem)|stamp]] used by [[Eurasian nomad]]ic peoples and by cultures influenced by them. The tamga was normally the emblem of a particular tribe, clan or family. They were common among the Eurasian nomads throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages (including [[Alans]], [[Mongols]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Turkic peoples]]). Similar \"tamga-like\" symbols were sometimes also adopted by sedentary peoples adjacent to the Pontic-Caspian steppe both in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]],<ref>Ottfried Neubecker. ''Heraldik''. Orbis, 2002; Brook 154; Franklin and Shepard 120-121; Pritsak 78-79.</ref> such as the [[East Slavs]], whose ancient [[Symbols of the Rurikids|royal symbols]] are sometimes referred to as \"tamgas\" and have similar appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMwmcqwZUGcC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=rurikid+tamga&source=bl&ots=OZoyQCrJDu&sig=2nASSscIJn6WshI6ORaX5PoWiuI&hl=ru&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6ifi2sqPNAhXkNJoKHYB7DrEQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&q=rurikid%20tamga&f=false|title = Pre-modern Russia and Its World: Essays in Honor of Thomas S.

One could also adopt the tamga of one's master or ruler, therefore signifying said master's patronage. Outside of denoting ownership, tamgas also possessed religious significance, and were used as [[talisman]]s to protect one from curses (it was believed that, as symbols of family, tamgas embodied the power of one's heritage). Tamgas depicted geometric shapes, images of animals, items, or [[glyph]]s. As they were usually inscribed using heavy and unwieldy instruments, such as knives or brands, and on different surfaces (meaning that their appearance could vary somewhat), tamgas were always simple and stylised, and needed to be laconic and easily recognisable.<ref>\u0422\u0410\u041c\u0413\u0410 (\u043a \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0430). \u0412.\u0421. \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0445, No 7, \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0440, 2001, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 75-86)</ref>\n\n====Tughras====\n{{Main|Tughra}}\n{{Further|Coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire}}\nEvery sultan of the Ottoman Empire had his own monogram, called the tughra, which served as a royal symbol. A coat of arms in the European heraldic sense was created in the late 19th century. Hampton Court requested from Ottoman Empire the coat of arms to be included in their collection. As the coat of arms had not been previously used in Ottoman Empire, it was designed after this request and the final design was adopted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II on April 17, 1882. It included two flags: the flag of the Ottoman Dynasty, which had a crescent and a star on red base, and the flag of the Islamic Caliph, which had three crescents on a green base.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book|ref=harv |last=Pimbley |first=Arthur Francis |year=1908 |title=Pimbley's dictionary of heraldry |publisher=Pimbley|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry}}\n* {{cite web\n| accessdate = 2011-05-16\n| publisher = An Tir College of Heralds\n| title = What is an Achievement?\n| quote = An 'achievement' is a full formal display of a coat of arms.\n| url = http://www.antirheralds.org/display/achievements/achievements.html\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110420025929/http://antirheralds.org/display/achievements/achievements.html\n| archivedate = 20 April 2011\n| url-status = dead\n| df = dmy-all\n}}\n\n; Books\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |author-link=Charles Boutell |last=Boutell |first=Charles |year=1890 |url = https://archive.org/details/heraldryancientm00boutrich |editor-first=S.
