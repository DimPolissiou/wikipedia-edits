Introduction, 27 May 1994]]</ref>\n\nA report by the UN Commission of Experts dated 24 May 1994 found that ethnic cleansing has been carried out through \"murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian populations in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian populations, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property\". Such forms of [[persecutions]] of a group were defined as [[crimes against humanity]], though they can also fall within the meaning of the [[Genocide Convention]].{{sfn|Bartrop|2019|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nEthnic cleansing is not to be confused with [[genocide]]. These terms are not synonymous, yet the academic discourse considers both to exist within a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced [[deportation]] or population transfer of a group to change the ethnic composition of a territory, whereas genocide is aimed at the destruction of a group.{{sfn|Schabas|2000|p=199}}\n\nThe [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) delivered a verdict in the [[Bosnian Genocide Case]] to draw a distinction between ''ethnic cleansing'' and ''genocide''.<blockquote>It [''i.e. ethnic cleansing''] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|[Genocide] Convention]], if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area \"ethnically homogeneous\", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is \"to destroy, in whole or in part\" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. \u2014 ICJ.{{sfn|International Court of Justice|2007|pp=83\u201384}}</blockquote>\n\n==International reports==\nOn 17 November 1992, [[United Nations special rapporteur]] [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] issued the report ''Situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia'' to the [[UN]].

Introduction, 27 May 1994]]</ref>\n\nA report by the UN Commission of Experts dated 24 May 1994 found that ethnic cleansing has been carried out through \"murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian populations in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian populations, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property\". Such forms of [[persecutions]] of a group were defined as [[crimes against humanity]], though they can also fall within the meaning of the [[Genocide Convention]].{{sfn|Bartrop|2019|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nEthnic cleansing is not to be confused with [[genocide]]. These terms are not synonymous, yet the academic discourse considers both to exist within a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced [[deportation]] or population transfer of a group to change the ethnic composition of a territory, whereas genocide is aimed at the destruction of a group.{{sfn|Schabas|2000|p=199}}\n\nThe [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) delivered a verdict in the [[Bosnian Genocide Case]] to draw a distinction between ''ethnic cleansing'' and ''genocide''.<blockquote>It [''i.e. ethnic cleansing''] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|[Genocide] Convention]], if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area \"ethnically homogeneous\", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is \"to destroy, in whole or in part\" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. \u2014 ICJ.{{sfn|International Court of Justice|2007|pp=83\u201384}}</blockquote>\n\n==International reports==\nOn 17 November 1992, [[United Nations special rapporteur]] [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] issued the report ''Situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia'' to the [[UN]]. In it, the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina was singled out, and described as a political objective of Serb nationalists who want to ensure control of territories with a Serb majority as well as \"adjacent territories assimilated to them\".

[[Dorset]], England. It was created on 1 April 2019 by the merger of the areas that were previously administered by the unitary authorities of [[Bournemouth]] and [[Poole]], and the [[non-metropolitan district]] of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/648/contents/made|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|author=Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=2018-05-28|website=legislation.gov.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525193043/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/648/contents/made#|archive-date=2018-05-25|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> The authority covers much of the area of the [[South East Dorset conurbation|South Dorset conurbation]].\n\n==Background==\n\nThe new authority was formed as a result of local government reorganisation in the ceremonial county of Dorset. Under the plans, dubbed \"Future Dorset\", all councils within the county were abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities. One was formed from the existing unitary authorities of [[Bournemouth Borough Council|Bournemouth]] and [[Poole Borough Council|Poole]], which merged with the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] to create the unitary authority to be known as Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. The other was created from the merger of the existing non-metropolitan districts of [[Weymouth and Portland]], [[West Dorset]], [[North Dorset]], [[Purbeck District|Purbeck]] and [[East Dorset]] to form a new [[Dorset (unitary authority)|Dorset]] authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|access-date=2018-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531065217/https://futuredorset.co.uk/#|archive-date=2018-05-31|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\nChristchurch Borough Council formally opposed the plans, whilst every other existing authority in Dorset supported the plans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-42583584|title=Council submits alternative to merger|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109024836/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-42583584#|archive-date=2018-11-09|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Christchurch Borough Council unsuccessfully challenged the proposals in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-45141810|title=Council's merger appeal bid refused|date=2018-08-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109024818/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-45141810#|archive-date=2018-11-09|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Several [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Councillors in Christchurch were suspended from the party for opposition, with four subsequently standing as independents in the 2019 election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-47536891|title=Tories suspended over merger row|date=2019-03-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-19|language=en-GB}}</ref>.\n\n==Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council==\n{{main|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council}}\nStatutory instruments for the creation of the new authority were made on behalf of the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 25 May 2018, and a shadow authority was formed the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-44250570|title=Parliament passes councils merger plan|date=25 May 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/historic-day-as-parliamentary-process-to-create-new-councils-concludes/|title=Historic day, as Parliamentary process to create new councils concludes - Future Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk}}</ref> The Shadow Authority was comprised of the existing borough councillors from Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, as well as the County Councillors representing Christchurch.

The first elections took place in 2019 alongside other local elections, and lead to the Conservatives holding the most seats, but lacking a majority, meaning that the council remained under [[No overall control]]. Subsequent to the election, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the second largest party in the council, lead the creation of the Unity Alliance Administration, made up of the Liberal Democrats (15), [[Independent politician|Independents]] (11), [[Poole People Party|Poole People]] (7), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] (3), [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] (2) and Alliance for Local Living (1). The Unity Alliance therefore had 39 members, the number required for a majority. The remaining councillors, belonging to the Conservative Party (36) and [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] (1) remained in opposition.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe authority lies in the South East of the ceremonial county of Dorset around 150 km from London. Dorset as a whole is part of the [[South West England|South West]] [[Regions of England|region of England]], which is used for [[NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom|statistical purposes]]. The three former boroughs are all historically seaside towns with tourism playing an important part in the local economy. Bournemouth and Christchurch [[Historic counties of England|historically]] within the County of [[Hampshire]]. Bournemouth and Poole lie north of [[Poole Harbour]], whilst Christchurch contains [[Christchurch Harbour]], with the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Solent]] to the East and [[English Channel]] to the South and West. Generally the area has a [[Temperate climate|temperate oceanic climate]] with mild summers and cool winters.\n\n=== Demographics ===\n[[File:South_West_Hampshire_&_South_East_Dorset_Green_Belt.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:South_West_Hampshire_&_South_East_Dorset_Green_Belt.svg|alt=|thumb|400x400px|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole within the Green Belt{{legend|#92F98B|Green belt|outline=#606060}}{{legend|#0024FF|County borders|outline=#606060}}{{legend|#FD3EC4|District borders|outline=#606060}}]]\nBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole roughly overlaps with the [[South East Dorset conurbation|South-East Dorset Conurbation]], although it also spreads to the former [[East Dorset|East Dorset Borough]] and parts of the [[New Forest District|New Forest district]] of Hampshire. As such, the area lies within the [[South West Hampshire/South East Dorset Green Belt]], created between 1958 and 1980, which regulates environmental and planning policy to manage development expansion.\n\n==See also==\n*[[2019 structural changes to local government in England]]\n*[[South East Dorset conurbation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official

[[Dorset]], England. It was created on 1 April 2019 by the merger of the areas that were previously administered by the unitary authorities of [[Bournemouth]] and [[Poole]], and the [[non-metropolitan district]] of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/648/contents/made|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|author=Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=2018-05-28|website=legislation.gov.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525193043/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/648/contents/made#|archive-date=2018-05-25|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> The authority covers much of the area of the [[South East Dorset conurbation|South Dorset conurbation]].\n\n==Background==\n\nThe new authority was formed as a result of local government reorganisation in the ceremonial county of Dorset. Under the plans, dubbed \"Future Dorset\", all councils within the county were abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities. One was formed from the existing unitary authorities of [[Bournemouth Borough Council|Bournemouth]] and [[Poole Borough Council|Poole]], which merged with the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] to create the unitary authority to be known as Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. The other was created from the merger of the existing non-metropolitan districts of [[Weymouth and Portland]], [[West Dorset]], [[North Dorset]], [[Purbeck District|Purbeck]] and [[East Dorset]] to form a new [[Dorset (unitary authority)|Dorset]] authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|access-date=2018-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531065217/https://futuredorset.co.uk/#|archive-date=2018-05-31|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\nChristchurch Borough Council formally opposed the plans, whilst every other existing authority in Dorset supported the plans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-42583584|title=Council submits alternative to merger|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109024836/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-42583584#|archive-date=2018-11-09|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Christchurch Borough Council unsuccessfully challenged the proposals in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-45141810|title=Council's merger appeal bid refused|date=2018-08-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109024818/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-45141810#|archive-date=2018-11-09|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Several [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Councillors in Christchurch were suspended from the party for opposition, with four subsequently standing as independents in the 2019 election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-47536891|title=Tories suspended over merger row|date=2019-03-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-19|language=en-GB}}</ref>.\n\n==Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council==\n{{main|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council}}\nStatutory instruments for the creation of the new authority were made on behalf of the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 25 May 2018, and a shadow authority was formed the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-44250570|title=Parliament passes councils merger plan|date=25 May 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/historic-day-as-parliamentary-process-to-create-new-councils-concludes/|title=Historic day, as Parliamentary process to create new councils concludes - Future Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk}}</ref> The Shadow Authority was comprised of the existing borough councillors from Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, as well as the County Councillors representing Christchurch.

The first elections took place in 2019 alongside other local elections, and lead to the Conservatives holding the most seats, but lacking a majority, meaning that the council remained under [[No overall control]]. Subsequent to the election, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the second largest party in the council, lead the creation of the Unity Alliance Administration, made up of the Liberal Democrats (15), [[Independent politician|Independents]] (11), [[Poole People Party|Poole People]] (7), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] (3), [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] (2) and Alliance for Local Living (1). The Unity Alliance therefore had 39 members, the number required for a majority. The remaining councillors, belonging to the Conservative Party (36) and [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] (1) remained in opposition.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe authority lies in the South East of the ceremonial county of Dorset around 150 km from London. Dorset as a whole is part of the [[South East England|South East]] [[Regions of England|region of England]], which is used for [[NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom|statistical purposes]]. The three former boroughs are all historically seaside towns with tourism playing an important part in the local economy. Bournemouth and Christchurch [[Historic counties of England|historically]] within the County of [[Hampshire]]. Bournemouth and Poole lie north of [[Poole Harbour]], whilst Christchurch contains [[Christchurch Harbour]], with the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Solent]] to the East and [[English Channel]] to the South and West. Generally the area has a [[Temperate climate|temperate oceanic climate]] with mild summers and cool winters.\n\n=== Demographics ===\n[[File:South_West_Hampshire_&_South_East_Dorset_Green_Belt.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:South_West_Hampshire_&_South_East_Dorset_Green_Belt.svg|alt=|thumb|400x400px|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole within the Green Belt{{legend|#92F98B|Green belt|outline=#606060}}{{legend|#0024FF|County borders|outline=#606060}}{{legend|#FD3EC4|District borders|outline=#606060}}]]\nBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole roughly overlaps with the [[South East Dorset conurbation|South-East Dorset Conurbation]], although it also spreads to the former [[East Dorset|East Dorset Borough]] and parts of the [[New Forest District|New Forest district]] of Hampshire. As such, the area lies within the [[South West Hampshire/South East Dorset Green Belt]], created between 1958 and 1980, which regulates environmental and planning policy to manage development expansion.\n\n==See also==\n*[[2019 structural changes to local government in England]]\n*[[South East Dorset conurbation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Dorset}}\n{{SW England}}\n{{Unitary authorities of England}}\n\n{{coord missing|Dorset}}\n\n[[Category:Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole| ]]\n[[Category:Local government in Bournemouth]]\n[[Category:Local government in Dorset]]\n[[Category:Unitary authority districts of England]]\n[[Category:Local government districts of South West England]]\n", "name_user": "BryceIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGeography:South West, not East", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth,_Christchurch_and_Poole"}

His brother Antoine was a Nationalist MP and Parliamentary Secretary while a cousin, [[Ugo Mifsud Bonnici]], was a Nationalist MP, Minister and [[President of Malta]]. Karmenu has two sisters and three brothers, one of whom (Antoine) is a Nationalist member of Parliament and another is an Archpriest.

He would later claim to be \"a Nationalist by birth, but a Labourite through free choice and conviction\". {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn 1969 Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici got a job as a local consultant of Malta's [[General Workers' Union]], playing a role in the struggle of the trade union and the Labour party against the Nationalist government-proposed Industrial Relations Bill, which foresaw sanctions up to imprisonment for workers on strike.<ref name=OPM/><ref name=rudolf/> He continued his engagement with the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] throughout the 1970s.\n \n===Labour Party leader and Prime minister===\nIn May 1980, [[Dom Mintoff]] appointed Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici as deputy leader of the Labour Party, which was confirmed by the party conference. Mifsud Bonnici managed the party campaign for the [[1981 Maltese general election|1981 elections]] - the third and last victory of Mintoff's Labour.<ref name=OPM/>\n\nIn October 1981 Mintoff designated Mifsud Bonnici as his successor, again confirmed by the party conference. Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici was thus co-opted into Parliament in May 1982 upon the resignation of Paul Xuereb, and assigned the Ministry of Employment and Social Services,<ref name=OPM/> without ever standing for election. This gained him the nickname of \"Doctor Zero\".

[[Political violence]] persisted, heightened and made more intense by the fact that the [[1987 Maltese general election|1987 elections]] were approaching. Relations with the church deteriorated further on two fronts: the enactment of a Bill to seize church property without compensation, and attempts by the government to take control of church schools. In 1984, a demonstration by some workers of the [[Malta Drydocks]], at which Mifsud Bonnici was present, climaxed when the offices of the Maltese Curia were ransacked after the demonstration had ended.
