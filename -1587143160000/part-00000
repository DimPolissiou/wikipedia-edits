As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerful\u2014albeit more expensive\u2014perks.

Shortly after they emerge from the Vault, the player character is contacted by the Vault Overseer. She reveals that Vault 76 was given a secret mandate to secure an arsenal of nuclear weapons deployed throughout Appalachia in three still-functioning nuclear missile silos: Site Alpha, Site Bravo, and Site Charlie. The player character is directed to contact the First Responders, a faction of emergency services personnel who tried to aid the residents of Appalachia during the war; however, they discover that the First Responders evacuated after they came under attack from the Scorched. Further investigation reveals that the Scorched are ghouls infected by the breath of a Scorchbeast, a creature that was awoken after the Great War.\n\nAs the Scorched represent a threat to the Wasteland beyond Appalachia, the player character decides to secure a nuclear weapon and use it to destroy a Scorchbeast nest. In order to achieve this, they start searching the bunkers of survivalists calling themselves the Free States who were working on the means to detect the Scorched until the Scorched overran them. The player character is able to build a radar system that detects the viral signature of the Scorched, but its limited range makes it ineffective, even after helping boost the signal with gaining the friendship of Rose, a Miss Nanny robot trying to rebuild the local Raider gangs that lived in Appalachia before being scared off by the Scorched, and investigating the Scorchbeasts further through the research done by the local Brotherhood of Steel as they had tried to halt the spread of the Scorchbeasts from their main lair. They hack into a government network and draw the attention of the Enclave, the remnants of the United States government. The Enclave are led by MODUS, a centralized artificial intelligence system located in a secure nuclear fallout bunker beneath the Whitespring Resort. MODUS asks the player character to help connect them to a series of isolated computer networks across Appalachia, and in return offers to connect to the radar system to detect Scorched across the region.\n\nOnce MODUS is connected, they are able to identify the Scorchbeast nest at a location called Fissure Site Prime, close to where the Brotherhood of Steel had made their ultimate attempt to stop the Scorchbeast threat themselves and failed. The player character is directed to one of the three nuclear silos and they launch a missile at the nest. Venturing into the irradiated area, they uncover a laboratory at the center of the nest that was also found by the Brotherhood of Steel, implying that the Scorchbeasts were man-made. The explosion awakens a Scorchbeast Queen, and the player is forced to fight her. With the Queen defeated, the Scorchbeasts' hive mind is broken, and the threat to the wasteland beyond Appalachia is halted. The player character rejoins the other residents of Vault 76 in rebuilding the Wasteland.\n\n===''Wastelanders''===\nAbout one year after Vault 76 opened, in 2103, people have begun returning to Appalachia due to rumors of possible treasure in the area, possibly in one of the Vaults. Concerned for their well-being due to the threat of the Scorched and Scorchbeasts still being a problem after the Scorchbeast Queen was dealt with, the Vault 76 Overseer asks the residents of Vault 76 that have been rebuilding the Wasteland to assist the new residents of Appalachia, meeting, befriending, and helping them while trying to figure out the rumors of treasure that caused everyone to return. Many new locations have appeared, and some have been changed greatly because of the return of people to the Appalachian Wasteland. New creatures have also appeared, and the Scorched still pose a grave threat to all the newcomers to the region.\n\nThe Overseer first asks the residents to explain the situation with the Scorched to the leaders of the two main factions in Appalachia now: The Settlers, led by Paige, and the Raiders, led by Meg. Both leaders agree to the inoculation for their groups after learning of the Scorched having done some heavy damage to their forces, and the residents and Overseer mass-produce the inoculation as the latest flavor of the famed Nuka-Cola soft drinks to thus render the Settlers and Raiders immune to the Scorchbeasts and their ability to infect humans with their radioactive dust to turn them into Scorched. Having protected the Settlers and Raiders from becoming new Scorched thanks to mass-producing the inoculation as Nuka-Cola, the Overseer and residents then turn their attention to the treasure rumors that caused everyone to return to Appalachia. According to the Overseer, the source of the treasure is another Vault: Vault 79.

As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerful\u2014albeit more expensive\u2014perks.

The player character exits the Vault on \"Reclamation Day\" as part of a plan to re-colonize the Wasteland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76 |title=Fallout 76: The History Of Vault 76 And What It Means For Fallout 76 |first=Tom |last=Marks |date=May 31, 2018 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611165612/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nTwenty-five years after the [[World War III|Great War]], Vault 76 is opened up and its residents given the task of repopulating the Wasteland. Shortly after they emerge from the Vault, the player character is contacted by the Vault Overseer. She reveals that Vault 76 was given a secret mandate to secure an arsenal of nuclear weapons deployed throughout Appalachia in three still-functioning nuclear missile silos: Site Alpha, Site Bravo, and Site Charlie. The player character is directed to contact the First Responders, a faction of emergency services personnel who tried to aid the residents of Appalachia during the war; however, they discover that the First Responders evacuated after they came under attack from the Scorched. Further investigation reveals that the Scorched are ghouls infected by the breath of a Scorchbeast, a creature that was awoken after the Great War.\n\nAs the Scorched represent a threat to the Wasteland beyond Appalachia, the player character decides to secure a nuclear weapon and use it to destroy a Scorchbeast nest. In order to achieve this, they start searching the bunkers of survivalists calling themselves the Free States who were working on the means to detect the Scorched until the Scorched overran them. The player character is able to build a radar system that detects the viral signature of the Scorched, but its limited range makes it ineffective, even after helping boost the signal with gaining the friendship of Rose, a Miss Nanny robot trying to rebuild the local Raider gangs that lived in Appalachia before being scared off by the Scorched, and investigating the Scorchbeasts further through the research done by the local Brotherhood of Steel as they had tried to halt the spread of the Scorchbeasts from their main lair. They hack into a government network and draw the attention of the Enclave, the remnants of the United States government. The Enclave are led by MODUS, a centralized artificial intelligence system located in a secure nuclear fallout bunker beneath the Whitespring Resort. MODUS asks the player character to help connect them to a series of isolated computer networks across Appalachia, and in return offers to connect to the radar system to detect Scorched across the region.\n\nOnce MODUS is connected, they are able to identify the Scorchbeast nest at a location called Fissure Site Prime, close to where the Brotherhood of Steel had made their ultimate attempt to stop the Scorchbeast threat themselves and failed. The player character is directed to one of the three nuclear silos and they launch a missile at the nest. Venturing into the irradiated area, they uncover a laboratory at the center of the nest that was also found by the Brotherhood of Steel, implying that the Scorchbeasts were man-made. The explosion awakens a Scorchbeast Queen, and the player is forced to fight her. With the Queen defeated, the Scorchbeasts' hive mind is broken, and the threat to the wasteland beyond Appalachia is halted. The player character rejoins the other residents of Vault 76 in rebuilding the Wasteland.\n\n===''Wastelanders''===\nAbout one year after Vault 76 opened, in 2103, people have begun returning to Appalachia due to rumors of possible treasure in the area, possibly in one of the Vaults. Concerned for their well-being due to the threat of the Scorched and Scorchbeasts still being a problem after the Scorchbeast Queen was dealt with, the Vault 76 Overseer asks the residents of Vault 76 that have been rebuilding the Wasteland to assist the new residents of Appalachia, meeting, befriending, and helping them while trying to figure out the rumors of treasure that caused everyone to return. Many new locations have appeared, and some have been changed greatly because of the return of people to the Appalachian Wasteland. New creatures have also appeared, and the Scorched still pose a grave threat to all the newcomers to the region.\n\nThe Overseer first asks the residents to explain the situation with the Scorched to the leaders of the two main factions in Appalachia now: The Settlers, led by Paige, and the Raiders, led by Meg. Both leaders agree to the inoculation for their groups after learning of the Scorched having done some heavy damage to their forces, and the residents and Overseer mass-produce the inoculation as the latest flavor of the famed Nuka-Cola soft drinks to thus render the Settlers and Raiders immune to the Scorchbeasts and their ability to infect humans with their radioactive dust to turn them into Scorched. Having protected the Settlers and Raiders from becoming new Scorched thanks to mass-producing the inoculation as Nuka-Cola, the Overseer and residents then turn their attention to the treasure rumors that caused everyone to return to Appalachia. According to the Overseer, the source of the treasure is another Vault: Vault 79. Wanting to investigate further, the Overseer and residents travel to Vault-Tec University in Morgantown to gain more information into what Vault-Tec could be hiding in Vault 79 that has caused people to migrate back into Appalachia.\n\n== Development ==\n''Fallout 76'' uses a modified version of Bethesda's [[Creation Engine]] designed to accommodate multiplayer gameplay.<ref name=\"Noclip\">{{cite web |author1=[[Noclip]] |title=The Making of Fallout 76 \u2013 Noclip Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 17, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617050330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs# |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Work on modifying the engine was carried out by [[Bethesda Game Studios Austin]].<ref name=\"Noclip\" /> The modified engine allowed the development team to incorporate new lighting models, rendering processes and more accurate terrain mapping.

Bethesda later offered affected customers free in-game currency of 500 atoms as compensation, equivalent to $5.00.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kent |first1=Emma |title=Bethesda offers 500 Atoms to customers affected by Fallout 76 bag-gate |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-29-bethesda-pledges-500-atoms-to-customers-affected-by-fallout-76-bag-gate |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=November 30, 2018|date=November 29, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Plunkett |first1=Luke |title=$200 Fallout 76 Edition Promised Fancy Bag, Delivers Nylon Trash Instead [Update: Bethesda Responds] |url=https://kotaku.com/200-fallout-76-edition-promised-fancy-bag-delivers-ny-1830724582 |website=Kotaku |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref> Critics pointed out this amount of currency was not enough to purchase the in-game postman uniform (700 atoms), which includes a canvas bag.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-29-bethesda-pledges-500-atoms-to-customers-affected-by-fallout-76-bag-gate|title=Bethesda offers 500 Atoms to customers affected by Fallout 76 bag-gate|first=Emma|last=Kent|date=November 29, 2018}}</ref> Additionally, it was discovered that Bethesda had given a different canvas bag to online influencers, further adding to the fan outrage.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-01-turns-out-bethesda-did-make-fallout-76-canvas-bags-and-gave-them-out-to-influencers | title=Turns out Bethesda did make Fallout 76 canvas bags and gave them out to influencers| date=December 2018}}</ref> Bethesda announced on December 3, 2018, that they would be producing canvas bags for all owners of the Power Armor special edition,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-canvas-bag-flub-update-bethesda-is-doi/1100-6463608/ |title=Fallout 76's Canvas Bag Flub Update: Bethesda Is Doing Right By Purchasers |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |date=December 3, 2018 |work=[[Gamespot]] |access-date=December 3, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> which were ultimately said to be shipping \"in four to six months.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/12/18/fallout-76-bags-ship-in-4-6-months/ |title='Fallout 76' Replacement Bags Will Ship in 4-6 Months\n |last=Dedmon |first=Tanner |date=December 18, 2018 |work=ComicBook.com |access-date=December 18, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In June 2019, the bags were delivered to customers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Fallout 76 players finally got their canvas bags from Bethesda |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/fallout-76-players-finally-got-their-canvas-bags-from-bethesda/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Moyse |first1=Chris |title='Bag-gate' comes to a close as Fallout 76 canvas bags finally delivered |url=https://www.destructoid.com/-bag-gate-comes-to-a-close-as-fallout-76-canvas-bags-finally-delivered-557744.phtml |website=Destructoid |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA [[data breach]] occurred on December 5, 2018, when a [[glitch]] in Bethesda's [[Issue tracking system|support system]] revealed personal information of approximately 65 ''Fallout 76'' customers, who had submitted a support ticket to receive the canvas bag.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/12/07/bethesda-responds-to-the-fallout-76-support-glitch-that-exposed-customer-data/#18ff3230e8a0|title=Bethesda Responds To The 'Fallout 76' Support Glitch That Exposed Customer Data|last=Kain|first=Erik|work=Forbes|date=December 7, 2018}}</ref> Users were able to open and close tickets of other customers and view personal information, including names, addresses, emails and partial credit card information.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://nordic.ign.com/news/21116/bethesda-support-glitch-revealed-personal-information-of-fal |title=Bethesda Support Glitch Revealed Personal Information Of Fallout 76 Customers |last=Bankhurst |first=Adam |date=December 5, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=December 6, 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/12/05/a-fallout-76-support-glitch-leaked-players-personal-information-for-all-the-world-to-see |title=A 'Fallout 76' Support Ticket Glitch Gave Players Access To Everyone's Personal Information |last=Kain |first=Erik |date=December 5, 2018 |work=[[Forbes]] |access-date=December 6, 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-support-ticket-leak |title=A Bethesda web glitch revealed everyone\u2019s support tickets, including personal info |last=Bailey |first=Dustin |date=December 5, 2018 |work=[[PCGamesN]] |access-date=December 6, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In a statement given to [[Ars Technica]], Bethesda said that the breach occurred via \"an error with our customer support website\" and that they are \"investigating the incident and will provide additional updates as we learn more\".
