They are usually more air-stable. The resulting phosphoranes are however less reactive than ylides lacking EWGs. For example they usually fail to react with ketones, necessitating the use of the [[Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons reaction]] as an alternative. Such stabilized ylides usually give rise to an E-alkene product when they react, rather than the more usual Z-alkene.\n[[File:Stabilized phosphorane.png|300px|left]]\n{{clear}}\nAlthough phosphoranes are \"electron-rich\", they are often susceptible to deprotonation.

The current lineup consists of guitarists [[Patrik Jensen]] and Rickard \"Rille\" Rimf\u00e4lt, bassist [[Sharlee D'Angelo]], vocalist [[Angus Norder]], and drummer [[Chris Barkensj\u00f6]].\n\n==History==\n{{Cleanup|section|reason=General tone and lack of citations|date=March 2020}}\n{{update|date=November 2017}}\nIt all began in 1997 when Swedish cult band Satanic Slaughter split up in a way that basically only left their singer Ztephan Dark in the band. Thus the proto-version of Witchery started out with Satanic Slaughter members Patrik Jensen (Orchriste, [[The Haunted (Swedish band)|The Haunted]]), Rickard \"Rille\" Rimf\u00e4lt, vocalist Toxine (Seance, Total Death), drummer Mique (Seance), and bassist [[Sharlee D'Angelo]] ([[Arch Enemy (band)|Arch Enemy]], [[Mercyful Fate]]) on board. In 1998 they recorded and released their debut ''[[Restless And Dead]]'' through [[Necropolis Records]], the name of the album being a pun on [[Restless and Wild]] an album by German heavy metal icons [[Accept (band)|Accept]]. Witchery quickly gathered a cult following with their combination of serious, technical thrash metal and all topics \"dead\". Their strictly tongue-in-cheek humour, often involving executions, murder, necrophilia, resurrections and other morbid topics can be spotted in song titles and album names as well as in their very own mascot - an animated skeleton called \"Ben Wrangle\", the name being a pun on the Swedish word \"benrangel\" which best translates into \"skellington\".\n\nWitchery also have their own heavy metal salute, a derivation from the original [[Sign of the horns]] \"Evil Eye\" ward popularized by [[Ronnie James Dio]] called \"The W\". For properly \"doing the W\" only the ring finger and thumb of the performing hand touch. Rumour has it that the salute came into being as somebody in the band tried to do the metal salute with a cigarette between his fingers. This \"W\" is not to be confused with the [[Shocker (hand gesture)|Shocker]].\n\nLater that year, Witchery released the ''Witchburner'' minialbum. The EP featured three originals and four cover songs bearing witness to the individual musicians' influences, among them [[Accept (band)|Accept]], [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P]] and [[Judas Priest]]. The track \"Witchburner\" being the first ever recording of the band and like the other two original tracks \"The Executioner\" and \"The Howling\" only available on this EP so far. In 1999, Witchery embarked on a U.S. tour with [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] and [[Borknagar]]. Their second full-length album ''[[Dead, Hot and Ready]]'' was unleashed soon thereafter, a six-week European tour following in 2000. ''[[Symphony for the Devil (Witchery album)|Symphony For The Devil]]'', the band's 2001 release, was recorded at Berno Studio ([[Amon Amarth (band)|Amon Amarth]], [[Dark Funeral]]) in Malm\u00f6, Sweden with new drummer, [[Martin Axenrot|Martin \"Axe\" Axenrot]] ([[Bloodbath]], [[Opeth]]). Witchery returned to tour North America later that year with [[The Haunted (Swedish band)|The Haunted]]. Returning to Berno Studios in 2004, the band recorded ''[[Don't Fear the Reaper (album)|Don't Fear The Reaper]]'', this time entrusting mixing duties to Tue Madsen and his Antfarm Studios (The Haunted, [[Heaven Shall Burn]], [[Himsa]]). After recording the album, the band signed a worldwide record deal with [[Century Media]].\n\nIn April 2010 accomplished black metal singer Legion (Erik Hagsted, ex-Marduk, ex-Devian) joined the band to replace Toxine who had to drop out because of schedule issues. According to the press release the split happened by mutual agreement. The new album entitled \"Witchkrieg\" (a play on the word [[Blitzkrieg]]) has been announced for July 2010. On the 19th of June, 2010, the band played at the annual [[Metaltown]] festival in [[Gothenburg]]\n\nTheir sixth studio album, ''[[In His Infernal Majesty's Service]]'', is due November 25 on [[Century Media Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/witchery-official-lyric-video-for-new-song-nosferatu|title=WITCHERY: Official Lyric Video for New Song 'Nosferatu'|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=2016-10-21}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n===Current members===\n*[[Patrik Jensen]] \u2013 guitars (1997\u2013present)\n*Richard Rimf\u00e4lt \u2013 guitars (1997\u2013present)\n*[[Sharlee D'Angelo]] \u2013 bass (1997\u2013present)\n*Angus Norder \u2013 vocals (2016\u2013present)\n*Chris Barkensj\u00f6 \u2013 drums (2016\u2013present)\n\n===Former members===\n====Vocalists====\n*Toxine (Tony Kampner) \u2013 1997\u20132010\n*Legion (Erik Hagstedt) \u2013 2010\u20132011\n*[[Emperor Magus Caligula]] \u2013 2011\u20132016\n\n====Drummers====\n*Mique (Micke Pettersson) \u2013 1997\u20131999\n*[[Martin Axenrot]] \u2013 1999\u20132016\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize  = width:900 height:auto barincrement:16\nPlotArea   = left:130 bottom:170 top:10 right:20\nAlignbars  = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/2021\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1997\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1998\nLegend     = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:1\n\nColors =\n id:vocals  value:red         legend:Vocals\n id:guitar  value:teal        legend:Lead_guitars\n id:guitar2 value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitars\n id:bass    value:blue        legend:Bass\n id:drums   value:orange      legend:Drums,_percussion\n id:studio  value:black       legend:Studio_releases\n id:other   value:gray(0.6)   legend:Others_releases\n\nLineData =\n at:10/02/1998 color:black layer:back\n at:03/29/1999 color:other layer:back\n at:10/22/1999 color:black layer:back\n at:02/01/2001 color:black layer:back\n at:02/27/2006 color:black layer:back\n at:06/21/2010 color:black layer:back\n at:11/25/2016 color:black layer:back\n at:11/10/2017 color:black layer:back\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tony        text:\"Tony Kampner\"\n bar:Erik         text:\"Erik Hagstedt\"\n bar:Magus     text:\"Masse Broberg\"\n bar:Angus     text:\"Angus Norder\"\n bar:Richard   text:\"Rickard Rimf\u00e4lt\"\n bar:Patrik      text:\"Patrik Jensen\"\n bar:Sharlee   text:\"Sharlee D'Angelo\"\n bar:Mique     text:\"Micke Pettersson\"\n bar:Martin    text:\"Martin Axenrot\"\n bar:Chris      text:\"Chris Barkensj\u00f6\"\n\nPlotData =\n width:11\n bar:Tony        from:01/01/1997 till:04/01/2010  color:vocals\n bar:Erik          from:04/01/2010 till:06/01/2011  color:vocals\n bar:Magus     from:06/01/2011 till:04/01/2016  color:vocals\n bar:Angus      from:04/01/2016 till:end  color:vocals\n bar:Richard    from:01/01/1997 till:end  color:guitar\n bar:Patrik       from:01/01/1997 till:end  color:guitar2\n bar:Sharlee    from:01/01/1997 till:end  color:bass\n bar:Sharlee    from:07/01/1999 till:10/01/1999  color:guitar width:3\n bar:Mique      from:01/01/1997 till:07/01/1999  color:drums\n bar:Martin      from:07/01/1999 till:04/01/2016  color:drums\n bar:Chris        from:04/01/2016 till:end  color:drums\n }}\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n*''[[Restless & Dead]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Dead, Hot and Ready]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Symphony for the Devil (Witchery album)|Symphony for the Devil]]'' (2001)\n*''Don't Fear the Reaper'' (2006)\n*''[[Witchkrieg]]'' (2010)\n*''[[In His Infernal Majesty's Service]]'' (2016)\n*''I Am Legion'' (2017)\n\n===EPs===\n*''[[Witchburner]]'' -

According to the press release the split happened by mutual agreement. The new album entitled \"Witchkrieg\" (a play on the word [[Blitzkrieg]]) has been announced for July 2010. On the 19th of June, 2010, the band played at the annual [[Metaltown]] festival in [[Gothenburg]]\n\nTheir sixth studio album, ''[[In His Infernal Majesty's Service]]'', is due November 25 on [[Century Media Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/witchery-official-lyric-video-for-new-song-nosferatu|title=WITCHERY: Official Lyric Video for New Song 'Nosferatu'|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=2016-10-21}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n===Current members===\n*[[Patrik Jensen]] \u2013 guitars (1997\u2013present)\n*Richard Rimf\u00e4lt \u2013 guitars (1997\u2013present)\n*[[Sharlee D'Angelo]] \u2013 bass (1997\u2013present)\n*Angus Norder \u2013 vocals (2016\u2013present)\n*Chris Barkensj\u00f6 \u2013 drums (2016\u2013present)\n\n===Former members===\n====Vocalists====\n*Toxine (Tony Kampner) \u2013 1997\u20132010\n*Legion (Erik Hagstedt) \u2013 2010\u20132011\n*[[Emperor Magus Caligula]] \u2013 2011\u20132016\n\n====Drummers====\n*Mique (Micke Pettersson) \u2013 1997\u20131999\n*[[Martin Axenrot]] \u2013 1999\u20132016\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize  = width:900 height:auto barincrement:16\nPlotArea   = left:130 bottom:170 top:10 right:20\nAlignbars  = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/2021\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1997\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1998\nLegend     = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:1\n\nColors =\n id:vocals  value:red         legend:Vocals\n id:guitar  value:teal        legend:Lead_guitars\n id:guitar2 value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitars\n id:bass    value:blue        legend:Bass\n id:drums   value:orange      legend:Drums,_percussion\n id:studio  value:black       legend:Studio_releases\n id:other   value:gray(0.6)   legend:Others_releases\n\nLineData =\n at:10/02/1998 color:black layer:back\n at:03/29/1999 color:other layer:back\n at:10/22/1999 color:black layer:back\n at:02/01/2001 color:black layer:back\n at:02/27/2006 color:black layer:back\n at:06/21/2010 color:black layer:back\n at:11/25/2016 color:black layer:back\n at:11/10/2017 color:black layer:back\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tony        text:\"Tony Kampner\"\n bar:Erik         text:\"Erik Hagstedt\"\n bar:Magus     text:\"Emperor Magus Caligula\"\n bar:Angus     text:\"Angus Norder\"\n bar:Richard   text:\"Rickard Rimf\u00e4lt\"\n bar:Patrik      text:\"Patrik Jensen\"\n bar:Sharlee   text:\"Sharlee D'Angelo\"\n bar:Mique     text:\"Micke Pettersson\"\n bar:Martin    text:\"Martin Axenrot\"\n bar:Chris      text:\"Chris Barkensj\u00f6\"\n\nPlotData =\n width:11\n bar:Tony        from:01/01/1997 till:04/01/2010  color:vocals\n bar:Erik          from:04/01/2010 till:06/01/2011  color:vocals\n bar:Magus     from:06/01/2011 till:04/01/2016  color:vocals\n bar:Angus      from:04/01/2016 till:end  color:vocals\n bar:Richard    from:01/01/1997 till:end  color:guitar\n bar:Patrik       from:01/01/1997 till:end  color:guitar2\n bar:Sharlee    from:01/01/1997 till:end  color:bass\n bar:Sharlee    from:07/01/1999 till:10/01/1999  color:guitar width:3\n bar:Mique      from:01/01/1997 till:07/01/1999  color:drums\n bar:Martin      from:07/01/1999 till:04/01/2016  color:drums\n bar:Chris        from:04/01/2016 till:end  color:drums\n }}\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n*''[[Restless & Dead]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Dead, Hot and Ready]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Symphony for the Devil (Witchery album)|Symphony for the Devil]]'' (2001)\n*''Don't Fear the Reaper'' (2006)\n*''[[Witchkrieg]]'' (2010)\n*''[[In His Infernal Majesty's Service]]'' (2016)\n*''I Am Legion'' (2017)\n\n===EPs===\n*''[[Witchburner]]'' - [[Necropolis Records|Necropolis]] (1999)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.centurymedia.com/artist.aspx?IdArtist=153 Witchery page at Century Media]\n\n{{Witchery}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Swedish thrash metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Century Media Records artists]]\n[[Category:Nuclear Blast artists]]\n", "name_user": "RSound", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTimeline:Caligula full name", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchery"}

Their project had several goals. They sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape, to examine the sea-bed for shipwrecks (where they found Sinop A-D), to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components, and to seek data about an ancient trade route between Sinop and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nAlthough Sinop served as a primary trade center in the Black Sea, the wrecks were located west of the trade route predicted by the prevalence of Sinopian ceramics on the [[Crimean peninsula]]. On wrecks A-C, mounds of distinctive carrot-shaped shipping jars, called [[amphorae]], were found. They were of a style associated with Sinop and retained much of their original stacking pattern on the sea floor. The jars may have carried a variety of archetypal Black Sea products such as [[olive oil]], [[honey]], [[wine]] or [[fish]] sauce but the contents are presently unknown because no artifacts were recovered from any of these wreck sites in 2000.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe wreck found provided the team with vast information about both the technological changes and trade that occurred in the Black Sea during a period of political, social and economic transition through their study of the ship\u2019s construction techniques. Studies show that in Sinop during the Byzantine era, they had developed long-distance trading as early as 4500 BC. Sea-trading on the Black Sea was most intense during the period of late antiquity, between the 2nd and 7th centuries AD.<ref>Hiebert, F., 2001, Black Sea coastal cultures: trade and interaction, Expedition 43: 11-20</ref> The examination of the four shipwrecks found by Ballard and his team provide the direct evidence for Black Sea maritime trade so well attested by the distribution of ceramics on land.\n\nThe video images of Shipwreck A that were taken show a wall of shipping jars standing about 2m above the sea-bed. The amphorae highest on the mound had fallen over without displacing those still standing in the rows beneath them, and it is likely that the ship settled upright on the sea-bed, gradually being both buried in and filled with sediment as exposed wood was devoured by the larva or the [[shipworm]].\n\nShipwreck B also consisted of a large pile of amphorae but several types are visible, as are multiple timbers protruding from within the mound and on it. In addition to the Sinop-styles jars, several amphorae similar to examples excavated on the [[Yassiada]] Byzantine shipwreck and dating from the 5th to late 6th century AD are present.<ref>van Doorninck, F.

When observing the sonar signature of Shipwreck D, a long, slender upright feature on the sea-bed, transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200m below the surface. Disappointingly for ship scholars and historians of technology, there are few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together. There are no [[mortise and tenon]] fastenings, and no sewing. Shipwreck D may be one of the earliest [[lateen]]-rigged ships to be studied by archaeologists. The angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel. A 2007 expedition to the site, however, identified what may be a mast for an [[Headsail|artemon]], suggesting a different type of vessel.<ref>[http://www.archaeological.org/pdfs/2ndPeoples2008.pdf Deepwater investigations of two Byzantine shipwrecks, 2007]</ref>\n\nThe Institute for Exploration Black Sea expeditions relied on remote sensing with side-scan sonar in shallow and deep water to identify potential archaeological sites examined by [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]s.

Owen was born in [[Crumlin, Caerphilly|Crumlin]], and is proving his worth as a full back. He was discovered by Leeds officials, but the Headingley club with a great wealth of talent allowed him to go to York. He is a brilliant defensive player, and can kick with great power with either foot. He is also a great goalkeeper. Owen has been unfortunate in coming to hand when there were so many full backs of ability in the league. He was, however, selected as reserve to [[Jim Sullivan (rugby league)|Sullivan]] for the [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] and [[England national rugby league team|England]] match in 1926.''\" <ref>[[Imperial Tobacco|Ogden]]'s (circa-1926).
