Only the syrup left from the final crystallization stage is called molasses. Intermediate syrups are called high green and low green, and these are recycled within the crystallization plant to maximize extraction. Beet molasses is 50% sugar by dry weight, predominantly [[sucrose]], but contains significant amounts of [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. Beet molasses is limited in [[biotin]] (vitamin H or B<sub>7</sub>) for cell growth; hence, it may be supplemented with a biotin source. The nonsugar content includes many salts, such as [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[oxalate]], and [[chloride]]. It contains [[trimethylglycine|betaine]] and the trisaccharide [[raffinose]]. These are a result of concentration from the original plant material or chemicals in processing, and make it unpalatable to humans. So, it is mainly used as an additive to animal feed (called \"molassed<!--Note: \"molasses\" is the correct spelling--> sugar beet feed\") or as a fermentation feedstock.\n\nExtracting additional sugar from beet molasses is possible through molasses desugarization. This exploits industrial-scale [[chromatography]] to separate sucrose from non-sugar components. The technique is economically viable in trade-protected areas, where the price of sugar is supported above market price. As such, it is practiced in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.arifractal.com/assbt%201995%20smb%20optimization.pdf \"Chromatographic Separator Optimization\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826001056/http://www.arifractal.com/assbt%201995%20smb%20optimization.pdf |date=2006-08-26 }}</ref> and parts of Europe.

Many foods, including molasses, were once treated with [[sulfur dioxide]] as a preservative, helping to kill off molds and bacteria. Sulfur dioxide is also used as a bleaching agent, as it helps lighten the color of molasses. Most brands have moved away from using sulfured molasses due to both the relatively stable natural shelf life of untreated molasses, and of the off flavor and trace toxicity of low doses of sulfur dioxide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culinarylore.com/food-science:why-does-my-mollases-say-unsulphured |title=Why Does my Molases say Unsulfured?

Beet molasses is 50% sugar by dry weight, predominantly [[sucrose]], but contains significant amounts of [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. Beet molasses is limited in [[biotin]] (vitamin H or B<sub>7</sub>) for cell growth; hence, it may be supplemented with a biotin source. The nonsugar content includes many salts, such as [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[oxalate]], and [[chloride]]. It contains [[trimethylglycine|betaine]] and the trisaccharide [[raffinose]]. These are a result of concentration from the original plant material or chemicals in processing, and make it unpalatable to humans. So, it is mainly used as an additive to animal feed (called \"molassed<!--Note: \"molasses\" is the correct spelling--> sugar beet feed\") or as a fermentation feedstock.\n\nExtracting additional sugar from beet molasses is possible through molasses desugarization. This exploits industrial-scale [[chromatography]] to separate sucrose from non-sugar components. The technique is economically viable in trade-protected areas, where the price of sugar is supported above market price. As such, it is practiced in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.arifractal.com/assbt%201995%20smb%20optimization.pdf \"Chromatographic Separator Optimization\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826001056/http://www.arifractal.com/assbt%201995%20smb%20optimization.pdf |date=2006-08-26 }}</ref> and parts of Europe. Sugar beet molasses is widely consumed in Europe (for example Germany, where it is known as Zuckerr\u00fcbensirup).<ref>{{cite web |title=Zuckerr\u00fcbensirup Translation |url=https://www.dict.cc/german-english/Zuckerr%C3%BCbensirup.html |website=Dict.Cc English-German Dictionary |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> Molasses is also used for [[baker's yeast|yeast]] production.\n\n==Unsulfured molasses==\nMany kinds of molasses on the market come branded as \"unsulfured\". Many foods, including molasses, were once treated with [[sulfur dioxide]] as a preservative, helping to kill off molds and bacteria. Sulfur dioxide is also used as a bleaching agent, as it helps lighten the color of molasses. Most brands have moved away from using sulfured molasses due to both the relatively stable natural shelf life of untreated molasses, and of the off flavor and trace toxicity of low doses of sulfur dioxide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culinarylore.com/food-science:why-does-my-mollases-say-unsulphured |title=Why Does my Molases say Unsulfured?
