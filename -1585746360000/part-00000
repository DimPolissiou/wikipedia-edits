Most of the storms formed either in the [[Mozambique Channel]] or in the far eastern portion of the basin, with five storms crossing from the adjacent [[1998\u201399 Australian region cyclone season|Australian basin]] east of 90\u00b0&nbsp;[[Longitude|E]]. As a result, few storms impacted [[Madagascar]], and none made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[Africa]]n continent. Throughout most of the season, there was below-normal [[sea surface temperature]]s in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. In February, typically the peak in activity, [[R\u00e9union]] island recorded its highest average monthly pressure since 1953. Due to generally unfavorable conditions, there were only six tropical storms tracked by the [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on R\u00e9union. There were only two tropical cyclones &ndash; a storm with winds of at least 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph).\n\nActivity began late, with the first tropical storm &ndash; Alda &ndash; forming on January&nbsp;16, the third latest ever recorded at the time. Alda formed in the [[Mozambique Channel]], which was one of few favorable areas for [[tropical cyclogenesis]] in the season. It brought rainfall to southwestern Madagascar that alleviated previously dry conditions. The next five tropical storms either originated or crossed into the adjacent Australian basin, where storms were monitored by the [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM). Both Tropical Storm Chikita and Tropical Cyclone Davina brought beneficial rainfall to the [[Mascarene Islands]]. The latter storm caused two drowning deaths on R\u00e9union and caused some crop damage. The strongest storm &ndash; Evrina &ndash; peaked as a strong cyclone in the Australian but weakened upon crossing 90\u00b0E, with 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph) in the basin. The final storm was unnamed, crossing from the Australian basin on April&nbsp;21 as a minimal tropical storm before quickly dissipating. There were also several tropical disturbances or depressions, many short-lived. The first of these formed on September&nbsp;3 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and there was a tropical depression in February in the Mozambique Channel that approached tropical storm status.\n\n==Season summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/1998 till:01/06/1999\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/1998\n\nColors     =\n id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n id:GP  value:red\n id:DT  value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)  legend:Tropical_Disturbance_&lt;_50_km/h_(_&lt;_31_mph)\n id:TD  value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_51&ndash;62_km/h_(32&ndash;38_mph)\n id:MS  value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Moderate_tropical_Storm_=_63&ndash;88_km/h_(39&ndash;54_mph)\n id:SS  value:rgb(0.80,1,1)     legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm_=_89&ndash;117_km/h_(55&ndash;73_mph)\n id:TC  value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Tropical_Cyclone_=_118&ndash;165_km/h_(74&ndash;102_mph)\n id:IT  value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Intense_=_166&ndash;212_km/h_(103&ndash;132_mph)\n id:VI  value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Very_Intense_&gt;_212_km/h_(_&gt;_132_mph)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:20/07/1998 till:25/07/1998 color:TD text:\"H4\"\n  from:03/09/1998 till:06/09/1998 color:DT text:\"A1\"\n  from:29/09/1998 till:02/10/1998 color:DT text:\"A2\"\n  from:04/12/1998 till:04/12/1998 color:DT text:\"A3\"\n  from:03/01/1999 till:05/01/1999 color:DT text:\"A4\"\n  from:14/01/1999 till:19/01/1999 color:SS text:\"Alda\"\n  from:28/01/1999 till:02/02/1999 color:MS text:\"Damien-Birenda\"\n  barset:break\n  from:31/01/1999 till:04/02/1999 color:MS text:\"Chikita\"\n  from:11/02/1999 till:17/02/1999 color:TD text:\"D1\"\n  from:23/02/1999 till:06/03/1999 color:DT text:\"D2-E1\"\n  from:28/02/1999 till:20/03/1999 color:DT text:\"E2\"\n  from:02/03/1999 till:19/03/1999 color:IT text:\"Davina\"\n  from:11/03/1999 till:21/03/1999 color:TD text:\"E3\"\n  from:01/04/1999 till:10/04/1999 color:IT text:\"Frederic\u2013Evrina\"\n  barset:break\n  from:21/04/1999 till:24/04/1999 color:MS text:\"Hamish-F1\"\n bar:Month width:6 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/1998 till:01/08/1998 text:July\n  from:01/08/1998 till:01/09/1998 text:August\n  from:01/09/1998 till:01/10/1998 text:September\n  from:01/10/1998 till:01/11/1998 text:October\n  from:01/11/1998 till:01/12/1998 text:November\n  from:01/12/1998 till:01/01/1999 text:December\n  from:01/01/1999 till:01/02/1999 text:January\n  from:01/02/1999 till:01/03/1999 text:February\n  from:01/03/1999 till:01/04/1999 text:March\n  from:01/04/1999 till:01/05/1999 text:April\n  from:01/05/1999 till:01/06/1999 text:May\n</timeline>\n</center>\nThe [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on [[R\u00e9union]] island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin during the season.

In general, [[sea surface temperature]]s were below normal, and [[atmospheric pressure]]s were above normal, both unfavorable for [[tropical cyclogenesis]]. In the month of February, on average the peak time for activity, there was a general lack of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, east of Madagascar. The average monthly pressure on R\u00e9union was the highest since reliable records began in 1953. The low number of storms occurred despite an otherwise active cyclone year in the southern hemisphere. In its summary of the season, the MFR described the lack of activity as \"rare and remarkable\", possibly related to a [[Walker circulation]]. The agency monitored 14&nbsp;tropical disturbances, of which only eight were tropical depressions for at least 24&nbsp;hours. Six of these intensified into tropical storms, three less than the average of nine, of which only two attained tropical cyclone status, or half the average. There were 28&nbsp;days in which there was storm or tropical cyclone activity, less than the average of 42 and at the time the fourth lowest since reliable record-keeping began in 1967 with the advent of satellite imagery.

Most of the storms formed either in the [[Mozambique Channel]] or in the far eastern portion of the basin, with five storms crossing from the adjacent [[1998\u201399 Australian region cyclone season|Australian basin]] east of 90\u00b0&nbsp;[[Longitude|E]]. As a result, few storms impacted [[Madagascar]], and none made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[Africa]]n continent. Throughout most of the season, there was below-normal [[sea surface temperature]]s in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. In February, typically the peak in activity, [[R\u00e9union]] island recorded its highest average monthly pressure since 1953. Due to generally unfavorable conditions, there were only six tropical storms tracked by the [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on R\u00e9union. There were only two tropical cyclones &ndash; a storm with winds of at least 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph).\n\nActivity began late, with the first tropical storm &ndash; Alda &ndash; forming on January&nbsp;16, the third latest ever recorded at the time. Alda formed in the [[Mozambique Channel]], which was one of few favorable areas for [[tropical cyclogenesis]] in the season. It brought rainfall to southwestern Madagascar that alleviated previously dry conditions. The next five tropical storms either originated or crossed into the adjacent Australian basin, where storms were monitored by the [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM). Both Tropical Storm Chikita and Tropical Cyclone Davina brought beneficial rainfall to the [[Mascarene Islands]]. The latter storm caused two drowning deaths on R\u00e9union and caused some crop damage. The strongest storm &ndash; Evrina &ndash; peaked as a strong cyclone in the Australian but weakened upon crossing 90\u00b0E, with 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph) in the basin. The final storm was unnamed, crossing from the Australian basin on April&nbsp;21 as a minimal tropical storm before quickly dissipating. There were also several tropical disturbances or depressions, many short-lived. The first of these formed on September&nbsp;3 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and there was a tropical depression in February in the Mozambique Channel that approached tropical storm status.\n\n==Season summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/1998 till:01/06/1999\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/1998\n\nColors     =\n id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n id:GP  value:red\n id:DT  value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)  legend:Tropical_Disturbance_&lt;_50_km/h_(_&lt;_31_mph)\n id:TD  value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_51&ndash;62_km/h_(32&ndash;38_mph)\n id:MS  value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Moderate_tropical_Storm_=_63&ndash;88_km/h_(39&ndash;54_mph)\n id:SS  value:rgb(0.80,1,1)     legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm_=_89&ndash;117_km/h_(55&ndash;73_mph)\n id:TC  value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Tropical_Cyclone_=_118&ndash;165_km/h_(74&ndash;102_mph)\n id:IT  value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Intense_=_166&ndash;212_km/h_(103&ndash;132_mph)\n id:VI  value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Very_Intense_&gt;_212_km/h_(_&gt;_132_mph)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:20/07/1998 till:25/07/1998 color:TD text:\"4H\"\n  from:03/09/1998 till:06/09/1998 color:DT text:\"A1\"\n  from:29/09/1998 till:02/10/1998 color:DT text:\"A2\"\n  from:04/12/1998 till:04/12/1998 color:DT text:\"A3\"\n  from:03/01/1999 till:05/01/1999 color:DT text:\"A4\"\n  from:14/01/1999 till:19/01/1999 color:SS text:\"Alda\"\n  from:28/01/1999 till:02/02/1999 color:MS text:\"Damien-Birenda\"\n  barset:break\n  from:31/01/1999 till:04/02/1999 color:MS text:\"Chikita\"\n  from:11/02/1999 till:17/02/1999 color:TD text:\"D1\"\n  from:23/02/1999 till:06/03/1999 color:DT text:\"D2-E1\"\n  from:28/02/1999 till:20/03/1999 color:DT text:\"E2\"\n  from:02/03/1999 till:19/03/1999 color:IT text:\"Davina\"\n  from:11/03/1999 till:21/03/1999 color:TD text:\"E3\"\n  from:01/04/1999 till:10/04/1999 color:IT text:\"Frederic\u2013Evrina\"\n  barset:break\n  from:21/04/1999 till:24/04/1999 color:MS text:\"Hamish-F1\"\n bar:Month width:6 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/1998 till:01/08/1998 text:July\n  from:01/08/1998 till:01/09/1998 text:August\n  from:01/09/1998 till:01/10/1998 text:September\n  from:01/10/1998 till:01/11/1998 text:October\n  from:01/11/1998 till:01/12/1998 text:November\n  from:01/12/1998 till:01/01/1999 text:December\n  from:01/01/1999 till:01/02/1999 text:January\n  from:01/02/1999 till:01/03/1999 text:February\n  from:01/03/1999 till:01/04/1999 text:March\n  from:01/04/1999 till:01/05/1999 text:April\n  from:01/05/1999 till:01/06/1999 text:May\n</timeline>\n</center>\nThe [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on [[R\u00e9union]] island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin during the season.

In general, [[sea surface temperature]]s were below normal, and [[atmospheric pressure]]s were above normal, both unfavorable for [[tropical cyclogenesis]]. In the month of February, on average the peak time for activity, there was a general lack of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, east of Madagascar. The average monthly pressure on R\u00e9union was the highest since reliable records began in 1953. The low number of storms occurred despite an otherwise active cyclone year in the southern hemisphere. In its summary of the season, the MFR described the lack of activity as \"rare and remarkable\", possibly related to a [[Walker circulation]]. The agency monitored 14&nbsp;tropical disturbances, of which only eight were tropical depressions for at least 24&nbsp;hours. Six of these intensified into tropical storms, three less than the average of nine, of which only two attained tropical cyclone status, or half the average.

Based on the organization, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression on February&nbsp;13. Although there were gale-force winds in the southwest periphery, the circulation was located on the northern edge of the convection. The depression neared tropical storm intensity, but an increase in wind shear from a nearby trough prevented further intensification. The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 85&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph), making the system a tropical storm by their assessment.
