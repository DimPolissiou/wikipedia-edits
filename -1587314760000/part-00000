Grant]] during the [[American Civil War]], later being [[Brevet (military)|breveted]] a brigadier general. After moving from New York to [[Galena, Illinois]], he taught in the local school, while also becoming involved in local politics. While living in Galena, Rowley was a neighbor and good friends with Ulysses Grant and [[John Aaron Rawlins|John Rawlins]] before and at the time the Civil War broke out. Under General Grant he fought in the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. He was one of nine Civil War generals that came from Galena. After serving in the [[Union Army]] he returned to Galena and service in political life. Rowley was among several officers who wrote letters for and rigorously defended Grant against claims that Grant was drinking at the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. On other occasions during his military and political career Rowley stood by Grant during times of controversy.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Rowley was born on February 8, 1824, in [[Gouverneur, New York]], in [[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]], in northern-most New York. He came to Galena, in [[Jo Daviess County, Illinois]], in 1843, and taught school in [[Brown County, Ohio]], and in Jo Daviess County, Illinois.<ref name=newsletter>[[#newsletter|The Ulysses S. Grant Association Newsletter, 1972, Volume X,1]]</ref> Rowley married Elizabeth Miller in 1847, with their marriage producing four children.<ref name=grantmuseum/> However, a discrepancy exists between accounts of his wife's name and number of children, i.e. it is also reported that her maiden name was ''Caroline Brush'', whom he married in February 1862, in [[Northport, New York|North Port]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], NY, and mentions only three children, Charles, Alice, and Martha.<ref>[http://illinoisancestors.org/jodaviess/williamrowlycivilwar.html Caudell and contributors, Illinois Ancestors.org]</ref>\n\nIn 1849 Rowley was appointed assessor and collector for Jo Daviess County. Between 1847 and 1861, Rowley held several other positions for the county government, including deputy circuit clerk and sheriff.<ref name=newsletter/> Future soldier and  author, Wilbur F. Crummer, who later wrote a book{{efn|See Bibliography}} about his experiences with Grant, Rowley, Rawlins and others, was then under the employ of Rowley at this time. In 1861 Rowley moved his family to 515 Hill Street in Galena, next door to the home of John Rawlins.<ref name=grantmuseum/> Notable people such as [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[John Aaron Rawlins|John Rawlins]] and Illinois Congressman, [[Elihu B. Washburne]], were among Rowley's neighbors and were residents of Galena at the time.<ref>{{*}}[[#wilson|Wilson, 1912]], pp. 23\u201325, 49&nbsp;&nbsp;{{*}}[[#mcfeely|McFeely, 1981]], p. 73&nbsp;&nbsp;{{*}}[[#crummer|Crummer, 1915]], pp.173\u2013174</ref>\n\n==Civil War==\nWhen the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] on April 12, 1861, and the news reached Galena the day after, Rowley was among the roused gathering that assembled in town. Also among them was future generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and [[John Aaron Rawlins|John Rawlins]]. Rawlins later became [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] when Grant was elected president in 1869.<ref name=grantmuseum>[[#museum|Galena Historical Society and Ulysses S. Grant Museum: Essay, 2012]]</ref><ref>[[#mcfeely|McFeely, 1981, p. 291]]</ref> After Rawlins' inspiring speech Grant confided in Rowley, saying that the speech \"stirred my patriotism\" and had rekindled his military ardor. As the crowd dispersed Rowley said to Grant, \"Well Captain Grant, it was a fine meeting after all\", where Grant replied quietly, \"Yes: we're about to ''do'' something now.\"<ref>[[#white|White, 2016]], pp.224\u2013225</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 1861, Rowley was appointed first lieutenant of Company D of the [[45th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|45th Illinois Infantry Regiment]], attached to the [[Army of the Tennessee]], and  officially joined the war effort on November 20, 1861, in Colonel [[John E. Smith]]'s 45th Illinois, commonly known among soldiers as the ''Washburne Lead Mine Regiment''.{{efn|Organized at Galena, Ill., and mustered in at Camp Douglas, Ill., December 25, 1861.<ref>[[#45th|American Civil War Archive; 45th Regiment Infantry \"Washburn Lead Mine Regiment\"]]</ref>}} At that time Rowley represented Grant's strongest tie with his Republican supporters in Galena, especially [[Elihu B. Washburne]]. As Rowley was constantly with Grant, he was well informed of Grant's affairs and whereabouts. Grant at times would use Rowley to communicate information or for forwarding requests to Washington<ref name=newsletter/>\n\n===Battle of Fort Donelson===\nRowley fought with the 45th Illinois volunteers at the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]], in which General Grant's army captured the confederate fort, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[John B. Floyd]], in February, 1862. After the battle  Rowley was commissioned captain and transferred to Grant's staff as an [[aide-de-camp]]. Grant, having been promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]], was permitted three aides and chose his friend and former neighbor from Galena as his third aide.<ref>[[#smith|Smith, 2001]], pp. 301\u2013302</ref><ref>[[#dana|Dana, 1909]], p. 74</ref><ref name=richardson232>[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]], p. 232</ref> After service at Fort Donelson, Rowley was moved to and was stationed at [[Savannah, Tennessee|Savannah]] from March 4\u201311.<ref>[[#45th|American Civil War Archive, 2016: 45th Regiment Infantry]]</ref>\n\n===Battle of Shiloh===\nRowley also fought in the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862. Due to the surprise of his army and the consequent heavy loss of life at Shiloh, General Grant was strongly criticized in many Northern newspapers. Grant had placed much of the blame on General [[Lew Wallace]], whom he had sent verbal orders to, accusing Wallace of failing to following those orders, which he believed resulted in the delay of Wallace in moving up his troops to the front during the first day of the battle, nearly resulting in a Union defeat. After learning that Wallace refused to obey anything but ''written'' orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders\", and first sent Rowley,<ref>[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]] p. 243</ref> ordering him to \"tell him to come up at once\" and that \"if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once\", while also instructing Rowley to make sure he brought writing materials.<ref name=groom305>[[#groom|Groom, 2012]], p. 305</ref><ref>[[#woodworth|Woodworth, 2005]], p. 177</ref>\n\nRowley finally caught up to where Wallace and one brigade of his division last were, only to find a supply wagon departing the scene. He rode on further and found General Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lay just ahead, exclaiming, \"I've been sent to hurry you up. Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole (Confederate) army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it.\"<ref name=groom305/> Rowley further exclaimed, \"I had a devil of a time finding you!\" Wallace asked, \"Does General Grant send me orders?\" Rowley replied, \"Yes, he wants you at [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee|Pittsburg Landing]]&mdash;and he wants you there like hell.\"<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace, Leeke, 1998]], pp. 115-116</ref><ref name=wallace466>[[#wallace1|Wallace, 1908]], p. 466-467</ref> Actually, Wallace had received an order from Grant that had passed through two other staffers, directing him to the right of the army, which Grant denied was Wallace's destination. Wallace stunned by the news, said that was the second such message he received and immediately sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation. Upon their return they had confirmed Rowley's claim, and Wallace countermarched to reach the battlefield.<ref name=groom305/><ref>[[#timothy|Smith, Timothy, 2013]] pp.90\u201391</ref> Later, in his Autobiography, Wallace wrote about his encounter with Rowley, how he realized he was at the rear of the entire Confederate army, and how he was stunned by the news.<ref name=wallace466/> Rowley and [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Douglas Putnam]] later corroborated Grant's account of the event when Grant was being criticized for the heavy losses involved in the battle.<ref>[[#stephens|Stephens, 2010]], pp. 79\u201384</ref> In the aftermath of the costly battle, rumors also emerged that Grant was delayed at [[Savannah, Tennessee|Savannah]] because he had been drinking.<ref>{{*}}[[#crummer|Crummer, 1915]], p. 175&nbsp;&nbsp;{{*}}[[#white|White, 2016]], p.225</ref>\n\nRowley and other officers that were with Grant gave a starkly different account of his capacity, and performance, than those of disgruntled or enterprising newspaper reporters who were far away from Grant during the battle.{{efn|A number of reporters had previous bad experiences with Generals [[Henry Halleck|Halleck]] and Grant.<ref name=mahoney336>[[#mahoney|Mahoney, 2016]], p. 336</ref>}} Answering a letter of inquiry about newspaper reports, Rowley maintained Grant's innocence. The letter below is addressed to Edward Hempstead,{{efn|A relative of Washburne}} and was copied by him and forwarded to Washburne.{{efn|The text comes from the copy in the Washburne Papers, Library of Congress.<ref name=newsletter/>}}\n\n{{quote|Head Quarters Army in the Field\nNear Pittsburg Tenn, April 19th 1862\n\nE Hempstead Esqr\n\n... I pronounce it an unmitigated slander. I have been on his Staff ever since the Donelson affair (and saw him frequently during that) and necessary in close contact with him every day, and I have never seen him take even a glass of liquor more than two or three times in my life and then only a single at a time. And I have never seen him intoxicated or even approximate to it. As to the story that he was intoxicated at the Battle of Pittsburg, I have only to say that the man who fabricated the story is an infamous liar, and you are at liberty to say to him that I say so. ... \n\nYours &c ''W R ROWLEY''\n\nP S &nbsp;I can probably explain to you some of the reasons why this man Chapman{{efn|Frank G. Chapman, reporter for the New York Herald, was previously expelled from [[Henry Halleck|General Halleck]]'s district. Chapman, who wrote an inaccurate newspaper article of the battle at Shiloh, had a reputation for slipshod journalism.<ref>[[#andrews|Andrews, 1955]], p. 265</ref>}} has such an interest in lying about Gen Grant. When he was at Donelson he made himself so obnoxious that Gen Grant issued a special order, directing him to be removed outside of our lines, and to remain there.<ref name=newsletter/>}}\n\nSeveral days later, Rowley wrote directly to Washburne about the misgivings concerning the battle, although the primary reason for the letter was to recommend the promotions of Grant's aides Clark B. Lagow and William S. Hillyer to colonel.  This letter is also in the Library of Congress and among the Washburne Papers. \n\n{{quote|Head Quarters Army of the Tennessee<br>Pittsburg April 23d 1862\n\nFriend Washburne I have intended ever since the Battle at this place to have written you a letter, but the hurry and confusion incident to such a fight as we have had prevented ... it. ... First however a word with reference to the Thousand and one stories that are afloat with reference to Gen Grant suffice it to say they have the same foundation as did those that were circulated after the Battle of Donelson and no more: It is sufficient to say that Gen Halleck is now here and the conduct of the Battle and all the details meet his entire approbation and the stories in circulation have their origin in the efforts of Cowardly hounds who \"stampeded\" and now would be glad to turn public attention from themselves, and direct it elsewhere, together with the eagerness of Newspaper Correspondents to get items I who was on the field know that had it not been for the almost superhuman efforts of the Gen' added to the assistance he had from his officers we would have been forced to Record a defeat instead of one of the most Brilliant victories that was ever won on any field ... \n\nYours &c ''W R ROWLEY'' <ref name=newsletter/>}}\n\nRawlins corroborated Rowley's account of Grant's whereabouts and performance, maintaining that the rumors were typically \"unmitigated slander\" and that he had never seen Grant at any time take a drink, and that \"Grant and his staff\" were on the battlefield by 7 A.M.<ref name=mahoney336/> Colonel [[John E. Smith]], also of the 45th Illinois, corroborated Rowley's claim as well, maintaining that the army was \"astonished\" to hear such claims, and that they were made by \"those who are jealous of him\". Colonel [[Jacob Ammen]], who had also seen Grant at Savannah and at Pittsburg Landing, in like manner claimed \"I am satisfied General Grant was not under the influence of liquor, either of the times I saw him.<ref>[[#catton60|Catton, 1960, Chap 12]]</ref> Rowley was soon promoted to Major General of Volunteers and later served on a detail as [[United States Army Provost Marshal General|Provost Marshal General]] of Departments of [[Army of the Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[Army of the Cumberland|Cumberland]], in 1863.<ref name=grantmuseum/><ref>[[#white|White, 2016]], pp. 224\u2013225</ref><ref>[[#bone|Bonekemper, 2004]], p. 152</ref>\n\n===Vicksburg campaign===\nRowley was also present during the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg Campaign]] during the late spring of 1863. He was appointed Lieutenant Colonel and Military Secretary on Grant's Staff, when Grant assumed the rank of [[lieutenant general]] on March 2, 1864.{{efn|[[James B.

Rowley, 1878.JPG|thumb|upright|William Rowley in 1878]]\nAfter his military career, Rowley returned to the post of Jo Daviess County Circuit Clerk until 1876, and later was judge of the county court. In July 1866, for his service in the war, Rowley was [[Brevet (military)|breveted]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] of volunteers on Grant's recommendation.<ref name=grantmuseum/> He remained friends with fellow soldier Wilbur Crummer with whom he often talked about events they shared together during the Civil War. Crummer, in his 1915 book about the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh and Vicksburg, noted that enemies of Grant circulated stories about his alleged drinking, and wrote of Rowley, that any time the subject came up, it would prove to be \"the spark that exploded the magazine of wrath and where Rowley would typically reply: \"All a damned lie\", sentiments that were also shared by Crummer.<ref>[[#crummer|Crummer, 1915]], pp. 174\u2013175</ref>\n\nIn June 1880, while the [[1880 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]] was in session in Chicago, former general and president Grant and his family were living in Galena. After being persuaded by his wife and political friends to stand for a nomination and run for office a third time, he finally consented. Grant would come down town in the morning on a daily basis and would spent an hour or two with Judge Rowley, now an old friend and former comrade, at his office, and would often talk about his recent [[Ulysses S. Grant#World tour and diplomacy|tour around the world]]. During the convention Rowley's office would receive many telegrams, and while Rowley and others would receive them with great interest, Grant showed little, until one arrived with some descending news about an old trusted friend, [[Elihu B. Washburne]], also on the list of presidential nominations. Washburne, now a competitor of Grant, was withdrawing his support and making disparaging statements about Grant, which ultimately ended their long friendship. While Grant received the news in his usual calm manner, Rowley and others, however, were very outspoken with their denunciation of Washburne.<ref>[[#crummer|Crummer, 1915]], pp. 179\u2013182</ref>\n\nRowley spent his final years in Galena and died on February 9, 1886, at the age of 62, and is buried in Galena's [[Greenwood Cemetery (Galena, Illinois)|Greenwood Cemetery]].<ref name=grantmuseum/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|American Civil War|Biography|Illinois}}\n* [[List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union)#R|List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union)]]\n* [[Bibliography of Ulysses S.

Grant]] during the [[American Civil War]], later being [[Brevet (military)|breveted]] a brigadier general. After moving from New York to [[Galena, Illinois]], he taught in the local school, while also becoming involved in local politics. While living in Galena, Rowley was a neighbor and good friends with Ulysses Grant and [[John Aaron Rawlins|John Rawlins]] before and at the time the Civil War broke out. Under General Grant he fought in the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. He was one of nine Civil War generals that came from Galena. After serving in the [[Union Army]] he returned to Galena and service in political life. Rowley was among several officers who wrote letters for and rigorously defended Grant against claims that Grant was drinking at the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. On other occasions during his military and political career Rowley stood by Grant during times of controversy.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Rowley was born on February 8, 1824, in [[Gouverneur, New York]], in [[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]], in northern-most New York. He came to Galena, in [[Jo Daviess County, Illinois]], in 1843, and taught school in [[Brown County, Ohio]], and in Jo Daviess County, Illinois.<ref name=newsletter>[[#newsletter|The Ulysses S. Grant Association Newsletter, 1972, Volume X,1]]</ref> Rowley married Elizabeth Miller in 1847, with their marriage producing four children.<ref name=grantmuseum/> However, a discrepancy exists between accounts of his wife's name and number of children, i.e. it is also reported that her maiden name was ''Caroline Brush'', whom he married in February 1862, in [[Northport, New York|North Port]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], NY, and mentions only three children, Charles, Alice, and Martha.<ref>[http://illinoisancestors.org/jodaviess/williamrowlycivilwar.html Caudell and contributors, Illinois Ancestors.org]</ref>\n\nIn 1849 Rowley was appointed assessor and collector for Jo Daviess County. Between 1847 and 1861, Rowley held several other positions for the county government, including deputy circuit clerk and sheriff.<ref name=newsletter/> Future soldier and  author, Wilbur F. Crummer, who later wrote a book{{efn|See Bibliography}} about his experiences with Grant, Rowley, Rawlins and others, was then under the employ of Rowley at this time. In 1861 Rowley moved his family to 515 Hill Street in Galena, next door to the home of John Rawlins.<ref name=grantmuseum/> Notable people such as [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[John Aaron Rawlins|John Rawlins]] and Illinois Congressman, [[Elihu B. Washburne]], were among Rowley's neighbors and were residents of Galena at the time.<ref>{{*}}[[#wilson|Wilson, 1912]], pp. 23\u201325, 49&nbsp;&nbsp;{{*}}[[#mcfeely|McFeely, 1981]], p. 73&nbsp;&nbsp;{{*}}[[#crummer|Crummer, 1915]], pp.173\u2013174</ref>\n\n==Civil War==\nWhen the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] on April 12, 1861, and the news reached Galena the day after, Rowley was among the roused gathering that assembled in town. Also among them was future generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and [[John Aaron Rawlins|John Rawlins]]. Rawlins later became [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] when Grant was elected president in 1869.<ref name=grantmuseum>[[#museum|Galena Historical Society and Ulysses S. Grant Museum: Essay, 2012]]</ref><ref>[[#mcfeely|McFeely, 1981, p. 291]]</ref> After Rawlins' inspiring speech Grant confided in Rowley, saying that the speech \"stirred my patriotism\" and had rekindled his military ardor. As the crowd dispersed Rowley said to Grant, \"Well Captain Grant, it was a fine meeting after all\", where Grant replied quietly, \"Yes: we're about to ''do'' something now.\"<ref>[[#white|White, 2016]], pp.224\u2013225</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 1861, Rowley was appointed first lieutenant of Company D of the [[45th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|45th Illinois Infantry Regiment]], attached to the [[Army of the Tennessee]], and  officially joined the war effort on November 20, 1861, in Colonel [[John E. Smith]]'s 45th Illinois, commonly known among soldiers as the ''Washburne Lead Mine Regiment''.{{efn|Organized at Galena, Ill., and mustered in at Camp Douglas, Ill., December 25, 1861.<ref>[[#45th|American Civil War Archive; 45th Regiment Infantry \"Washburn Lead Mine Regiment\"]]</ref>}} At that time Rowley represented Grant's strongest tie with his Republican supporters in Galena, especially [[Elihu B. Washburne]]. As Rowley was constantly with Grant, he was well informed of Grant's affairs and whereabouts. Grant at times would use Rowley to communicate information or for forwarding requests to Washington<ref name=newsletter/>\n\n===Battle of Fort Donelson===\nRowley fought with the 45th Illinois volunteers at the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]], capturing the confederate fort, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[John B. Floyd]], in February, 1862. After the battle  Rowley was commissioned captain and transferred to Grant's staff as an [[aide-de-camp]]. Grant, having been promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]], was permitted three aides and chose his friend and former neighbor from Galena as his third aide.<ref>[[#smith|Smith, 2001]], pp. 301\u2013302</ref><ref>[[#dana|Dana, 1909]], p. 74</ref><ref name=richardson232>[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]], p. 232</ref> After service at Fort Donelson, Rowley was moved to and was stationed at [[Savannah, Tennessee|Savannah]] from March 4\u201311.<ref>[[#45th|American Civil War Archive, 2016: 45th Regiment Infantry]]</ref>\n\n===Battle of Shiloh===\nRowley also fought in the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862. Due to the heavy loss of life at Shiloh, General Grant was strongly criticized in many Northern newspapers. Grant had placed much of the blame on General [[Lew Wallace]], whom he had sent verbal orders to, accusing Wallace of failing to following those orders, which he believed resulted in the delay of Wallace in moving up his troops to the front during the first day of the battle, nearly resulting in a Union defeat. After learning that Wallace refused to obey anything but ''written'' orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders\", and first sent Rowley,<ref>[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]] p. 243</ref> ordering him to \"tell him to come up at once\" and that \"if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once\", while also instructing Rowley to make sure he brought writing materials.<ref name=groom305>[[#groom|Groom, 2012]], p. 305</ref><ref>[[#woodworth|Woodworth, 2005]], p. 177</ref>\n\nRowley finally caught up to where Wallace's division last was, only to find a supply wagon departing the scene. He rode on further and found General Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lied just ahead, exclaiming, \"I've been sent to hurry you up. Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole (Confederate) army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it.\"<ref name=groom305/> Rowley further exclaimed, \"I had a devil of a time finding you!\" Wallace asked, \"Does General Grant send me orders?\" Rowley replied, \"Yes, he wants you at [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee|Pittsburg Landing]]&mdash;and he wants you there like hell.\"<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace, Leeke, 1998]], pp. 115-116</ref><ref name=wallace466>[[#wallace1|Wallace, 1908]], p. 466-467</ref> Wallace, stunned by the news, said that was the second such message he received and immediately sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation. Upon their return they had confirmed Rowley's claim.<ref name=groom305/><ref>[[#timothy|Smith, Timothy, 2013]] pp.90\u201391</ref> Later, in his Autobiography, Wallace wrote about his encounter with Rowley, how he realized he was at the rear of the entire Confederate army, and how he was stunned by the news.<ref name=wallace466/> Rowley and [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Douglas Putnam]] later corroborated Grant's account of the event when Grant was being criticized for the heavy losses involved in the battle.<ref>[[#stephens|Stephens, 2010]], pp. 79\u201384</ref> In the aftermath of the costly battle, rumors also emerged that Grant was delayed at [[Savannah, Tennessee|Savannah]] because he had been drinking.<ref>{{*}}[[#crummer|Crummer, 1915]], p. 175&nbsp;&nbsp;{{*}}[[#white|White, 2016]], p.225</ref>\n\nRowley and other officers that were with Grant gave a starkly different account of his capacity, and performance, than those of disgruntled or enterprising newspaper reporters who were far away from Grant during the battle.{{efn|A number of reporters had previous bad experiences with Generals [[Henry Halleck|Halleck]] and Grant.<ref name=mahoney336>[[#mahoney|Mahoney, 2016]], p. 336</ref>}} Answering a letter of inquiry about newspaper reports, Rowley maintained Grant's innocence. The letter below is addressed to Edward Hempstead,{{efn|A relative of Washburne}} and was copied by him and forwarded to Washburne.{{efn|The text comes from the copy in the Washburne Papers, Library of Congress.<ref name=newsletter/>}}\n\n{{quote|Head Quarters Army in the Field\nNear Pittsburg Tenn, April 19th 1862\n\nE Hempstead Esqr\n\n... I pronounce it an unmitigated slander. I have been on his Staff ever since the Donelson affair (and saw him frequently during that) and necessary in close contact with him every day, and I have never seen him take even a glass of liquor more than two or three times in my life and then only a single at a time. And I have never seen him intoxicated or even approximate to it. As to the story that he was intoxicated at the Battle of Pittsburg, I have only to say that the man who fabricated the story is an infamous liar, and you are at liberty to say to him that I say so. ... \n\nYours &c ''W R ROWLEY''\n\nP S &nbsp;I can probably explain to you some of the reasons why this man Chapman{{efn|Frank G. Chapman, reporter for the New York Herald, was previously expelled from [[Henry Halleck|General Halleck]]'s district. Chapman, who wrote an inaccurate newspaper article of the battle at Shiloh, had a reputation for slipshod journalism.<ref>[[#andrews|Andrews, 1955]], p. 265</ref>}} has such an interest in lying about Gen Grant. When he was at Donelson he made himself so obnoxious that Gen Grant issued a special order, directing him to be removed outside of our lines, and to remain there.<ref name=newsletter/>}}\n\nSeveral days later, Rowley wrote directly to Washburne about the misgivings concerning the battle, although the primary reason for the letter was to recommend the promotions of Grant's aides Clark B. Lagow and William S. Hillyer to colonel.  This letter is also in the Library of Congress and among the Washburne Papers. \n\n{{quote|Head Quarters Army of the Tennessee<br>Pittsburg April 23d 1862\n\nFriend Washburne I have intended ever since the Battle at this place to have written you a letter, but the hurry and confusion incident to such a fight as we have had prevented ... it. ... First however a word with reference to the Thousand and one stories that are afloat with reference to Gen Grant suffice it to say they have the same foundation as did those that were circulated after the Battle of Donelson and no more: It is sufficient to say that Gen Halleck is now here and the conduct of the Battle and all the details meet his entire approbation and the stories in circulation have their origin in the efforts of Cowardly hounds who \"stampeded\" and now would be glad to turn public attention from themselves, and direct it elsewhere, together with the eagerness of Newspaper Correspondents to get items I who was on the field know that had it not been for the almost superhuman efforts of the Gen' added to the assistance he had from his officers we would have been forced to Record a defeat instead of one of the most Brilliant victories that was ever won on any field ... \n\nYours &c ''W R ROWLEY'' <ref name=newsletter/>}}\n\nRawlins corroborated Rowley's account of Grant's whereabouts and performance, maintaining that the rumors were typically \"unmitigated slander\" and that he had never seen Grant at any time take a drink, and that \"Grant and his staff\" were on the battlefield by 7 A.M.<ref name=mahoney336/> Colonel [[John E. Smith]], also of the 45th Illinois, corroborated Rowley's claim as well, maintaining that the army was \"astonished\" to hear such claims, and that they were made by \"those who are jealous of him\". Colonel [[Jacob Ammen]], who had also seen Grant at Savannah and at Pittsburg Landing, in like manner claimed \"I am satisfied General Grant was not under the influence of liquor, either of the times I saw him.<ref>[[#catton60|Catton, 1960, Chap 12]]</ref> Rowley was soon promoted to Major General of Volunteers and later served on a detail as [[United States Army Provost Marshal General|Provost Marshal General]] of Departments of [[Army of the Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[Army of the Cumberland|Cumberland]], in 1863.<ref name=grantmuseum/><ref>[[#white|White, 2016]], pp. 224\u2013225</ref><ref>[[#bone|Bonekemper, 2004]], p. 152</ref>\n\n===Vicksburg campaign===\nRowley was also present during the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg Campaign]] during the late spring of 1863. He was appointed Lieutenant Colonel and Military Secretary on Grant's Staff, when Grant assumed the rank of [[lieutenant general]] on March 2, 1864.{{efn|[[James B.

Rowley, 1878.JPG|thumb|upright|William Rowley in 1878]]\nAfter his military career, Rowley returned to the post of Jo Daviess County Circuit Clerk until 1876, and later was judge of the county court. In July 1866, for his service in the war, Rowley was [[Brevet (military)|breveted]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] of volunteers on Grant's recommendation.<ref name=grantmuseum/> He remained friends with fellow soldier Wilbur Crummer with whom he often talked about events they shared together during the Civil War. Crummer, in his 1915 book about the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh and Vicksburg, noted that enemies of Grant circulated stories about his alleged drinking, and wrote of Rowley, that any time the subject came up, it would prove to be \"the spark that exploded the magazine of wrath and where Rowley would typically reply: \"All a damned lie\", sentiments that were also shared by Crummer.<ref>[[#crummer|Crummer, 1915]], pp. 174\u2013175</ref>\n\nIn June 1880, while the [[1880 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]] was in session in Chicago, former general and president Grant and his family were living in Galena. After being persuaded by his wife and political friends to stand for a nomination and run for office a third time, he finally consented. Grant would come down town in the morning on a daily basis and would spent an hour or two with Judge Rowley, now an old friend and former comrade, at his office, and would often talk about his recent [[Ulysses S. Grant#World tour and diplomacy|tour around the world]]. During the convention Rowley's office would receive many telegrams, and while Rowley and others would receive them with great interest, Grant showed little, until one arrived with some descending news about an old trusted friend, [[Elihu B. Washburne]], also on the list of presidential nominations. Washburne, now a competitor of Grant, was withdrawing his support and making disparaging statements about Grant, which ultimately ended their long friendship. While Grant received the news in his usual calm manner, Rowley and others, however, were very outspoken with their denunciation of Washburne.<ref>[[#crummer|Crummer, 1915]], pp. 179\u2013182</ref>\n\nRowley spent his final years in Galena and died on February 9, 1886, at the age of 62, and is buried in Galena's [[Greenwood Cemetery (Galena, Illinois)|Greenwood Cemetery]].<ref name=grantmuseum/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|American Civil War|Biography|Illinois}}\n* [[List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union)#R|List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union)]]\n* [[Bibliography of Ulysses S.

This was the first post-War sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being the first of the modern era of UFO sightings, including numerous reported sightings over the next two to three weeks. Arnold's description of the objects also led to the press quickly coining the terms ''[[flying saucer]]'' and ''flying disc'' as popular descriptive terms for UFOs.\n\n==Sighting==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\n{{Location map+|Washington|width=350|float = right|caption='''Locations of Kenneth Arnold's plane and the sighted objects'''<br>The objects arrived from the direction of Mount Baker, then passed in front of Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in the space of 1 min. 42 s.

He made a brief detour after learning of a $5,000 reward (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|5000|1947|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) for the discovery of a U.S. Marine Corps [[C-46 Commando|C-46]] transport airplane that had crashed near Mt. Rainier. The skies were completely clear and there was a mild wind.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nA few minutes before 3:00&nbsp;p.m. (15:00) at about {{convert|9200|ft|m}} in altitude and near [[Mineral, Washington]], he gave up his search and started heading eastward towards Yakima. He saw a bright flashing light, similar to sunlight reflecting from a [[mirror]]. Afraid he might be dangerously close to another aircraft, Arnold scanned the skies around him, but all he could see was a [[DC-4]] to his left and behind him, about {{convert|15|mi|km}} away.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAbout 30 seconds after seeing the first flash of light, Arnold saw a series of bright flashes in the distance off to his left, or north of [[Mt. Rainier]], which was then from {{convert|20|to|25|mi|km}} away. He thought they might be reflections on his airplane's windows, but a few quick tests (rocking his airplane from side to side, removing his eyeglasses, later rolling down his side window) ruled this out. The reflections came from flying objects. They flew in a long chain, and Arnold for a moment considered they might be a flock of geese, but quickly ruled this out for a number of reasons, including the altitude, bright glint, and obviously very fast speed. He then thought they might be a new type of jet and started looking intently for a tail and was surprised that he couldn't find any.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThey quickly approached Rainier and then passed in front, usually appearing dark in profile against the bright white snowfield covering Rainier, but occasionally still giving off bright light flashes as they flipped around erratically. Sometimes he said he could see them on edge, when they seemed so thin and flat they were practically invisible. According to [[Jerome Clark]],<ref>{{Cite book | last = Clark | first = Jerome | title = The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial | publisher = Visible Ink | edition =  | location =  | year = 1998 | page =  | isbn = 1-57859-029-9 | url = https://archive.org/details/ufobookencyclope0000clar }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Clark | first = Jerome | title = The UFO Encyclopedia: The Phenomenon from the Beginning | publisher = Omnigraphics | volume = A-K | edition = | location = Detroit | origyear = 1998| year = 2005 | page = | isbn = 0-7808-0097-4 }}</ref> Arnold described them as a series of objects with convex shapes, though he later revealed that one object differed by being [[crescent]]-shaped. Several years later, Arnold would state he likened their movement to saucers skipping on water, without comparing their actual shapes to saucers,<ref name=Murrow/> but initial quotes from him do indeed have him comparing the shape to a \"saucer\", \"disc\", \"pie pan\", or \"half moon\", or generally convex and thin (discussion below). At one point Arnold said they flew behind a subpeak of Rainier and briefly disappeared. Knowing his position and the position of the (unspecified) subpeak, Arnold placed their distance as they flew past Rainier at about {{convert|23|mi|km}}.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nUsing a [[Dzus fastener|dzus]] [[cowling]] fastener as a gauge to compare the nine objects to the distant DC-4, Arnold estimated their angular size as slightly smaller than the DC-4, about the width between the outer engines (about {{cvt|60|ft|||}}). Arnold also said he realized that the objects would have to be quite large to see any details at that distance and later, after comparing notes with a United Airlines crew that had a similar sighting 10 days later (see below), placed the absolute size as larger than a DC-4 airliner (or greater than {{convert|100|ft|m}} in length). Army Air Force analysts would later estimate 140 to {{convert|280|ft|m}}, based on analysis of human [[visual acuity]] and other sighting details (such as estimated distance).{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n \nArnold said the objects were grouped together, as Ted Bloecher<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080413203646/http://www.mimufon.org/historical_folders/nicap_pages/ReportOnWaveOf1947.pdf The UFO Wave of 1947] by Ted Bloecher, 1967; URL accessed March 7, 2007</ref> writes, \"in a diagonally stepped-down, [[echelon formation]], stretched out over a distance that he later calculated to be five miles\". Though moving on a more or less level horizontal plane, Arnold said the objects weaved from side to side (\"like the tail of a Chinese kite\" as he later stated), darting through the valleys and around the smaller mountain peaks. They would occasionally flip or bank on their edges in unison as they turned or maneuvered causing almost blindingly bright or mirror-like flashes of light. The encounter gave him an \"eerie feeling\", but Arnold suspected he had seen test flights of a new U.S. military aircraft.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs the objects passed Mt Rainer, Arnold turned his plane southward on a more or less parallel course. It was at this point that he opened his side window and began observing the objects unobstructed by any glass that might have produced reflections. The objects did not disappear and continued to move very rapidly southward, continuously moving forward of his position. Curious about their speed, he began to time their rate of passage: he said they moved from Mt. Rainer to [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] where they faded from view, a distance of about {{convert|50|mi|km}}, in one minute and forty-two seconds, according to the clock on his instrument panel. When he later had time to do the calculation, the speed was over {{convert|1700|mi/h|km/h}}. This was about three times faster than any manned aircraft in 1947. Not knowing exactly the distance where the objects faded from view, Arnold conservatively and arbitrarily rounded this down to {{convert|1200|mi|km}} an hour, still faster than any known aircraft, which had yet to break the [[sound barrier]]. It was this [[supersonic]] speed in addition to the unusual saucer or disk description that seemed to capture people's attention.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Arnold shares the story===\nArnold landed in Yakima at about 4:00&nbsp;p.m., and quickly told friend and airport general manager Al Baxter the amazing story, and before long, the entire airport staff knew of Arnold's claims. He discussed the story with the staff, and later wrote that Baxter didn't believe him.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n \nArnold flew on to an air show in [[Pendleton, Oregon]], not knowing that somebody in Yakima had phoned in ahead to say that Arnold had seen some strange new aircraft. It was at this time that Arnold studied his maps, determined the distance between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams, and calculated the rather astonishing speed. He told a number of pilot friends, and wrote in his account to AAF intelligence that they did not scoff or laugh. Instead they suggested that maybe he had seen guided missiles or something new, although Arnold felt this explanation to be inadequate. He also wrote that some former Army pilots told him that they had been briefed before going into combat \"that they might see objects of similar shape and design as I described and assured me that I wasn't dreaming or going crazy\" (see [[Foo fighter]]).{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nArnold wasn't interviewed by reporters until the next day (June 25) when he went to the office of the ''[[East Oregonian]]'' in Pendleton.<ref>Lagrange, Pierre (1988), [https://pierrelagrangesociologie.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/lagrange-impossiblebut-spencerevans-1988.pdf \u00ab \u201c It Seems Impossible, but There It Is \u201d \u00bb], in John Spencer & Hilary Evans (eds.), ''Phenomenon: From Flying Saucers to UFOs - Forty Years of Facts and Research''.

He also gave the impression of being a careful observer ... These details impressed the newspapermen who interviewed him and lent credibility to his report.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nArnold would soon complain about the effects of the publicity on his life. On June 27 he was reported saying: \"I haven't had a moment of peace since I first told the story.\" He then said a preacher had called and told him that the objects he saw were \"harbingers of doomsday\" and that the preacher was preparing his congregation \"for the end of the world.\"  In another encounter, a woman in a Pendleton cafe noticed him and dashed out shrieking: \"There's the man who saw the men from Mars.\"  She ran out \"sobbing she would have to do something for the children,\" Arnold was reported as saying \"with a shudder\".{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nHe then added that, \"This whole thing has gotten out of hand. I want to talk to the FBI or someone. Half the people look at me as a combination of Einstein, [[Flash Gordon]] and screwball. I wonder what my wife back in Idaho thinks.\"<ref>Spokane (Washington) ''Daily Chronicle'', p. 1 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=ddB7do2jUx8C&dat=19470627&printsec=frontpage], Eugene (Oregon) ''Register-Guard'', June 27, 1947, p. 1 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y-ZPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EwgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2397,6600678&dq=men-from-mars&hl=en]; Bremerton (Washington) ''Sun'', June 28, 1947, p. 1</ref>\n\n===Arnold talks of possible non-earthly origins===\nOn July 7, 1947, two stories came out where Arnold again was raising the topic of possible extraterrestrial origins, both as his opinion and those who had written to him.  In an Associated Press story, Arnold said he had received quantities of fan mail eager to help solve the mystery, none of it calling him a \"screwball\".  Like the earlier doomsday preacher Arnold spoke of, many of the writers placed a religious interpretation on his sighting.  But others, he said, \"suggested the discs were visitations from another planet.\"  Arnold added he had purchased a movie camera, which he would now take with him on every flight, hoping to obtain photographic proof of what he had seen.<ref>Associated Press story, July 7, 1947, e.g., Salt Lake City ''Deseret News'', p. 3, \"Author of 'Discs' Story To Seek Proof\" [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Aul-kAQHnToC&dat=19470707&printsec=frontpage]</ref>\n\nIn the other story, Arnold was interviewed by the Chicago ''Times'':\n\n:\"...Kenneth Luis Arnold ...is not so certain that the strange contraptions are made on this planet.  Arnold... said he hoped the devices were really the work of the U.S. Army.  But he told the TIMES in a phone conversation:  'If our government knows anything about these devices, the people should be told at once.  A lot of people out here are very much disturbed.  Some think these things may be from another planet.  But they aren't harming anyone and I think it would be the wrong thing to shoot one of them down\u2014even if can be done.  Their high speed would completely wreck them\u2026'\n\n:\"Arnold, in pointing to the possibility of these discs being from another world, said, regardless of their origin, they apparently were traveling to some reachable destination.  Whoever controlled them, he said, obviously wasn't trying to hurt anyone.  \u2026He said discs were making turns so abruptly in rounding peaks that it would have been impossible for human pilots inside to have survived the pressure.  So, he too thinks they are controlled from elsewhere, regardless of whether it's from Mars, Venus, or our own planet.\"<ref>[http://www.roswellproof.com/Chicago_D_Times_1947-07-07-3s_Arnold_interplanetary_statement-Cpt_Smith.jpg Chicago 'Times', July 7, 1947, p. 3]</ref>\n\nIn an Associated Press story from July 19, Arnold reiterated his belief that if they weren't Army, then they were extraterrestrial:\n\n:\"The ex-University of Minnesota swimmer and footballer says he now believes: \n:1. The disks are not from any foreign country.\n:2. The Army could give the answer if it would -- 'if they don't have the explanation now they certainly could do something to find out.'\n:3. If the Army has no explanation the disks must be -- 'and I know this sounds crazy' -- from another planet.\"<ref>Walla Walla (Wash) ''Union-Bulletin'', July 20, 1947, \"Man Who Reported 'Flying Saucers' Feels That He Has Been Vindicated\"[http://www.saturdaynightuforia.com/html/articles/articlehtml/positivelytruestoryofkennetharnold5.html]</ref>\n\nArnold would make similar statements when interviewed by journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]] in 1950.  ([[#Other sightings by Arnold and his opinion|See below]])\n\nIn April 1949, in a skeptical article in the [[Saturday Evening Post]] titled \"What You Can Believe About Flying Saucers\", Arnold was likewise quoted:\n\n:\"Since my first observations and report of the so-called 'flying disks' I have spent a great deal of money and time thoroughly investigating the subject... There is no doubt in my mind but what these objects are aircraft of a strange design, and material that is unknown to the civilization of this earth.\"<ref name=eveningpost19490430>[http://www.nicap.org/articles/ShalettsArticle1.pdf Saturday Evening Post, April 30, 1949, p. 129]</ref>\n\nThe article goes on to say:\n\n:Arnold himself has been conducting a one-man campaign to prove that he did see something out of the ordinary that day over Mount Rainier...  Arnold has written other articles for [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]--one titled Phantom Lights Over Nevada, and another Are Space Visitors Here.  In the latter, discussing a fisherman's report of seeing weird purplish spheres with portholes maneuvering over the Crown River, in Ontario, Arnold wrote:  \"Once again, we can be sure that these Canadian blue-green-purple globes are not meteors, nor are they fragments of a comet or Venus.  What, then, are they?  Spacecraft from another world?\"<ref name=eveningpost19490430/>\n\nClearly Arnold was early leaning towards the [[Extraterrestrial hypothesis]] to explain what he and others had seen.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Corroboration===\n[[Image:Tulsa Saucers July12 1947.jpg|thumb|250px|Eight Arnold-like objects photographed over Tulsa, Oklahoma, July 12, 1947 (from Tulsa ''[[Tulsa World|Daily World]]'').]]\nArnold's sighting was partly corroborated by a prospector named Fred Johnson on Mt. Adams, who wrote AAF intelligence that he saw six of the objects on June 24 at about the same time as Arnold, which he viewed through a small telescope. He said they were \"round\" and tapered \"sharply to a point in the head and in an oval shape.\"  He also noted that the objects seemed to disturb his compass. An evaluation of the witness by AAF intelligence found him to be credible.  Ironically, Johnson's report was listed as the first unexplained UFO report in Air Force files, while Arnold's was dismissed as a mirage, yet Johnson seemed to be describing a continuation of the same event as Arnold.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] ''Oregon Journal'' reported on July 4 receiving a letter from an L. G. Bernier of [[Richland, Washington]] (about {{convert|110|mi|km}} east of Mt. Adams and {{convert|140|mi|km}} southeast of Mt. Rainier). Bernier wrote that he saw three of the strange objects over Richland flying \"almost edgewise\" toward Mt. Rainier about one half-hour before Arnold. Bernier thought the three were part of a larger formation. He indicated they were traveling at high speed: \"I have seen a [[P-38]] appear seemingly on one horizon and then gone to the opposite horizon in no time at all, but these disks certainly were traveling faster than any P-38. [Maximum speed of a P-38 was about 440 miles an hour.]  No doubt Mr. Arnold saw them just a few minutes or seconds later, according to their speed.\"<ref>''Oregon Journal'', Portland, July 4, 1947, p. 2</ref>  The previous day, Bernier had also spoken to his local newspaper, the Richland Washington ''Villager'', and was among the first witnesses to suggest extraterrestrial origins:  \"I believe it may be a visitor from another planet.\"<ref>Michael D.

A member of the Washington State forest service, who had been on fire watch at a tower in Diamond Gap, about {{convert|20|mi|km}} south of Yakima, reported seeing \"flashes\" at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. on the 24th over Mount Rainier (or exactly the same time as Arnold's sighting), that appeared to move in a straight line. Similarly, at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. Sidney B. Gallagher in Washington state (exact position unspecified) reported seeing nine shiny discs flash by to the north.<ref>Hall & Connors, 27-28</ref>\n\nA Seattle newspaper also mentioned a woman near [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] who said she saw a chain of nine, bright objects flying at high speed near Mt. Rainier. Unfortunately this short news item wasn't precise as to time or date, but indicated it was around the same date as Arnold's sighting.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nHowever, a pilot of a [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]] some 10 to {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of Arnold en route to Seattle reported seeing nothing unusual. This was the same DC-4 seen by Arnold and which he used for size comparison.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nOther Seattle area newspapers also reported other sightings of flashing, rapidly moving unknown objects on the same day, but not the same time, as Arnold's sighting. Most of these sightings were over Seattle or west of Seattle in the town of [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], either that morning or at night.<ref>Seattle ''Daily Times'', June 27, 1947, p. 1; Bremerton ''Sun'', June 28, 1947, p. 1</ref>  Altogether, there were at least 16 other reported UFO sightings the same day as Arnold's in the Washington state area.<ref>Map.

Without exception, according to Bloecher, the Arnold story was initially related with a serious, even-handed tone.   The first reporters to interview Arnold were Nolan Skiff and Bill Bequette of the ''[[East Oregonian]]'' in Pendleton, Oregon on June 25, and the first story on the Arnold sighting, written by Bequette, appeared in the newspaper the same day.<ref>Lagrange, Pierre (1988), [https://pierrelagrangesociologie.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/lagrange-impossiblebut-spencerevans-1988.pdf \u00ab \u201c It Seems Impossible, but There It Is \u201d \u00bb], in John Spencer & Hilary Evans (eds.), ''Phenomenon: From Flying Saucers to UFOs - Forty Years of Facts and Research''.

Thus the Arnold sighting is credited with giving rise to these popular terms. The actual origin of the terms is somewhat controversial and complicated. Jerome Clark cites a 1970 study by Herbert Strentz, who reviewed U.S. newspaper accounts of the Arnold UFO sighting, and concluded that the term was probably due to an editor or headline writer: the body of the early Arnold news stories did not use the term \"flying saucer\" or \"flying disc.\"<ref>Perhaps the earliest example was the Chicago ''Sun'' on June 26, whose headline for the AP story read: \"Supersonic Flying Saucers Sighted by Idaho Pilot\".</ref>  However, earlier stories did in fact credit Arnold with using terms such as \"saucer\", \"disk\", and \"pie-pan\" in describing the shape. (see quotations further below)\n\n===Bequette interview===\nYears later, Arnold claimed he told Bill Bequette that \"they flew erratic, like a saucer if you skip it across the water.\" Arnold felt that he had been misquoted since the description referred to the objects' motion rather than their shape.<ref name=Murrow>In an interview with [[CBS News]]man [[Edward R. Murrow]] on April 7, 1950, Arnold explained: \"In the excitement of it all ... nobody knew just exactly what they were talking about ... They said that I said that they were saucer-like; I said that they flew in a saucer-like fashion\", see: {{Citation | first = Carl | last = Sagan | title = [[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science As a Candle in the Dark | place = | publisher = [[Ballantine Books]] | series =  | volume = | edition =  | date = March 1997 | page = 70 | isbn = 0-345-40946-9 }}</ref> Thus Bequette has often been credited with first using \"flying saucer\" and supposedly misquoting Arnold, but the term does not appear in Bequette's early articles.

He also specifically used terms like \"saucer\" or \"saucer-like\", \"disk\", and \"pie pan\" or \"pie plate\" in describing the shape. The motion he generally described as weaving like the tail of a kite and erratic flipping.\n\nFor example, in a surviving recorded radio interview from June 26, 1947 made by reporter Ted Smith, United Press correspondent in Pendleton, and aired on KWRC, the local radio station of Pendleton<ref>For the story of the circumstances during which this record was discovered in 1988, see [https://pulp.hypotheses.org/1180 this page of Pierre Lagrange research log] (the account is in French but an article of an interview with Ted Smith published in the East Oregonian en 1997 is reproduced and the text of the interview with Arnold is transcribed).</ref>, Arnold described them as looking \"something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear.\"  His motion descriptions were:  \"I noticed to the left of me a chain which looked to me like the tail of a Chinese kite, kind of weaving... they seemed to flip and flash in the sun, just like a mirror... they seemed to kind of weave in and out right above the mountaintops...\"  [http://www.konsulting.com/audio_clips.htm]\n\n[[Image:Arnold AAF drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Kenneth Arnold's report to [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] (AAF) intelligence, dated July 12, 1947, which includes annotated sketches of the typical craft in the chain of nine objects.]]\n\n==Widespread UFO reports after Arnold sighting==\nIn the weeks that followed Arnold's June 1947 story, at least several hundred reports of similar sightings flooded in from the U.S. and around the world\u2014most of which described saucer-shaped objects. A sighting by a United Airlines crew of another nine disk-like objects over Idaho on July 4 probably garnered more newspaper coverage than Arnold's original sighting, and opened the floodgates of media coverage in the days to follow.\n\nBloecher collected reports of 853 flying disc sightings that year from 140 newspapers from Canada, Washington D.C, and every U.S. state save Montana. This was more UFO reports for 1947 than most researchers ever suspected. Some of these stories were poorly documented or fragmentary, but Bloecher argued that about 250 of the more detailed reports (such as those made by pilots or scientists, multiple eyewitnesses, or backed by photos) made a persuasive case for a genuine mystery.\n\nAdding intrigue to Arnold's story, the U.S. military denied having any planes at all in the area of Mount Rainier at the time of his sighting. Likewise, on July 6, speculation arose in newspaper articles that the objects being sighted were due to either the \"[[Northrop_YB-35|flying wing]]\" or \"[[Vought_XF5U|flying flapjack]]\", a disc-shaped aircraft, both experimental planes under development by the U.S. military at the time. The military repeated that neither aircraft could account for the sightings, which is also borne out by historical records.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe most famous UFO event during this period was the [[Roswell UFO incident]], the alleged military recovery of a crashed flying disk, the story of which broke on July 8, 1947. To calm rising public concern, this and other cases were debunked by the military in succeeding days as mistaken sightings of [[weather balloon]]s.<ref>[http://www.roswellproof.com/militarydebunk.html]</ref> Just before the Roswell story came out, the Army Air Forces in Washington issued a press statement saying they had the matter under investigation and had decided the flying discs definitely were ''not'' \"secret bacteriological weapons designed by some foreign power\", \"new-type army rockets\", or \"space ships\".<ref>United Press story from Washington D.C., July 8, 1947, Ted Bloecher, \"Report on the UFO Wave of 1947\", p. 50 [http://nicap.org/waves/Wave47Rpt/ReportOnWaveOf1947.pdf]; [http://www.roswellproof.com/flying-saucers-not-spaceships.html#anchor_9 Copies of United Press stories]</ref>\n\n==Military investigation of Arnold story==\nThe first investigation of Arnold's claims came from Lt. Frank Brown and Capt. William Davidson of [[Hamilton Air Force Base|Hamilton Field]] in [[California]], who interviewed Arnold on July 12. Arnold also submitted a written report at that time. Regarding the reliability of Arnold's sighting, they concluded:\n\n:\"It is the present opinion of the interviewer that Mr. Arnold actually saw what he stated he saw. It is difficult to believe that a man of [his] character and apparent integrity would state that he saw objects and write up a report to the extent that he did if he did not see them.\"<ref>reprinted in Bloecher, 1967</ref>\n\nDespite this, the Army Air Force's formal public conclusion was that Arnold had seen a mirage.\n\nIn addition, on July 9 AAF intelligence, with help from the [[FBI]], secretly began an investigation of the best sightings, mostly from pilots and military personnel. Arnold's sighting, as well as that of the United Airline's crew, were included in the list of best sightings. Three weeks later they came to the conclusion that the saucer reports were not imaginary or adequately explained by natural phenomena; something real was flying around. This laid the groundwork for another intelligence estimate in September 1947 by Gen. [[Nathan Twining]], commanding officer of the [[Air Materiel Command]], which likewise concluded the saucers were real and urged a formal investigation by multiple government agencies. This in turn resulted in the formation of [[Project Sign]] at the end of 1947, the first publicly acknowledged USAF [[UFO]] investigation. Project Sign eventually evolved into [[Project Grudge]], and then the better known [[Project Blue Book]].\n\nThe personnel of the U.S. Air Force's [[Project Sign]] (1947\u20131949) also later studied Arnold's story. According to Major [[Edward J. Ruppelt]],\n\n:I found that there was a lot of speculation on this report [amongst Sign personnel]. Two factions ... joined up behind two lines of reasoning. One side said that Arnold had seen plain, everyday jet airplanes flying in formation ... The other side didn't buy this idea at all. They based their argument on the fact that Arnold knew where the objects were when he timed them ...\n\n:There was an old theory that maybe Arnold had seen wind whipping snow along the mountain ridges, so I asked Air Force investigators about this. I got a flat \"Impossible.\"<ref>Edward J. Ruppelt; ''Report On Unidentified Flying Objects''; New York: Doubleday 1956</ref>\n\n==Skeptical explanations==\n[[Steuart Campbell]] has said that the objects Arnold reported could have been mirages of several snow-capped peaks in Cascade Range. Campbell's calculation of the objects' speed determined that they were travelling at roughly the same speed as Arnold's plane, indicating that the objects were in fact stationary. Mirages could have been caused by temperature inversions over several deep valleys in the line of sight.<ref name=Campbell>{{Cite book | last = Campbell | first = Steuart | title = The UFO Mystery Solved, Chapter 5: The first flying saucers | publisher = Explicit Books | edition = | location = | year = 1994 | page = | isbn = 0-9521512-0-0 }}</ref>\n\n[[Philip J.

Rainier. According to Maccabee, such snow clouds have hazy light, not the mirror-like brilliance reported by Arnold. Further, such clouds could not be in the rapid motion reported by Arnold, nor would they account for Arnold first seeing the bright objects north of Rainier.\n#In 1963, Menzel proposed that Arnold had seen [[orographic cloud]]s or [[wave cloud]]s; Maccabee says that this conflicted with testimony from Arnold and others that the sky was clear, and again can't account for the objects' reported brightness and rapid motion over a very large angular region.\n#In 1971, Menzel said that Arnold may have merely seen spots of water on his airplane's windows; Maccabee says that this contradicts Arnold's testimony that he had specifically ruled out water spots or reflections shortly after seeing the nine UFOs. For example, the early Bill Bequette article of June 26 in the ''East Oregonian'' has Arnold saying he at first thought that maybe he was seeing reflections off his window, but \"he still saw the objects after rolling it down.\"\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of UFO sightings]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.martinshough.com/aerialphenomena/Arnold%20analysis2.pdf The Singular Adventure of Mr Kenneth Arnold]\n*[http://www.saturdaynightuforia.com/html/articles/articlehtml/positivelytruestoryofkennetharnold1.html The Positively True Story of Kenneth Arnold - Part One] 10-part series at Saturday Night Uforia\n*[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/06/flyingsaucer_anniversary?currentPage=1 Out of This World: 60 Years of Flying Saucers by Nigel Watson]\n*[http://brumac.mysite.com/KARNOLD/KARNOLD.html The most complete Arnold sighting description and analysis on the net]\n*[http://www.reall.org/newsletter/v05/n06/resolving-arnold-part-1.html Resolving Arnold part 1]\n*[http://www.reall.org/newsletter/v05/n07/resolving-arnold-part-2.html Resolving Arnold part 2]\n*[http://www.project1947.com/fig/kamurrow.htm Transcript of telephone conversation with Arnold] by [[Edward R.

This was the first post-War sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being the first of the modern era of UFO sightings, including numerous reported sightings over the next two to three weeks.

He made a brief detour after learning of a $5,000 reward (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|5000|1947|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) for the discovery of a U.S. Marine Corps [[C-46 Commando|C-46]] transport airplane that had crashed near Mt. Rainier. The skies were completely clear and there was a mild wind.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nA few minutes before 3:00&nbsp;p.m. (15:00) at about {{convert|9200|ft|m}} in altitude and near [[Mineral, Washington]], he gave up his search and started heading eastward towards Yakima. He saw a bright flashing light, similar to sunlight reflecting from a [[mirror]]. Afraid he might be dangerously close to another aircraft, Arnold scanned the skies around him, but all he could see was a [[DC-4]] to his left and behind him, about {{convert|15|mi|km}} away.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAbout 30 seconds after seeing the first flash of light, Arnold saw a series of bright flashes in the distance off to his left, or north of [[Mt. Rainier]], which was then from {{convert|20|to|25|mi|km}} away. He thought they might be reflections on his airplane's windows, but a few quick tests (rocking his airplane from side to side, removing his eyeglasses, later rolling down his side window) ruled this out. The reflections came from flying objects. They flew in a long chain, and Arnold for a moment considered they might be a flock of geese, but quickly ruled this out for a number of reasons, including the altitude, bright glint, and obviously very fast speed. He then thought they might be a new type of jet and started looking intently for a tail and was surprised that he couldn't find any.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThey quickly approached Rainier and then passed in front, usually appearing dark in profile against the bright white snowfield covering Rainier, but occasionally still giving off bright light flashes as they flipped around erratically. Sometimes he said he could see them on edge, when they seemed so thin and flat they were practically invisible. According to [[Jerome Clark]],<ref>{{Cite book | last = Clark | first = Jerome | title = The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial | publisher = Visible Ink | edition =  | location =  | year = 1998 | page =  | isbn = 1-57859-029-9 | url = https://archive.org/details/ufobookencyclope0000clar }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Clark | first = Jerome | title = The UFO Encyclopedia: The Phenomenon from the Beginning | publisher = Omnigraphics | volume = A-K | edition = | location = Detroit | origyear = 1998| year = 2005 | page = | isbn = 0-7808-0097-4 }}</ref> Arnold described them as a series of objects with convex shapes, though he later revealed that one object differed by being [[crescent]]-shaped. Several years later, Arnold would state he likened their movement to saucers skipping on water, without comparing their actual shapes to saucers,<ref name=Murrow/> but initial quotes from him do indeed have him comparing the shape to a \"saucer\", \"disc\", \"pie pan\", or \"half moon\", or generally convex and thin (discussion below). At one point Arnold said they flew behind a subpeak of Rainier and briefly disappeared. Knowing his position and the position of the (unspecified) subpeak, Arnold placed their distance as they flew past Rainier at about {{convert|23|mi|km}}.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nUsing a [[Dzus fastener|dzus]] [[cowling]] fastener as a gauge to compare the nine objects to the distant DC-4, Arnold estimated their angular size as slightly smaller than the DC-4, about the width between the outer engines (about {{cvt|60|ft|||}}). Arnold also said he realized that the objects would have to be quite large to see any details at that distance and later, after comparing notes with a United Airlines crew that had a similar sighting 10 days later (see below), placed the absolute size as larger than a DC-4 airliner (or greater than {{convert|100|ft|m}} in length). Army Air Force analysts would later estimate 140 to {{convert|280|ft|m}}, based on analysis of human [[visual acuity]] and other sighting details (such as estimated distance).{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n \nArnold said the objects were grouped together, as Ted Bloecher<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080413203646/http://www.mimufon.org/historical_folders/nicap_pages/ReportOnWaveOf1947.pdf The UFO Wave of 1947] by Ted Bloecher, 1967; URL accessed March 7, 2007</ref> writes, \"in a diagonally stepped-down, [[echelon formation]], stretched out over a distance that he later calculated to be five miles\". Though moving on a more or less level horizontal plane, Arnold said the objects weaved from side to side (\"like the tail of a Chinese kite\" as he later stated), darting through the valleys and around the smaller mountain peaks. They would occasionally flip or bank on their edges in unison as they turned or maneuvered causing almost blindingly bright or mirror-like flashes of light. The encounter gave him an \"eerie feeling\", but Arnold suspected he had seen test flights of a new U.S. military aircraft.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs the objects passed Mt Rainer, Arnold turned his plane southward on a more or less parallel course. It was at this point that he opened his side window and began observing the objects unobstructed by any glass that might have produced reflections. The objects did not disappear and continued to move very rapidly southward, continuously moving forward of his position. Curious about their speed, he began to time their rate of passage: he said they moved from Mt. Rainer to [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] where they faded from view, a distance of about {{convert|50|mi|km}}, in one minute and forty-two seconds, according to the clock on his instrument panel. When he later had time to do the calculation, the speed was over {{convert|1700|mi/h|km/h}}. This was about three times faster than any manned aircraft in 1947. Not knowing exactly the distance where the objects faded from view, Arnold conservatively and arbitrarily rounded this down to {{convert|1200|mi|km}} an hour, still faster than any known aircraft, which had yet to break the [[sound barrier]]. It was this [[supersonic]] speed in addition to the unusual saucer or disk description that seemed to capture people's attention.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Arnold shares the story===\nArnold landed in Yakima at about 4:00&nbsp;p.m., and quickly told friend and airport general manager Al Baxter the amazing story, and before long, the entire airport staff knew of Arnold's claims. He discussed the story with the staff, and later wrote that Baxter didn't believe him.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n \nArnold flew on to an air show in [[Pendleton, Oregon]], not knowing that somebody in Yakima had phoned in ahead to say that Arnold had seen some strange new aircraft. It was at this time that Arnold studied his maps, determined the distance between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams, and calculated the rather astonishing speed. He told a number of pilot friends, and wrote in his account to AAF intelligence that they did not scoff or laugh. Instead they suggested that maybe he had seen guided missiles or something new, although Arnold felt this explanation to be inadequate. He also wrote that some former Army pilots told him that they had been briefed before going into combat \"that they might see objects of similar shape and design as I described and assured me that I wasn't dreaming or going crazy\" (see [[Foo fighter]]).{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nArnold wasn't interviewed by reporters until the next day (June 25) when he went to the office of the ''[[East Oregonian]]'' in Pendleton.<ref>Lagrange, Pierre (1988), [https://pierrelagrangesociologie.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/lagrange-impossiblebut-spencerevans-1988.pdf \u00ab \u201c It Seems Impossible, but There It Is \u201d \u00bb], in John Spencer & Hilary Evans (eds.), ''Phenomenon: From Flying Saucers to UFOs - Forty Years of Facts and Research''.

On June 27 he was reported saying: \"I haven't had a moment of peace since I first told the story.\" He then said a preacher had called and told him that the objects he saw were \"harbingers of doomsday\" and that the preacher was preparing his congregation \"for the end of the world.\"  In another encounter, a woman in a Pendleton cafe noticed him and dashed out shrieking: \"There's the man who saw the men from Mars.\"  She ran out \"sobbing she would have to do something for the children,\" Arnold was reported as saying \"with a shudder\".{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nHe then added that, \"This whole thing has gotten out of hand.

In an Associated Press story, Arnold said he had received quantities of fan mail eager to help solve the mystery, none of it calling him a \"screwball\".  Like the earlier doomsday preacher Arnold spoke of, many of the writers placed a religious interpretation on his sighting.  But others, he said, \"suggested the discs were visitations from another planet.\"  Arnold added he had purchased a movie camera, which he would now take with him on every flight, hoping to obtain photographic proof of what he had seen.<ref>Associated Press story, July 7, 1947, e.g., Salt Lake City ''Deseret News'', p. 3, \"Author of 'Discs' Story To Seek Proof\" [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Aul-kAQHnToC&dat=19470707&printsec=frontpage]</ref>\n\nIn the other story, Arnold was interviewed by the Chicago ''Times'':\n\n:\"...Kenneth Luis Arnold ...is not so certain that the strange contraptions are made on this planet.  Arnold... said he hoped the devices were really the work of the U.S. Army.  But he told the TIMES in a phone conversation:  'If our government knows anything about these devices, the people should be told at once.  A lot of people out here are very much disturbed.  Some think these things may be from another planet.  But they aren't harming anyone and I think it would be the wrong thing to shoot one of them down\u2014even if can be done.  Their high speed would completely wreck them\u2026'\n\n:\"Arnold, in pointing to the possibility of these discs being from another world, said, regardless of their origin, they apparently were traveling to some reachable destination.  Whoever controlled them, he said, obviously wasn't trying to hurt anyone.  \u2026He said discs were making turns so abruptly in rounding peaks that it would have been impossible for human pilots inside to have survived the pressure.  So, he too thinks they are controlled from elsewhere, regardless of whether it's from Mars, Venus, or our own planet.\"<ref>[http://www.roswellproof.com/Chicago_D_Times_1947-07-07-3s_Arnold_interplanetary_statement-Cpt_Smith.jpg Chicago 'Times', July 7, 1947, p. 3]</ref>\n\nIn an Associated Press story from July 19, Arnold reiterated his belief that if they weren't Army, then they were extraterrestrial:\n\n:\"The ex-University of Minnesota swimmer and footballer says he now believes: \n:1. The disks are not from any foreign country.\n:2. The Army could give the answer if it would -- 'if they don't have the explanation now they certainly could do something to find out.'\n:3. If the Army has no explanation the disks must be -- 'and I know this sounds crazy' -- from another planet.\"<ref>Walla Walla (Wash) ''Union-Bulletin'', July 20, 1947, \"Man Who Reported 'Flying Saucers' Feels That He Has Been Vindicated\"[http://www.saturdaynightuforia.com/html/articles/articlehtml/positivelytruestoryofkennetharnold5.html]</ref>\n\nArnold would make similar statements when interviewed by journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]] in 1950.  ([[#Other sightings by Arnold and his opinion|See below]])\n\nIn April 1949, in a skeptical article in the [[Saturday Evening Post]] titled \"What You Can Believe About Flying Saucers\", Arnold was likewise quoted:\n\n:\"Since my first observations and report of the so-called 'flying disks' I have spent a great deal of money and time thoroughly investigating the subject... There is no doubt in my mind but what these objects are aircraft of a strange design, and material that is unknown to the civilization of this earth.\"<ref name=eveningpost19490430>[http://www.nicap.org/articles/ShalettsArticle1.pdf Saturday Evening Post, April 30, 1949, p. 129]</ref>\n\nThe article goes on to say:\n\n:Arnold himself has been conducting a one-man campaign to prove that he did see something out of the ordinary that day over Mount Rainier...  Arnold has written other articles for [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]--one titled Phantom Lights Over Nevada, and another Are Space Visitors Here.  In the latter, discussing a fisherman's report of seeing weird purplish spheres with portholes maneuvering over the Crown River, in Ontario, Arnold wrote:  \"Once again, we can be sure that these Canadian blue-green-purple globes are not meteors, nor are they fragments of a comet or Venus.  What, then, are they?  Spacecraft from another world?\"<ref name=eveningpost19490430/>\n\nClearly Arnold was early leaning towards the [[Extraterrestrial hypothesis]] to explain what he and others had seen.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Corroboration===\n[[Image:Tulsa Saucers July12 1947.jpg|thumb|250px|Eight Arnold-like objects photographed over Tulsa, Oklahoma, July 12, 1947 (from Tulsa ''[[Tulsa World|Daily World]]'').]]\nArnold's sighting was partly corroborated by a prospector named Fred Johnson on Mt. Adams, who wrote AAF intelligence that he saw six of the objects on June 24 at about the same time as Arnold, which he viewed through a small telescope. He said they were \"round\" and tapered \"sharply to a point in the head and in an oval shape.\"  He also noted that the objects seemed to disturb his compass. An evaluation of the witness by AAF intelligence found him to be credible.  Ironically, Johnson's report was listed as the first unexplained UFO report in Air Force files, while Arnold's was dismissed as a mirage, yet Johnson seemed to be describing a continuation of the same event as Arnold.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] ''Oregon Journal'' reported on July 4 receiving a letter from an L. G. Bernier of [[Richland, Washington]] (about {{convert|110|mi|km}} east of Mt. Adams and {{convert|140|mi|km}} southeast of Mt. Rainier). Bernier wrote that he saw three of the strange objects over Richland flying \"almost edgewise\" toward Mt. Rainier about one half-hour before Arnold. Bernier thought the three were part of a larger formation. He indicated they were traveling at high speed: \"I have seen a [[P-38]] appear seemingly on one horizon and then gone to the opposite horizon in no time at all, but these disks certainly were traveling faster than any P-38. [Maximum speed of a P-38 was about 440 miles an hour.]  No doubt Mr. Arnold saw them just a few minutes or seconds later, according to their speed.\"<ref>''Oregon Journal'', Portland, July 4, 1947, p. 2</ref>  The previous day, Bernier had also spoken to his local newspaper, the Richland Washington ''Villager'', and was among the first witnesses to suggest extraterrestrial origins:  \"I believe it may be a visitor from another planet.\"<ref>Michael D. Hall & Wendy A. Connors, ''[[Alfred Loedding]] & the Great Saucer Wave of 1947'', [http://www.nicap.org/loedding/LoeddingBook.pdf online], p. 27</ref>\n\nAbout {{convert|60|mi|km}} west-northwest of Richland in [[Yakima, Washington]], a woman named Ethel Wheelhouse likewise reported sighting several flying discs moving at fantastic speeds at around the same time as Arnold's sighting.<ref>Hall & Connors, 27</ref>\n\nWhen military intelligence began investigating Arnold's sighting in early July ([[#Military investigation of Arnold story|see below]]), they found yet another witness from the area.  A member of the Washington State forest service, who had been on fire watch at a tower in Diamond Gap, about {{convert|20|mi|km}} south of Yakima, reported seeing \"flashes\" at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. on the 24th over Mount Rainier (or exactly the same time as Arnold's sighting), that appeared to move in a straight line. Similarly, at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. Sidney B. Gallagher in Washington state (exact position unspecified) reported seeing nine shiny discs flash by to the north.<ref>Hall & Connors, 27-28</ref>\n\nA Seattle newspaper also mentioned a woman near [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] who said she saw a chain of nine, bright objects flying at high speed near Mt. Rainier. Unfortunately this short news item wasn't precise as to time or date, but indicated it was around the same date as Arnold's sighting.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nHowever, a pilot of a [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]] some 10 to {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of Arnold en route to Seattle reported seeing nothing unusual. This was the same DC-4 seen by Arnold and which he used for size comparison.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nOther Seattle area newspapers also reported other sightings of flashing, rapidly moving unknown objects on the same day, but not the same time, as Arnold's sighting. Most of these sightings were over Seattle or west of Seattle in the town of [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], either that morning or at night.<ref>Seattle ''Daily Times'', June 27, 1947, p. 1; Bremerton ''Sun'', June 28, 1947, p. 1</ref>  Altogether, there were at least 16 other reported UFO sightings the same day as Arnold's in the Washington state area.<ref>Map.

Without exception, according to Bloecher, the Arnold story was initially related with a serious, even-handed tone.   The first reporters to interview Arnold were Nolan Skiff and Bill Bequette of the ''[[East Oregonian]]'' in Pendleton, Oregon on June 25, and the first story on the Arnold sighting, written by Bequette, appeared in the newspaper the same day.<ref>Lagrange, Pierre (1988), [https://pierrelagrangesociologie.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/lagrange-impossiblebut-spencerevans-1988.pdf \u00ab \u201c It Seems Impossible, but There It Is \u201d \u00bb], in John Spencer & Hilary Evans (eds.), ''Phenomenon: From Flying Saucers to UFOs - Forty Years of Facts and Research''.

Thus the Arnold sighting is credited with giving rise to these popular terms. The actual origin of the terms is somewhat controversial and complicated. Jerome Clark cites a 1970 study by Herbert Strentz, who reviewed U.S. newspaper accounts of the Arnold UFO sighting, and concluded that the term was probably due to an editor or headline writer: the body of the early Arnold news stories did not use the term \"flying saucer\" or \"flying disc.\"<ref>Perhaps the earliest example was the Chicago ''Sun'' on June 26, whose headline for the AP story read: \"Supersonic Flying Saucers Sighted by Idaho Pilot\".</ref>  However, earlier stories did in fact credit Arnold with using terms such as \"saucer\", \"disk\", and \"pie-pan\" in describing the shape. (see quotations further below)\n\n===Bequette interview===\nYears later, Arnold claimed he told Bill Bequette that \"they flew erratic, like a saucer if you skip it across the water.\" Arnold felt that he had been misquoted since the description referred to the objects' motion rather than their shape.<ref name=Murrow>In an interview with [[CBS News]]man [[Edward R. Murrow]] on April 7, 1950, Arnold explained: \"In the excitement of it all ... nobody knew just exactly what they were talking about ... They said that I said that they were saucer-like; I said that they flew in a saucer-like fashion\", see: {{Citation | first = Carl | last = Sagan | title = [[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science As a Candle in the Dark | place = | publisher = [[Ballantine Books]] | series =  | volume = | edition =  | date = March 1997 | page = 70 | isbn = 0-345-40946-9 }}</ref> Thus Bequette has often been credited with first using \"flying saucer\" and supposedly misquoting Arnold, but the term does not appear in Bequette's early articles.

He also specifically used terms like \"saucer\" or \"saucer-like\", \"disk\", and \"pie pan\" or \"pie plate\" in describing the shape. The motion he generally described as weaving like the tail of a kite and erratic flipping.\n\nFor example, in a surviving recorded radio interview from June 26, 1947 made by reporter Ted Smith, United Press correspondent in Pendleton, and aired on KWRC, the local radio station of Pendleton<ref>For the story of the circumstances during which this record was discovered in 1988, see [https://pulp.hypotheses.org/1180 this page of Pierre Lagrange research log] (the account is in French but an article of an interview with Ted Smith published in the East Oregonian en 1997 is reproduced and the text of the interview with Arnold is transcribed).</ref>, Arnold described them as looking \"something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear.\"  His motion descriptions were:  \"I noticed to the left of me a chain which looked to me like the tail of a Chinese kite, kind of weaving... they seemed to flip and flash in the sun, just like a mirror... they seemed to kind of weave in and out right above the mountaintops...\"  [http://www.konsulting.com/audio_clips.htm]\n\n[[Image:Arnold AAF drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Kenneth Arnold's report to [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] (AAF) intelligence, dated July 12, 1947, which includes annotated sketches of the typical craft in the chain of nine objects.]]\n\n==Widespread UFO reports after Arnold sighting==\nIn the weeks that followed Arnold's June 1947 story, at least several hundred reports of similar sightings flooded in from the U.S. and around the world\u2014most of which described saucer-shaped objects. A sighting by a United Airlines crew of another nine disk-like objects over Idaho on July 4 probably garnered more newspaper coverage than Arnold's original sighting, and opened the floodgates of media coverage in the days to follow.\n\nBloecher collected reports of 853 flying disc sightings that year from 140 newspapers from Canada, Washington D.C, and every U.S. state save Montana. This was more UFO reports for 1947 than most researchers ever suspected. Some of these stories were poorly documented or fragmentary, but Bloecher argued that about 250 of the more detailed reports (such as those made by pilots or scientists, multiple eyewitnesses, or backed by photos) made a persuasive case for a genuine mystery.\n\nAdding intrigue to Arnold's story, the U.S. military denied having any planes at all in the area of Mount Rainier at the time of his sighting. Likewise, on July 6, speculation arose in newspaper articles that the objects being sighted were due to either the \"[[Northrop_YB-35|flying wing]]\" or \"[[Vought_XF5U|flying flapjack]]\", a disc-shaped aircraft, both experimental planes under development by the U.S. military at the time. The military repeated that neither aircraft could account for the sightings, which is also borne out by historical records.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe most famous UFO event during this period was the [[Roswell UFO incident]], the alleged military recovery of a crashed flying disk, the story of which broke on July 8, 1947. To calm rising public concern, this and other cases were debunked by the military in succeeding days as mistaken sightings of [[weather balloon]]s.<ref>[http://www.roswellproof.com/militarydebunk.html]</ref> Just before the Roswell story came out, the Army Air Forces in Washington issued a press statement saying they had the matter under investigation and had decided the flying discs definitely were ''not'' \"secret bacteriological weapons designed by some foreign power\", \"new-type army rockets\", or \"space ships\".<ref>United Press story from Washington D.C., July 8, 1947, Ted Bloecher, \"Report on the UFO Wave of 1947\", p. 50 [http://nicap.org/waves/Wave47Rpt/ReportOnWaveOf1947.pdf]; [http://www.roswellproof.com/flying-saucers-not-spaceships.html#anchor_9 Copies of United Press stories]</ref>\n\n==Military investigation of Arnold story==\nThe first investigation of Arnold's claims came from Lt. Frank Brown and Capt. William Davidson of [[Hamilton Air Force Base|Hamilton Field]] in [[California]], who interviewed Arnold on July 12. Arnold also submitted a written report at that time. Regarding the reliability of Arnold's sighting, they concluded:\n\n:\"It is the present opinion of the interviewer that Mr. Arnold actually saw what he stated he saw. It is difficult to believe that a man of [his] character and apparent integrity would state that he saw objects and write up a report to the extent that he did if he did not see them.\"<ref>reprinted in Bloecher, 1967</ref>\n\nDespite this, the Army Air Force's formal public conclusion was that Arnold had seen a mirage.\n\nIn addition, on July 9 AAF intelligence, with help from the [[FBI]], secretly began an investigation of the best sightings, mostly from pilots and military personnel. Arnold's sighting, as well as that of the United Airline's crew, were included in the list of best sightings. Three weeks later they came to the conclusion that the saucer reports were not imaginary or adequately explained by natural phenomena; something real was flying around. This laid the groundwork for another intelligence estimate in September 1947 by Gen. [[Nathan Twining]], commanding officer of the [[Air Materiel Command]], which likewise concluded the saucers were real and urged a formal investigation by multiple government agencies. This in turn resulted in the formation of [[Project Sign]] at the end of 1947, the first publicly acknowledged USAF [[UFO]] investigation. Project Sign eventually evolved into [[Project Grudge]], and then the better known [[Project Blue Book]].\n\nThe personnel of the U.S. Air Force's [[Project Sign]] (1947\u20131949) also later studied Arnold's story. According to Major [[Edward J. Ruppelt]],\n\n:I found that there was a lot of speculation on this report [amongst Sign personnel]. Two factions ... joined up behind two lines of reasoning. One side said that Arnold had seen plain, everyday jet airplanes flying in formation ... The other side didn't buy this idea at all. They based their argument on the fact that Arnold knew where the objects were when he timed them ...\n\n:There was an old theory that maybe Arnold had seen wind whipping snow along the mountain ridges, so I asked Air Force investigators about this. I got a flat \"Impossible.\"<ref>Edward J. Ruppelt; ''Report On Unidentified Flying Objects''; New York: Doubleday 1956</ref>\n\n==Skeptical explanations==\n[[Steuart Campbell]] has said that the objects Arnold reported could have been mirages of several snow-capped peaks in Cascade Range. Campbell's calculation of the objects' speed determined that they were travelling at roughly the same speed as Arnold's plane, indicating that the objects were in fact stationary. Mirages could have been caused by temperature inversions over several deep valleys in the line of sight.<ref name=Campbell>{{Cite book | last = Campbell | first = Steuart | title = The UFO Mystery Solved, Chapter 5: The first flying saucers | publisher = Explicit Books | edition = | location = | year = 1994 | page = | isbn = 0-9521512-0-0 }}</ref>\n\n[[Philip J.

Further, such clouds could not be in the rapid motion reported by Arnold, nor would they account for Arnold first seeing the bright objects north of Rainier.\n#In 1963, Menzel proposed that Arnold had seen [[orographic cloud]]s or [[wave cloud]]s; Maccabee says that this conflicted with testimony from Arnold and others that the sky was clear, and again can't account for the objects' reported brightness and rapid motion over a very large angular region.\n#In 1971, Menzel said that Arnold may have merely seen spots of water on his airplane's windows; Maccabee says that this contradicts Arnold's testimony that he had specifically ruled out water spots or reflections shortly after seeing the nine UFOs. For example, the early Bill Bequette article of June 26 in the ''East Oregonian'' has Arnold saying he at first thought that maybe he was seeing reflections off his window, but \"he still saw the objects after rolling it down.\"\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of UFO sightings]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.martinshough.com/aerialphenomena/Arnold%20analysis2.pdf The Singular Adventure of Mr Kenneth Arnold]\n*[http://www.saturdaynightuforia.com/html/articles/articlehtml/positivelytruestoryofkennetharnold1.html The Positively True Story of Kenneth Arnold - Part One] 10-part series at Saturday Night Uforia\n*[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/06/flyingsaucer_anniversary?currentPage=1 Out of This World: 60 Years of Flying Saucers by Nigel Watson]\n*[http://brumac.mysite.com/KARNOLD/KARNOLD.html The most complete Arnold sighting description and analysis on the net]\n*[http://www.reall.org/newsletter/v05/n06/resolving-arnold-part-1.html Resolving Arnold part 1]\n*[http://www.reall.org/newsletter/v05/n07/resolving-arnold-part-2.html Resolving Arnold part 2]\n*[http://www.project1947.com/fig/kamurrow.htm Transcript of telephone conversation with Arnold] by [[Edward R.
