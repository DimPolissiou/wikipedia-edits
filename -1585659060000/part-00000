This helped the movement spread quickly in the [[Balkans]], gradually expanding throughout the [[Byzantine Empire]] and later reaching [[Kievan Rus']], [[Banate of Bosnia|Bosnia]] ([[Bosnian Church]]), [[Dalmatia]], [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]], [[Italy]], and [[France]] ([[Cathars]]).\n\nThe Bogomils were [[Dualistic cosmology|dualists]] or [[Gnostics]] in that they believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body. They did not use the Christian [[Christian cross|cross]], nor build [[church (building)|church]]es, as they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging,{{clarify|date=May 2016}} [[fasting]], celebrating and dancing.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term ''Bogomil'' in free translation means \"dear to God\", and is a compound of the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] words for \"god\" ([[Common Slavic]]: [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/bog\u044a|*bog\u044a]]) and \"dear\" (Common Slavic: *mil\u044a). It may be also a translation of the Greek name ''Theophilos'', literally \"dear to God; loved by the gods,\" from ''theos'' \"god\" + ''philos'' \"loved, beloved\". It is difficult to ascertain whether the name was taken from the reputed founder of that movement, the priest Bogomil ({{lang-bg|\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043b|Bogomil}}), or whether he assumed that name after it had been given to the sect itself. The word is an [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[calque]] of ''Massaliani'', the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] name of the sect corresponding to the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Euchites]]. The Bogomils are identified with the [[Messalians]] in Greek and Slavonic documents from the 12th-14th centuries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wolski |first1=Jan |title=Autoproscoptae, Bogomils and Messalians in the 14th Century Bulgaria |journal=Studia Ceranea |date=2014 |volume=4 |pages=234-238 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12120359/Autoproscoptae_Bogomils_and_Messalians_in_the_14th_Century_Bulgaria}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe members are referred to as ''Babuni'' in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] documents, which originally meant \"superstition; superstitious person\" (Common Slavic: ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/babon\u044a|*babon\u044a, *babun\u044a *babona]]'').

The earliest description of the Bogomils is in a letter from Patriarch Theophylact of Bulgaria to Tsar Peter of Bulgaria.

The old Slavonic lists of forbidden books of the 15th and 16th century also give us a clue to the discovery of this heretical literature and of the means the Bogomils employed to carry on their [[teachings]].

His followers, who became known as [[Paulicians]], were not marked by extreme deviance in lifestyle compared to contemporaries, despite their belief that the world was evil, and were renowned as good fighting men.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/dualist.htm |title=Hamilton, Janet and Bernard, ''Christian dualist heresies in the Byzantine world, c.650-c.1450'' |access-date=2018-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527121532/http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/dualist.htm |archive-date=2011-05-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 970 the Byzantine emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]] transplanted 200,000 Armenian Paulicians to Europe and settled them in the neighbourhood of Philippopolis (today's [[Plovdiv]] in Thrace). Under Byzantine and then later Ottoman rule, the Armenian Paulicians lived in relative safety in their ancient stronghold near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]], and further northward. Linguistically, they were assimilated into the [[Bulgarians]], by whom they were called ''pavlikiani'' (the [[Byzantine Greek]] word for Paulician). In 1650, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] gathered them into its fold. Fourteen villages near [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nicopolis]], in [[Moesia]], embraced Catholicism, as well as the villages around Philippopolis. A colony of Paulicians in the Wallachian village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Cioplea|ro}} near [[Bucharest]] also followed the example of their brethren across the [[Danube]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|right|The religious distribution at the time of the [[East\u2013West Schism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartileonline.eu/carte/1025738/dragan-brujia-vodia-kroz-svet-vizantijeDragan |title=Vodi\u010d kroz svet Vizantije (Guide to the Byzantine World) |accessdate= |author=Dragan Bruji\u0107 |authorlink= |year=2005 |work= |publisher=Beograd |page=51 |language= |quote= |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> showing Bogomils concentrated in the Balkans.]]\nThe [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] social-religious movement and doctrine originated in the time of [[Peter I of Bulgaria]] (927&ndash;969), alleged in the modern day to be a reaction against state and clerical oppression of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Byzantine church]]. In spite of all measures of repression, it remained strong and popular until the fall of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in the end of the 14th century. Bogomilism was an outcome of many factors that had arisen in the beginning of the 10th century, most probably in the region of Macedonia.  It was also strongly influenced by the [[Paulicians]] who had been driven out of [[Armenia]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reformedreader.org/history/brockett/bogomils.htm |title=Bogomils of Bulgaria and Bosnia | work =The Reformed Reader}}</ref>\n\nThe Slavonic sources are unanimous on the point that Bogomil's teaching was Manichaean. A ''Synodikon'' from the year 1210 adds the names of his pupils or \"apostles\", Mihail, Todur, Dobri, Stefan, Vasilie and Peter. Zealous missionaries carried their doctrines far and wide. In 1004, scarcely 25 years after the introduction of Christianity into [[Kievan Rus]], we hear of a priest Adrian teaching the same doctrines as the Bogomils. He was imprisoned by Leontius, Bishop of [[Kiev]]. In 1125, the Church in the south of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] had to combat another heresiarch named Dmitri. The Church in Bulgaria also tried to extirpate Bogomilism. Several thousand went in the army of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] against the [[Normans|Norman]], [[Robert Guiscard]]; but, deserting the emperor, many of them (1085) were thrown into prison.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Efforts were again put forth for their conversion; and for the converts the new city of [[Alexiopolis]] was built, opposite Philippopolis. When the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]] took [[Constantinople]] (1204), they found some [[Paulicians]], whom the historian [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] calls Popelicans.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe Legend of Saint Gerard discloses that followers of Bulgarian Bogomilism were present during the early 11th century in [[Ahtum]]'s realm, which comprised present day [[Banat]].

Fresco from 1290]]\n\nThe Bogomils spread westwards and settled in [[Serbia]], where they were to be known as Babuns (''Babuni''). At the end of the 12th century [[Serbian Grand Prince]] [[Stefan Nemanja]] and the Serbian council deemed Bogomilism a [[heresy]], and expelled them from the country. Large numbers, majority of Vlach origin, took refuge in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Dalmatia]] where they were known under the name of Patarenes (''Patareni'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nProviding refuge to heretics, including bogomils, was a recurrent pretext for Hungarian rulers to declare [[crusades against Bosnia]] and extend their influence in the region. A first Hungarian complaint to the Pope was averted by the public abjuration of the Bosnian ruler [[Ban Kulin]], close relative of Stefan Nemanja, in 1203.<ref>Thierry Mudry, Histoire de la Bosnie-Herz\u00e9govine faits et controverses, \u00c9ditions Ellipses, 1999 (chapitre 2: La Bosnie m\u00e9di\u00e9vale p. 25 \u00e0 42 et chapitre 7 : La querelle historiographique p. 255 \u00e0 265).

In the following centuries, the Bosnian Church (autonomous but mainly following Orthodox doctrine<ref>John A. Fine - The Late Medieval Balkans</ref><ref>Noel Malcolm - Bosnia: A Short History</ref>) and the heretic sect of the bogomils came to be identified with each other, due to the scarcity of documents after the Ottoman conquest.<ref>The issue of the false Bogomil hypothesis is accurately dealt with by Noel Malcolm (Bosnia.

Fine (in Mark Pinson, The Bosnian Muslims)</ref>\n\nIn 1203, [[Pope Innocent III]], with the aid of the King of Hungary, forced an agreement of Kulin to acknowledge Papal authority and religion: in practice this was ignored. On the death of Kulin in 1216 a mission was sent to convert Bosnia to Rome but failed. In 1234, the [[Bishop of Bosnia|Catholic Bishop of Bosnia]] was removed by Pope Gregory IX for allowing heretical practices.<ref>Malcolm Lambert, ''Medieval Heresy:Popular Movements from Bogomil to Hus'', (Edward Arnold Ltd, 1977), 143.</ref> In addition, Gregory called on the Hungarian king to crusade against the heretics.<ref>''Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World, C. 650-c. 1450'', ed.

Such decision provoked the schism of the Bosnian Christians, who refused to submit to the Hungarians and broke off their relations with Rome.<ref>Mudry 1999; Hupchick and Cox 2008</ref> In that way, an autonomous Bosnian Church came into being, in which some later saw a Bogomil or Cathar Church, while in reality no trace of bogomilism, [[cathars|Catharism]] or [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] can be found in the original documents of the Bosnian Christians.<ref>The issue of the false Bogomil hypothesis is accurately dealt with by [[Noel Malcolm]] (''Bosnia.

Some scholars, who sought certain ideological backgrounds and justifications for their political narratives, argue that both Catholics and Orthodox persecuted the Bogomils as heretics and according to them, the pressures drew Bosnia to Bogomilism. It has purportedly been said that, with the introduction of Ottoman rule, Bosnians (this is not an ethnic name but a regional one - the only ethnic names known from the contemporary sources in medieval Bosnia were \"Serbs and Vlachs\" <ref>John A. Fine - The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey</ref>) were often more likely to convert to Islam since they were not friends of either the Roman Catholic or Serb Orthodox churches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. However, these claims have been completely rejected today <ref>John A. Fine - The Late Medieval Balkans</ref><ref>Noel Malcolm - Bosnia: A Short History</ref> as an anachronism from the Austro-Hungarian era. Although this narrative has been debunked, it continues to be emphasized by the Bosniak academic community.\n\nFrom Bosnia, their influence extended into Italy ([[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]). The Hungarians undertook many crusades against the heretics in Bosnia, but towards the close of the 15th century, the conquest of that country by the Turks put an end to their persecution. Few or no remnants of Bogomilism have survived in Bosnia. The Ritual in Slavonic written by the Bosnian Radoslav, and published in vol. xv. of the ''Starine of the South Slavonic Academy at Agram'', shows great resemblance to the [[Cathar]] ritual published by Cunitz, 1853.<ref>[[Franjo Ra\u010dki]], \"Bogomili i Paternai\" in ''[[Rad (journal)|Rad]]'', vols. vii., viii. and x.

There are still over ten thousand Banat Bulgarians in [[Banat]] today in the villages of [[Dude\u015ftii Vechi]], [[Vinga]], [[Denta|Bre\u015ftea]] and also in the city of [[Timi\u0219oara]], with a few in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]; however, they no longer practice Bogomilism, having converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. There are also a few villages of Paulicians in the Serbian part of [[Banat]], especially the villages of [[Ivanovo, Serbia|Ivanovo]] and Belo Blato, near [[Pan\u010devo]].\n\n=== Social factors ===\nThe gradual Christianization of the Bulgarian population, the fact that the service was initially practiced in Greek, which only the elite knew, resulted in a low level of understanding of the religion among the peasantry. Due to the constant wars during the time of Tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], the lands near the Byzantine border ([[Thrace]]) were devastated, and the people living there were left without occupation. The constant change of authority over these lands, and the higher taxes during the time of Tsar Peter I, gave birth to a great social discontent at the beginning of the 10th century. Moreover, the corruption of the church as an institution, led to grave disappointment among its recently converted flock.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n=== Religious factors ===\nThe existence of older Christian heresies in the Bulgarian lands ([[Manichaeism]] and [[Paulicianism]]), which were considered very [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], influenced the Bogomil movement. Manichaeism's origin is related to [[Zoroastrianism]]; that is why Bogomilism is sometimes indirectly connected to Zoroastrianism in the sense of its duality.\n\n=== Connections to the royal court ===\nMost probably, as [[Samuil of Bulgaria]] revolted against the Byzantine Empire, he relied on the popular support of the movement. There are no sources of Bogomil persecution during his reign (976\u20131014).<ref name='obolensky1' />\n\n== Doctrine ==\nFrom the imperfect and conflicting data that is available, one positive result can be gathered that the Bogomils were [[gnostic]]s, [[adoptionist]]s and [[Dualism (cosmology)|dualist]]s.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTheir dualism was initially moderate (or \"monarchian\"): according to their teachings, God created and rules the spiritual part of the world, and Satan the material, but Satan is ultimately inferior to God and his side by virtue of being God's son.<ref name=Yuri>{{cite book|author=Yuri Stoyanov|title=The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy|url=|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-03-000825-3-1|page=|language= Spanish}}</ref> However, Bogomils were not quite free from the absolute dualism of [[Manichaeism]] and [[Paulicianism]], and over time adopted an absolute position too, believing God and Satan as eternal opponents, similar to the one maintained by the posterior [[Cathars]].<ref name=Yuri/>\n\nTheir adoptionist teaching apparently came from [[Paul of Samosata]] (though at a later period the name of Paul was believed to be that of the Apostle).

The Historiated Bible, the Letter from Heaven, the Wanderings through Heaven and Hell, the numerous Adam and Cross legends, the religious poems of the \"Kal\u0113ki perehozhie\" and other similar productions owe their dissemination to a large extent to the activity of the Bogomils of Bulgaria, and their successors in other lands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Cosmology ===\nIn their original monarchian dualist story, Bogomils taught that God had two sons, the elder [[Satanail]] and the younger [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bogomils|title=1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Bogomils|accessdate= 20 October 2018|year= 1911|quote= Bogomils taught that God had two sons, the elder Satanail and the younger Michael}}</ref> Satanail rebelled against the father and became an evil spirit. He created the lower heavens and the Earth and tried in vain to create man, though in the end he had to appeal to God for the Spirit. After creation, [[Adam]] was allowed to till the ground on condition that he sold himself and his posterity to the owner of the Earth, Satanail.\n\nIn order to free Adam and his offspring, Michael was sent in the form of a man, becoming identified with [[Jesus Christ]], and was \"[[Adoptionism|elected]]\" by God after the baptism in the Jordan. When the Holy Ghost appeared in the shape of the dove, Jesus received power to break the covenant in the form of a clay tablet (''hierographon'') held by Satanail from Adam. He had now become the angel Michael in a human form, and as such he vanquished Satanail, and deprived him of the suffix ''il'' (meaning ''God''), in which his power resided. Satanail was thus transformed into Satan. However, through Satan's machinations the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] took place, and Satan was the originator of the whole [[Orthodox Christian|Orthodox]] community with its churches, vestments, ceremonies, sacraments and fasts, with its monks and priests. This world being the work of Satan, the perfect must eschew any and every excess of its pleasure, though not so far as asceticism.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThey held the \"Lord's Prayer\" in high respect as the most potent weapon against Satan, and had a number of conjurations against \"evil spirits\". Each community had its own twelve \"apostles\", and women could be raised to the rank of \"elect\". The Bogomils wore garments like those of [[Mendicant orders|mendicant friars]] and were known as enthusiastic missionaries, travelling far and wide to propagate their doctrines. Healing the sick and exorcising the evil spirit, they traversed different countries and spread their apocryphal literature along with some of the books of the Old Testament, deeply influencing the religious spirit of the nations and preparing them for the Reformation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Christology and the Trinity ===\nFor Bogomils \"the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] was not the [[God the Son|Second Person of the Blessed Trinity]], the [[incarnation|Eternal Word incarnate]], but merely the spoken word of God, shown in the oral teaching of Christ\".<ref>''The Bogomils: A Study in Balkan Neo-Manichaeism'' Page 211 Dimitri Obolensky, 2004 \"The Logos was for them not the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word incarnate, but merely the spoken word of God, manifested in the oral teaching of Christ.* Hence the Bogomils taught that Christ was ...\"</ref> Although Bogomils regarded themselves as \"Trinitarian\",<ref>''Contra Patarenos'' Page 39 Hugh Eteriano, Janet Hamilton, Sarah Hamilton, 2004 \"He was aware that the Bogomils regarded themselves as Trinitarians: 'Do not be astonished, my brothers', he writes,'\u2026 when you hear them say that they believe in Father, Son and Holy Spirit, that they keep the apostles and saints\u2026\"</ref> anathemas against Bogomils (circa 1027) charge Bogomils with rejection of the [[Trinity]].<ref>''Heresy in medieval France: dualism in Aquitaine and the Agenais'', Page 64 Claire Taylor, Royal Historical Society (Great Britain), 2005: \"Anathemas against Bogomils were in use in the early decades of the eleventh century, contained in versions of the Synodikon of orthodoxy and included in a euchologion produced in 1027. They attest to Bogomil rejection of the Trinity\"</ref>\n\n=== Opposition to institutions and materialism ===\n{{original research|date=December 2010}}\nThe essence of Bogomilism is the duality in the creation of the world. This is  why it is considered a heresy by the [[Catholic Church]]. Bogomils explained the earthly sinful corporeal life as a creation of Satan, an angel that was sent to Earth. Due to this duality, the church does not believe in anything that is created with materialistic and governmental goals. It further claims that no human doctrine should be followed, because no doctrine comes from the soul, the only divine possession of the human.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Bogomil followers refused to pay taxes, to work in serfdom, or to fight in conquering wars. They ignored the feudal social system, which was interpreted by their enemies and contemporaries as creating disorder, and even the destruction of the state and church.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n[[Strigolniki|Karp Strigolnik]], who in the 14th century preached the doctrine in [[Novgorod]], explained that St. Paul had taught that simpleminded men should instruct one another; therefore they elected their \"teachers\" from among themselves to be their spiritual guides, and had no special priests. There is a tradition that the Bogomils taught that prayers were to be said in private houses, not in separate buildings such as churches. Ordination was conferred by the congregation and not by any specially appointed minister. The congregation were the \"elect\", and each member could obtain the perfection of Christ and become a Christ or \"Chlist\". Marriage was not a sacrament. Bogomils refused to fast on Mondays and Fridays, and they rejected monasticism. They declared Christ to be the Son of God only through grace like other prophets, and that the bread and wine of the eucharist were not physically transformed into flesh and blood; that the last judgement would be executed by God and not by Jesus; that the images and the cross were idols and the veneration of saints and relics idolatry.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThese doctrines have survived in the great Russian sects, and can be traced back to the teachings and practice of the Bogomils. But in addition to these doctrines of an adoptionist origin, they held the Manichaean dualistic conception of the origin of the world. This has been partly preserved in some of their literary remains, and has taken deep root in the beliefs and traditions of Balkan nations with substantial Bogomil followings. The chief literature of all the heretical sects throughout the ages has been that of apocryphal Biblical narratives, and the popes Jeremiah or Bogumil are directly mentioned as authors of such forbidden books \"which no orthodox dare read\". Though these writings are mostly of the same origin as those from the older lists of apocryphal books, they underwent a modification at the hands of their Bogomil editors, so as to be useful for the propagation of their own specific doctrines.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn its most simple and attractive form\u2014invested with the authority of the reputed holy author\u2014their account of the creation of the world and of man, the origin of sin and redemption, the history of the Cross, and the disputes between body and soul, right and wrong, heaven and hell, were embodied either in \"Historiated Bibles\" (Paleya) or in special dialogues held between Christ and his disciples, or between renowned Fathers of the Church who expounded these views in a simple manner adapted to the understanding of the people (Lucidaria).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Link with later religious movements ===\nThe Bogomils were the connecting link between the so-called heretical sects of the East and those of the West. They were, moreover, the most active agents in disseminating such teachings in Kievan Rus' and among all the nations of [[Europe]]. In the 12th and 13th century, the Bogomils were already known in the West as \"Cathars\" or in other places as \"Bulgari\", i.e. Bulgarians (\u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438). In 1207 the ''Bulgarorum heresis'' is mentioned. In 1223 the [[Albigenses]] are declared to be the local Bougres, and in the same period mention is made of the \"Pope of the Albigenses who resided within the confines of Bulgaria\" (see also [[Nicetas, Bogomil bishop]]). The [[Cathars]] and [[Bosnian Church|Patarenes]], the [[Waldenses]], the [[Anabaptists]], and in Russia the [[Strigolniki]], and [[Spiritual Christians]], have all at different times been either identified with the Bogomils or closely connected with them, even though several of these are unrelated and are not dualist.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nConsiderable scholarly debate has arisen about the exact relationship between dualist heresies that arose in different places and centuries across medieval Europe, questioning whether it was indeed a single movement or belief system which was spread from one region to the next, or if multiple heretical movements arose independently in different parts of Europe.  Furthering the confusion is that the medieval sources themselves, such as the 13th century papal Inquisition in France, would often simply assume that dualistic heresies were directly connected to previous heretical movements in different regions.  Inquistors often described 13th century Cathars as a direct outgrowth of surviving Manichean dualists from previous centuries\u2014though by the same logic, Inquisitors who encountered pagan religions in the fringes of Europe (Celtic lands, or in the Baltic Crusades) would directly accuse non-Christians of worshiping \"Apollo and Mercury\", simply applying previous terms and rhetoric to new contexts in which they didn't accurately apply. Thus medieval scholarship is divided over whether the \"Cathars\" actually were an offshoot of the \"Bogomils\", or if the 13th century Inquisition itself simply mistook \"Cathars\" for \"Bogomils\".\n\n===In modern and popular culture===\nIn ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'', a novel by the [[Italians|Italian]] philosopher and writer [[Umberto Eco]], the plot concerning a widespread secret and mystic conspiracy has its ground in the disappearance of the Bogomils after the fall of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n''[[The Secret Book]]'' is a [[North Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[feature film]] combining the [[Detective fiction|detective]], [[Thriller film|thriller]] and [[conspiracy fiction]] genres, based on a fictional story of the quest for the original Slavic language \"Secret Book\", written by the Bogomils in Bulgaria and carried to Western Europe during the Middle Ages.\n\nA French and consequently an English word emerged based on twisted perceptions of the Bogomils by the Catholic Church. The words \"bouguer\" and \"[[buggery]]\" emerged, by way of the word \"bougre\" in French, from the [[Latin]] ''Bulgarus'' (Bulgarian). \"Buggery\" first appears in English in 1330 with the sense \"abominable heresy\", though \"bugger\" in a sexual sense is not recorded until 1555.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24372?redirectedFrom=buggery#eid}}</ref>\nThe ''Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' quotes a similar form\u2014\"bowgard\" (and \"bouguer\"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics \"as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. Albigensian\". Webster's Third New International Dictionary, gives the only meaning of the word \"bugger\" as sodomite, \"from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Bogomilism Study |url=http://www.bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810053756/http://bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |archivedate=2015-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[Bogomil Cove]] on [[Rugged Island (South Shetland Islands)|Rugged Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Priest Bogomil.\n\nThe Bogomils make a significant part in the [[Thomas Pynchon]] novel ''[[Against the Day]]'', when Cyprian Lakewood becomes a postulant and gives up his life of sodomitic servitude as a spy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Albigensian Crusade]]\n* [[Bosnian Muslims]]\n* [[Edmund Hamer Broadbent]] - The Pilgrim Church\n* [[Cathar]]\n* [[Gnostic]]\n* [[Novgorod Codex]]\n* [[Paulicianism]]\n* [[Restorationism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bogomils|volume=4|page=119|first=Moses|last=Gaster|authorlink=Moses Gaster}} This provides as bibliography:\n* [[Euthymius Zigabenus]], ''Narratio de Bogomilis'', ed.

They did not use the Christian [[Christian cross|cross]], nor build [[church (building)|church]]es, as they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging,{{clarify|date=May 2016}} [[fasting]], celebrating and dancing.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term ''Bogomil'' in free translation means \"dear to God\", and is a compound of the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] words for \"god\" ([[Common Slavic]]: [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/bog\u044a|*bog\u044a]]) and \"dear\" (Common Slavic: *mil\u044a). It may be also a translation of the Greek name ''Theophilos'', literally \"dear to God; loved by the gods,\" from ''theos'' \"god\" + ''philos'' \"loved, beloved\". It is difficult to ascertain whether the name was taken from the reputed founder of that movement, the priest Bogomil ({{lang-bg|\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043b|Bogomil}}), or whether he assumed that name after it had been given to the sect itself. The word is an [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[calque]] of ''Massaliani'', the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] name of the sect corresponding to the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Euchites]]. The Bogomils are identified with the [[Messalians]] in Greek and Slavonic documents from the 12th-14th centuries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wolski |first1=Jan |title=Autoproscoptae, Bogomils and Messalians in the 14th Century Bulgaria |journal=Studia Ceranea |date=2014 |volume=4 |pages=234-238 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12120359/Autoproscoptae_Bogomils_and_Messalians_in_the_14th_Century_Bulgaria}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe members are referred to as ''Babuni'' in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] documents, which originally meant \"superstition; superstitious person\" (Common Slavic: ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/babon\u044a|*babon\u044a, *babun\u044a *babona]]'').

The old Slavonic lists of forbidden books of the 15th and 16th century also give us a clue to the discovery of this heretical literature and of the means the Bogomils employed to carry on their [[teachings]].

Under Byzantine and then later Ottoman rule, the Armenian Paulicians lived in relative safety in their ancient stronghold near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]], and further northward. Linguistically, they were assimilated into the [[Bulgarians]], by whom they were called ''pavlikiani'' (the [[Byzantine Greek]] word for Paulician). In 1650, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] gathered them into its fold.

In spite of all measures of repression, it remained strong and popular until the fall of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in the end of the 14th century. Bogomilism was an outcome of many factors that had arisen in the beginning of the 10th century, most probably in the region of Macedonia.  It was also strongly influenced by the [[Paulicians]] who had been driven out of [[Armenia]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reformedreader.org/history/brockett/bogomils.htm |title=Bogomils of Bulgaria and Bosnia | work =The Reformed Reader}}</ref>\n\nThe Slavonic sources are unanimous on the point that Bogomil's teaching was Manichaean. A ''Synodikon'' from the year 1210 adds the names of his pupils or \"apostles\", Mihail, Todur, Dobri, Stefan, Vasilie and Peter. Zealous missionaries carried their doctrines far and wide. In 1004, scarcely 25 years after the introduction of Christianity into [[Kievan Rus]], we hear of a priest Adrian teaching the same doctrines as the Bogomils. He was imprisoned by Leontius, Bishop of [[Kiev]]. In 1125, the Church in the south of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] had to combat another heresiarch named Dmitri. The Church in Bulgaria also tried to extirpate Bogomilism. Several thousand went in the army of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] against the [[Normans|Norman]], [[Robert Guiscard]]; but, deserting the emperor, many of them (1085) were thrown into prison.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Efforts were again put forth for their conversion; and for the converts the new city of [[Alexiopolis]] was built, opposite Philippopolis.

At the end of the 12th century [[Serbian Grand Prince]] [[Stefan Nemanja]] and the Serbian council deemed Bogomilism a [[heresy]], and expelled them from the country. Large numbers, majority of Vlach origin, took refuge in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Dalmatia]] where they were known under the name of Patarenes (''Patareni'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nProviding refuge to heretics, including bogomils, was a recurrent pretext for Hungarian rulers to declare [[crusades against Bosnia]] and extend their influence in the region.

Some scholars, who sought certain ideological backgrounds and justifications for their political narratives, argue that both Catholics and Orthodox persecuted the Bogomils as heretics and according to them, the pressures drew Bosnia to Bogomilism. It has purportedly been said that, with the introduction of Ottoman rule, Bosnians (this is not an ethnic name but a regional one - the only ethnic names known from the contemporary sources in medieval Bosnia were \"Serbs and Vlachs\" <ref>John A. Fine - The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey</ref>) were often more likely to convert to Islam since they were not friends of either the Roman Catholic or Serb Orthodox churches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. However, these claims have been completely rejected today <ref>John A. Fine - The Late Medieval Balkans</ref><ref>Noel Malcolm - Bosnia: A Short History</ref> as an anachronism from the Austro-Hungarian era. Although this narrative has been debunked, it continues to be emphasized by the Bosniak academic community.\n\nFrom Bosnia, their influence extended into Italy ([[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]). The Hungarians undertook many crusades against the heretics in Bosnia, but towards the close of the 15th century, the conquest of that country by the Turks put an end to their persecution. Few or no remnants of Bogomilism have survived in Bosnia. The Ritual in Slavonic written by the Bosnian Radoslav, and published in vol. xv. of the ''Starine of the South Slavonic Academy at Agram'', shows great resemblance to the [[Cathar]] ritual published by Cunitz, 1853.<ref>[[Franjo Ra\u010dki]], \"Bogomili i Paternai\" in ''[[Rad (journal)|Rad]]'', vols. vii., viii. and x.

There are still over ten thousand Banat Bulgarians in [[Banat]] today in the villages of [[Dude\u015ftii Vechi]], [[Vinga]], [[Denta|Bre\u015ftea]] and also in the city of [[Timi\u015foara]], with a few in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]; however, they no longer practice Bogomilism, having converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. There are also a few villages of Paulicians in the Serbian part of [[Banat]], especially the villages of [[Ivanovo, Serbia|Ivanovo]] and Belo Blato, near [[Pan\u010devo]].\n\n=== Social factors ===\nThe gradual Christianization of the Bulgarian population, the fact that the service was initially practiced in Greek, which only the elite knew, resulted in a low level of understanding of the religion among the peasantry. Due to the constant wars during the time of Tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], the lands near the Byzantine border ([[Thrace]]) were devastated, and the people living there were left without occupation. The constant change of authority over these lands, and the higher taxes during the time of Tsar Peter I, gave birth to a great social discontent at the beginning of the 10th century. Moreover, the corruption of the church as an institution, led to grave disappointment among its recently converted flock.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n=== Religious factors ===\nThe existence of older Christian heresies in the Bulgarian lands ([[Manichaeism]] and [[Paulicianism]]), which were considered very [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], influenced the Bogomil movement. Manichaeism's origin is related to [[Zoroastrianism]]; that is why Bogomilism is sometimes indirectly connected to Zoroastrianism in the sense of its duality.\n\n=== Connections to the royal court ===\nMost probably, as [[Samuil of Bulgaria]] revolted against the Byzantine Empire, he relied on the popular support of the movement. There are no sources of Bogomil persecution during his reign (976\u20131014).<ref name='obolensky1' />\n\n== Doctrine ==\nFrom the imperfect and conflicting data that is available, one positive result can be gathered that the Bogomils were [[gnostic]]s, [[adoptionist]]s and [[Dualism (cosmology)|dualist]]s.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTheir dualism was initially moderate (or \"monarchian\"): according to their teachings, God created and rules the spiritual part of the world, and Satan the material, but Satan is ultimately inferior to God and his side by virtue of being God's son.<ref name=Yuri>{{cite book|author=Yuri Stoyanov|title=The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy|url=|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-03-000825-3-1|page=|language= Spanish}}</ref> However, Bogomils were not quite free from the absolute dualism of [[Manichaeism]] and [[Paulicianism]], and over time adopted an absolute position too, believing God and Satan as eternal opponents, similar to the one maintained by the posterior [[Cathars]].<ref name=Yuri/>\n\nTheir adoptionist teaching apparently came from [[Paul of Samosata]] (though at a later period the name of Paul was believed to be that of the Apostle).

They sowed the seeds of a rich, popular religious literature in the East as well as the West. The Historiated Bible, the Letter from Heaven, the Wanderings through Heaven and Hell, the numerous Adam and Cross legends, the religious poems of the \"Kal\u0113ki perehozhie\" and other similar productions owe their dissemination to a large extent to the activity of the Bogomils of Bulgaria, and their successors in other lands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Cosmology ===\nIn their original monarchian dualist story, Bogomils taught that God had two sons, the elder [[Satanail]] and the younger [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bogomils|title=1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Bogomils|accessdate= 20 October 2018|year= 1911|quote= Bogomils taught that God had two sons, the elder Satanail and the younger Michael}}</ref> Satanail rebelled against the father and became an evil spirit. He created the lower heavens and the Earth and tried in vain to create man, though in the end he had to appeal to God for the Spirit. After creation, [[Adam]] was allowed to till the ground on condition that he sold himself and his posterity to the owner of the Earth, Satanail.\n\nIn order to free Adam and his offspring, Michael was sent in the form of a man, becoming identified with [[Jesus Christ]], and was \"[[Adoptionism|elected]]\" by God after the baptism in the Jordan. When the Holy Ghost appeared in the shape of the dove, Jesus received power to break the covenant in the form of a clay tablet (''hierographon'') held by Satanail from Adam. He had now become the angel Michael in a human form, and as such he vanquished Satanail, and deprived him of the suffix ''il'' (meaning ''God''), in which his power resided. Satanail was thus transformed into Satan. However, through Satan's machinations the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] took place, and Satan was the originator of the whole [[Orthodox Christian|Orthodox]] community with its churches, vestments, ceremonies, sacraments and fasts, with its monks and priests. This world being the work of Satan, the perfect must eschew any and every excess of its pleasure, though not so far as asceticism.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThey held the \"Lord's Prayer\" in high respect as the most potent weapon against Satan, and had a number of conjurations against \"evil spirits\". Each community had its own twelve \"apostles\", and women could be raised to the rank of \"elect\". The Bogomils wore garments like those of [[Mendicant orders|mendicant friars]] and were known as enthusiastic missionaries, travelling far and wide to propagate their doctrines. Healing the sick and exorcising the evil spirit, they traversed different countries and spread their apocryphal literature along with some of the books of the Old Testament, deeply influencing the religious spirit of the nations and preparing them for the Reformation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Christology and the Trinity ===\nFor Bogomils \"the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] was not the [[God the Son|Second Person of the Blessed Trinity]], the [[incarnation|Eternal Word incarnate]], but merely the spoken word of God, shown in the oral teaching of Christ\".<ref>''The Bogomils: A Study in Balkan Neo-Manichaeism'' Page 211 Dimitri Obolensky, 2004 \"The Logos was for them not the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word incarnate, but merely the spoken word of God, manifested in the oral teaching of Christ.* Hence the Bogomils taught that Christ was ...\"</ref> Although Bogomils regarded themselves as \"Trinitarian\",<ref>''Contra Patarenos'' Page 39 Hugh Eteriano, Janet Hamilton, Sarah Hamilton, 2004 \"He was aware that the Bogomils regarded themselves as Trinitarians: 'Do not be astonished, my brothers', he writes,'\u2026 when you hear them say that they believe in Father, Son and Holy Spirit, that they keep the apostles and saints\u2026\"</ref> anathemas against Bogomils (circa 1027) charge Bogomils with rejection of the [[Trinity]].<ref>''Heresy in medieval France: dualism in Aquitaine and the Agenais'', Page 64 Claire Taylor, Royal Historical Society (Great Britain), 2005: \"Anathemas against Bogomils were in use in the early decades of the eleventh century, contained in versions of the Synodikon of orthodoxy and included in a euchologion produced in 1027. They attest to Bogomil rejection of the Trinity\"</ref>\n\n=== Opposition to institutions and materialism ===\n{{original research|date=December 2010}}\nThe essence of Bogomilism is the duality in the creation of the world. This is  why it is considered a heresy by the [[Catholic Church]]. Bogomils explained the earthly sinful corporeal life as a creation of Satan, an angel that was sent to Earth. Due to this duality, the church does not believe in anything that is created with materialistic and governmental goals. It further claims that no human doctrine should be followed, because no doctrine comes from the soul, the only divine possession of the human.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Bogomil followers refused to pay taxes, to work in serfdom, or to fight in conquering wars. They ignored the feudal social system, which was interpreted by their enemies and contemporaries as creating disorder, and even the destruction of the state and church.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n[[Strigolniki|Karp Strigolnik]], who in the 14th century preached the doctrine in [[Novgorod]], explained that St. Paul had taught that simpleminded men should instruct one another; therefore they elected their \"teachers\" from among themselves to be their spiritual guides, and had no special priests. There is a tradition that the Bogomils taught that prayers were to be said in private houses, not in separate buildings such as churches. Ordination was conferred by the congregation and not by any specially appointed minister. The congregation were the \"elect\", and each member could obtain the perfection of Christ and become a Christ or \"Chlist\". Marriage was not a sacrament. Bogomils refused to fast on Mondays and Fridays, and they rejected monasticism. They declared Christ to be the Son of God only through grace like other prophets, and that the bread and wine of the eucharist were not physically transformed into flesh and blood; that the last judgement would be executed by God and not by Jesus; that the images and the cross were idols and the veneration of saints and relics idolatry.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThese doctrines have survived in the great Russian sects, and can be traced back to the teachings and practice of the Bogomils. But in addition to these doctrines of an adoptionist origin, they held the Manichaean dualistic conception of the origin of the world. This has been partly preserved in some of their literary remains, and has taken deep root in the beliefs and traditions of Balkan nations with substantial Bogomil followings. The chief literature of all the heretical sects throughout the ages has been that of apocryphal Biblical narratives, and the popes Jeremiah or Bogumil are directly mentioned as authors of such forbidden books \"which no orthodox dare read\". Though these writings are mostly of the same origin as those from the older lists of apocryphal books, they underwent a modification at the hands of their Bogomil editors, so as to be useful for the propagation of their own specific doctrines.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn its most simple and attractive form\u2014invested with the authority of the reputed holy author\u2014their account of the creation of the world and of man, the origin of sin and redemption, the history of the Cross, and the disputes between body and soul, right and wrong, heaven and hell, were embodied either in \"Historiated Bibles\" (Paleya) or in special dialogues held between Christ and his disciples, or between renowned Fathers of the Church who expounded these views in a simple manner adapted to the understanding of the people (Lucidaria).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Link with later religious movements ===\nThe Bogomils were the connecting link between the so-called heretical sects of the East and those of the West. They were, moreover, the most active agents in disseminating such teachings in Kievan Rus' and among all the nations of [[Europe]]. In the 12th and 13th century, the Bogomils were already known in the West as \"Cathars\" or in other places as \"Bulgari\", i.e. Bulgarians (\u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438). In 1207 the ''Bulgarorum heresis'' is mentioned. In 1223 the [[Albigenses]] are declared to be the local Bougres, and in the same period mention is made of the \"Pope of the Albigenses who resided within the confines of Bulgaria\" (see also [[Nicetas, Bogomil bishop]]). The [[Cathars]] and [[Bosnian Church|Patarenes]], the [[Waldenses]], the [[Anabaptists]], and in Russia the [[Strigolniki]], and [[Spiritual Christians]], have all at different times been either identified with the Bogomils or closely connected with them, even though several of these are unrelated and are not dualist.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nConsiderable scholarly debate has arisen about the exact relationship between dualist heresies that arose in different places and centuries across medieval Europe, questioning whether it was indeed a single movement or belief system which was spread from one region to the next, or if multiple heretical movements arose independently in different parts of Europe.  Furthering the confusion is that the medieval sources themselves, such as the 13th century papal Inquisition in France, would often simply assume that dualistic heresies were directly connected to previous heretical movements in different regions.  Inquistors often described 13th century Cathars as a direct outgrowth of surviving Manichean dualists from previous centuries\u2014though by the same logic, Inquisitors who encountered pagan religions in the fringes of Europe (Celtic lands, or in the Baltic Crusades) would directly accuse non-Christians of worshiping \"Apollo and Mercury\", simply applying previous terms and rhetoric to new contexts in which they didn't accurately apply. Thus medieval scholarship is divided over whether the \"Cathars\" actually were an offshoot of the \"Bogomils\", or if the 13th century Inquisition itself simply mistook \"Cathars\" for \"Bogomils\".\n\n===In modern and popular culture===\nIn ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'', a novel by the [[Italians|Italian]] philosopher and writer [[Umberto Eco]], the plot concerning a widespread secret and mystic conspiracy has its ground in the disappearance of the Bogomils after the fall of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n''[[The Secret Book]]'' is a [[North Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[feature film]] combining the [[Detective fiction|detective]], [[Thriller film|thriller]] and [[conspiracy fiction]] genres, based on a fictional story of the quest for the original Slavic language \"Secret Book\", written by the Bogomils in Bulgaria and carried to Western Europe during the Middle Ages.\n\nA French and consequently an English word emerged based on twisted perceptions of the Bogomils by the Catholic Church. The words \"bouguer\" and \"[[buggery]]\" emerged, by way of the word \"bougre\" in French, from the [[Latin]] ''Bulgarus'' (Bulgarian). \"Buggery\" first appears in English in 1330 with the sense \"abominable heresy\", though \"bugger\" in a sexual sense is not recorded until 1555.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24372?redirectedFrom=buggery#eid}}</ref>\nThe ''Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' quotes a similar form\u2014\"bowgard\" (and \"bouguer\"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics \"as belonging to the Greek Church, sp.

There are many metrics that can be used to measure the performance of a classifier or predictor; different fields have different preferences for specific metrics due to different goals. For example, in medicine [[sensitivity and specificity]] are often used, while in computer science [[precision and recall]] are preferred. An important distinction is between metrics that are independent on the [[prevalence]] (how often each category occurs in the population), and metrics that depend on the prevalence \u2013 both types are useful, but they have very different properties.\n\n==Contingency table==\n{{main article|Confusion matrix}}\n\nGiven a data set, a classification (the output of a classifier on that set) gives two numbers: the number of positives and the number of negatives, which add up to the total size of the set. To evaluate a classifier, one compares its output to another reference classification \u2013 ideally a perfect classification, but in practice the output of another [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] test \u2013 and [[cross tabulation|cross tabulates]] the data into a 2\u00d72 [[contingency table]], comparing the two classifications. One then evaluates the classifier ''relative'' to the gold standard by computing [[summary statistic]]s of these 4 numbers. Generally these statistics will be [[scale invariant]] (scaling all the numbers by the same factor does not change the output), to make them independent of population size, which is achieved by using ratios of [[homogeneous function]]s, most simply [[homogeneous linear]] or [[homogeneous quadratic]] functions.\n\nSay we test some people for the presence of a disease. Some of these people have the disease, and our test correctly says they are positive. They are called ''[[true positive]]s'' (TP). Some have the disease, but the test incorrectly claims they don't. They are called ''[[false negative]]s'' (FN). Some don't have the disease, and the test says they don't \u2013 ''[[true negative]]s'' (TN). Finally, there might be healthy people who have a positive test result \u2013 ''[[false positive]]s'' (FP). These can be arranged into a 2\u00d72 contingency table ([[confusion matrix]]), conventionally with the test result on the vertical axis and the actual condition on the horizontal axis.\n\nThese numbers can then be totaled, yielding both a [[grand total]] and [[marginal total]]s. Totaling the entire table, the number of true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives add up to 100% of the set. Totaling the rows (adding horizontally) the number of true positives and false positives add up to 100% of the test positives, and likewise for negatives. Totaling the columns (adding vertically), the number of true positives and false negatives add up to 100% of the condition positives (conversely for negatives). The basic marginal ratio statistics are obtained by dividing the 2\u00d72=4 values in the table by the marginal totals (either rows or columns), yielding 2 auxiliary 2\u00d72 tables, for a total of 8 ratios. These ratios come in 4 complementary pairs, each pair summing to 1, and so each of these derived 2\u00d72 tables can be summarized as a pair of 2 numbers, together with their complements. Further statistics can be obtained by taking ratios of these ratios, ratios of ratios, or more complicated functions.\n\nThe contingency table and the most common derived ratios are summarized below; see sequel for details.\n\n{{DiagnosticTesting Diagram}}\n\nNote that the columns correspond to the ''condition actually'' being positive or negative (or classified as such by the gold standard), as indicated by the color-coding, and the associated statistics are prevalence-independent, while the rows correspond to the ''test'' being positive or negative, and the associated statistics are prevalence-dependent. There are analogous likelihood ratios for prediction values, but these are less commonly used, and not depicted above.\n\n== Sensitivity and specificity ==\n{{main article|Sensitivity and specificity}}\nThe fundamental prevalence-independent statistics are [[sensitivity and specificity]].\n\n'''[[Sensitivity (tests)|Sensitivity]]''' or [[True Positive Rate]] (TPR), also known as [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], is the proportion of people that tested positive and are positive (True Positive, TP) of all the people that actually are positive (Condition Positive, CP = TP + FN). It can be seen as ''the probability that the test is positive given that the patient is sick''. With higher sensitivity, fewer actual cases of disease go undetected (or, in the case of the factory quality control, fewer faulty products go to the market).\n\n'''[[Specificity (tests)|Specificity]]''' (SPC) or [[True Negative Rate]] (TNR) is the proportion of people that tested negative and are negative (True Negative, TN) of all the people that actually are negative (Condition Negative, CN = TN + FP). As with sensitivity, it can be looked at as ''the probability that the test result is negative given that the patient is not sick''. With higher specificity, fewer healthy people are labeled as sick (or, in the factory case, fewer good products are discarded).\n\nThe relationship between sensitivity and specificity, as well as the performance of the classifier, can be visualized and studied using the [[Receiver Operating Characteristic]] (ROC) curve.\n\nIn theory, sensitivity and specificity are independent in the sense that it is possible to achieve 100% in both (such as in the red/blue ball example given above). In more practical, less contrived instances, however, there is usually a trade-off, such that they are inversely proportional to one another to some extent. This is because we rarely measure the actual thing we would like to classify; rather, we generally measure an indicator of the thing we would like to classify, referred to as a [[surrogate endpoint|surrogate marker]]. The reason why 100% is achievable in the ball example is because redness and blueness is determined by directly detecting redness and blueness. However, indicators are sometimes compromised, such as when non-indicators mimic indicators or when indicators are time-dependent, only becoming evident after a certain lag time. The following example of a pregnancy test will make use of such an indicator.\n\nModern pregnancy tests ''do not'' use the pregnancy itself to determine pregnancy status; rather, [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] is used, or hCG, present in the urine of [[gravid]] females, as a ''surrogate marker to indicate'' that a woman is pregnant.  Because hCG can also be produced by a [[neoplasm|tumor]], the specificity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100% (because false positives are possible).  Also, because hCG is present in the urine in such small concentrations after fertilization and early [[embryogenesis]], the sensitivity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100% (because false negatives are possible).\n\n===Likelihood ratios===\n{{main article|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}}\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Positive and negative predictive values==\n{{main article|Positive and negative predictive values}}\nIn addition to sensitivity and specificity, the performance of a binary classification test can be measured with [[positive predictive value]] (PPV), also known as [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]], and [[negative predictive value]] (NPV). The positive prediction value answers the question \"If the test result is ''positive'', how well does that ''predict'' an actual presence of disease?\". It is calculated as TP/(TP + FP); that is, it is the proportion of true positives out of all positive results. The negative prediction value is the same, but for negatives, naturally.\n\n=== Impact of prevalence on prediction values ===\nPrevalence has a significant impact on prediction values. As an example, suppose there is a test for a disease with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. If 2000 people are tested and the prevalence (in the sample) is 50%, 1000 of them are sick and 1000 of them are healthy. Thus about 990 true positives and 990 true negatives are likely, with 10 false positives and 10 false negatives. The positive and negative prediction values would be 99%, so there can be high confidence in the result.\n\nHowever, if the prevalence is only 5%, so of the 2000 people only 100 are really sick, then the prediction values change significantly. The likely result is 99 true positives, 1 false negative, 1881 true negatives and 19 false positives. Of the 19+99 people tested positive, only 99 really have the disease \u2013 that means, intuitively, that given that a patient's test result is positive, there is only 84% chance that they really have the disease. On the other hand, given that the patient's test result is negative, there is only 1 chance in 1882, or 0.05% probability, that the patient has the disease despite the test result.\n\n===Likelihood ratios===\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Precision and recall==\n{{main article|Precision and recall}}\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Relationships===\nThere are various relationships between these ratios.\n\nIf the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are known, the positive predictive value can be obtained from the following identity:\n\n::<math> \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) (1-\\text{prevalence})} </math>\n\nIf the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are known, the negative predictive value can be obtained from the following identity:\n\n::<math> \n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(\\text{specificity}) (1 - \\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{specificity}) (1 - \\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence})}. </math>\n\n==Single metrics==\nIn addition to the paired metrics, there are also single metrics that give a single number to evaluate the test.\n\nPerhaps the simplest statistic is [[Accuracy and precision#In binary classification|accuracy]] or Fraction Correct (FC), which measures the fraction of all instances that are correctly categorized; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of correct or incorrect classifications: (TP + TN)/Total Population = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN). This is often not very useful, compared to the marginal ratios, as it does not yield useful marginal interpretations, due to mixing true positives (test positive, condition positive) and true negatives (test negative, condition negative) \u2013 in terms of the condition table, it sums the diagonal; further, it is prevalence-dependent. The complement is the Fraction Incorrect (FiC): FC + FiC = 1, or (FP + FN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) \u2013 this is the sum of the [[antidiagonal]], divided by the total population.\n\nThe [[diagnostic odds ratio]] (DOR) is a more useful overall metric, which can be defined directly as (TP\u00d7TN)/(FP\u00d7FN) = (TP/FN)/(FP/TN), or indirectly as a ratio of ratio of ratios (ratio of likelihood ratios, which are themselves ratios of True Rates or Prediction Values). This has a useful interpretation \u2013 as an [[odds ratio]] \u2013 and is prevalence-independent.\n\nAn [[F-score]] is a combination of the [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]] and the [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], providing a single score. There is a one-parameter family of statistics, with parameter ''\u03b2,'' which determines the relative weights of precision and recall. The traditional or balanced F-score ([[F1 score]]) is the [[Harmonic mean#Harmonic mean of two numbers|harmonic mean]] of precision and recall:\n\n:<math>F_1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{recall}}{\\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall}} </math>.\n\n===Alternative metrics===\nNote, however, that the F-scores do not take the true negative rate into account, and are more suited to [[information retrieval]] and [[information extraction]] evaluation where the true negatives are innumerable. Instead, measures such as the [[Phi coefficient]], [[Matthews correlation coefficient]], [[Informedness]] or [[Cohen's kappa]] may be preferable to assess the performance of a binary classifier.<ref name=\"Powers2007\">{{cite journal |first=David M W |last=Powers |date=2011 |title=Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Score to ROC, Informedness, Markedness & Correlation |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Technologies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=37\u201363 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2328/27165}}</ref><ref name=Powers2012>{{cite conference |first=David M.

There are many metrics that can be used to measure the performance of a classifier or predictor; different fields have different preferences for specific metrics due to different goals. For example, in medicine [[sensitivity and specificity]] are often used, while in computer science [[precision and recall]] are preferred. An important distinction is between metrics that are independent on the [[prevalence]] (how often each category occurs in the population), and metrics that depend on the prevalence \u2013 both types are useful, but they have very different properties.\n\n==Contingency table==\n{{main article|Confusion matrix}}\n\nGiven a data set, a classification (the output of a classifier on that set) gives two numbers: the number of positives and the number of negatives, which add up to the total size of the set. To evaluate a classifier, one compares its output to another reference classification \u2013 ideally a perfect classification, but in practice the output of another [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] test \u2013 and [[cross tabulation|cross tabulates]] the data into a 2\u00d72 [[contingency table]], comparing the two classifications. One then evaluates the classifier ''relative'' to the gold standard by computing [[summary statistic]]s of these 4 numbers. Generally these statistics will be [[scale invariant]] (scaling all the numbers by the same factor does not change the output), to make them independent of population size, which is achieved by using ratios of [[homogeneous function]]s, most simply [[homogeneous linear]] or [[homogeneous quadratic]] functions.\n\nSay we test some people for the presence of a disease. Some of these people have the disease, and our test correctly says they are positive. They are called ''[[true positive]]s'' (TP). Some have the disease, but the test incorrectly claims they don't. They are called ''[[false negative]]s'' (FN). Some don't have the disease, and the test says they don't \u2013 ''[[true negative]]s'' (TN). Finally, there might be healthy people who have a positive test result \u2013 ''[[false positive]]s'' (FP). These can be arranged into a 2\u00d72 contingency table ([[confusion matrix]]), conventionally with the test result on the vertical axis and the actual condition on the horizontal axis.\n\nThese numbers can then be totaled, yielding both a [[grand total]] and [[marginal total]]s. Totaling the entire table, the number of true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives add up to 100% of the set. Totaling the rows (adding horizontally) the number of true positives and false positives add up to 100% of the test positives, and likewise for negatives. Totaling the columns (adding vertically), the number of true positives and false negatives add up to 100% of the condition positives (conversely for negatives). The basic marginal ratio statistics are obtained by dividing the 2\u00d72=4 values in the table by the marginal totals (either rows or columns), yielding 2 auxiliary 2\u00d72 tables, for a total of 8 ratios. These ratios come in 4 complementary pairs, each pair summing to 1, and so each of these derived 2\u00d72 tables can be summarized as a pair of 2 numbers, together with their complements. Further statistics can be obtained by taking ratios of these ratios, ratios of ratios, or more complicated functions.\n\nThe contingency table and the most common derived ratios are summarized below; see sequel for details.\n\n{{DiagnosticTesting Diagram}}\n\nNote that the columns correspond to the ''condition actually'' being positive or negative (or classified as such by the gold standard), as indicated by the color-coding, and the associated statistics are prevalence-independent, while the rows correspond to the ''test'' being positive or negative, and the associated statistics are prevalence-dependent. There are analogous likelihood ratios for prediction values, but these are less commonly used, and not depicted above.\n\n== Sensitivity and specificity ==\n{{main article|Sensitivity and specificity}}\nThe fundamental prevalence-independent statistics are [[sensitivity and specificity]].\n\n'''[[Sensitivity (tests)|Sensitivity]]''' or [[True Positive Rate]] (TPR), also known as [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], is the proportion of people that tested positive and are positive (True Positive, TP) of all the people that actually are positive (Condition Positive, CP = TP + FN). It can be seen as ''the probability that the test is positive given that the patient is sick''. With higher sensitivity, fewer actual cases of disease go undetected (or, in the case of the factory quality control, fewer faulty products go to the market).\n\n'''[[Specificity (tests)|Specificity]]''' (SPC) or [[True Negative Rate]] (TNR) is the proportion of people that tested negative and are negative (True Negative, TN) of all the people that actually are negative (Condition Negative, CN = TN + FP). As with sensitivity, it can be looked at as ''the probability that the test result is negative given that the patient is not sick''. With higher specificity, fewer healthy people are labeled as sick (or, in the factory case, fewer good products are discarded).\n\nThe relationship between sensitivity and specificity, as well as the performance of the classifier, can be visualized and studied using the [[Receiver Operating Characteristic]] (ROC) curve.\n\nIn theory, sensitivity and specificity are independent in the sense that it is possible to achieve 100% in both (such as in the red/blue ball example given above). In more practical, less contrived instances, however, there is usually a trade-off, such that they are inversely proportional to one another to some extent. This is because we rarely measure the actual thing we would like to classify; rather, we generally measure an indicator of the thing we would like to classify, referred to as a [[surrogate endpoint|surrogate marker]]. The reason why 100% is achievable in the ball example is because redness and blueness is determined by directly detecting redness and blueness. However, indicators are sometimes compromised, such as when non-indicators mimic indicators or when indicators are time-dependent, only becoming evident after a certain lag time. The following example of a pregnancy test will make use of such an indicator.\n\nModern pregnancy tests ''do not'' use the pregnancy itself to determine pregnancy status; rather, [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] is used, or hCG, present in the urine of [[gravid]] females, as a ''surrogate marker to indicate'' that a woman is pregnant.  Because hCG can also be produced by a [[neoplasm|tumor]], the specificity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100% (because false positives are possible).  Also, because hCG is present in the urine in such small concentrations after fertilization and early [[embryogenesis]], the sensitivity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100% (because false negatives are possible).\n\n===Likelihood ratios===\n{{main article|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}}\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Positive and negative predictive values==\n{{main article|Positive and negative predictive values}}\nIn addition to sensitivity and specificity, the performance of a binary classification test can be measured with [[positive predictive value]] (PPV), also known as [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]], and [[negative predictive value]] (NPV). The positive prediction value answers the question \"If the test result is ''positive'', how well does that ''predict'' an actual presence of disease?\". It is calculated as TP/(TP + FP); that is, it is the proportion of true positives out of all positive results. The negative prediction value is the same, but for negatives, naturally.\n\n=== Impact of prevalence on prediction values ===\nPrevalence has a significant impact on prediction values. As an example, suppose there is a test for a disease with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. If 2000 people are tested and the prevalence (in the sample) is 50%, 1000 of them are sick and 1000 of them are healthy. Thus about 990 true positives and 990 true negatives are likely, with 10 false positives and 10 false negatives. The positive and negative prediction values would be 99%, so there can be high confidence in the result.\n\nHowever, if the prevalence is only 5%, so of the 2000 people only 100 are really sick, then the prediction values change significantly. The likely result is 99 true positives, 1 false negative, 1881 true negatives and 19 false positives. Of the 19+99 people tested positive, only 99 really have the disease \u2013 that means, intuitively, that given that a patient's test result is positive, there is only 84% chance that they really have the disease. On the other hand, given that the patient's test result is negative, there is only 1 chance in 1882, or 0.05% probability, that the patient has the disease despite the test result.\n\n===Likelihood ratios===\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Precision and recall==\n{{main article|Precision and recall}}\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Relationships===\nThere are various relationships between these ratios.\n\nIf the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are known, the positive predictive value can be obtained from the following identity:\n\n::<math> \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) (1-\\text{prevalence})} </math>\n\nIf the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are known, the negative predictive value can be obtained from the following identity:\n\n::<math> \n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(\\text{specificity}) (1 - \\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{specificity}) (1 - \\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence})}. </math>\n\n==Single metrics==\nIn addition to the paired metrics, there are also single metrics that give a single number to evaluate the test.\n\nPerhaps the simplest statistic is [[Accuracy and precision#In binary classification|accuracy]] or Fraction Correct (FC), which measures the fraction of all instances that are correctly categorized; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of correct or incorrect classifications: (TP + TN)/Total Population = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN). This is often not very useful, compared to the marginal ratios, as it does not yield useful marginal interpretations, due to mixing true positives (test positive, condition positive) and true negatives (test negative, condition negative) \u2013 in terms of the condition table, it sums the diagonal; further, it is prevalence-dependent. The complement is the Fraction Incorrect (FiC): FC + FiC = 1, or (FP + FN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) \u2013 this is the sum of the [[antidiagonal]], divided by the total population.\n\nThe [[diagnostic odds ratio]] (DOR) is a more useful overall metric, which can be defined directly as (TP\u00d7TN)/(FP\u00d7FN) = (TP/FN)/(FP/TN), or indirectly as a ratio of ratio of ratios (ratio of likelihood ratios, which are themselves ratios of True Rates or Prediction Values). This has a useful interpretation \u2013 as an [[odds ratio]] \u2013 and is prevalence-independent.\n\nAn [[F-score]] is a combination of the [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]] and the [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], providing a single score. There is a one-parameter family of statistics, with parameter ''\u03b2,'' which determines the relative weights of precision and recall. The traditional or balanced F-score ([[F1 score]]) is the [[Harmonic mean#Harmonic mean of two numbers|harmonic mean]] of precision and recall:\n\n:<math>F_1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{recall}}{\\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall}} </math>.\n\n===Alternative metrics===\nNote, however, that the F-scores do not take the true negative rate into account, and are more suited to [[information retrieval]] and [[information extraction]] evaluation where the true negatives are innumerable. Instead, measures such as the [[Phi coefficient]], [[Matthews correlation coefficient]], [[Informedness]] or [[Cohen's kappa]] may be preferable to assess the performance of a binary classifier.<ref name=\"Powers2007\">{{cite journal |first=David M W |last=Powers |date=2011 |title=Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Score to ROC, Informedness, Markedness & Correlation |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Technologies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=37\u201363 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2328/27165}}</ref><ref name=Powers2012>{{cite conference |first=David M.

The Habsburg armies came as far as [[Ni\u0161|Nis]], modern-day [[Serbia]], before being pushed back across the Danube by 1690. Sultan Mustafa II was determined to recapture the lost territories in Hungary and therefore he personally commanded his armies.\n===Capture of Chios===\nFirst, the [[Ottoman navy]] recaptured the island of [[Chios]] after defeating the Venetian Fleet twice, in the Battle of the Oinousses Islands (1695) and in the Battle of Chios (1695), in February 1695.<ref name=\"kultur1\">[http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN,32007/chronology.html Bilgi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Somel|first1=Selcuk Aksin|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|publisher=Scarecrow Press, 2003|isbn=0810866064|page=XIIV chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGZQL41tg_oC&pg=PR44&lpg=PR44&dq=ottoman+mustafa+chios&source=bl&ots=jgsAEXM1Dy&sig=ak1FWIAJ5EokPb0IYKvwryp4nA4&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ottoman%20mustafa%20chios&f=false}}</ref> In June 1695, Mustafa II left [[Edirne]] for his first military campaign against the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. By September 1695 the town of [[Lipova, Arad|Lipova]] was captured. On 18 September 1695 the Venetian Navy was again defeated in the naval victory of [[Battle of Zeytinburnu|Zeytinburnu]]. A few days later the Habsburg army was defeated in the [[Battle of Lugos]]. Afterwards the [[Ottoman Army]] returned to the capital. Meanwhile, the Ottoman fortress in [[Azov]] was [[Azov campaigns (1695\u201396)|successfully defended]] against the besieging [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] forces.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n===Hasburg wars===\nIn April 1696 Mustafa II left Edirne for his second military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. In August 1696 the Russians besieged Azov for the second time and captured the fortress. In August 1696 the Ottoman troops defeated the Habsburg army in the [[Battle of Ula\u015f]] and in the [[Battle of Cenei]]. After these victories the Ottoman troops captured [[Timi\u0219oara]] and Koca Cafer Pasha was appointed as the protector of [[Belgrade]]. Afterwards the army returned to the Ottoman capital.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nIn June 1697 Mustafa II left the capital on his third military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. However, the Ottoman Army suffered a defeat in the [[Battle of Zenta]] and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Elmas Mehmed Pasha]] died in the battle. Afterwards the Ottomans signed a treaty with the Holy League.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nThe most traumatic event of his reign was the loss of [[Hungary]] by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.\n\nYet even if Ottoman power seemed to wane on one side of the empire, this did not mean that Ottoman efforts at expansion ceased. In 1700, for example, the Grand Vizier [[Amcazade K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc H\u00fcseyin Pasha|Amcazade H\u00fcseyin]] boasted to a recalcitrant tribe residing in swamps near Baghdad that they ought to abide by the sultan's rule, since his grasp extended even to their marshy redoubts. The Grand Vizier added that, after all, Mustafa II was \"the Lord of Water and Mud.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = In the Bellies of the Marshes: Water and Power in the Countryside of Ottoman Baghdad|last = Husain|first = Faisal|date = October 2014|journal = Environmental History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of his reign, Mustafa II sought to restore power to the Sultanate, which had been an increasingly symbolic position since the middle of the 17th century, when Mehmed IV had signed over his executive powers to the Grand Vizier. Mustafa II's strategy was to create an alternative base of power for himself by making the position of [[Timariot|timars]], the Ottoman cavalrymen, hereditary and thus loyal to him. The timars, however, were at this point increasingly an obsolete part of the Ottoman military machine.\n\n===Deposition===\nThe strategem failed, the disaffected troops bound to a [[Ottoman invasion of western Georgia (1703)|Georgian campaign]] mutinied in the capital (called the \"[[Edirne incident|Edirne event]]\" by historians), and Mustafa was deposed on 22 August 1703. \n\n==Personal life==\n===Character===\nDefine as red beard, short neck, medium height and majestic.  Mustafa II has a miniature made by Levni.  After 1699, like his father, he was interested in hunting and entertainment, engaged in [[literature]] and wrote poems with the pseudonym.

Sultan Mustafa II was determined to recapture the lost territories in Hungary and therefore he personally commanded his armies.\n===Capture of Chios===\nFirst, the [[Ottoman navy]] recaptured the island of [[Chios]] after defeating the Venetian Fleet twice, in the Battle of the Oinousses Islands (1695) and in the Battle of Chios (1695), in February 1695.<ref name=\"kultur1\">[http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN,32007/chronology.html Bilgi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Somel|first1=Selcuk Aksin|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|publisher=Scarecrow Press, 2003|isbn=0810866064|page=XIIV chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGZQL41tg_oC&pg=PR44&lpg=PR44&dq=ottoman+mustafa+chios&source=bl&ots=jgsAEXM1Dy&sig=ak1FWIAJ5EokPb0IYKvwryp4nA4&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ottoman%20mustafa%20chios&f=false}}</ref> In June 1695, Mustafa II left [[Edirne]] for his first military campaign against the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. By September 1695 the town of [[Lipova, Arad|Lipova]] was captured. On 18 September 1695 the Venetian Navy was again defeated in the naval victory of [[Battle of Zeytinburnu|Zeytinburnu]]. A few days later the Habsburg army was defeated in the [[Battle of Lugos]]. Afterwards the [[Ottoman Army]] returned to the capital. Meanwhile, the Ottoman fortress in [[Azov]] was [[Azov campaigns (1695\u201396)|successfully defended]] against the besieging [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] forces.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n===Hasburg wars===\nIn April 1696 Mustafa II left Edirne for his second military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. In August 1696 the Russians besieged Azov for the second time and captured the fortress. In August 1696 the Ottoman troops defeated the Habsburg army in the [[Battle of Ula\u015f]] and in the [[Battle of Cenei]]. After these victories the Ottoman troops captured [[Timi\u015foara]] and Koca Cafer Pasha was appointed as the protector of [[Belgrade]]. Afterwards the army returned to the Ottoman capital.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nIn June 1697 Mustafa II left the capital on his third military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. However, the Ottoman Army suffered a defeat in the [[Battle of Zenta]] and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Elmas Mehmed Pasha]] died in the battle. Afterwards the Ottomans signed a treaty with the Holy League.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nThe most traumatic event of his reign was the loss of [[Hungary]] by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.\n\nYet even if Ottoman power seemed to wane on one side of the empire, this did not mean that Ottoman efforts at expansion ceased. In 1700, for example, the Grand Vizier [[Amcazade K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc H\u00fcseyin Pasha|Amcazade H\u00fcseyin]] boasted to a recalcitrant tribe residing in swamps near Baghdad that they ought to abide by the sultan's rule, since his grasp extended even to their marshy redoubts. The Grand Vizier added that, after all, Mustafa II was \"the Lord of Water and Mud.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = In the Bellies of the Marshes: Water and Power in the Countryside of Ottoman Baghdad|last = Husain|first = Faisal|date = October 2014|journal = Environmental History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of his reign, Mustafa II sought to restore power to the Sultanate, which had been an increasingly symbolic position since the middle of the 17th century, when Mehmed IV had signed over his executive powers to the Grand Vizier. Mustafa II's strategy was to create an alternative base of power for himself by making the position of [[Timariot|timars]], the Ottoman cavalrymen, hereditary and thus loyal to him. The timars, however, were at this point increasingly an obsolete part of the Ottoman military machine.\n\n===Deposition===\nThe strategem failed, the disaffected troops bound to a [[Ottoman invasion of western Georgia (1703)|Georgian campaign]] mutinied in the capital (called the \"[[Edirne incident|Edirne event]]\" by historians), and Mustafa was deposed on 22 August 1703. \n\n==Personal life==\n===Character===\nDefine as red beard, short neck, medium height and majestic.  Mustafa II has a miniature made by Levni.  After 1699, like his father, he was interested in hunting and entertainment, engaged in [[literature]] and wrote poems with the pseudonym.  A curiosity of this sultan, who had lines in the style of Celi, Nesih and Sulus was archery.  [[Silahdar Findiklili Mehmed Agha]], who was assigned to write the history of his period.  He described Mustafa's reign in his book Nusretname. {{sfn|Sakao\u011flu|2015|p=294}}\n\n===Family===\n;Consorts\n* Alicenab Kad\u0131n (died 20 April 1699, [[Edirne Palace]], Edirne, buried in Dar\u00fclhadis Mosque);<ref name=\"hans\">{{cite book|first=Hans Georg|last=Majer|title=Osmanl\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131 XII (The Journal of Ottoman Studies XII): The harem of Mustafa II (1695\u20131703)|publisher=|year=1992|pages=435\u20137, 438|isbn=}}</ref>\n* [[Saliha Sultan (wife of Mustafa II)|Saliha Sultan]]<ref name=\"hans\"/> (died 21 September 1739, T\u0131rnak\u00e7\u0131 Palace, Istanbul, buried in Turhan Sultan Mausoleum, New Mosque);\n* [[\u015eehsuvar Sultan]]<ref name=\"hans\"/> (died 27 April 1756, Topkap\u0131 Palace, Istanbul, buried in [[Nuruosmaniye Mosque]]);\n* [[Afife Kad\u0131n]];<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n* Bahtiyar Kad\u0131n;<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n* Ivaz Kad\u0131n;<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n* F\u00fclane Kad\u0131n.<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n;Sons\n* [[Mahmud I]] (2 August 1696 \u2013 13 December 1754), son with Saliha Sultan;<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n* \u015eehzade Suleiman (25 December 1697 \u2013 25 December 1697, Edirne Palace, Edirne, buried in New Mosque), son with Afife Kad\u0131n;<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n* \u015eehzade Mehmed (22 November 1698 \u2013 5 June 1703, Edirne Palace, Edirne, buried in New Mosque), son with Afife Kad\u0131n;<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n* [[Osman III]] (2/3 January 1699 \u2013 30 October 1757), son with \u015eehsuvar Sultan;<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n* \u015eehzade Hasan (16 April 1699 \u2013 25 May 1733), became heir apparent from 1730.  <ref name=\"hans\"/>\n* \u015eehzade H\u00fcseyn (7 May 1699 \u2013 24 August 1700, Edirne Palace, Edirne, buried in New Mosque);\n* \u015eehzade Selim (16 May 1700 \u2013 8 June 1701, Edirne Palace, Edirne, buried in New Mosque), son with Afife Kad\u0131n;<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n* \u015eehzade Murad (14 September 1702 - 1 April 1703) {{sfn|Sakao\u011flu|2015|p=294}}\n* \u015eehzade Ahmed (3 March 1703 \u2013 7 September 1703, [[Edirne Palace]], Edirne, buried in Dar\u00fclhadis Mosque), son with Afife Kad\u0131n;<ref name=\"hans\"/>\n\n;Daughters\n* [[Ay\u015fe Sultan (daughter of Mustafa II)|Ay\u015fe Sultan]] (30 April 1696 \u2013 26 September 1752, Istanbul, buried in New Mosque);\n* [[Emine Sultan (daughter of Mustafa II)|Emine Sultan]] (1 September 1696 \u2013 {{circa}} 1739, Istanbul, buried in New Mosque);\n* [[Safiye Sultan (daughter of Mustafa II)|Safiye Sultan]] (13 December 1696 \u2013 15 May 1778, Istanbul, buried in New Mosque);\n* Rukiye Sultan (13 November 1697 \u2013 28 March 1698, [[Edirne Palace]], Edirne, buried in Dar\u00fclhadis Mosque);\n* Hatice Sultan (14 February 1698 \u2013 died young, [[Edirne Palace]], Edirne, buried in Dar\u00fclhadis Mosque);\n* Fatma Sultan (8 October 1699 \u2013 20 May 1700, Istanbul, buried in New Mosque);\n* Ismihan Sultan (23 April 1700 \u2013 1 June 1700);\n* \u00dcmm\u00fcg\u00fcls\u00fcm Sultan (10 June 1700 \u2013 1 May 1701, [[Edirne Palace]], Edirne, buried in Dar\u00fclhadis Mosque);\n* Zeyneb Sultan (10 June 1700 \u2013 18 December 1705, Istanbul, buried in New Mosque);\n* [[Emetullah Sultan]] (22 June 1701 \u2013 12 April 1727, Istanbul, buried in New Mosque);\n\n==Death==\nAfter the new sultan's return to Istanbul, after the Edirne Foundation and the state official.
