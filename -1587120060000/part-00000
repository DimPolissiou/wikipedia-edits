Son of a former Telugu [[Palegaadu]] Mallareddy and Seethamma, Narasimha Reddy was born in Rupanagudi village, Uyyalawada Mandal, Kurnool district. He and his commander-in-chief ''[[Vadde Obanna]]'' were at the heart of the rebellion against  [[Company rule in India|British]] in 1847, where 5,000 [[peasant|peasants]] rose up against the [[British East India Company ]] in [[Kurnool district]], [[Rayalaseema]] Region of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. They were protesting against the changes introduced by the British to the traditional agrarian system in the first half of the nineteenth century. Which included the introduction of the [[ryotwari]] system and other attempts to maximize revenue through exploiting lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished.<ref name=\"venugopal\">{{cite journal |last=Reddy |first=K. Venugopal |year=2010 |title=Dominance and Resistance: A Study of Narasimha Reddy's Revolt in Andhra against the injustice and towards India\u2019s freedom movement (1846\u201347) |work=Social Scientist |jstor=25621954 |volume=38 |pages=23\u201336}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nThe father of Narasimha Reddy was related to the [[Polygar]] (jagirdarr) family of [[Uyyalawada]] in [[Koilkuntla]] [[taluk]] who had married two daughters of the Polygar of Nossam. He had three sons, of whom Narasimha was the youngest.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/> His first wife was Siddamma.\n\n==Causes of rebellion ==\nThe [[East India Company|EIC]]'s introduction to the Madras Presidency of the 1803 [[Permanent Settlement]], which had first been enacted in [[Bengal Presidency]] ten years previously, replaced the agrarian socio-economic status quo with a more egalitarian arrangement where anyone could cultivate provided that they paid a fixed sum to the EIC for the privilege of doing so.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/>\n\nThe Polygars and other higher-status people who preferred the old agrarian system \"represented the decadent social order\", were in many cases \"upstarts\" and \"were also the heirs of a social system in which various orders of Hindu society were integrated through ages\".

The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the company's charter in 1684, and the company was dissolved.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda\"/>\n\nBermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudians also vigorously pursued [[whaling]], [[privateering]], and the merchant trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]].

Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].<ref name=Jarvis>{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|pages=385\u2013389}}</ref>\n\nThree American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 1775, 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda acquired a reputation for disloyalty. Later that year, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well-established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] until 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of privateers.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|389\u2013415}}\n\nIn June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778\u20131779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combined efforts of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|416\u2013427}}\n\nThe death of George Bruere in 1780 turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., an active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists. Even Henry Tucker abandoned trading with the United States, because of the presence of many privateers. Loyalist privateers based in Bermuda captured 114 prizes between 1777 and 1781, while 130 were captured in 1782.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|428\u2013433}}\n\n[[The Bermuda Gazette]], Bermuda's first newspaper, began publishing in 1784.<ref name=\"Stark\">{{cite book |last1=Stark |first1=James Henry |title=Stark's Illustrated Bermuda Guide: A Description of Everything on Or about These Places of which the Visitor Or Resident May Desire Information, Including Their History, Inhabitants, Climate, Agriculture, Geology, Government and Resources |date=1897 |publisher=J.H.Stark |location=Bermuda Island (Bermuda Islands) |page=250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T11qAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA150&q=1784%20bermuda%20stockdale |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"200th\">{{cite web |last1=Rigby |first1=Neil |title=1984 200th Anniversary of Bermuda's first Newspaper and Postal Service |date=26 January 1984 |url=http://www.bermudastamps.co.uk/1984/01/26/200th-anniversary-bermudas-first-newspaper-postal-service/ |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"TBG\">{{cite web |title=The Bermuda gazette |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn89049233/ |publisher=United States Library of Congress |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Devonshire Redoubt (Bermuda).png|thumb|left|An illustration of the Devonshire Redoubt, Bermuda, 1614]]\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours on the Bermudas.

The [[stratigraphic column]] starts with the Walsingham [[formation (geology)|Formation]], overlain by the Castle Harbour Geosol, the Lower and Upper Town Hill Formations separated by the Harbour Road Geosol, the Ord Road Geosol, the Belmont Formation, the Shore Hills Geosol, the Rocky Bay Formation, and the Southampton Formation.<ref name=Vacher/>\n\nThe older eolianite ridges (Older Bermuda) are more rounded and subdued compared to the outer coastline (Younger Bermuda). Thus, post deposition morphology includes chemical [[erosion]], with inshore water bodies demonstrating much of Bermuda is partially drowned [[Pleistocene]] [[karst]]. The Walsingham Formation is a clear example, constituting the cave district around Castle Harbour.

After the acknowledgement by the British Government of the independence of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen continental colonies]] (including Virginia and the Carolinas) in 1783, Bermuda was generally grouped regionally by the British Government with [[The Maritimes]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], substantially nearer to Bermuda than is the Caribbean. However, with the confederation of Canada and the Maritimes and their attainment of [[Dominion]] status in the 1860s, the British political, naval and military hierarchy in Bermuda became increasingly separated from that of the Canadian Government (the [[Royal Navy]] headquarters for the [[North America and West Indies Station]] had spent summers at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and winters at Bermuda, but settled at Bermuda year round with the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax]] finally being transferred to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in 1907, and the [[Bermuda Garrison]] had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence, and had been part of the Nova Scotia Command thereafter, but became the separate ''Bermuda Command'' from the 1860s with the Major-General or Lieutenant-General appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda also filling the civil role of [[Governor of Bermuda]]), and Bermuda was increasingly perceived by the British Government as in, or at least grouped for convenience with, the British West Indies (although the established [[Church of England]] in Bermuda, which from 1825 to 1839 had been attached to the See of [[Nova Scotia]]) remained part of the [[Diocese of Newfoundland|Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda]] until 1879, when the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop). Newfoundland attained Dominion status in 1907, leaving the nearest other territories to Bermuda that were still within the [[Commonwealth realm|British Realm]] (a term which replaced ''Dominion'' in 1952 as the dominions and many colonies moved towards full political independence) as the British colonies in the [[British West Indies]].\n\n\nBermuda became an associate member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) in July 2003, despite not being in the Caribbean region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-online.org/bdagovt.htm |title= Bermuda Government today |work=Bermuda-Online.org |accessdate =9 July 2010 |quote=In July 2003, Bermuda formally joined the Caribbean Community as an Associate Member (non-voting member), in certain areas but not in others.

By the war's end, the two BVRC contingents had lost over 75% of their combined strength.]]\n[[File:Rembrance Day Parade Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Remembrance Day Parade, Hamilton, Bermuda]]\n\nOnce known as \"the Gibraltar of the West\" and \"Fortress Bermuda\", Bermuda today is defended by British forces. For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local (infantry) militia and fortified coastal artillery batteries manned by volunteer artillerymen. Bermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October, 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia and coastal artillery), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's barrier reef, coastal artillery batteries and  militia provided a defence too powerful for the fleet sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]]. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].\n\nDue to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.\n\nIn May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). The US Army established the [[Bermuda Base Command]] in 1941 to co-ordinate its [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets during the war. The US Navy operated a [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] on [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] from 1942 through 1945.<ref name=\"bermuda-online.org\"/>\n\nConstruction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.\n\nThe original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a [[seaplane]] base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] (NAVFAC Bermuda), a submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility in the Tudor Hill area; it was converted from a US Army coast artillery bunker in 1954 and operated until 1995. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nCanada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.\n\nIn the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.\n\n[[File:HMS Ambuscade in Bermuda.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ambuscade (F172)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']] at the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard in 1988]]]]\nBermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.\n\nToday, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.\n\nIn early 2020 Bermuda formed the Bermuda Coast Guard. Its 24-hour on-duty service includes search and rescue, counter-narcotics operations, border control, and protection of Bermuda's maritime interests. The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service.<ref>https://www.gov.bm/articles/launch-bermuda-coast-guard</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of Bermuda}}\n[[File:Front Street, Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Front Street, Hamilton]]\nBanking and other financial services form the largest sector of the economy at circa 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/><ref name=Smithsonian/> Industrial and agriculture activities occur, however these are on a very limited scale and Bermuda is heavily reliant on imports.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/> Living standards are high and as of 2019 Bermuda has the 6th highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/>\n\n===Currency===\nIn 1970 the country switched its currency from the [[Bermudian pound]] to the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] at par with the US dollar.

The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation.

English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.\n\nA second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.\n\nThe first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] (1931\u2013 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, [[Angela Barry]] has won critical recognition for her published fiction.\n\n===Arts===\n{{see also|Music of Bermuda}}\nMusic and dance are an important part of Bermudian culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. Local icons, [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], performed calypso music for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. While calypso appealed more to tourists than to the local residents, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrants.\n[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|Gombey dancers from Bermuda at the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.]]\nNoted Bermudian musicians include [[tenor|operatic tenor]] Dr. Gary Burgess; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]]; singer-songwriter and poet, [[Heather Nova]], and her brother [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], reggae musician; classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]]; and more recently, [[dancehall]] artist [[Collie Buddz]].\n\nThe dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001, they performed at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. These Gombey Dancers continue to showcase their work for locals and visitors during the Harbour Nights festival on Bermuda's Front Street every Wednesday evening (during the summer months) and draw very large crowds.\n\nBermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, \"Battle of the Summer Islands\" (1645).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|title=The Battle Of The Summer Islands : Canto 1 \u2013 Poem by Edmund Waller|website=poemhunter.com|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008224321/http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907\u201321), Volume VII.

The cup was contested annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda.]]\n\nMany sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as [[the Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. The [[Bermuda national football team]] managed to qualify to the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the country's first ever major football competition.\n\nThe professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.\n\n[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual \"Cup Match\" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark ''forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery''. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the ''St. George's Garrison'' (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).<ref>Stranack</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16\u201317 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009. One-armed Bermudian golfer [[Quinn Talbot]] was both the United States National Amputee Golf Champion for five successive years and the British World One-Arm Golf Champion.<ref>[https://www.oceanviewgolfclub.com/staff/ Ocean View Golf Course Staff]</ref>\n\n[[File:International One Design - Hamilton Harbour - Bermuda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[International One Design|IOD]] racer on a mooring in [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]]]]\nThe Government announced in 2006 that it would provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and [[Bermuda national football team|football]] teams. Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the [[Second World War]], though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir [[George Bullock (British Army officer)|George Mackworth Bullock]] in 1913. A combined team of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (BMI) defeated {{HMS|Malabar|shore establishment|6}} to win the cup on 21 March 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.<ref>''Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup''. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943.</ref> Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Kyle Lightbourne]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]] but folded in 2013.\n\n[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport\u2013Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the [[2017 America's Cup]] was announced.\n\nAt the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events. In those Olympics, Bermuda's Katura Horton-Perinchief made history by becoming the first black female diver to compete in the Olympic Games. Bermuda has had one Olympic medallist, [[Clarence Hill (boxer)|Clarence Hill]], who won a bronze medal in boxing. Bermuda also competed in Men's [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy. Patrick Singleton placed 19th, with a final time of 1:59.81. [[Jillian Teceira]] competed in the Beijing Olympics in 2008. It is tradition for Bermuda to march in the Opening Ceremony in [[Bermuda shorts]], regardless of the summer or winter Olympic celebration. Bermuda also competes in the biennial [[Island Games]], which it hosted in 2013.\n\nIn 1998, Bermuda established its own Basketball Association.<ref>[http://fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/FIBA/fibaStru/nfLeag/nfProf.asp?nationalFederationNumber=4697 FIBA National Federations | Bermuda], fiba.com.

The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the company's charter in 1684, and the company was dissolved.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda\"/>\n\nBermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudians also vigorously pursued [[whaling]], [[privateering]], and the merchant trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]].

Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].<ref name=Jarvis>{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|pages=385\u2013389}}</ref>\n\nThree American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 1775, 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda acquired a reputation for disloyalty. Later that year, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well-established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] until 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of privateers.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|389\u2013415}}\n\nIn June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778\u20131779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combined efforts of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|416\u2013427}}\n\nThe death of George Bruere in 1780 turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., an active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists. Even Henry Tucker abandoned trading with the United States, because of the presence of many privateers. Loyalist privateers based in Bermuda captured 114 prizes between 1777 and 1781, while 130 were captured in 1782.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|428\u2013433}}\n\n[[The Bermuda Gazette]], Bermuda's first newspaper, began publishing in 1784.<ref name=\"Stark\">{{cite book |last1=Stark |first1=James Henry |title=Stark's Illustrated Bermuda Guide: A Description of Everything on Or about These Places of which the Visitor Or Resident May Desire Information, Including Their History, Inhabitants, Climate, Agriculture, Geology, Government and Resources |date=1897 |publisher=J.H.Stark |location=Bermuda Island (Bermuda Islands) |page=250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T11qAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA150&q=1784%20bermuda%20stockdale |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"200th\">{{cite web |last1=Rigby |first1=Neil |title=1984 200th Anniversary of Bermuda's first Newspaper and Postal Service |date=26 January 1984 |url=http://www.bermudastamps.co.uk/1984/01/26/200th-anniversary-bermudas-first-newspaper-postal-service/ |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"TBG\">{{cite web |title=The Bermuda gazette |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn89049233/ |publisher=United States Library of Congress |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Devonshire Redoubt (Bermuda).png|thumb|left|An illustration of the Devonshire Redoubt, Bermuda, 1614]]\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours on the Bermudas.

The [[stratigraphic column]] starts with the Walsingham [[formation (geology)|Formation]], overlain by the Castle Harbour Geosol, the Lower and Upper Town Hill Formations separated by the Harbour Road Geosol, the Ord Road Geosol, the Belmont Formation, the Shore Hills Geosol, the Rocky Bay Formation, and the Southampton Formation.<ref name=Vacher/>\n\nThe older eolianite ridges (Older Bermuda) are more rounded and subdued compared to the outer coastline (Younger Bermuda). Thus, post deposition morphology includes chemical [[erosion]], with inshore water bodies demonstrating much of Bermuda is partially drowned [[Pleistocene]] [[karst]]. The Walsingham Formation is a clear example, constituting the cave district around Castle Harbour.

After the acknowledgement by the British Government of the independence of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen continental colonies]] (including Virginia and the Carolinas) in 1783, Bermuda was generally grouped regionally by the British Government with [[The Maritimes]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], substantially nearer to Bermuda than is the Caribbean. However, with the confederation of Canada and the Maritimes and their attainment of [[Dominion]] status in the 1860s, the British political, naval and military hierarchy in Bermuda became increasingly separated from that of the Canadian Government (the [[Royal Navy]] headquarters for the [[North America and West Indies Station]] had spent summers at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and winters at Bermuda, but settled at Bermuda year round with the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax]] finally being transferred to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in 1907, and the [[Bermuda Garrison]] had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence, and had been part of the Nova Scotia Command thereafter, but became the separate ''Bermuda Command'' from the 1860s with the Major-General or Lieutenant-General appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda also filling the civil role of [[Governor of Bermuda]]), and Bermuda was increasingly perceived by the British Government as in, or at least grouped for convenience with, the British West Indies (although the established [[Church of England]] in Bermuda, which from 1825 to 1839 had been attached to the See of [[Nova Scotia]]) remained part of the [[Diocese of Newfoundland|Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda]] until 1879, when the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop). Newfoundland attained Dominion status in 1907, leaving the nearest other territories to Bermuda that were still within the [[Commonwealth realm|British Realm]] (a term which replaced ''Dominion'' in 1952 as the dominions and many colonies moved towards full political independence) as the British colonies in the [[British West Indies]].\n\n\nBermuda became an associate member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) in July 2003, despite not being in the Caribbean region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-online.org/bdagovt.htm |title= Bermuda Government today |work=Bermuda-Online.org |accessdate =9 July 2010 |quote=In July 2003, Bermuda formally joined the Caribbean Community as an Associate Member (non-voting member), in certain areas but not in others.

By the war's end, the two BVRC contingents had lost over 75% of their combined strength.]]\n[[File:Rembrance Day Parade Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Remembrance Day Parade, Hamilton, Bermuda]]\n\nOnce known as \"the Gibraltar of the West\" and \"Fortress Bermuda\", Bermuda today is defended by British forces. For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local (infantry) militia and fortified coastal artillery batteries manned by volunteer artillerymen. Bermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October, 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia and coastal artillery), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's barrier reef, coastal artillery batteries and  militia provided a defence too powerful for the fleet sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]]. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].\n\nDue to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.\n\nIn May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). The US Army established the [[Bermuda Base Command]] in 1941 to co-ordinate its [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets during the war. The US Navy operated a [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] on [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] from 1942 through 1945.<ref name=\"bermuda-online.org\"/>\n\nConstruction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.\n\nThe original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a [[seaplane]] base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] (NAVFAC Bermuda), a submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility in the Tudor Hill area; it was converted from a US Army coast artillery bunker in 1954 and operated until 1995. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nCanada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.\n\nIn the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.\n\n[[File:HMS Ambuscade in Bermuda.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ambuscade (F172)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']] at the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard in 1988]]]]\nBermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.\n\nToday, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.\n\nIn early 2020 Bermuda formed the Bermuda Coast Guard. Its 24-hour on-duty service includes search and rescue, counter-narcotics operations, border control, and protection of Bermuda's maritime interests. The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service.<ref>https://www.gov.bm/articles/launch-bermuda-coast-guard</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of Bermuda}}\n[[File:Front Street, Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Front Street, Hamilton]]\nBanking and other financial services form the largest sector of the economy at circa 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/><ref name=Smithsonian/> Industrial and agriculture activities occur, however these are on a very limited scale and Bermuda is heavily reliant on imports.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/> Living standards are high and as of 2019 Bermuda has the 6th highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/>\n\n===Currency===\nIn 1970 the country switched its currency from the [[Bermudian pound]] to the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] at par with the US dollar.

The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation.

English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.\n\nA second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.\n\nThe first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] (1931\u2013 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, [[Angela Barry]] has won critical recognition for her published fiction.\n\n===Arts===\n{{see also|Music of Bermuda}}\nMusic and dance are an important part of Bermudian culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. Local icons, [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], performed calypso music for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. While calypso appealed more to tourists than to the local residents, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrants.\n[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|Gombey dancers from Bermuda at the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.]]\nNoted Bermudian musicians include [[tenor|operatic tenor]] Dr. Gary Burgess; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]]; singer-songwriter and poet, [[Heather Nova]], and her brother [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], reggae musician; classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]]; and more recently, [[dancehall]] artist [[Collie Buddz]].\n\nThe dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001, they performed at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. These Gombey Dancers continue to showcase their work for locals and visitors during the Harbour Nights festival on Bermuda's Front Street every Wednesday evening (during the summer months) and draw very large crowds.\n\nBermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, \"Battle of the Summer Islands\" (1645).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|title=The Battle Of The Summer Islands : Canto 1 \u2013 Poem by Edmund Waller|website=poemhunter.com|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008224321/http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907\u201321), Volume VII.

The cup was contested annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda.]]\n\nMany sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as [[the Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. The [[Bermuda national football team]] managed to qualify to the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the country's first ever major football competition.\n\nThe professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.\n\n[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual \"Cup Match\" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark ''forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery''. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the ''St. George's Garrison'' (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).<ref>Stranack</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16\u201317 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009. One-armed Bermudian golfer [[Quinn Talbot]] was both the United States National Amputee Golf Champion for five successive years and the British World One-Arm Golf Champion.<ref>[https://www.oceanviewgolfclub.com/staff/ Ocean View Golf Course Staff]</ref>\n\n[[File:International One Design - Hamilton Harbour - Bermuda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[International One Design|IOD]] racer on a mooring in [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]]]]\nThe Government announced in 2006 that it would provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and [[Bermuda national football team|football]] teams. Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the [[Second World War]], though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir [[George Bullock (British Army officer)|George Mackworth Bullock]] in 1913. A combined team of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (BMI) defeated {{HMS|Malabar|shore establishment|6}} to win the cup on 21 March 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.<ref>''Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup''. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943.</ref> Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Kyle Lightbourne]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]] but folded in 2013.\n\n[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport\u2013Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the [[2017 America's Cup]] was announced.\n\nAt the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events. In those Olympics, Bermuda's Katura Horton-Perinchief made history by becoming the first black female diver to compete in the Olympic Games. Bermuda has had one Olympic medallist, [[Clarence Hill (boxer)|Clarence Hill]], who won a bronze medal in boxing. Bermuda also competed in Men's [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy. Patrick Singleton placed 19th, with a final time of 1:59.81. [[Jillian Teceira]] competed in the Beijing Olympics in 2008. It is tradition for Bermuda to march in the Opening Ceremony in [[Bermuda shorts]], regardless of the summer or winter Olympic celebration. Bermuda also competes in the biennial [[Island Games]], which it hosted in 2013.\n\nIn 1998, Bermuda established its own Basketball Association.<ref>[http://fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/FIBA/fibaStru/nfLeag/nfProf.asp?nationalFederationNumber=4697 FIBA National Federations | Bermuda], fiba.com.

After the split, Kone Corporation's marine cargo handling (MacGregor), container handling (Kalmar Industries AB) and load handling (HIAB and Moffett, the latter being based in Ireland and acquired in 2000) business units formed Cargotec. However, the businesses within Cargotec have much longer histories and they have been formed through a series of mergers and acquisitions during several decades.\n\nCargotec's Kalmar business area started to take shape in 1997 when Partek Corporation acquired the Finnish state-owned [[Sisu Auto|Sisu Ltd]] including its [[Sisu Terminal Systems|terminal tractor business]]. During the same year, Partek acquired a major shareholding in Kalmar Industries Ltd, a container handling equipment producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kalmarglobal.com/|title=Kalmar Global - Kalmarglobal|website=www.kalmarglobal.com}}</ref>\n\nThe foundations of Cargotec's Hiab business area were laid in 1977 when Partek Corporation bought Multilift Group. In 1985, Partek acquired Hydrauliska Industrier Ltd (Hiab) and Jonsered forestry cranes. A couple of years later Partek strengthened its forestry crane expertise by acquiring that particular business line from Fiskars. Several business acquisitions in 2000 enforced the load handling business. In 2004, the name Hiab was taken into use for the whole load handling business in Cargotec.<ref>http://www.hiab.com/</ref>\n\nMacGregor originates from England where it started to serve shipping companies and shipyards in 1937. The marine cargo business of the company in a broader meaning started in 1983 when MacGregor merged with the Finnish Navire. In 1993 Incentive acquired MacGregor-Navire and merged it with H\u00e4gglunds Marine. In 1998, the majority of MacGregor was sold to Industri Kapital.

''O. unilateralis'' infects [[ant]]s of the [[Camponotini]] tribe, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains after its eventual death.<ref name = \"Mongkolsamrit2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mongkolsamrit S, Kobmoo N, Tasanathai K, Khonsanit A, Noisripoom W, Srikitikulchai P, Somnuk R, Luangsa-ard JJ | title = Life cycle, host range and temporal variation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''/''Hirsutella formicarium'' on Formicine ants | journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 217\u201324 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22959811 | doi = 10.1016/j.jip.2012.08.007 }}</ref> The process leading to mortality takes 4\u201310 days, and includes a reproductive stage where [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores. ''O. unilateralis'' is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.\n\n''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' and related species are known to engage in an active [[secondary metabolism]], among other reasons, for the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by [[natural product]]s chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the [[polyketide]] family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nAfter years of research, the taxonomy of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' is becoming increasingly clear. \n\n=== ''Cordyceps'' vs ''Ophiocordyceps'' ===\n\nThroughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between both the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' [[genus]] and the ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'' genus. These genera are different, however they were at the source of many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as ''Ophiocordyceps'' was only recently brought forward.\n\nThe ''Cordyceps'' genus comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the ''[[Clavicipitaceae]]'' [[family (biology)|family]] within the [[order (biology)|order]] ''[[Hypocreales]]''. The classification was based on different morphological characteristics such as filiform [[ascospores]] and cylindrical [[asci]].<ref name = \"Sung2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Gi-Ho |last2=Hywel-Jones |first2=Nigel L. |last3=Sung |first3=Jae-Mo |last4=Luangsa-ard |first4=J.

However, in 2007, important new molecular data was tested, and enabled them to re-classify the ''Clavicipitaceae'' family. It was found that \u2018\u2019Clavicipitaceae\u2019\u2019 was in fact three distinct monophyletic families: the ''Clavicipitaceae'', the ''Cordycipitaceae'' and the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''.<ref name = \"Sung2007\"/>\n \nThe new molecular phylogenetics studies contradicted the older classification and moved all ''Cordyceps'' species forming a sister group with ''Tolypocladium'', into ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''. Fungi able to parasitize ants were also included in the transfer, such as ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' which was later renamed ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/> Following this study, multiple traits such as the production of darkly pigmented, hard to flexible [[stromata]] were defined as characteristics of the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae'' family.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nConsequently, as phylogenetic tools improved, ''O. unilateralis'' was moved from ''Cordyceps'' to ''Ophiocordyceps''.

Following this, a study conducted in Brazil delimited using morphological comparison of the ascospores, germination process and asexual morphs, four different ''Ophiocordyceps'' species. Afterwards, three new species were described in the Brazilian Amazon, six in Thailand, and one in Japan. These findings provided increasing evidence for ''O. unilateralis'' being actually a complex a species.<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\nMore recently in 2018, 15 new species were described. They first used classic taxonomic criteria, and macro-morphological data with a deeper focus on ascospore and asexual morphology in order to delimit and classify species composing ''O. unilateralis s.l.''. \nThe asexual morphologies enabled to distinguish two different [[clades]] mainly composed of [[myrmecophilous|species associated with ants]] which they termed \u201c''O. unilateralis'' core clade\u201d and \u201c''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade\u201d.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nAfterwards, in the same study, they conducted further analysis using a set of different traits. They used morphological traits analysis which included both macro-morphological characters and microscopic traits. The macro-morphological characteristics consist of: the typical single stroma arising from the host\u2019s dorsal pronotum, the [[ascoma]] (perithecia) growing from the stroma. The microscopic traits consisted of: the morphology of the ascospores in terms of size, shape, [[septation]] and germination. Finally, they used other traits such as the host and the location of the death grip.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nWith these analyses, they identified different morphologies which enabled them to distribute 14 new species within the core clade, and one within the sub-clade.

Once the host is killed by the fungus, it is commonly found fixed through their mandibles onto the surfaces of leaves.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n'''''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade morphological characteristics'''<br>\n\nThe ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade, as described by Araujo et al in 2018, also has distinct morphological characteristics. Its species produce a stroma that grows laterally from the host\u2019s thorax which itself generates an orange [[ascoma]]. Moreover, species within this sub-clade share a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nAs for the core clade, these species are also recognizable through the hosts they infect, which are usually neotropical ant species. The sub-clade does not present the same extended phenotype with the famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d that O. unilateralis species typically exhibit. Their hosts usually die at the base of large trees in the Amazonian rainforest, among the moss carpets.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n== Life cycle ==\n\nLike other fungi pathogenic to insects in the genus ''Ophiocordyceps'', ''O. unilateralis'' targets a specific host species, ''Camponotus Leonardi''. However, the fungus may parasitize other closely related species of ants with lesser degrees of host manipulation and reproductive success.<ref name=Sample />\nThe changes in the behavior of the infected ants are very specific, giving rise to the popular term \"zombie ants\", and are tuned for the benefit of the fungus in terms of its growth and its transmission, thereby increasing its fitness. \nIn tropical forests, ''C. leonardi'' lives in the high canopy, and has an extensive network of aerial trails. Sometimes the canopy gaps are too difficult to cross, so the trails descend to the forest floor where the ants are exposed to ''O. unilateralis'' infections. The fungus\u2019 spores attach to and eventually break through the ant's exoskeleton using mechanical pressure and enzymes.<ref name=\"pmc-3204140\" /> \n\nYeast stages of the fungus spread in the ant's body and presumably produce compounds that affect the ant's [[hemocoel]], using the evolutionary trait of an [[extended phenotype]] to manipulate the behavioral patterns exhibited by the ant.<ref name=\"Andersen\" /> \nAn infected ant exhibits irregularly timed full-body convulsions that dislodge it from its canopy nest to the forest floor.<ref name=\"Hughes, D.

For this purpose, the fungus\u2019 [[hypha]] pierces the [[exoskeleton]] using enzymes such as [[chitinase]], [[lipase]] and [[protease]], combined with mechanical pressure.<ref name=pmc-3204140/>\n\n* '''Convulsions and climbing behaviour'''<br>\n\nAfter the fungus enters the ant it propagates, and fungal cells can be found beside the host\u2019s brain. Once the population is of sufficient size, the fungus takes over the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), which enables it to manipulate the ant to reach the forest floor and climb up the vegetation.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nTwo candidate compounds, [[sphingosine]] and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA), were identified as responsible for the manipulation of the host brain. Both of these metabolites are known in the scientific world to be involved in neurological disorders. However, more research is needed in the field to determine whether other fungal metabolites interact with the host brain and cause higher levels of sphingosine and GBA in the brain.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nSome studies identified another compound, hypoxanthine, present at high extracellular concentration. Hypoxanthine has deleterious effects on neural tissues of the cerebral cortex, which in the context of zombie ants may indicate a way for the fungus to alter the motor neurons of the ant, consequently affecting its behavior.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\n* '''Death grip'''<br>\n\nThe famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d exhibited by the ant is also a result of the fungus-induced manipulation. The behavior consists in the ant biting the leaf so tightly that the ant is prevented from falling as it dies hanging upside down, consequently enabling the proper growth of the fungus\u2019 fruiting body.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/>\n\nThis is possibly a result of the atrophication of the ant\u2019s mandibular muscles caused by the secretion of fungal compounds. In multiple studies, fungal cell populations were found within atrophied mandibular muscle tissues. In fact, they infiltrate between the muscle fibers and it is a common hypothesis of researchers that they cause the muscles\u2019 atrophication the secretion of chemicals.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\nSignificant decreases in [[leucine]] concentration and [[mitochondria]] number were identified in infected ants. A deficit in leucine results in the prevention of muscle regeneration because the amino acid is a nutrient regulator of muscle protein synthesis. A decrease in mitochondria ultimately results in a reduction of energy and calcium levels due to the lack of [[ATP]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which provides [[calcium]] for [[actin]]-[[myosin]] binding which is essential for muscle cells.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\nMore in depth research is needed for the identification of other fungal compounds which act to atrophy the mandibular muscles, and for the understanding of their exact effects on the ant.\n\n'''Natural products are host specific'''\n\nAnother study tested the effects of ''O. unilateralis'' on different ant species. The ant species which are normally found infected in nature exhibited a manipulated behavior, whereas the species which are not typically infected were killed by the infection, but their behavior was not altered.

To do so, ''O. unilateralis'' fortifies the ant cadaver to prevent its decay, which consequently ensures the growth of the fruiting body. Therefore, the zombie-ant fungus adapts to the short viability of its spores by increasing their production using the dead ant.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" />\n\n== Host adaptation ==\n\nThe principal hosts of ''O. unilateralis'' evolved adaptive behaviours enable to limit the contact rate between uninfected susceptible hosts and infected hosts, thereby reducing the risk of transmission. \n\n''O.unilateralis\u2019'' principal hosts evolved efficient behavioral forms of social immunity. In fact, the ants clean the exoskeletons of one another in order to decrease the presence of spores which are attached to their cuticle.<ref name=\"Hughes, D. P. 2011\"/> Studies also show that ants can sense that a member of the colony is infected; resulting in healthy ants carry the ''O. unilateralis''-infected individual far away from the colony to avoid fungal spore exposure. Plus, there are reports testifying that most worker ants remain inside the nest boundaries, consequently, only foragers are at risk of infection.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" /> \n\nMoreover, one of the fungus' principal hosts, ''Camponotus leonardi'' which occurs in tropical forests of Thailand, provided evidence for the avoidance of the forest floor by the host ants as a defence method.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> In areas where ''O. unilateralis'' is present, ''C. leonardi'' builds its nests high in the canopy, and has a broad network of areal trails. These trails occasionally move down to the ground level, where infection and graveyards occur, due to canopy gaps too difficult for the ants to cross. Studies show that when the trails descend to the forest floor, their length is only of three to five meters before going back up into the canopy. This demonstrates the avoidance of the zones of infection by the ants. Additionally, more evidence participates in the favour of this defence method being adaptive as it is not observed in undisturbed forests where the zombie-ant fungus is not present.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/>\n\n== Genetic Basis of Behavioral Manipulation ==\n\nOphiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is an Entomopathogenic fungi, meaning it is a parasite of insects. Parasites obtain their necessities of life by appropriating nutrients from a host, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, are no exception to this concept of the nature of a parasite (1-5). One of the most notable traits of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis in the behavior it manipulates in the host ants to maximize their own lifetime reproductive fitness (2,4).  The Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is of great interest for many reasons, one of which is its ability to manipulate their hosts behaviors without destroying the brain (1,2,3).\nInfected ant hosts have been observed climbing up vegetation and biting onto it such tat they hang off the grass. It has been suggested that these hosts hang off of the vegetation in a position that is optimal for the fungi to have maximum dispersal (2,3). This behavior is known as an extended phenotype, otherwise described as the ability for a parasites genotype to be expressed in the hosts phenotype.\nIt was hypothesized that this fungus penetrates the brain (2), however, some experiments have found Ophiocordyceps unilateralis cells are present throughout the body, but not in the brain (3). Fungal cells have been identified as hyphal bodies which take the form of yeast-like cells and grow inside the ant\u2019s bodies. The other type of fungal cell is hyphae which are filamentous branch-like structure which allow for the fungus to spread to other tissues within the host (3). It has been found that the fungal cells never actually degrade or invade the brain of the host (1,3). \nTo better understand how exactly this fungus is able to invade and manipulate the ant hosts muscles, 3-dimensional (3D) structures of this parasite-host interaction were constructed (3). Experiments have shown that hyphae fungal cells surround the ants muscle fibers, especially in the legs (3). It has also been noted that these fungal cells interact with each other via conidial tubes. These tubes allow for the transfer of cellular information between the different muscle fibers which they surround and penetrate (3). Frederickson et al. found that these cell\u2013cell connections resulted in a 3D network of hyphal bodies that surrounded the muscle fiber as seen in the following figure (3).\n from Frederickson et al. \nSeveral studies have been done on entomopathogenic fungi to try and understand the genetic basis of this ability to alter their host\u2019s behaviors. Will et al. research used comparative transcriptomics (compared RNA sequences) between different entomopathogenic fungi-ant species interactions to see if there were any candidate genes which underly the manipulation of the ant\u2019s behavior (2). \n\n  from Will I et al.\nThe figure above shows the major genetic themes in infected host ants between various species of entomopathogenic fungi obtained from Will et al\u2019s comparative transcriptomics results and the associated behaviors of the hosts. Will et al. found that there were several recurring candidate genes found in infected hosts (5). Will et all\u2019s findings corroborate past literature by finding genetic basis of the extended phenotype. They saw changes in gene expression which modifies nutritional physiology and neuronal-activity. of the host (5).  One of the manipulations is to odor receptors where they observed regulation changes in odor receptor genes and binding proteins. Communication between ants relies on pheromone and odor detection, resulting in impaired response to external stimuli (5). is a disruption to the hosts innate circadian rhythms and caste identities  (1-5). There is still much to learn about the genetic basis of these relationships but understanding how a host is manipulated by these entomopathogenic fungi.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Sample>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Sample | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/18/zombie-carpenter-ant-fungus | title = 'Zombie ants' controlled by parasitic fungus for 48m years | date = 18 August 2010 | department = News \u00bb Science \u00bb Microbiology | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ponto>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pontoppidan MB, Himaman W, Hywel-Jones NL, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = Graveyards on the move: The spatio-temporal distribution of dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-infected ants | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4835 | date = 12 March 2009 | pmid = 19279680 | pmc = 2652714 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004835 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4835P }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=sung>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sung GH, Hywel-Jones NL, Sung JM, Luangsa-Ard JJ, Shrestha B, Spatafora JW | title = Phylogenetic classification of ''Cordyceps'' and the clavicipitaceous fungi | journal = Studies in Mycology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201359 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18490993 | pmc = 2104736 | doi = 10.3114/sim.2007.57.01 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zombie>{{cite news | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100818105730.htm | title = Fossil Reveals 48-Million-Year History of Zombie Ants | publisher = [[Science Daily]] | date = 18 August 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=MBank>{{cite web | url = http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=281145 | title = Ophiocordyceps unilateralis | website = [[MycoBank]] | publisher = [[International Mycological Association]] | accessdate = 2011-07-19}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes DP, Wappler T, Labandeira CC | title = Ancient death-grip leaf scars reveal ant fungal parasitism | journal = [[Biology Letters]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u201370 | date = 23 February 2011 | pmid = 20719770 | pmc = 3030878 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0521 | origyear = 18 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Andersen>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SB, Gerritsma S, Yusah KM, Mayntz D, Hywel-Jones NL, Billen J, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = The life of a dead ant: The expression of an adaptive extended phenotype | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 424\u2013433 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19627240 | doi = 10.1086/603640 | jstor = 10.1086/603640 | url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/the-life-of-a-dead-ant(e6374602-b2a0-496c-b78e-774b34fb152b).html }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Xiao>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao JH, Zhong JJ | title = Secondary metabolites from ''Cordyceps'' species and their antitumor activity studies | journal = Recent Patents on Biotechnology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 123\u2013137 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19075836 | doi = 10.2174/187220807780809454 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Wongsa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wongsa P, Tasanatai K, Watts P, Hywel-Jones N | title = Isolation and ''in vitro'' cultivation of the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = [[Mycological Research]] | volume = 109 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 936\u2013940 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16175796 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756205003321 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Unagul>{{cite journal | vauthors = Unagul P, Wongsa P, Kittakoop P, Intamas S, Srikitikulchai P, Tanticharoen M | title = Production of red pigments by the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' BCC 1869 | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 135\u2013140 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15891934 | doi = 10.1007/s10295-005-0213-6 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kittakoopa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kittakoopa P, Punyaa J, Kongsaeree P, Lertwerawat Y, Jintasirikul A, Tanticharoena M, Thebtaranonth Y | year = 1999 | title = Bioactive naphthoquinones from ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 453\u2013457 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00272-1}}</ref>\n}}\n<ref> de Bekker, C., Ohm, R.

''O. unilateralis'' infects [[ant]]s of the [[Camponotini]] tribe, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains after its eventual death.<ref name = \"Mongkolsamrit2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mongkolsamrit S, Kobmoo N, Tasanathai K, Khonsanit A, Noisripoom W, Srikitikulchai P, Somnuk R, Luangsa-ard JJ | title = Life cycle, host range and temporal variation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''/''Hirsutella formicarium'' on Formicine ants | journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 217\u201324 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22959811 | doi = 10.1016/j.jip.2012.08.007 }}</ref> The process leading to mortality takes 4\u201310 days, and includes a reproductive stage where [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores. ''O. unilateralis'' is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.\n\n''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' and related species are known to engage in an active [[secondary metabolism]], among other reasons, for the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by [[natural product]]s chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the [[polyketide]] family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nAfter years of research, the taxonomy of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' is becoming increasingly clear. \n\n=== ''Cordyceps'' vs ''Ophiocordyceps'' ===\n\nThroughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between both the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' [[genus]] and the ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'' genus. These genera are different, however they were at the source of many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as ''Ophiocordyceps'' was only recently brought forward.\n\nThe ''Cordyceps'' genus comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the ''[[Clavicipitaceae]]'' [[family (biology)|family]] within the [[order (biology)|order]] ''[[Hypocreales]]''. The classification was based on different morphological characteristics such as filiform [[ascospores]] and cylindrical [[asci]].<ref name = \"Sung2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Gi-Ho |last2=Hywel-Jones |first2=Nigel L. |last3=Sung |first3=Jae-Mo |last4=Luangsa-ard |first4=J.

However, in 2007, important new molecular data was tested, and enabled them to re-classify the ''Clavicipitaceae'' family. It was found that \u2018\u2019Clavicipitaceae\u2019\u2019 was in fact three distinct monophyletic families: the ''Clavicipitaceae'', the ''Cordycipitaceae'' and the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''.<ref name = \"Sung2007\"/>\n \nThe new molecular phylogenetics studies contradicted the older classification and moved all ''Cordyceps'' species forming a sister group with ''Tolypocladium'', into ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''. Fungi able to parasitize ants were also included in the transfer, such as ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' which was later renamed ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/> Following this study, multiple traits such as the production of darkly pigmented, hard to flexible [[stromata]] were defined as characteristics of the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae'' family.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nConsequently, as phylogenetic tools improved, ''O. unilateralis'' was moved from ''Cordyceps'' to ''Ophiocordyceps''.

Following this, a study conducted in Brazil delimited using morphological comparison of the ascospores, germination process and asexual morphs, four different ''Ophiocordyceps'' species. Afterwards, three new species were described in the Brazilian Amazon, six in Thailand, and one in Japan. These findings provided increasing evidence for ''O. unilateralis'' being actually a complex a species.<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\nMore recently in 2018, 15 new species were described. They first used classic taxonomic criteria, and macro-morphological data with a deeper focus on ascospore and asexual morphology in order to delimit and classify species composing ''O. unilateralis s.l.''. \nThe asexual morphologies enabled to distinguish two different [[clades]] mainly composed of [[myrmecophilous|species associated with ants]] which they termed \u201c''O. unilateralis'' core clade\u201d and \u201c''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade\u201d.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nAfterwards, in the same study, they conducted further analysis using a set of different traits. They used morphological traits analysis which included both macro-morphological characters and microscopic traits. The macro-morphological characteristics consist of: the typical single stroma arising from the host\u2019s dorsal pronotum, the [[ascoma]] (perithecia) growing from the stroma. The microscopic traits consisted of: the morphology of the ascospores in terms of size, shape, [[septation]] and germination. Finally, they used other traits such as the host and the location of the death grip.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nWith these analyses, they identified different morphologies which enabled them to distribute 14 new species within the core clade, and one within the sub-clade.

Generally, the asexual morphs identified for ''Ophiocordyceps'' are ''[[Hirsutella]]'' and ''[[Hymenostilbe]]'', two genera of asexually reproducing fungi.<ref name=pmc-3204140/><br>\n\n=== Morphological variation ===\n\n''O. unilateralis'' species exhibit morphological variations which are most certainly due to their wide geographic range, from Japan to the Americas. \nMoreover, it has been hypothesized that their morphological variations may also be a result of one fungus species maximizing its infection on one specific host ant species (host-specific infections). Different [[sub-species]] of ant can occur within the same area, which means that in order to coexist they have to occupy different [[ecological niches]]. Consequently, the fungi may have evolved at the subspecies level in order to maximize its [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\n'''''O. unilateralis'' core clade morphological characteristics'''<br>\n\nThe ''O. unilateralis'' core clade, as described by Araujo et al in 2018, has distinct morphological characteristics. It exhibits a single stroma with a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph, which arises from the dorsal neck region of the dead ant and produces a dark brown perithecia attached to its stalk.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nThese species are also recognizable through the host species they infect, which are only ''Camponotini'' species. Once the host is killed by the fungus, it is commonly found fixed through their mandibles onto the surfaces of leaves.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n'''''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade morphological characteristics'''<br>\n\nThe ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade, as described by Araujo et al in 2018, also has distinct morphological characteristics. Its species produce a stroma that grows laterally from the host\u2019s thorax which itself generates an orange [[ascoma]]. Moreover, species within this sub-clade share a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nAs for the core clade, these species are also recognizable through the hosts they infect, which are usually neotropical ant species. The sub-clade does not present the same extended phenotype with the famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d that O. unilateralis species typically exhibit. Their hosts usually die at the base of large trees in the Amazonian rainforest, among the moss carpets.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n== Life cycle ==\n\nLike other fungi pathogenic to insects in the genus ''Ophiocordyceps'', ''O. unilateralis'' targets a specific host species, ''Camponotus Leonardi''. However, the fungus may parasitize other closely related species of ants with lesser degrees of host manipulation and reproductive success.<ref name=Sample />\nThe changes in the behavior of the infected ants are very specific, giving rise to the popular term \"zombie ants\", and are tuned for the benefit of the fungus in terms of its growth and its transmission, thereby increasing its fitness. \nIn tropical forests, C. leonardi lives in the high canopy, and has an extensive network of aerial trails. Sometimes the canopy gaps are too difficult to cross, so the trails descend to the forest floor where the ants are exposed to O. unilateralis infections. The fungus\u2019 spores attach to and eventually break through the ant's exoskeleton using mechanical pressure and enzymes.<ref name=\"pmc-3204140\" /> \n\nYeast stages of the fungus spread in the ant's body and presumably produce compounds that affect the ant's [[hemocoel]], using the evolutionary trait of an [[extended phenotype]] to manipulate the behavioral patterns exhibited by the ant.<ref name=\"Andersen\" /> \nAn infected ant exhibits irregularly timed full-body convulsions that dislodge it from its canopy nest to the forest floor.<ref name=\"Hughes, D.

For this purpose, the fungus\u2019 [[hypha]] pierces the [[exoskeleton]] using enzymes such as [[chitinase]], [[lipase]] and [[protease]], combined with mechanical pressure.<ref name=pmc-3204140/>\n\n* '''Convulsions and climbing behaviour'''<br>\n\nAfter the fungus enters the ant it propagates, and fungal cells can be found beside the host\u2019s brain. Once the population is of sufficient size, the fungus takes over the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), which enables it to manipulate the ant to reach the forest floor and climb up the vegetation.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nTwo candidate compounds, [[sphingosine]] and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA), were identified as responsible for the manipulation of the host brain. Both of these metabolites are known in the scientific world to be involved in neurological disorders. However, more research is needed in the field to determine whether other fungal metabolites interact with the host brain and cause higher levels of sphingosine and GBA in the brain.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nSome studies identified another compound, hypoxanthine, present at high extracellular concentration. Hypoxanthine has deleterious effects on neural tissues of the cerebral cortex, which in the context of zombie ants may indicate a way for the fungus to alter the motor neurons of the ant, consequently affecting its behavior.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\n* '''Death grip'''<br>\n\nThe famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d exhibited by the ant is also a result of the fungus-induced manipulation. The behavior consists in the ant biting the leaf so tightly that the ant is prevented from falling as it dies hanging upside down, consequently enabling the proper growth of the fungus\u2019 fruiting body.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/>\n\nThis is possibly a result of the atrophication of the ant\u2019s mandibular muscles caused by the secretion of fungal compounds. In multiple studies, fungal cell populations were found within atrophied mandibular muscle tissues. In fact, they infiltrate between the muscle fibers and it is a common hypothesis of researchers that they cause the muscles\u2019 atrophication the secretion of chemicals.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\nSignificant decreases in [[leucine]] concentration and [[mitochondria]] number were identified in infected ants. A deficit in leucine results in the prevention of muscle regeneration because the amino acid is a nutrient regulator of muscle protein synthesis. A decrease in mitochondria ultimately results in a reduction of energy and calcium levels due to the lack of [[ATP]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which provides [[calcium]] for [[actin]]-[[myosin]] binding which is essential for muscle cells.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\nMore in depth research is needed for the identification of other fungal compounds which act to atrophy the mandibular muscles, and for the understanding of their exact effects on the ant.\n\n'''Natural products are host specific'''\n\nAnother study tested the effects of ''O. unilateralis'' on different ant species. The ant species which are normally found infected in nature exhibited a manipulated behavior, whereas the species which are not typically infected were killed by the infection, but their behavior was not altered.

To do so, ''O. unilateralis'' fortifies the ant cadaver to prevent its decay, which consequently ensures the growth of the fruiting body. Therefore, the zombie-ant fungus adapts to the short viability of its spores by increasing their production using the dead ant.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" />\n\n== Host adaptation ==\n\nThe principal hosts of ''O. unilateralis'' evolved adaptive behaviours enable to limit the contact rate between uninfected susceptible hosts and infected hosts, thereby reducing the risk of transmission. \n\n''O.unilateralis\u2019'' principal hosts evolved efficient behavioral forms of social immunity. In fact, the ants clean the exoskeletons of one another in order to decrease the presence of spores which are attached to their cuticle.<ref name=\"Hughes, D. P. 2011\"/> Studies also show that ants can sense that a member of the colony is infected; resulting in healthy ants carry the ''O. unilateralis''-infected individual far away from the colony to avoid fungal spore exposure. Plus, there are reports testifying that most worker ants remain inside the nest boundaries, consequently, only foragers are at risk of infection.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" /> \n\nMoreover, one of the fungus' principal hosts, ''Camponotus leonardi'' which occurs in tropical forests of Thailand, provided evidence for the avoidance of the forest floor by the host ants as a defence method.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> In areas where ''O. unilateralis'' is present, ''C. leonardi'' builds its nests high in the canopy, and has a broad network of areal trails. These trails occasionally move down to the ground level, where infection and graveyards occur, due to canopy gaps too difficult for the ants to cross. Studies show that when the trails descend to the forest floor, their length is only of three to five meters before going back up into the canopy. This demonstrates the avoidance of the zones of infection by the ants. Additionally, more evidence participates in the favour of this defence method being adaptive as it is not observed in undisturbed forests where the zombie-ant fungus is not present.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/>\n\n== Genetic Basis of Behavioral Manipulation ==\n\nOphiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is an Entomopathogenic fungi, meaning it is a parasite of insects. Parasites obtain their necessities of life by appropriating nutrients from a host, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, are no exception to this concept of the nature of a parasite (1-5). One of the most notable traits of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis in the behavior it manipulates in the host ants to maximize their own lifetime reproductive fitness (2,4).  The Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is of great interest for many reasons, one of which is its ability to manipulate their hosts behaviors without destroying the brain (1,2,3).\nInfected ant hosts have been observed climbing up vegetation and biting onto it such tat they hang off the grass. It has been suggested that these hosts hang off of the vegetation in a position that is optimal for the fungi to have maximum dispersal (2,3). This behavior is known as an extended phenotype, otherwise described as the ability for a parasites genotype to be expressed in the hosts phenotype.\nIt was hypothesized that this fungus penetrates the brain (2), however, some experiments have found Ophiocordyceps unilateralis cells are present throughout the body, but not in the brain (3). Fungal cells have been identified as hyphal bodies which take the form of yeast-like cells and grow inside the ant\u2019s bodies. The other type of fungal cell is hyphae which are filamentous branch-like structure which allow for the fungus to spread to other tissues within the host (3). It has been found that the fungal cells never actually degrade or invade the brain of the host (1,3). \nTo better understand how exactly this fungus is able to invade and manipulate the ant hosts muscles, 3-dimensional (3D) structures of this parasite-host interaction were constructed (3). Experiments have shown that hyphae fungal cells surround the ants muscle fibers, especially in the legs (3). It has also been noted that these fungal cells interact with each other via conidial tubes. These tubes allow for the transfer of cellular information between the different muscle fibers which they surround and penetrate (3). Frederickson et al. found that these cell\u2013cell connections resulted in a 3D network of hyphal bodies that surrounded the muscle fiber as seen in the following figure (3).\n from Frederickson et al. \nSeveral studies have been done on entomopathogenic fungi to try and understand the genetic basis of this ability to alter their host\u2019s behaviors. Will et al. research used comparative transcriptomics (compared RNA sequences) between different entomopathogenic fungi-ant species interactions to see if there were any candidate genes which underly the manipulation of the ant\u2019s behavior (2). \n\n  from Will I et al.\nThe figure above shows the major genetic themes in infected host ants between various species of entomopathogenic fungi obtained from Will et al\u2019s comparative transcriptomics results and the associated behaviors of the hosts. Will et al. found that there were several recurring candidate genes found in infected hosts (5). Will et all\u2019s findings corroborate past literature by finding genetic basis of the extended phenotype. They saw changes in gene expression which modifies nutritional physiology and neuronal-activity. of the host (5).  One of the manipulations is to odor receptors where they observed regulation changes in odor receptor genes and binding proteins. Communication between ants relies on pheromone and odor detection, resulting in impaired response to external stimuli (5). is a disruption to the hosts innate circadian rhythms and caste identities  (1-5). There is still much to learn about the genetic basis of these relationships but understanding how a host is manipulated by these entomopathogenic fungi.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Sample>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Sample | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/18/zombie-carpenter-ant-fungus | title = 'Zombie ants' controlled by parasitic fungus for 48m years | date = 18 August 2010 | department = News \u00bb Science \u00bb Microbiology | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ponto>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pontoppidan MB, Himaman W, Hywel-Jones NL, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = Graveyards on the move: The spatio-temporal distribution of dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-infected ants | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4835 | date = 12 March 2009 | pmid = 19279680 | pmc = 2652714 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004835 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4835P }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=sung>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sung GH, Hywel-Jones NL, Sung JM, Luangsa-Ard JJ, Shrestha B, Spatafora JW | title = Phylogenetic classification of ''Cordyceps'' and the clavicipitaceous fungi | journal = Studies in Mycology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201359 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18490993 | pmc = 2104736 | doi = 10.3114/sim.2007.57.01 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zombie>{{cite news | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100818105730.htm | title = Fossil Reveals 48-Million-Year History of Zombie Ants | publisher = [[Science Daily]] | date = 18 August 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=MBank>{{cite web | url = http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=281145 | title = Ophiocordyceps unilateralis | website = [[MycoBank]] | publisher = [[International Mycological Association]] | accessdate = 2011-07-19}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes DP, Wappler T, Labandeira CC | title = Ancient death-grip leaf scars reveal ant fungal parasitism | journal = [[Biology Letters]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u201370 | date = 23 February 2011 | pmid = 20719770 | pmc = 3030878 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0521 | origyear = 18 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Andersen>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SB, Gerritsma S, Yusah KM, Mayntz D, Hywel-Jones NL, Billen J, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = The life of a dead ant: The expression of an adaptive extended phenotype | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 424\u2013433 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19627240 | doi = 10.1086/603640 | jstor = 10.1086/603640 | url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/the-life-of-a-dead-ant(e6374602-b2a0-496c-b78e-774b34fb152b).html }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Xiao>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao JH, Zhong JJ | title = Secondary metabolites from ''Cordyceps'' species and their antitumor activity studies | journal = Recent Patents on Biotechnology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 123\u2013137 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19075836 | doi = 10.2174/187220807780809454 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Wongsa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wongsa P, Tasanatai K, Watts P, Hywel-Jones N | title = Isolation and ''in vitro'' cultivation of the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = [[Mycological Research]] | volume = 109 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 936\u2013940 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16175796 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756205003321 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Unagul>{{cite journal | vauthors = Unagul P, Wongsa P, Kittakoop P, Intamas S, Srikitikulchai P, Tanticharoen M | title = Production of red pigments by the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' BCC 1869 | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 135\u2013140 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15891934 | doi = 10.1007/s10295-005-0213-6 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kittakoopa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kittakoopa P, Punyaa J, Kongsaeree P, Lertwerawat Y, Jintasirikul A, Tanticharoena M, Thebtaranonth Y | year = 1999 | title = Bioactive naphthoquinones from ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 453\u2013457 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00272-1}}</ref>\n}}\n<ref> de Bekker, C., Ohm, R.

Each character has special abilities called \"Skybound Arts,\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://versus.granbluefantasy.jp/?lang=en|title=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames|website=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames}}</ref> which correspond to skills that the character is able to use in the main ''[[Granblue Fantasy]]'' game. In an attempt to make the game more accessible to new players, each Skybound Arts can be triggered with a simple button press, but the player will have to wait for a short [[cooldown]] period before they can use it again.  However, if the player uses a more advanced combination of movement and button presses to launch the attack, the cooldown time on the skill will be shortened.\n\nThe game also contains a story mode. Unlike the main fighting game mode, the story mode is more of a side-scrolling, [[beat-'em up]], [[action role-playing game]]. The story mode includes exclusive bosses and minions to battle, setting weapon grids, and a co-op mode.<ref name=\"Granblue Extra Fes 2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2019/jul/20/granblue-fantasy-versus-will-reportedly-receive-ton-new-information-granblue-extra-fes-2019-august-3/|title=Granblue Fantasy Versus will reportedly receive a ton of new information at Granblue Extra Fes 2019 on August 3|first=Dakota 'DarkHorse'|last=Hills|date=July 20, 2019|website=EventHubs}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Do not add Erika Harlacher yet.

series.<ref>https://twitter.com/gbvs_official/status/1232968809314570241</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Granblue Fantasy Versus'' is mainly a fighting game where the goal is to eliminate the opponent by using a combination of attacks to empty their character's life bar enough times to win the match.  Each character has special abilities called \"Skybound Arts,\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://versus.granbluefantasy.jp/?lang=en|title=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames|website=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames}}</ref> which correspond to skills that the character is able to use in the main ''[[Granblue Fantasy]]'' game. In an attempt to make the game more accessible to new players, each Skybound Arts can be triggered with a simple button press, but the player will have to wait for a short [[cooldown]] period before they can use it again.  However, if the player uses a more advanced combination of movement and button presses to launch the attack, the cooldown time on the skill will be shortened.\n\nThe game also contains a story mode. Unlike the main fighting game mode, the story mode is more of a side-scrolling, [[beat-'em up]], [[action role-playing game]]. The story mode includes exclusive bosses and minions to battle, setting weapon grids, and a co-op mode.<ref name=\"Granblue Extra Fes 2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2019/jul/20/granblue-fantasy-versus-will-reportedly-receive-ton-new-information-granblue-extra-fes-2019-august-3/|title=Granblue Fantasy Versus will reportedly receive a ton of new information at Granblue Extra Fes 2019 on August 3|first=Dakota 'DarkHorse'|last=Hills|date=July 20, 2019|website=EventHubs}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Do not add Erika Harlacher yet.
