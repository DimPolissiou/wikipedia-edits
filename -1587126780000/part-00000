Relations deteriorated and led to a war over [[Venice]] in 806\u2013810. In the process, Nikephoros had quelled a Venetian rebellion in 807, but suffered extensive losses to the Franks.  The conflict was resolved only after Nikephoros' death, and Venice, [[Istria]], the [[Dalmatia]]n coast and [[South Italy]] were assigned to the East, while [[Rome]], [[Ravenna]] and the [[Pentapolis]] were included in the Western realm. \n\nBy withholding the tribute which Irene had agreed to pay to the caliph [[H\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd]], Nikephoros committed himself to a war against the Arabs.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|p=222}} Compelled by Bardanes' disloyalty to take the field himself, he sustained a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Krasos]] in Phrygia (805).{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|p=222}} In 806 a Muslim army of 135,000 men [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (806)|invaded the Empire]].

He also played for the [[California Angels]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]].

In 1981, he won the American League batting title in the strike-shortened season, becoming the league's first right-handed hitter to do so in 11 years.

Lansford narrowly missed winning his second batting title in 1989 with a .336 average (Minnesota's [[Kirby Puckett]] finished with a .339 average). Although his power numbers dropped off during those years, and he missed almost all the 1991 season with an injury, Lansford's speed and solid hitting made him a significant contributor to the A's dynasty. He played in three [[World Series]] with the A's, losing in {{wsy|1988}} and {{wsy|1990}} and winning in {{wsy|1989}}.\n\nIn his 15-year career, Lansford was a .290 hitter with 151 [[home run]]s, 874 [[run batted in|RBI]], and 224 [[stolen base]]s in 1862 [[games played|games]].

Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then decided to sell to [[Paris]]ian hairdressers.\nOn 31 July 1919, [[Eug\u00e8ne Schueller|Schueller]] registered his company,<ref>[https://prezi.com/a2vt6eplmrmn/corporate-financial-reporting/ Corporate financial reporting by Amberr Aslamm on Prezi]. Prezi.com. Retrieved on 12 April 2015.</ref> the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Or\u00e9al, were research and innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists. By 1950, the team was 100 strong; by 1984 was 1,000 and is nearly 82,000 today.\n\nSchueller provided financial support and held meetings for [[La Cagoule]] at L'Or\u00e9al headquarters. [[La Cagoule]] was a violent French [[fascist]]-leaning and anti-[[communist]] group whose leader formed a political party [[Mouvement Social R\u00e9volutionnaire]] (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement) which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |title=The Color of Money |date=28 March 2011 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505045702/http://gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |archivedate=5 May 2012  }}</ref> L'Or\u00e9al hired several members of the group as executives after [[World War II]], such as [[Jacques Corr\u00e8ze]], who served as [[CEO]] of the [[United States]] operation. This involvement was extensively researched by [[Michael Bar-Zohar]] in his book, ''Bitter Scent''.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. L'Or\u00e9al currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, [[Hairstyle|hair styling]], body and skincare, [[cleanser]]s, makeup, and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to hyper - and supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies and direct mail.\n\n===Research and development facilities===\nL'Or\u00e9al has six worldwide [[research and development]] centres: two in [[France]]: [[Aulnay-sous-Bois|Aulnay]] and [[Chevilly-Larue|Chevilly]]; one in the [[United States|U.S.]]: [[Clark, New Jersey|Clark]], [[New Jersey]]; one in [[Japan]]: [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]; in 2005 one was established in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and one in [[India]].

[[StudioCanal]] acquired the Paravision properties in 1994.\n\n==Acquisitions==\nL'Or\u00e9al purchased Synth\u00e9labo in 1973 to pursue its ambitions in the pharmaceutical field. Synth\u00e9labo merged with [[Sanofi]] in 1999 to become [[Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo]].

He claims that he was let go because L'Or\u00e9al wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L'Or\u00e9al executives. [[Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt]] who married Schueller's daughter, [[Liliane Bettencourt]], and became deputy chairman for L'Or\u00e9al, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Fran\u00e7aise. La Terre Fran\u00e7aise was an anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda sheet. Andr\u00e9 has admitted ownership of the [[propaganda]] but claimed he was poisoned by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime and said, \"I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them.\"<ref name=\"Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt\"/> Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the [[French Resistance]] after Liberation.<ref name=\"Pascal\"/> It was also revealed that Eug\u00e8ne Schueller hired [[Jacques Correze]], who was the honorary head of L'Or\u00e9al's U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with [[La Cagoule]].<ref name=\"Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's\"/>\n\nFurther controversy arose when it was revealed that L'Or\u00e9al had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during [[World War II]]. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder, was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner's consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L'Or\u00e9al, which was later bought out in 1961 by L'Or\u00e9al, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder's argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the [[Jewish Restitution Successor Organization]], though this was done without the family's consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as ''L'Or\u00e9al a pris ma maison'' and in English as ''L'Or\u00e9al stole my house!'', details how L'Or\u00e9al, took over the Waitzfelder home in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Karlsruhe]] (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters.<ref name=\"Gentleman\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/13/secondworldwar.germany | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Amelia | last=Gentleman | title=L'Or\u00e9al profited from victims of Nazis, court told | date=13 October 2004}}</ref>  Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, \"All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Or\u00e9al should be any different from the others.\" A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial.

He claims that he was let go because L'Or\u00e9al wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L'Or\u00e9al executives. [[Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt]] who married Schueller's daughter, [[Liliane Bettencourt]], and became deputy chairman for L'Or\u00e9al, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Fran\u00e7aise. La Terre Fran\u00e7aise was an anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda sheet. Andr\u00e9 has admitted ownership of the [[propaganda]] but claimed he was poisoned by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime and said, \"I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them.\"<ref name=\"Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt\"/> Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the [[French Resistance]] after Liberation.<ref name=\"Pascal\"/> It was also revealed that Eug\u00e8ne Schueller hired [[Jacques Correze]], who was the honorary head of L'Or\u00e9al's U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with [[La Cagoule]].<ref name=\"Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's\"/>\n\nFurther controversy arose when it was revealed that L'Or\u00e9al had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during [[World War II]]. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder, was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner's consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L'Or\u00e9al, which was later bought out in 1961 by L'Or\u00e9al, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder's argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the [[Jewish Restitution Successor Organization]], though this was done without the family's consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as ''L'Or\u00e9al a pris ma maison'' and in English as ''L'Or\u00e9al stole my house!'', details how L'Or\u00e9al, took over the Waitzfelder home in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Karlsruhe]] (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters.<ref name=\"Gentleman\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/13/secondworldwar.germany | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Amelia | last=Gentleman | title=L'Or\u00e9al profited from victims of Nazis, court told | date=13 October 2004}}</ref>  Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, \"All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Or\u00e9al should be any different from the others.\" A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial.  As of 2007, she is bringing the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].<ref name=\"Pascal\"/><ref name=\"Gentleman\"/>\n\nFollowing L'Or\u00e9al's 2006 purchase of [[The Body Shop]], which does not support [[animal testing]], The Body Shop's founder [[Anita Roddick]] was forced to defend herself against allegations of abandoning her principles over L'Or\u00e9al's track record on animal testing.

He was the rhythm/lead guitarist, singer and principal songwriter for the rock band [[The Velvet Underground]] and had a solo career that spanned five decades. The Velvet Underground was not a commercial success during its existence, but became regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of [[underground music|underground]] and [[alternative rock]] music.\n\nAfter leaving the band in 1970, Reed released twenty solo [[Album#Studio|studio albums]]. His second, ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'' (1972), was produced by [[David Bowie]] and arranged by [[Mick Ronson]], and brought mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the [[glam rock]] genre, anchored by Reed's most successful single, \"[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]\". After ''Transformer'', the less commercial but critically acclaimed ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' reached No. 7 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Animal]]'' (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and ''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with ''[[New Sensations]]'' (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album ''[[New York (album)|New York]]''.\n\nReed participated in the reformation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with [[John Cale]] titled ''[[Songs for Drella]]'' which was a tribute to their former mentor [[Andy Warhol]]. ''[[Magic and Loss]]'' (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.\n\nHe contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled ''[[The Raven (Lou Reed album)|The Raven]]''. He married his third wife [[Laurie Anderson]] in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album ''[[Lulu (Lou Reed and Metallica album)|Lulu]]'' with [[Metallica]]. He died in 2013 of [[liver disease]]. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic lyrics and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career. Reed has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice; as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996 and as a solo act in 2015.\n\n==Biography==\n===1942\u201357: Early life ===\nLewis Allan Reed was born on March 2, 1942, at Beth El Hospital (later [[Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center|Brookdale]]) in [[Brooklyn]] and grew up in [[Freeport, New York|Freeport, Long Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-27/lou-reed-rocker-who-sang-walk-on-the-wild-side-dies-at-71.html |title=Lou Reed, 'Walk on the Wild Side' Rocker, Dies at 71 |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=October 28, 2013}}</ref>{{refn|Contrary to some sources, his birth name was Lewis Allan Reed, not Louis Firbanks, a name that was coined as a joke by [[Lester Bangs]] in ''[[Creem]]'' magazine.{{sfnp|Roberts|Reed|2004|p=18}}|group=nb}} Reed was the son of Toby (n\u00e9e Futterman) (1920\u20132013) and Sidney Joseph Reed (1913\u20132005), an accountant.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Lou_Reed.aspx |title=Lou Reed Facts, information, pictures|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref> His family was [[Jews|Jewish]];{{sfnp|Beeber|2006|p=11}} his father had changed his name from Rabinowitz to Reed.{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=}} Reed said that although he was Jewish, his real god was rock 'n' roll.<ref name=\"NYROCK1998\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/loureed_int.htm|title=The Gospel According to Lou: Interview with Lou Reed|author=Gabriella|website=Nyrock.com|date=November 1998|accessdate=October 27, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031184208/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/loureed_int.htm|archivedate=October 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/lou-reeds-contradictory-jewishness/|title=Lou Reed's paradoxical Jewishness|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=September 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nReed attended Atkinson Elementary School in Freeport and went on to Freeport Junior High School.

That year he wrote and recorded the single \"The Ostrich\", a parody of popular [[dance music|dance songs]] of the time, which included lines such as \"put your head on the floor and have somebody step on it\". His employers felt that the song had hit potential, and assembled a supporting band to help promote the recording. The ''ad hoc'' band, called \"the Primitives\", included Welsh musician [[John Cale]], who had recently moved to New York to study music and was playing viola in composer [[La Monte Young]]'s [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], along with [[Tony Conrad]]. Cale and Conrad were surprised to find that for \"The Ostrich\", Reed tuned each string of his guitar to the same note, which they began to call his \"[[ostrich guitar]]\" tuning. This technique created a [[drone (music)|drone]] effect similar to their experimentation in Young's [[avant-garde]] ensemble. Disappointed with Reed's performance, Cale was nevertheless impressed by Reed's early repertoire (including \"[[Heroin (The Velvet Underground song)|Heroin]]\"), and a partnership began to evolve.<ref name=documentary/>\n\nReed and Cale (who played viola, keyboards and bass guitar) lived together on the [[Lower East Side]], and invited Reed's college acquaintance guitarist Sterling Morrison and Cale's neighbor drummer [[Angus MacLise]] to join the band, thus forming [[the Velvet Underground]].

He was the rhythm/lead guitarist, singer and principal songwriter for the rock band [[The Velvet Underground]] and had a solo career that spanned five decades. The Velvet Underground was not a commercial success during its existence, but became regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of [[underground music|underground]] and [[alternative rock]] music.\n\nAfter leaving the band in 1970, Reed released twenty solo [[Album#Studio|studio albums]]. His second, ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'' (1972), was produced by [[David Bowie]] and arranged by [[Mick Ronson]], and brought mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the [[glam rock]] genre, anchored by Reed's most successful single, \"[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]\". After ''Transformer'', the less commercial but critically acclaimed ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' reached No. 7 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Animal]]'' (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and ''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with ''[[New Sensations]]'' (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album ''[[New York (album)|New York]]''.\n\nReed participated in the reformation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with [[John Cale]] titled ''[[Songs for Drella]]'' which was a tribute to their former mentor [[Andy Warhol]]. ''[[Magic and Loss]]'' (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.\n\nHe contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled ''[[The Raven (Lou Reed album)|The Raven]]''. He married his third wife [[Laurie Anderson]] in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album ''[[Lulu (Lou Reed and Metallica album)|Lulu]]'' with [[Metallica]]. He died in 2013 of [[liver disease]]. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic lyrics and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.

That year he wrote and recorded the single \"The Ostrich\", a parody of popular [[dance music|dance songs]] of the time, which included lines such as \"put your head on the floor and have somebody step on it\". His employers felt that the song had hit potential, and assembled a supporting band to help promote the recording. The ''ad hoc'' band, called \"the Primitives\", included Welsh musician [[John Cale]], who had recently moved to New York to study music and was playing viola in composer [[La Monte Young]]'s [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], along with [[Tony Conrad]]. Cale and Conrad were surprised to find that for \"The Ostrich\", Reed tuned each string of his guitar to the same note, which they began to call his \"[[ostrich guitar]]\" tuning. This technique created a [[drone (music)|drone]] effect similar to their experimentation in Young's [[avant-garde]] ensemble.

Adi. Currently living in Bhopal after Prashant's transfer to the city, she is propelled both by the arrival of her former teammate Meenu and a push from Adi, who learns of her achievements through Prashant, to return to the sport despite facing challenges of physical fitness and newer, more experienced players. Initially unable to deal with the pressures of a hectic job and the exercise routines that Adi's enthusiasm pushes her through, she finally regains composure and, with support from Prashant and Adi, goes on to mark her comeback to the sport as a mother of a 7-year-old after her story gets noticed again. How she gets back on her feet as the renewed player forms the rest of the story.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kangana Ranaut]] as Jaya Nigam\n*[[Jassi Gill]] as Prashant Sachdeva, Jaya's husband\n*[[Richa Chadda]] as Meenal \"Meenu\" Singh, Jaya's friend and former teammate\n*[[Neena Gupta]] as Rachna Nigam, Jaya's mother\n*[[Yagya Bhasin]] as Aditya \"Adi\" Sachdeva, Jaya's and Prashant's son\n*[[Megha Burman]] as Nisha Das, Jaya's present teammate\n*[[Rajesh Tailang]] as National Coach\n*[[Smita Tambe]] as india captain\n\n==Production==\n=== Development ===\n''Panga'' was announced on 21 August 2018 with [[Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari]] sharing an emotional Instagram video montage of herself, [[Kangana Ranaut]], [[Jassi Gill]], [[Neena Gupta]] and their families, indicating that when your kin stands behind you, no one in the world can take \u2018panga\u2019 with you.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmua0nxnj43/|title=My existing reality is a reflection of my dear ones' belief in me.

My family has been my pillar of strength and have always stood by me through thick and thin. I could really relate to the emotions of the film. Plus, Ashwiny is known for her slice-of-life films and I loved her recent work in Bareilly Ki Barfi. Panga is even more special for me as, for the first time, I will be playing the role of a National-level Kabaddi player. That's going to be challenging for sure!

Adi. Currently living in Bhopal after Prashant's transfer to the city, she is propelled both by the arrival of her former teammate Meenu and a push from Adi, who learns of her achievements through Prashant, to return to the sport despite facing challenges of physical fitness and newer, more experienced players. Initially unable to deal with the pressures of a hectic job and the exercise routines that Adi's enthusiasm pushes her through, she finally regains composure and, with support from Prashant and Adi, goes on to mark her comeback to the sport as a mother of a 7-year-old after her story gets noticed again.

Evelyn is an extreme [[environmentalist]] working for a blog company that promotes \"going green\", while Max works a dead-end job at the local horror memorabilia shop. Max often finds himself trapped trying to do whatever he can to keep Evelyn happy, including changing his diet and selling his old car. In addition to this, Max dreams of opening up a horror memorabilia shop of his own, much to Evelyn's dismay. One day at the shop, Max unloads the latest shipments and finds a [[Satan]] [[Genie]], an object that claims it can grant anyone's wants or desires. Believing it to just be another silly item for the shop, Max places it on the shelf in the storage room and dismisses it.\n\nLater that night, he and Evelyn have sex in the shop and make a promise to each other that they'll be together forever. Shortly thereafter, Max has Evelyn move in with him. Max and Evelyn initially decide to celebrate this new step in their relationship by grabbing a bite to eat. Wanting Evelyn to try something he enjoys for a change, Max suggests they go to a horror themed [[Ice cream parlor|ice cream shop]] run by Olivia ([[Alexandra Daddario]]). Evelyn is immediately unkind to Olivia, believing her and Max were flirting with each other. As Max pleads his case to her, Evelyn tearfully admits that she doesn't want to lose him and that he's the only thing in her life that has made her happy since her mother's death.\n\nAll seems to be great until Max comes back home to discover that Evelyn has redecorated their apartment to what she finds aesthetically pleasing and has put away all of Max's collectables and posters, ruining their price values. This leads to an argument where Max states that he and Evelyn should be making decisions together instead of her taking the reins on every little thing. Feeling that Evelyn's overbearing nature will lead him to be unhappy for the duration of their relationship, Max plans to break up with her but is too scared to do so. Max turns to his slacker half-brother Travis ([[Oliver Cooper]]) for advice. Travis suggests that Max break up with Evelyn in a public place so he can make a quick getaway and have everyone present see her for the control freak she truly is. However, the plan backfires when Evelyn accidentally gets hit by a bus on her way to the park. She dies in the middle of the road while in the arms of a tearful Max.\n\nA couple weeks go by and Max has shut himself off emotionally, feeling responsible for Evelyn's death. Travis swings by his place and, after seeing the funk he's in, encourages him to get back out and move on. Max eventually runs into Olivia again and starts to hit it off with her. As the night progresses, Max and Olivia learn that they both share the same fascination for horror. But when Max and Olivia visit the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]], Evelyn is shown to have risen up from the dead and has dug herself out of the ground. After Olivia walks Max back home, he's quickly greeted by an undead Evelyn at the door. Evelyn is overjoyed and believes hers and Max's love is being given a second chance and thinks they're still dating. Frightened, Max realizes that the Satan Genie from the shop made their wish of being \"together forever\" has brought Evelyn back from the dead. Still wanting to pursue Olivia, Max actively attempts to hide Evelyn from her. He's also left to ponder how exactly he's going to officially dump Evelyn. Max presumes that the answer to his problems lie with the Satan Genie, only to have it shatter on the ground when he loses his footing. For his backup plan, Max then researches the occult/spell books the shop has available in the hopes of finding something that will send Evelyn back to her grave. He tries these techniques, but to no avail; as they have no effect on Evelyn whatsoever.\n\nTravis stumbles upon Max with a drunken Evelyn, and is reluctant to help him. He soon has a change of heart and tells Max that the only true way he can get rid of Evelyn is to decapitate her with a machete. Max tries to accomplish this but backs out at the last minute. The day before Halloween, Olivia drops by the shop to visit Max. It's later interrupted by a phone call from Evelyn. Olivia, who still doesn't know that Evelyn's a zombie, thinks Max hasn't gotten over her yet, but offers him an invitation to a screening of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' at the cemetery. Travis steps up to the plate and offers to kill Evelyn so Max can meet Olivia at the movie. Travis shows up at the apartment under the guise of searching for an old DVD Max never returned and intentionally prolongs his stay, annoying Evelyn. She then develops a sudden craving for brains and ends up eating Travis. Meanwhile, Max and Olivia are enjoying each other's company and end up having sex in the back of Olivia's car.\n\nUpon Max's return, he discovers Travis's corpse in the living room. Knowing that Evelyn is now determined to kill anyone who gets in her way, Max tricks her into drawing a hot bubble bath for themselves in order to barricade the bathroom door and trap her inside. He rushes out of the apartment to get the police but leaves his cell phone behind by mistake. Evelyn wastes no time breaking free and escapes. She then kidnaps Olivia after reading the texts between her and Max. Having had no luck with the police, Max hears through one of the [[Scanner (radio)|police scanners]] about someone knocking over a malt shop and realizes Olivia's in trouble. Back at the apartment, Max sees Olivia tied up and Evelyn threatens to kill her. A battle ensues between Max, Evelyn, and Olivia, ending with Travis (now revealed to be a zombie himself) fatally stabbing Evelyn through the chest with the machete. With Evelyn finally gone, Max and Olivia take her body back to the cemetery and bury her.\n\nOne year later, Max and Olivia's relationship is still going strong. Max has long since quit his job, became business partners with Olivia, having joined his horror memorabilia store and her ice cream shop as an enterprise of their own and is now truly happy. Max then surprises Olivia with an engagement ring, which she gladly accepts. And Travis, still in his zombie form, is shown sign-spinning outside the shop.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Max\n* [[Ashley Greene]] as Evelyn\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Olivia\n* [[Oliver Cooper]] as Travis\n* [[Archie Hahn (actor)|Archie Hahn]] as Chuck\n* [[Mark Alan]] as Goth Bartender \n* [[Gabrielle Christian]] as Coco \n* [[Mindy Robinson]] as  Mindy\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Grumpy Cop\n\n==Production==\n''Burying the Ex'' was originally produced as a 15-minute short in 2008, written and directed by Alan Trezza. It starred [[Danielle Harris]] as Olivia and [[Mircea Monroe]] as Evelyn, with the male lead (then named Zak) played by [[John Francis Daley]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1262121/ Burying the Ex (2008) - IMDb]</ref> Trezza later expanded the short into a feature film script. According to an interview with director Joe Dante in 2014:\n<blockquote>I met Alan several years ago, got the script for the feature, which was not substantially different from the one we shot. I thought it was funny and different. Cut forward five years. Unexpectedly, after another project fell through, money appeared so we could make the movie, but we had to shoot cheaply and quickly. We shot in 20 days and it was a lot of fun, a hectic shoot, but there was a lot to do. We were clever about our locations and shooting all within the same area of town...

Evelyn is an extreme [[environmentalist]] working for a blog company that promotes \"going green\", while Max works a dead-end job at the local horror memorabilia shop. Max often finds himself trapped trying to do whatever he can to keep Evelyn happy, including changing his diet and selling his old car. In addition to this, Max dreams of opening up a horror memorabilia shop of his own, much to Evelyn's dismay. One day at the shop, Max unloads the latest shipments and finds a [[Satan]] [[Genie]], an object that claims it can grant anyone's wants or desires. Believing it to just be another silly item for the shop, Max places it on the shelf in the storage room and dismisses it.\n\nLater that night, he and Evelyn have sex in the shop and make a promise to each other that they'll be together forever. Shortly thereafter, Max has Evelyn move in with him. Max and Evelyn initially decide to celebrate this new step in their relationship by grabbing a bite to eat. Wanting Evelyn to try something he enjoys for a change, Max suggests they go to a horror themed [[Ice cream parlor|ice cream shop]] run by Olivia ([[Alexandra Daddario]]). Evelyn is immediately unkind to Olivia, believing her and Max were flirting with each other. As Max pleads his case to her, Evelyn tearfully admits that she doesn't want to lose him and that he's the only thing in her life that has made her happy since her mother's death.\n\nAll seems to be great until Max comes back home to discover that Evelyn has redecorated their apartment to what she finds aesthetically pleasing and has put away all of Max's collectables and posters, ruining their price values. This leads to an argument where Max states that he and Evelyn should be making decisions together instead of her taking the reins on every little thing. Feeling that Evelyn's overbearing nature will lead him to be unhappy for the duration of their relationship, Max plans to break up with her but is too scared to do so. Max turns to his slacker half-brother Travis ([[Oliver Cooper]]) for advice. Travis suggests that Max break up with Evelyn in a public place so he can make a quick getaway and have everyone present see her for the control freak she truly is. However, the plan backfires when Evelyn accidentally gets hit by a bus on her way to the park. She dies in the middle of the road while in the arms of a tearful Max.\n\nA couple weeks go by and Max has shut himself off emotionally, feeling responsible for Evelyn's death. Travis swings by his place and, after seeing the funk he's in, encourages him to get back out and move on. Max eventually runs into Olivia again and starts to hit it off with her. As the night progresses, Max and Olivia learn that they both share the same fascination for horror. But when Max and Olivia visit the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]], Evelyn is shown to have risen up from the dead and has dug herself out of the ground. After Olivia walks Max back home, he's quickly greeted by an undead Evelyn at the door. Evelyn is overjoyed and believes hers and Max's love is being given a second chance and thinks they're still dating. Frightened, Max realizes that the Satan Genie from the shop made their wish of being \"together forever\" has brought Evelyn back from the dead. Still wanting to pursue Olivia, Max actively attempts to hide Evelyn from her. He's also left to ponder how exactly he's going to officially dump Evelyn. Max presumes that the answer to his problems lie with the Satan Genie, only to have it shatter on the ground when he loses his footing. For his backup plan, Max then researches the occult/spell books the shop has available in the hopes of finding something that will send Evelyn back to her grave. He tries these techniques, but to no avail; as they have no effect on Evelyn whatsoever.\n\nTravis stumbles upon Max with a drunken Evelyn, and is reluctant to help him. He soon has a change of heart and tells Max that the only true way he can get rid of Evelyn is to decapitate her with a machete. Max tries to accomplish this but backs out at the last minute. The day before Halloween, Olivia drops by the shop to visit Max. It's later interrupted by a phone call from Evelyn. Olivia, who still doesn't know that Evelyn's a zombie, thinks Max hasn't gotten over her yet, but offers him an invitation to a screening of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' at the cemetery. Travis steps up to the plate and offers to kill Evelyn so Max can meet Olivia at the movie. Travis shows up at the apartment under the guise of searching for an old DVD Max never returned and intentionally prolongs his stay, annoying Evelyn. She then develops a sudden craving for brains and ends up eating Travis. Meanwhile, Max and Olivia are enjoying each other's company and end up having sex in the back of Olivia's car.\n\nUpon Max's return, he discovers Travis's corpse in the living room. Knowing that Evelyn is now determined to kill anyone who gets in her way, Max tricks her into drawing a hot bubble bath for themselves in order to barricade the bathroom door and trap her inside. He rushes out of the apartment to get the police but leaves his cell phone behind by mistake. Evelyn wastes no time breaking free and escapes. She then kidnaps Olivia after reading the texts between her and Max. Having had no luck with the police, Max hears through one of the [[Scanner (radio)|police scanners]] about someone knocking over a malt shop and realizes Olivia's in trouble. Back at the apartment, Max sees Olivia tied up and Evelyn threatens to kill her. A battle ensues between Max, Evelyn, and Olivia, ending with Travis (now revealed to be a zombie himself) fatally stabbing Evelyn through the chest with the machete. With Evelyn finally gone, Max and Olivia take her body back to the cemetery and bury her.\n\nOne year later, Max and Olivia's relationship is still going strong. Max has long since quit his job, became business partners with Olivia, having joined his horror memorabilia store and her ice cream shop as an enterprise of their own and is now truly happy. Max then surprises Olivia with an engagement ring, which she gladly accepts. And Travis, still in his zombie form, is shown sign-spinning outside the shop.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Max\n* [[Ashley Greene]] as Evelyn\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Olivia\n* [[Oliver Cooper]] as Travis\n* [[Archie Hahn (actor)|Archie Hahn]] as Chuck\n* [[Mark Alan]] as Goth Bartender \n* [[Gabrielle Christian]] as Coco \n* [[Mindy Robinson]] as  Mindy\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Grumpy Cop\n\n==Production==\n''Burying the Ex'' was originally produced as a 15-minute short in 2008, written and directed by Alan Trezza. It starred [[Danielle Harris]] as Olivia and [[Mircea Monroe]] as Evelyn, with the male lead (then named Zak) played by [[John Francis Daley]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1262121/ Burying the Ex (2008) - IMDb]</ref> Trezza later expanded the short into a feature film script. According to an interview with director Joe Dante in 2014:\n<blockquote>I met Alan several years ago, got the script for the feature, which was not substantially different from the one we shot. I thought it was funny and different. Cut forward five years. Unexpectedly, after another project fell through, money appeared so we could make the movie, but we had to shoot cheaply and quickly. We shot in 20 days and it was a lot of fun, a hectic shoot, but there was a lot to do. We were clever about our locations and shooting all within the same area of town... The four leads are really fun and creative and brought a lot to the table.<ref name=\"joe\"/></blockquote>\nPrincipal photography began November 17, 2013 and ended December 19, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pro-labs.imdb.com/title/tt3339674/details |title=IMDbPro |publisher=Pro-labs.imdb.com |date= |accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Mary Woronov]] played the owner of a store called Bloody Mary's.
