San Sebasti\u00e1n's three beaches, Concha, Ondarreta, and Zurriola, make it a popular resort. The town is surrounded by easily accessible hilly areas: [[Urgull]] (adjacent to the old part of the city), [[Mount Ulia]] (extending east to [[Pasaia]]), Mount [[Adarra]] (south of the city) and Igeldo (overlooking Concha Bay from the west).\n\nThe city sits at the mouth of the River [[Urumea]], Donostia was built to a large extent on the river's wetlands over the last two centuries. In fact, the city centre and the districts of [[Donostia#Amara Berri|Amara Berri]] and Riberas de Loiola lie on the former bed of the river, which was diverted to its current canalized course in the first half of the 20th century.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\">{{cite book |last1=Sada |first1=Javier Maria |last2=Sada |first2=Asier|title= San Sebasti\u00e1n: La Historia de la Ciudad a trav\u00e9s de sus Calles, Plazas, Barrios, Montes y Caminos | edition= 3rd | year= 2007 |publisher= Txertoa |location= Andoain |isbn= 978-84-7148-399-7|page=92}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfb'') with warm summers and cool winters.

The unearthed remains, such as carved stone used as knives to cut animal skin, date from 24,000 to 22,000 BC. The open-air findings of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] have revealed that the settlers were hunters and ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', besides pointing to a much colder climate at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.diariovasco.com/20070323/sansebastian/hallan-centenar-objetos-hace_200703230910.html | title = Hallan un centenar de objetos de hace 22.000 a\u00f1os en el parque de Ametzagaina | publisher = El Diario Vasco| date = 23 March 2007 }} Article in Spanish</ref>\n\n===Antiquity===\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n is thought to have been in the territory of the [[Varduli]] in Roman times. {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the current city lay the Basque Roman town of [[Oiasso]] ([[Irun]]), which was for a long time wrongly identified with San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAfter a long period of silence in evidence, in 1014 the monastery of St. Sebasti\u00e1n with its apple orchards (for cider), located in the term of [[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]], is donated to the Abbey of [[Monastery of Leyre|Leire]] by [[Sancho III of Navarre|Sancho III of Pamplona]]. By 1181, the city is chartered (given [[fuero]]) by king [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI of Pamplona]] on the site of Izurum, having jurisdiction over all the territory between the rivers [[Oria River|Oria]] and [[Bidasoa]].\n\nIn 1200, the city was conquered by [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], whose king [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]], confirmed its charter (fuero), but the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] was deprived of its main direct access out to the sea. Perhaps as soon as 1204 (or earlier), the city nucleus at the foot of [[Urgull]] started to be populated with [[Gascon language|Gascon]]-speaking colonizers from [[Bayonne]] and beyond, who left an important imprint in the city's identity in the centuries to come.<ref name=\"LOS GASCONES EN GUIP\u00daZCOA\">{{cite web | url = http://atzoatzokoa.gipuzkoakultura.net/c78f6/ | title=LOS GASCONES EN GUIP\u00daZCOA|publisher = IMPRENTA DE LA DIPUTACION DE GUIPUZCOA|language=Spanish|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1265, the use of the city as a seaport is granted to Navarre as part of a wedding pact. The large quantity of Gascons inhabiting the town favoured the development of trade with other European ports and [[Gascony]]. The city steered clear of the destructive [[War of the Bands]] in Gipuzkoa, the only town in doing so in that territory. In fact, the town only joined [[Gipuzkoa]] in 1459 after the war came to an end.<ref name=\"LOS GASCONES EN GUIP\u00daZCOA\"/> Up to the 16th century, Donostia remained mostly out of wars, but by the beginning of the 15th century, a line of walls of simple construction is attested encircling the town. The last chapter of the town in the Middle Ages was brought about by a fire that devastated Donostia in 1489. After burning to the ground, the town began a new renaissance by building up mainly with stone instead of bare timber.\n\n===Modern Age===\nThe advent of the Modern Age brought a period of instability and war for the city. New state boundaries were drawn that left Donostia located close to [[Spain]]'s border with France; thicker and more sophisticated walls were erected, with the town becoming involved in the 1521\u20131524 military campaigns that formed part of the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|Spanish conquest of Navarre]]. The town provided critical naval help to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] during the siege of [[Hondarribia]], which earned the town the titles \"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\", recorded on its coat of arms. The town also aided the monarch by sending a party to the [[Battle of Noain]] and providing help to quash the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] in 1521.\n\nAfter these events, Gascons, who had played a leading role in the political and economic life of the town since its foundation, began to be excluded from influential public positions by means of a string of regional sentences upheld by royal decision (regional diets of [[Zestoa]] 1527, [[Hondarribia]] 1557, [[Bergara]] 1558, [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] 1604 and [[Deba, Gipuzkoa|Deba]] 1662).<ref name=\"LOS GASCONES EN GUIP\u00daZCOA\"/> Meanwhile, the climate of war and disease left the town in a poor condition that drove many fishermen and traders to take to the sea as corsairs as a way of getting a living, most of the times under the auspices of the king [[Philip II of Spain]], who benefited from the disruption caused to and wealth obtained from the French and Dutch trade ships.\n\nIn 1660, the city was used as the royal headquarters during the marriage of [[Maria Theresa of Spain|the Infanta]] to [[Louis XIV]] at [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] nearby. After a relatively peaceful 17th century, the town was besieged and taken over by the troops of the French Duke of Berwick up to 1721. However, San Sebasti\u00e1n was not spared by shelling in the French assault and many urban structures were reconstructed, e.g. a new opening in the middle of the town, the Plaza Berria (that was to become the current Konstituzio Plaza).\n\nIn 1728, the [[Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]] was founded and boosted commerce with the [[Spanish Empire|Americas]]. Thanks to the profit the company generated, the town underwent some urban reforms and improvements and the new Santa Maria Church was erected by subscription. This period of wealth and development was to last up to the end of 18th century.<ref name=\"Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n\"/>{{rp|56/58}}\n\nIn 1808, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] forces captured San Sebasti\u00e1n in the [[Peninsular War]]. In 1813, after a siege of various weeks, on 28 August, during the night, a landing party from a British [[Royal Navy]] squadron captured [[Santa Clara Island (San Sebastian)|Santa Clara Island]], in the bay. Situated on a narrow promontory that jutted out into the sea between the waters of the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the broad estuary of the [[Urumea]] River, the town was hard to get at and well fortified \u2013 \"it was the strongest fortification I ever saw, [[Gibraltar]] excepted\", wrote [[William Dent]].<ref>L. Woodford (ed.), ''A Young Surgeon in Wellingtons Army: the Letters of William Dent'' (Old Woking, 1976), p. 39.</ref> Three days later, on 31 August, British and Portuguese troops [[Siege of San Sebastian|besieging San Sebasti\u00e1n]] assaulted the town. The relieving troops ransacked and burnt the city to the ground. Only the street at the foot of the hill (now called 31 August Street) remained.\n\n===Contemporary history===\nAfter these destructive events, reconstruction of the city was commenced in the original location with a slightly altered layout. A modern octagonal layout as drafted by the architect P.M. Ugartemendia was turned down and eventually M. Gogorza's blueprint was approved, then supervised and implemented by the Ugartemendia. This area, the old town, has a neoclassical, austere and systematic style of architectural construction. Constitution Square was built in 1817 and the town hall (currently a library) between 1828 and 1832.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|100}} Housing in the old town was built gradually alongside the rest of the area.\n\nThe liberal and bourgeois San Sebasti\u00e1n became the capital of Gipuzkoa (instead of [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]]) until 1823, when absolutists attacked the town again (only 200 inhabitants remained in the town when the offensive troops entered). It was designated again as the capital in 1854.<ref name=\"Berruso\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ingeba.org/liburua/donostia/46contem/46contem.htm |title=San Sebasti\u00e1n en los Siglos XIX y XX |last1=Berruso Bar\u00e9s |first1=Pedro |website=Geograf\u00eda e historia de Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n|publisher=Ingeba |accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref> In 1833, British volunteers under Sir [[George de Lacy Evans]] defended the town against [[Carlist]] attack, and those who died were buried in the English Cemetery on Mount [[Urgull]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the local government was still ruled by the principle of nobility, while inhabitants of foreign origin or descent had always been ubiquitous in the town, especially among the trading community. Although San Sebasti\u00e1n benefited greatly from the charts system established in the [[Southern Basque Country]] (''[[fuero|foruak]]'', with borders in the Ebro river and no duties for overseas goods), the town was at odds with the more traditional [[Gipuzkoa]], even requesting secession from the province and annexation to [[Navarre]] in 1841.\n\nIn 1863, the [[defensive walls]] of the town were demolished (their remains are visible in the underground car park on the Boulevard) and an expansion of the town began in an attempt to move on from its previous military function.<ref name=\"Pi\u00f1eiro\"/> Jose Goicoa and Ramon Cortazar were appointed to oversee the work. They modelled the new city according to an orthogonal shape in a neoclassical Parisian style, and Goicoa designed several elegant buildings, such as the [[Miramar Palace]] and La Concha Promenade.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|145\u2013146}} The city was chosen by the Spanish monarchy as a summer retreat following the French example of nearby [[Biarritz]], and Spanish nobility and the diplomatic corps opened residences in the town. As the \"wave baths\" at La Concha were in conflict with nearby shipbuilding activity, the shipyards relocated to [[Pasaia]], a nearby bay that had formerly been part of San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n\nHowever, in 1875, war came to the town again, and in 1876 shelling over the city by [[Carlist Wars|Carlists]] claimed the life of acclaimed the poet [[Bilintx]].<ref name=\"Berruso\"/> From 1885, King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]]'s widow [[Maria Christina of Austria|Maria Cristina]] spent every summer in Donostia along with her retinue, staying at the Miramar Palace. In 1887, a casino was built, which eventually became the current city hall, and some time later the Regional Government building was completed in Plaza Gipuzkoa following Jose Goicoa's design. Cultural life thrived in this period, giving rise to various events still popular in the city, such as the Caldereros or the [[Tamborrada]], and journalistic and literary works in both Spanish and Basque.\n\nAfter much debate in the city over whether to pursue an economy based on tourism or manufacturing, Donostia developed into a fully-fledged seaside resort, but some industry developed in the district of Antiguo and on the outskirts of the city. Following the outbreak of World War I, San Sebasti\u00e1n became a destination for renowned international figures of culture and politics,<ref name=\"Berruso\"/> including [[Mata Hari]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Maurice Ravel]], and [[Conde de Romanones|Romanones]].\n\nSan Sebastian was one of earliest  towns hit by the [[Spanish flu|1918 Influenza epidemic]], dealing with a first wave outbreak in February of that year. Officials feared for the city's reputation and attempted to keep the disease's spread quiet, to no avail, and the outbreak soon spread throughout Spain.<ref>[[Gina Kolata|''Kolata, Gina'']]. \"Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It\" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2000), p. 9.</ref>\n\nVarious rationalist architectural works, typically white or light-coloured, were built in the 1920s and 1930s, such as La Equitativa, Nautico, and Easo. In 1924\u20131926, canalisation work was carried out on the Urumea river at the southern edge of the city. However, after the city's Belle Epoque in the European wartime, repression under [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship was not favourable for the city. In 1924, gambling was prohibited by the authoritarian regime, causing existential problems for the Grand Casino and the Kursaal (1921).\n\nIn 1930, Spanish republican forces signed up to the [[Pact of San Sebasti\u00e1n]], leading to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Unrest and repression did not stop with the new political regime, and large-scale industrial action was called several times by the growing anarchist, communist and socialist unions. The [[Spanish Civil War, 1936|1936 military coup]] was initially defeated by the resistance, led by the [[Basque nationalism|Basque Nationalists]],<ref>[[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] (2001). ''Spanish Civil War''.</ref>{{rp|226}} anarchists and communists, but later that same year the province fell to Spanish Nationalist forces during [[War in the North|the Northern Campaign]].<ref>Hugh Thomas (2001).</ref>{{rp|397}} The occupation proved disastrous for the city's residents. Between 1936 and 1943, 485 people were executed as a result of [[show trials]] by the Spanish Nationalists ([[Requet\u00e9]]s and [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS|Falangist]]s).<ref>{{cite book | author=Paul Preston | title=The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain. | publisher= HarperCollins | location= London, UK | isbn=978-0-00-638695-7 | year=2013}}</ref>{{rp|431}} It has been estimated that extrajudicial executions (''paseos'') by the occupying military forces accounted for over 600 murders in the area during the first months of occupation.<ref>Paul Preston (2013).</ref>{{rp|431}} [[Evacuation of children in the Spanish Civil War|Many children were evacuated]] to temporary safety in Bilbao, with the city's population falling by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nIn the aftermath of war, the city was stricken by poverty, famine and repression, coupled with a thriving smuggling trade. Many republican detainees were held at the beach-side Ondarreta Prison in grim and humid conditions, until the building was demolished in 1948. However, industrial development paved the way for urban expansion in the Egia and Amara Berri districts, on the marshes and riverbed of the Urumea, at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s.\n\nIn 1943, the first [[Ikastola|Basque language schools]] were established by Elvira Zipitria, who taught in Basque from her home in the Old Town. In 1947, the Grand Casino was converted into the City Hall.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|95}} In 1953, city businessmen organised the first [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]] to stimulate the economic life and profile of the city.\n\nMass immigration from other parts of Spain, spurred by growing industrial production, greatly increased the population, initiating rapid and chaotic urban development on the outskirts of the city (Altza, Intxaurrondo, Herrera, Bidebieta), yet social, cultural and political injustices followed, setting the scene for popular dissatisfaction. A general climate of protest and street demonstrations followed, driven by Basque nationalists (especially the armed separatist organisation ETA) and various underground unions, triggering the first state of emergency in Gipuzkoa in 1968. Several more were imposed by the Francoist authorities in the period immediately preceding Franco's death in 1975.\n\nAmid the fragile economic situation and real estate speculation, the Kursaal and the Chofre bullring in Gros were demolished in 1973.<ref name=\"Berruso\"/> From 1975\u201377, sculptor [[Eduardo Chillida]] and architect [[Luis Pe\u00f1a Ganchegui]]'s landmark [[The Comb of the Wind]]s was built at the western tip of the bay. The 1970s to the mid-1980s were years of general urban and social decay marked by social and political unrest and violence.\n\nIn 1979, the first democratic municipal elections were held, won by the [[Basque Nationalist Party]], who held office along with splinter party [[Eusko Alkartasuna]] (Basque Solidarity) until 1991. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]'s [[Odon Elorza]] took over as mayor from 1991 until 2011, when he was defeated unexpectedly by Juan Carlos Izagirre ([[Bildu]]) in elections.<ref name=\"Berruso\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s, a major makeover of the city centre began, aimed at enhancing and revamping the neoclassical and modernist side of San Sebasti\u00e1n's architecture. Other regeneration projects included the reshaping and enlargement of Zurriola beach and promenade, the opening of the [[Kursaal Palace]] cubes (1999),<ref name=\"Berruso\"/> the new university campus and technology facilities in Ibaeta, the creation of a wide network of cycle lanes, underground car-parks and significant improvements to public transport. Districts of cutting-edge design have been erected, such as [[Donostia#Ibaeta|Ibaeta]] and [[Donostia#Riberas de Loiola|Riberas de Loiola]], while some other major public works are still pending confirmation of funding and approval.\n\n==Districts of the city==\n[[File:Monumentos de San Sebasti\u00e1n.jpg|thumbnail|Monuments of the city]]\n[[File:Plaza Constituci\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|right|Fa\u00e7ade of the Constitution Square (Plaza) in San Sebasti\u00e1n]]\nAs a result of Donostia's sprawling in all directions, first into the flatlands shaped by the river [[Urumea]] and later up the hills, new districts arose after the walls of the city were demolished in 1863. The first expansion of the old town stretched out to the river's mouth, on the old quarter called Zurriola (a name later given by Council decision to the sand area and the avenue across the river).<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|13, 322}}\n\nThe orthogonal layout nowadays making up the city centre (the Cortazar development) was built up to 1914 (first phase finished) much in tune with a Parisian [[Baron Haussmann#Haussmann's plan for Paris|Haussmannian]] style. The arcades of the Buen Pastor square were fashioned after the ones of the [[Rue de Rivoli]], with the Maria Cristina Bridge being inspired by the [[Pont Alexandre III]] that spans the Seine.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|257}} The Estaci\u00f3n del Norte train station standing right across the bridge was inaugurated in 1864 just after the arrival of the railway to San Sebasti\u00e1n, with its metallic roof being designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]].

The Old Town is divided in two parishes relating to the Santa Maria and San Vicente churches, the inhabitants belonging to the former being dubbed traditionally ''joxemaritarrak'', while those attached to the latter are referred to as ''koxkeroak''. Historically, the koxkeroak up to the early 18th century were largely [[Gascon language|Gascon]] speaking inhabitants. Especially after the end of Franco's dictatorship, scores of bars sprang up all over the Old Part which are very popular with the youth and the tourists, although not as much with the local residents. Most current buildings trace back to the 19th century, erected thanks to the concerted effort and determination of the town dwellers [[Siege of San Sebasti\u00e1n#Ransacking and burning of San Sebastian|after the 1813 destruction]] of the town by the allied Anglo-Portuguese troops.<ref name=\"Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n\">{{cite book |last1=Sadaba|first1=Javier|last2=Sadaba|first2=Javier|date=1995|title=Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n|location=San Sebasti\u00e1n|publisher=Editorial Txertoa|isbn= 84-7148-318-1}} Book in Spanish</ref>{{rp|73\u201375, 81\u201389}}\n\nThere is a small fishing and recreation port, with two-floor houses lined under the front-wall of the mount [[Urgull]].

The core of this district is the ''Easo plaza'', with the railway terminal of Euskotren closing the square at its south.\n\n===Amara Berri===\nThis city expansion to the south came about as of the 1940s, after the works to canalize the river were achieved.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|30\u201331, 92}} Nowadays the name Amara usually applies to this sector, the newer district having overshadowed the original nucleus both in size and population. The district harbours the main road entrance to the city. Facilities of many state run agencies were established here and presently Amara's buildings house many business offices. The district revolves around the axis of ''Avenida Sancho el Sabio'' and ''Avenida de Madrid''.\n\n===Gros===\nThe district is built on the sandy terrain across the river. The ''Gros'' or ''Zurriola'' surf beach by the river's mouth bears witness to that type of soil. In the 19th century, shanties and workshops started to dot the area, Tomas Gros being one of its main proprietors as well as providing the name for this part of the city.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|148\u2013149}} The area held the former monumental bullring ''Chofre'' demolished in 1973, on a site currently occupied by a housing estate.

At the beginning of the 20th century, a patch of land by the railway started to be used as a football pitch, eventually turning into the official stadium of the local team ''Real Sociedad'' before it was transferred in the 1990s to Anoeta,<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|111}} south of Amara Berri (nowadays the site harbours houses). The former tobacco factory building [[Tabakalera]], which has been converted into a Contemporary Culture Centre, conjures up the former industrial past of the area,.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|111}} Right opposite to this building lies the Cristina Enea park, a public compound with a botanic vocation. Egia holds the city cemetery, Polloe, at the north-east fringes of the district, stretching out to South Intxaurrondo.\n\n===Intxaurrondo===\nThis part (meaning 'walnut tree' in Basque) is a large district to the east of the city. The original nucleus lies between the railway and the Ategorrieta Avenue, where still today the farmhouse Intxaurrondo Zar, declared \"National Monument\", is situated since the mid-17th century. The railway cuts across the district, the southern side being the fruit of the heavy development undergone in the area during the immigration years of the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, further housing estates have been built up more recently souther beyond the N-1 E-5 E-80 E-70 ring road (South Intxaurrondo). The police force [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] runs controversial barracks there (works for new housing are underway).\n\n===Altza===\nAltza ([[Basque language|Basque]] for alder tree) is the easternmost district of San Sebasti\u00e1n along with Bidebieta and Trintxerpe. It was but a quaint village comprising scattered farmhouses and a small nucleus a century ago (2,683 inhabitants in 1910), yet on the arrival of thousands of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s a rapid and chaotic housing and building activity ensued, resulting in a maze of grey landscape of skyscrapers and 32,531 inhabitants crammed in them (data of 1970), the figure is 20,000 {{As of|2013|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.donostia.org/info/ciudadano/part_barrios.nsf/vowebContenidosId/NT0000097E?OpenDocument&idioma=eus&id=a608306614310&doc=D|title=Auzoak eta Herriak: Altza |website=Donostiako Udala \u2013 Ayuntamiento de San Sebasti\u00e1n |accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Ibaeta===\nIbaeta stands on the former location for various factories (e.g., Cervezas El Le\u00f3n) of San Sebasti\u00e1n, with the buildings of the old industrial estate being demolished in the late 20th century.

A stream called Konporta flows down along the eastern side of the area, but it was canalized under the ground almost all along to its mouth on the bay pushed by urban building pressure.\n\n===Loiola===\nIt lies by the Urumea at the south-east end of the city. It comprises a small patch of detached houses (Ciudad Jard\u00edn) and a core area of 6-odd floor buildings. The district has recently gone through a major makeover, with works finishing in 2008. The road axis coming from important industrial areas (Astigarraga-[[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]]) crosses the district heading downtown. A military base stands across the river,<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\"/> home to an uprising in 1936. Attempts by the city council to close it have been unsuccessful so far.\n\n===Riberas de Loiola===\nNew modern district erected in the 2000s next to the city's inner bypass and south road entrance to Donostia. A pedestrian bridge spans the Urumea river onto the Cristina Enea Park.\n\n===Martutene===\nThe [[Martutene]] district bordering to the south on the town of [[Astigarraga]] comes next to Loiola in the south direction. This part of the city features an industrial area, a football pitch for lower leagues, a disused vocational training building and enclosure as well as a prison, much in decay and due to be transferred soon to a new location, probably in the municipality's exclave of Zubieta, while this option is coming in for much opposition.\n\n===Ulia===\n[[File:El_Deposito_-_Lumina_Nocte.jpg|thumb|Former tank supplying the city with sanitary water in Ulia]]\nThis part stands on the east side of the city at the foot of the [[Mount Ulia]] Park, on the left hand side of the road heading from [[Donostia]] to [[Pasaia]] and [[Irun]]. It consists of a residential area, besides holding a number of educational institutions, culture and sports centres built since 1980. The [[Park of Nurseries of Ulia]] sits at the base of the road leading to Mount Ulia, with its name deriving from its function as a nursery of plants for the public gardens of Donostia during all the 20th century and until 2008. It includes two ancient water-tanks, architectonic elements, and specific flora and fauna.\n\n===Zubieta===\nThe exclave Zubieta (meaning 'place of bridges') was a village up to recent years, with a number of houses, a [[Basque pelota|handball]] pitch (on account of its single wall as opposed to the regular two) and a church. Yet it has undergone a great urban development, which has rendered the location a built-up area with paved streets and due equipment.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Two contested projects are under way to build a solid-waste incinerator and a prison nearby. Historically, neighbours from Donostia held a meeting at a house in the former village in the wake of the [[Siege of San Sebastian#Burning of San Sebastian|1813 burning]], in order to decide the reconstruction of the town.\n\n==Culture and events==\n[[File:San Sebastian Festival Entrada.JPG|thumb|upright|San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, Red Carpet]]\n\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n shows a dynamic cultural scene, where grass-roots initiative based on different parts of the city and the concerted private and public synergy have paved the ground for a rich range of possibilities and events catering to the tastes of a wide and selected public alike. The city was selected as [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2016 (shared with [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Poland]]) with a basic motto, \"Waves of people's energy\", summarizing a clear message: people and movements of citizens are the real driving force behind transformations and changes in the world.\n\nEvents ranging from traditional city festivals to music, theatre or cinema take place all year round, while they specially thrive in summer. In the last week of July, [[San Sebastian Jazz Festival|San Sebasti\u00e1n's Jazz Festival]] (Jazzaldia), the longest, continuously running Jazz Festival in Europe is held. In different spots of the city gigs are staged, sometimes with free admission. The Musical Fortnight comes next extending for at least fifteen days well into August and featuring classical music concerts. In September, the [[San Sebastian International Film Festival|San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]] comes to the spotlight, an event with more than 50 years revolving around the venues of [[Kursaal Palace|Kursaal]] and the Victoria Eugenia Theatre. The city is also home to the [[San Telmo Museoa]], a major cultural institution with an ethnographic, artistic and civic vocation.\n\nSticking to the cinematic language but lacking its echo, Street Zinema is an international audiovisual festival exploring contemporary art and urban cultures. Other rising and popular events include the Horror and Fantasy Festival in October (21st edition in 2010) and the Surfilm Festibal, a cinema festival featuring surfing footage, especially shorts. During centuries, the city has been open to many influences that have left a trace, often mingling with the local customs and traditions and eventually resulting in festivals and new customs.\n\n===San Sebasti\u00e1n Day===\n{{Main|Tamborrada}}\n[[File:San Sebastian Tamborrada Infantil cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Tamborrada]], children's section]]\nEvery year on 20 January (the feast of [[Saint Sebastian]]), the people of San Sebasti\u00e1n celebrate a festival known as the \"Tamborrada\". At midnight, in the Konstituzio plaza in the \"Alde Zaharra/Parte Vieja\" (Old Part), the mayor raises the flag of San Sebasti\u00e1n (see in the infobox). For 24 hours, the entire city is awash with the sound of drums. The adults, dressed as cooks and soldiers, march around the city. They march all night with their cook hats and white aprons with the March of San Sebasti\u00e1n.<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ingeba.org/liburua/donostia/62ssfies/623ssfies.htm |title=La Tamborrada y otras Fiestas |last1=Saez Garcia |first1=Juan Antonio |website=Geograf\u00eda e historia de Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n|publisher=Ingeba |accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn this day a procession was held in the early 19th century from the Santa Maria Church in the Old Part to the San Sebasti\u00e1n Church in the district of [[Donostia#Antiguo|Antiguo]], while later limited on the grounds of weather conditions to the in-wall area. The event finished with a popular dancing accompanied on the military band's flutes and drums. In addition, every day a soldier parade took place to change the guards at the town's southern walls. Since the San Sebasti\u00e1n Day was the first festival heralding the upcoming Carnival, it's no surprise that some youths in Carnival mood followed them aping their martial manners and drumrolls, using for the purpose the buckets left at the fountains.<ref name=\"Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n\"/>{{rp|107}} In the period spanning the 1860s and 1880s the celebrations started to shape as we know them today with proper military style outfits and parades and the tunes fashioned by music composer Raimundo Sarriegui.<ref name=\"Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n\"/>{{rp|110}}\n\nAdults usually have dinner in ''[[txoko]]s'' (\"gourmet clubs\"), who traditionally admitted only males, but nowadays even the strictest ones allow women on the \"Noche de la Tamborrada\". They eat sophisticated meals cooked by themselves, mostly composed of seafood (traditionally [[elver]]s, now no longer served due to its exorbitant price) and drink the best wines. For \"Donostiarras\" this is the most celebrated festival of the year.\n\n===La Semana Grande/Aste Nagusia===\n[[File:Gigantes San Sebastian.jpg|thumb|The city [[Gigantes y cabezudos|giants and big-heads]] in the Semana Grande/Aste Nagusia]]\n\nA festival, ''La Semana Grande'' in Spanish and ''Aste Nagusia'' in Basque (\"The Big/Main Week\"), is held every year in mid-August. A major international fireworks competition is held during the festival, in which teams representing various countries and cities put on a fireworks display each night over the bay, with the winner of the contest announced at the end. The displays are sometimes accompanied by a full live orchestra performing on the boardwalk. Attendees often claim spots along the beach and bay hours in advance.<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\"/> The festival also includes a parade of marching bands, stilted entertainers, and big-heads costumes every afternoon.\n\n===Basque Week===\nThis decades long festivity taking place at the beginning of September features events related to Basque culture, such as performances of traditional improvising poets ([[bertsolari]]s), [[Basque pelota]] games, [[Harrijasotzaileak|stone lifting]] contests, [[Idi probak|oxen wagers]], dance exhibitions or the [[cider]] tasting festival. Yet the main highlight may be the [[estropadak|rowing boat competition]], where teams from different towns of the [[Bay of Biscay]] contend for the [[Kontxako Bandera|Flag of La Concha]]. Thousands of supporters coming from these coastal locations pour into the city's streets and promenades overlooking the bay to follow the event, especially on the Sunday of the final race. All day long the streets of the Old Part play host to droves of youths clad in their team colours who party there in a cheerful atmosphere.\n\n===Santa Ageda Bezpera===\nSaint Agatha's Eve is a traditional event taking place at the beginning of February or end of January in many spots of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. It holds a small but cherished slot in the city's run-up to the Carnival. Groups dressed up in Basque traditional farmer costume march across the neighbourhood singing and wielding a characteristic stick beaten on the ground to the rhythm of the traditional [[Saint Agatha]]'s tune.<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\"/> The singers ask for a small donation, which can be money, a drink or something to eat.\n\n===Caldereros===\n[[File:San Sebastian Puerto.jpg|thumb|View of the harbour]]\nThis is a local festival held on the first Saturday of February linked to the upcoming [[Carnival]], where different groups of people dressed in [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsy) tinkers attire take to the streets banging rhythmically a hammer or spoon against a pot or pan, and usually bar-hop while they sing the traditional songs for the occasion. They were just male voices some time ago, but women participate and sing currently too, and the main event is at the City Hall, where the city band plays marches while the crowds bang the pots and pans. The festival began in 1884.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Santo Tomas===\nThis popular festival takes place on 21 December, a date frequently shrouded in winter cold. From early in the morning, stalls are arranged across the city centre and people from all [[Gipuzkoa]] flock to the streets of the centre and the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n#Old Part|Old Part]], with crowds of people often dressed in traditional Basque \"farmer\" outfit turning out and filling the area. Traditional and typical produce is showcased and sold on the stalls, while the main drink is cider and the most popular snacks are txistorra (a type of thin, uncured chorizo) wrapped in talos (flatbread). A large pig is on display in the Konstituzio Plaza, which is raffled off during the festival.<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\"/>\n\n===Olentzero===\nAs in other Basque cities, towns and villages, on Christmas Eve the [[Olentzero]] and the accompanying carol singers usually dressed in Basque farmer costume take over the streets, especially in the city centre, asking for small donations in bars, shops and banks after singing their repertoire. Sometimes Olentzero choirs roam around the streets in later dates, on the 31st for example, and are often related to cultural, social or political associations and demands.\n\n==Economy and industry==\nThe main economic activities are commerce and tourism.  San Sebasti\u00e1n is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Spain.<ref name=\"ingeba1\"/>\n\nThe international technology organisation [[Ikusi]] is based in San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n\n==Transport==\nThe city is served by [[Euskotren Trena]], the main Basque rail operator. Euskotren Trena operates trains to [[Bilbao]] and other destinations, as well as the [[Metro Donostialdea]] and [[Cercan\u00edas San Sebasti\u00e1n]] within the San Sebasti\u00e1n metropolitan area. There are frequent trains via [[San Sebasti\u00e1n railway station]] from [[Madrid\u2013Hendaye railway|Madrid to Hendaye]] in France, which is connected to the French rail network. The city is also served by [[San Sebasti\u00e1n Airport]] in the nearby municipality of [[Hondarribia]]. San Sebasti\u00e1n Airport currently has no international destinations. Biarritz Airport in France is located about 50&nbsp;km from San Sebastian.\n\n==Gastronomy==\n[[File:San Sebastian Altstadt.jpg|thumb|[[Jam\u00f3n serrano]] and [[pintxo]]s in one of the numerous bars of the Old Quarter]]\nDonostia is renowned for its Basque cuisine.

The unearthed remains, such as carved stone used as knives to cut animal skin, date from 24,000 to 22,000 BC. The open-air findings of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] have revealed that the settlers were hunters and ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', besides pointing to a much colder climate at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.diariovasco.com/20070323/sansebastian/hallan-centenar-objetos-hace_200703230910.html | title = Hallan un centenar de objetos de hace 22.000 a\u00f1os en el parque de Ametzagaina | publisher = El Diario Vasco| date = 23 March 2007 }} Article in Spanish</ref>\n\n===Antiquity===\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n is thought to have been in the territory of the [[Varduli]] in Roman times. {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the current city lay the Basque Roman town of [[Oiasso]] ([[Irun]]), which was for a long time wrongly identified with San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAfter a long period of silence in evidence, in 1014 the monastery of St. Sebasti\u00e1n with its apple orchards (for cider), located in the term of [[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]], is donated to the Abbey of [[Monastery of Leyre|Leire]] by [[Sancho III of Navarre|Sancho III of Pamplona]]. By 1181, the city is chartered (given [[fuero]]) by king [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI of Pamplona]] on the site of Izurum, having jurisdiction over all the territory between the rivers [[Oria River|Oria]] and [[Bidasoa]].\n\nIn 1200, the city was conquered by [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], whose king [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]], confirmed its charter (fuero), but the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] was deprived of its main direct access out to the sea. Perhaps as soon as 1204 (or earlier), the city nucleus at the foot of [[Urgull]] started to be populated with [[Gascon language|Gascon]]-speaking colonizers from [[Bayonne]] and beyond, who left an important imprint in the city's identity in the centuries to come.<ref name=\"LOS GASCONES EN GUIP\u00daZCOA\">{{cite web | url = http://atzoatzokoa.gipuzkoakultura.net/c78f6/ | title=LOS GASCONES EN GUIP\u00daZCOA|publisher = IMPRENTA DE LA DIPUTACION DE GUIPUZCOA|language=Spanish|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1265, the use of the city as a seaport is granted to Navarre as part of a wedding pact. The large quantity of Gascons inhabiting the town favoured the development of trade with other European ports and [[Gascony]]. The city steered clear of the destructive [[War of the Bands]] in Gipuzkoa, the only town in doing so in that territory. In fact, the town only joined [[Gipuzkoa]] in 1459 after the war came to an end.<ref name=\"LOS GASCONES EN GUIP\u00daZCOA\"/> Up to the 16th century, Donostia remained mostly out of wars, but by the beginning of the 15th century, a line of walls of simple construction is attested encircling the town. The last chapter of the town in the Middle Ages was brought about by a fire that devastated Donostia in 1489. After burning to the ground, the town began a new renaissance by building up mainly with stone instead of bare timber.\n\n===Modern Age===\nThe advent of the Modern Age brought a period of instability and war for the city. New state boundaries were drawn that left Donostia located close to [[Spain]]'s border with France; thicker and more sophisticated walls were erected, with the town becoming involved in the 1521\u20131524 military campaigns that formed part of the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|Spanish conquest of Navarre]]. The town provided critical naval help to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] during the siege of [[Hondarribia]], which earned the town the titles \"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\", recorded on its coat of arms. The town also aided the monarch by sending a party to the [[Battle of Noain]] and providing help to quash the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] in 1521.\n\nAfter these events, Gascons, who had played a leading role in the political and economic life of the town since its foundation, began to be excluded from influential public positions by means of a string of regional sentences upheld by royal decision (regional diets of [[Zestoa]] 1527, [[Hondarribia]] 1557, [[Bergara]] 1558, [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] 1604 and [[Deba, Gipuzkoa|Deba]] 1662).<ref name=\"LOS GASCONES EN GUIP\u00daZCOA\"/> Meanwhile, the climate of war and disease left the town in a poor condition that drove many fishermen and traders to take to the sea as corsairs as a way of getting a living, most of the times under the auspices of the king [[Philip II of Spain]], who benefited from the disruption caused to and wealth obtained from the French and Dutch trade ships.\n\nIn 1660, the city was used as the royal headquarters during the marriage of [[Maria Theresa of Spain|the Infanta]] to [[Louis XIV]] at [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] nearby. After a relatively peaceful 17th century, the town was besieged and taken over by the troops of the French Duke of Berwick up to 1721. However, San Sebasti\u00e1n was not spared by shelling in the French assault and many urban structures were reconstructed, e.g. a new opening in the middle of the town, the Plaza Berria (that was to become the current Konstituzio Plaza).\n\nIn 1728, the [[Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]] was founded and boosted commerce with the [[Spanish Empire|Americas]]. Thanks to the profit the company generated, the town underwent some urban reforms and improvements and the new Santa Maria Church was erected by subscription. This period of wealth and development was to last up to the end of 18th century.<ref name=\"Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n\"/>{{rp|56/58}}\n\nIn 1808, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] forces captured San Sebasti\u00e1n in the [[Peninsular War]]. In 1813, after a siege of various weeks, on 28 August, during the night, a landing party from a British [[Royal Navy]] squadron captured [[Santa Clara Island (San Sebastian)|Santa Clara Island]], in the bay. Situated on a narrow promontory that jutted out into the sea between the waters of the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the broad estuary of the [[Urumea]] River, the town was hard to get at and well fortified \u2013 \"it was the strongest fortification I ever saw, [[Gibraltar]] excepted\", wrote [[William Dent]].<ref>L. Woodford (ed.), ''A Young Surgeon in Wellingtons Army: the Letters of William Dent'' (Old Woking, 1976), p. 39.</ref> Three days later, on 31 August, British and Portuguese troops [[Siege of San Sebastian|besieging San Sebasti\u00e1n]] assaulted the town. The relieving troops ransacked and burnt the city to the ground. Only the street at the foot of the hill (now called 31 August Street) remained.\n\n===Contemporary history===\nAfter these destructive events, reconstruction of the city was commenced in the original location with a slightly altered layout. A modern octagonal layout as drafted by the architect P.M. Ugartemendia was turned down and eventually M. Gogorza's blueprint was approved, then supervised and implemented by the Ugartemendia. This area, the old town, has a neoclassical, austere and systematic style of architectural construction. Constitution Square was built in 1817 and the town hall (currently a library) between 1828 and 1832.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|100}} Housing in the old town was built gradually alongside the rest of the area.\n\nThe liberal and bourgeois San Sebasti\u00e1n became the capital of Gipuzkoa (instead of [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]]) until 1823, when absolutists attacked the town again (only 200 inhabitants remained in the town when the offensive troops entered). It was designated again as the capital in 1854.<ref name=\"Berruso\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ingeba.org/liburua/donostia/46contem/46contem.htm |title=San Sebasti\u00e1n en los Siglos XIX y XX |last1=Berruso Bar\u00e9s |first1=Pedro |website=Geograf\u00eda e historia de Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n|publisher=Ingeba |accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref> In 1833, British volunteers under Sir [[George de Lacy Evans]] defended the town against [[Carlist]] attack, and those who died were buried in the English Cemetery on Mount [[Urgull]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the local government was still ruled by the principle of nobility, while inhabitants of foreign origin or descent had always been ubiquitous in the town, especially among the trading community. Although San Sebasti\u00e1n benefited greatly from the charts system established in the [[Southern Basque Country]] (''[[fuero|foruak]]'', with borders in the Ebro river and no duties for overseas goods), the town was at odds with the more traditional [[Gipuzkoa]], even requesting secession from the province and annexation to [[Navarre]] in 1841.\n\nIn 1863, the [[defensive walls]] of the town were demolished (their remains are visible in the underground car park on the Boulevard) and an expansion of the town began in an attempt to move on from its previous military function.<ref name=\"Pi\u00f1eiro\"/> Jose Goicoa and Ramon Cortazar were appointed to oversee the work. They modelled the new city according to an orthogonal shape in a neoclassical Parisian style, and Goicoa designed several elegant buildings, such as the [[Miramar Palace]] and La Concha Promenade.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|145\u2013146}} The city was chosen by the Spanish monarchy as a summer retreat following the French example of nearby [[Biarritz]], and Spanish nobility and the diplomatic corps opened residences in the town. As the \"wave baths\" at La Concha were in conflict with nearby shipbuilding activity, the shipyards relocated to [[Pasaia]], a nearby bay that had formerly been part of San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n\nHowever, in 1875, war came to the town again, and in 1876 shelling over the city by [[Carlist Wars|Carlists]] claimed the life of acclaimed the poet [[Bilintx]].<ref name=\"Berruso\"/> From 1885, King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]]'s widow [[Maria Christina of Austria|Maria Cristina]] spent every summer in Donostia along with her retinue, staying at the Miramar Palace. In 1887, a casino was built, which eventually became the current city hall, and some time later the Regional Government building was completed in Plaza Gipuzkoa following Jose Goicoa's design. Cultural life thrived in this period, giving rise to various events still popular in the city, such as the Caldereros or the [[Tamborrada]], and journalistic and literary works in both Spanish and Basque.\n\nAfter much debate in the city over whether to pursue an economy based on tourism or manufacturing, Donostia developed into a fully-fledged seaside resort, but some industry developed in the district of Antiguo and on the outskirts of the city. Following the outbreak of World War I, San Sebasti\u00e1n became a destination for renowned international figures of culture and politics,<ref name=\"Berruso\"/> including [[Mata Hari]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Maurice Ravel]], and [[Conde de Romanones|Romanones]].\n\nSan Sebastian was one of earliest  towns hit by the [[Spanish flu|1918 Influenza epidemic]], dealing with a first wave outbreak in February of that year. Officials feared for the city's reputation and attempted to keep the disease's spread quiet, to no avail, and the outbreak soon spread throughout Spain.<ref>[[Gina Kolata|''Kolata, Gina'']]. \"Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It\" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2000), p. 9.</ref>\n\nVarious rationalist architectural works, typically white or light-coloured, were built in the 1920s and 1930s, such as La Equitativa, Nautico, and Easo. In 1924\u20131926, canalisation work was carried out on the Urumea river at the southern edge of the city. However, after the city's Belle Epoque in the European wartime, repression under [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship was not favourable for the city. In 1924, gambling was prohibited by the authoritarian regime, causing existential problems for the Grand Casino and the Kursaal (1921).\n\nIn 1930, Spanish republican forces signed up to the [[Pact of San Sebasti\u00e1n]], leading to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Unrest and repression did not stop with the new political regime, and large-scale industrial action was called several times by the growing anarchist, communist and socialist unions. The [[Spanish Civil War, 1936|1936 military coup]] was initially defeated by the resistance, led by the [[Basque nationalism|Basque Nationalists]],<ref>[[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] (2001). ''Spanish Civil War''.</ref>{{rp|226}} anarchists and communists, but later that same year the province fell to Spanish Nationalist forces during [[War in the North|the Northern Campaign]].<ref>Hugh Thomas (2001).</ref>{{rp|397}} The occupation proved disastrous for the city's residents. Between 1936 and 1943, 485 people were executed as a result of [[show trials]] by the Spanish Nationalists ([[Requet\u00e9]]s and [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS|Falangist]]s).<ref>{{cite book | author=Paul Preston | title=The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain. | publisher= HarperCollins | location= London, UK | isbn=978-0-00-638695-7 | year=2013}}</ref>{{rp|431}} It has been estimated that extrajudicial executions (''paseos'') by the occupying military forces accounted for over 600 murders in the area during the first months of occupation.<ref>Paul Preston (2013).</ref>{{rp|431}} [[Evacuation of children in the Spanish Civil War|Many children were evacuated]] to temporary safety in Bilbao, with the city's population falling by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nIn the aftermath of war, the city was stricken by poverty, famine and repression, coupled with a thriving smuggling trade. Many republican detainees were held at the beach-side Ondarreta Prison in grim and humid conditions, until the building was demolished in 1948. However, industrial development paved the way for urban expansion in the Egia and Amara Berri districts, on the marshes and riverbed of the Urumea, at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s.\n\nIn 1943, the first [[Ikastola|Basque language schools]] were established by Elvira Zipitria, who taught in Basque from her home in the Old Town. In 1947, the Grand Casino was converted into the City Hall.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|95}} In 1953, city businessmen organised the first [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]] to stimulate the economic life and profile of the city.\n\nMass immigration from other parts of Spain, spurred by growing industrial production, greatly increased the population, initiating rapid and chaotic urban development on the outskirts of the city (Altza, Intxaurrondo, Herrera, Bidebieta), yet social, cultural and political injustices followed, setting the scene for popular dissatisfaction. A general climate of protest and street demonstrations followed, driven by Basque nationalists (especially the armed separatist organisation ETA) and various underground unions, triggering the first state of emergency in Gipuzkoa in 1968. Several more were imposed by the Francoist authorities in the period immediately preceding Franco's death in 1975.\n\nAmid the fragile economic situation and real estate speculation, the Kursaal and the Chofre bullring in Gros were demolished in 1973.<ref name=\"Berruso\"/> From 1975-77, sculptor [[Eduardo Chillida]] and architect [[Luis Pe\u00f1a Ganchegui]]'s landmark [[The Comb of the Wind]]s was built at the western tip of the bay. The 1970s to the mid-1980s were years of general urban and social decay marked by social and political unrest and violence.\n\nIn 1979, the first democratic municipal elections were held, won by the [[Basque Nationalist Party]], who held office along with splinter party [[Eusko Alkartasuna]] (Basque Solidarity) until 1991. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]'s [[Odon Elorza]] took over as mayor from 1991 until 2011, when he was defeated unexpectedly by Juan Carlos Izagirre ([[Bildu]]) in elections.<ref name=\"Berruso\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s, a major makeover of the city centre began, aimed at enhancing and revamping the neoclassical and modernist side of San Sebasti\u00e1n's architecture. Other regeneration projects included the reshaping and enlargement of Zurriola beach and promenade, the opening of the [[Kursaal Palace]] cubes (1999),<ref name=\"Berruso\"/> the new university campus and technology facilities in Ibaeta, the creation of a wide network of cycle lanes, underground car-parks and significant improvements to public transport. Districts of cutting-edge design have been erected, such as [[Donostia#Ibaeta|Ibaeta]] and [[Donostia#Riberas de Loiola|Riberas de Loiola]], while some other major public works are still pending confirmation of funding and approval.\n\n==Districts of the city==\n[[File:Monumentos de San Sebasti\u00e1n.jpg|thumbnail|Monuments of the city]]\n[[File:Plaza Constituci\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|right|Fa\u00e7ade of the Constitution Square (Plaza) in San Sebasti\u00e1n]]\nAs a result of Donostia's sprawling in all directions, first into the flatlands shaped by the river [[Urumea]] and later up the hills, new districts arose after the walls of the city were demolished in 1863. The first expansion of the old town stretched out to the river's mouth, on the old quarter called Zurriola (a name later given by Council decision to the sand area and the avenue across the river).<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|13, 322}}\n\nThe orthogonal layout nowadays making up the city centre (the Cortazar development) was built up to 1914 (first phase finished) much in tune with a Parisian [[Baron Haussmann#Haussmann's plan for Paris|Haussmannian]] style.

The Old Town is divided in two parishes relating to the Santa Maria and San Vicente churches, the inhabitants belonging to the former being dubbed traditionally ''joxemaritarrak'', while those attached to the latter are referred to as ''koxkeroak''. Historically, the koxkeroak up to the early 18th century were largely [[Gascon language|Gascon]] speaking inhabitants. Especially after the end of Franco's dictatorship, scores of bars sprang up all over the Old Part which are very popular with the youth and the tourists, although not as much with the local residents. Most current buildings trace back to the 19th century, erected thanks to the concerted effort and determination of the town dwellers [[Siege of San Sebasti\u00e1n#Ransacking and burning of San Sebastian|after the 1813 destruction]] of the town by the allied Anglo-Portuguese troops.<ref name=\"Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n\">{{cite book |last1=Sadaba|first1=Javier|last2=Sadaba|first2=Javier|date=1995|title=Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n|location=San Sebasti\u00e1n|publisher=Editorial Txertoa|isbn= 84-7148-318-1}} Book in Spanish</ref>{{rp|73\u201375, 81\u201389}}\n\nThere is a small fishing and recreation port, with two-floor houses lined under the front-wall of the mount [[Urgull]].

The core of this district is the ''Easo plaza'', with the railway terminal of Euskotren closing the square at its south.\n\n===Amara Berri===\nThis city expansion to the south came about as of the 1940s, after the works to canalize the river were achieved.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|30\u201331, 92}} Nowadays the name Amara usually applies to this sector, the newer district having overshadowed the original nucleus both in size and population. The district harbours the main road entrance to the city. Facilities of many state run agencies were established here and presently Amara's buildings house many business offices. The district revolves around the axis of ''Avenida Sancho el Sabio'' and ''Avenida de Madrid''.\n\n===Gros===\nThe district is built on the sandy terrain across the river. The ''Gros'' or ''Zurriola'' surf beach by the river's mouth bears witness to that type of soil. In the 19th century, shanties and workshops started to dot the area, Tomas Gros being one of its main proprietors as well as providing the name for this part of the city.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|148\u2013149}} The area held the former monumental bullring ''Chofre'' demolished in 1973, on a site currently occupied by a housing estate.

The place in turn became the summer residence for the dictator up to 1975.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|62}} Nowadays home to the Bakearen Etxea or Peace Memorial House.\n\n===Egia===\nEgia, stemming from (H)Egia ([[Basque language|Basque]] for either bank/shore or hill), is a popular district of Donostia on the right side of the [[Urumea]] beyond the train station. At the beginning of the 20th century, a patch of land by the railway started to be used as a football pitch, eventually turning into the official stadium of the local team ''Real Sociedad'' before it was transferred in the 1990s to Anoeta,<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|111}} south of Amara Berri (nowadays the site harbours houses). The former tobacco factory building [[Tabakalera]], which has been converted into a Contemporary Culture Centre, conjures up the former industrial past of the area,.<ref name=\"SadaSanse\"/>{{rp|111}} Right opposite to this building lies the Cristina Enea park, a public compound with a botanic vocation. Egia holds the city cemetery, Polloe, at the north-east fringes of the district, stretching out to South Intxaurrondo.\n\n===Intxaurrondo===\nThis part (meaning 'walnut tree' in Basque) is a large district to the east of the city. The original nucleus lies between the railway and the Ategorrieta Avenue, where still today the farmhouse Intxaurrondo Zar, declared \"National Monument\", is situated since the mid-17th century. The railway cuts across the district, the southern side being the fruit of the heavy development undergone in the area during the immigration years of the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, further housing estates have been built up more recently souther beyond the N-1 E-5 E-80 E-70 ring road (South Intxaurrondo). The police force [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] runs controversial barracks there (works for new housing are underway).\n\n===Altza===\nAltza ([[Basque language|Basque]] for alder tree) is the easternmost district of San Sebasti\u00e1n along with Bidebieta and Trintxerpe. It was but a quaint village comprising scattered farmhouses and a small nucleus a century ago (2,683 inhabitants in 1910), yet on the arrival of thousands of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s a rapid and chaotic housing and building activity ensued, resulting in a maze of grey landscape of skyscrapers and 32,531 inhabitants crammed in them (data of 1970), the figure is 20,000 {{As of|2013|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.donostia.org/info/ciudadano/part_barrios.nsf/vowebContenidosId/NT0000097E?OpenDocument&idioma=eus&id=a608306614310&doc=D|title=Auzoak eta Herriak: Altza |website=Donostiako Udala \u2013 Ayuntamiento de San Sebasti\u00e1n |accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Ibaeta===\nIbaeta stands on the former location for various factories (e.g., Cervezas El Le\u00f3n) of San Sebasti\u00e1n, with the buildings of the old industrial estate being demolished in the late 20th century. The levelling of this large flat area paved the ground for a carefully planned modern and elegant housing estate, featuring a new university campus for the public [[University of the Basque Country]] (UPV-EHU)<ref name=\"Pi\u00f1eiro\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ingeba.org/liburua/donostia/53geourb/53geourb.htm|title=La Estructura Urbana|website=Geograf\u00eda e historia de Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n|publisher=Ingeba|last1=Gomez Pi\u00f1eiro|first1=Javier|accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref> and institutions such as the [[Donostia International Physics Center]] or the [http://www.nanogune.eu/en Nanotechnology Center]. A stream called Konporta flows down along the eastern side of the area, but it was canalized under the ground almost all along to its mouth on the bay pushed by urban building pressure.\n\n===Loiola===\nIt lies by the Urumea at the south-east end of the city. It comprises a small patch of detached houses (Ciudad Jard\u00edn) and a core area of 6-odd floor buildings. The district has recently gone through a major makeover, with works finishing in 2008. The road axis coming from important industrial areas (Astigarraga-[[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]]) crosses the district heading downtown. A military base stands across the river,<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\"/> home to an uprising in 1936. Attempts by the city council to close it have been unsuccessful so far.\n\n===Riberas de Loiola===\nNew modern district erected in the 2000s next to the city's inner bypass and south road entrance to Donostia. A pedestrian bridge spans the Urumea river onto the Cristina Enea Park.\n\n===Martutene===\nThe [[Martutene]] district bordering to the south on the town of [[Astigarraga]] comes next to Loiola in the south direction. This part of the city features an industrial area, a football pitch for lower leagues, a disused vocational training building and enclosure as well as a prison, much in decay and due to be transferred soon to a new location, probably in the municipality's exclave of Zubieta, while this option is coming in for much opposition.\n\n===Ulia===\n[[File:El_Deposito_-_Lumina_Nocte.jpg|thumb|Former tank supplying the city with sanitary water in Ulia]]\nThis part stands on the east side of the city at the foot of the [[Mount Ulia]] Park, on the left hand side of the road heading from [[Donostia]] to [[Pasaia]] and [[Irun]]. It consists of a residential area, besides holding a number of educational institutions, culture and sports centres built since 1980. The [[Park of Nurseries of Ulia]] sits at the base of the road leading to Mount Ulia, with its name deriving from its function as a nursery of plants for the public gardens of Donostia during all the 20th century and until 2008. It includes two ancient water-tanks, architectonic elements, and specific flora and fauna.\n\n===Zubieta===\nThe exclave Zubieta (meaning 'place of bridges') was a village up to recent years, with a number of houses, a [[Basque pelota|handball]] pitch (on account of its single wall as opposed to the regular two) and a church. Yet it has undergone a great urban development, which has rendered the location a built-up area with paved streets and due equipment.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Two contested projects are under way to build a solid-waste incinerator and a prison nearby. Historically, neighbours from Donostia held a meeting at a house in the former village in the wake of the [[Siege of San Sebastian#Burning of San Sebastian|1813 burning]], in order to decide the reconstruction of the town.\n\n==Culture and events==\n[[File:San Sebastian Festival Entrada.JPG|thumb|upright|San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, Red Carpet]]\n\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n shows a dynamic cultural scene, where grass-roots initiative based on different parts of the city and the concerted private and public synergy have paved the ground for a rich range of possibilities and events catering to the tastes of a wide and selected public alike. The city was selected as [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2016 (shared with [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Poland]]) with a basic motto, \"Waves of people's energy\", summarizing a clear message: people and movements of citizens are the real driving force behind transformations and changes in the world.\n\nEvents ranging from traditional city festivals to music, theatre or cinema take place all year round, while they specially thrive in summer. In the last week of July, [[San Sebastian Jazz Festival|San Sebasti\u00e1n's Jazz Festival]] (Jazzaldia), the longest, continuously running Jazz Festival in Europe is held. In different spots of the city gigs are staged, sometimes with free admission. The Musical Fortnight comes next extending for at least fifteen days well into August and featuring classical music concerts. In September, the [[San Sebastian International Film Festival|San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]] comes to the spotlight, an event with more than 50 years revolving around the venues of [[Kursaal Palace|Kursaal]] and the Victoria Eugenia Theatre. The city is also home to the [[San Telmo Museoa]], a major cultural institution with an ethnographic, artistic and civic vocation.\n\nSticking to the cinematic language but lacking its echo, Street Zinema is an international audiovisual festival exploring contemporary art and urban cultures. Other rising and popular events include the Horror and Fantasy Festival in October (21st edition in 2010) and the Surfilm Festibal, a cinema festival featuring surfing footage, especially shorts. During centuries, the city has been open to many influences that have left a trace, often mingling with the local customs and traditions and eventually resulting in festivals and new customs.\n\n===San Sebasti\u00e1n Day===\n{{Main|Tamborrada}}\n[[File:San Sebastian Tamborrada Infantil cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Tamborrada]], children's section]]\nEvery year on 20 January (the feast of [[Saint Sebastian]]), the people of San Sebasti\u00e1n celebrate a festival known as the \"Tamborrada\". At midnight, in the Konstituzio plaza in the \"Alde Zaharra/Parte Vieja\" (Old Part), the mayor raises the flag of San Sebasti\u00e1n (see in the infobox). For 24 hours, the entire city is awash with the sound of drums. The adults, dressed as cooks and soldiers, march around the city. They march all night with their cook hats and white aprons with the March of San Sebasti\u00e1n.<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ingeba.org/liburua/donostia/62ssfies/623ssfies.htm |title=La Tamborrada y otras Fiestas |last1=Saez Garcia |first1=Juan Antonio |website=Geograf\u00eda e historia de Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n|publisher=Ingeba |accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn this day a procession was held in the early 19th century from the Santa Maria Church in the Old Part to the San Sebasti\u00e1n Church in the district of [[Donostia#Antiguo|Antiguo]], while later limited on the grounds of weather conditions to the in-wall area. The event finished with a popular dancing accompanied on the military band's flutes and drums. In addition, every day a soldier parade took place to change the guards at the town's southern walls. Since the San Sebasti\u00e1n Day was the first festival heralding the upcoming Carnival, it's no surprise that some youths in Carnival mood followed them aping their martial manners and drumrolls, using for the purpose the buckets left at the fountains.<ref name=\"Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n\"/>{{rp|107}} In the period spanning the 1860s and 1880s the celebrations started to shape as we know them today with proper military style outfits and parades and the tunes fashioned by music composer Raimundo Sarriegui.<ref name=\"Historia de San Sebasti\u00e1n\"/>{{rp|110}}\n\nAdults usually have dinner in ''[[txoko]]s'' (\"gourmet clubs\"), who traditionally admitted only males, but nowadays even the strictest ones allow women on the \"Noche de la Tamborrada\". They eat sophisticated meals cooked by themselves, mostly composed of seafood (traditionally [[elver]]s, now no longer served due to its exorbitant price) and drink the best wines. For \"Donostiarras\" this is the most celebrated festival of the year.\n\n===La Semana Grande/Aste Nagusia===\n[[File:Gigantes San Sebastian.jpg|thumb|The city [[Gigantes y cabezudos|giants and big-heads]] in the Semana Grande/Aste Nagusia]]\n\nA festival, ''La Semana Grande'' in Spanish and ''Aste Nagusia'' in Basque (\"The Big/Main Week\"), is held every year in mid-August. A major international fireworks competition is held during the festival, in which teams representing various countries and cities put on a fireworks display each night over the bay, with the winner of the contest announced at the end. The displays are sometimes accompanied by a full live orchestra performing on the boardwalk. Attendees often claim spots along the beach and bay hours in advance.<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\"/> The festival also includes a parade of marching bands, stilted entertainers, and big-heads costumes every afternoon.\n\n===Basque Week===\nThis decades long festivity taking place at the beginning of September features events related to Basque culture, such as performances of traditional improvising poets ([[bertsolari]]s), [[Basque pelota]] games, [[Harrijasotzaileak|stone lifting]] contests, [[Idi probak|oxen wagers]], dance exhibitions or the [[cider]] tasting festival. Yet the main highlight may be the [[estropadak|rowing boat competition]], where teams from different towns of the [[Bay of Biscay]] contend for the [[Kontxako Bandera|Flag of La Concha]]. Thousands of supporters coming from these coastal locations pour into the city's streets and promenades overlooking the bay to follow the event, especially on the Sunday of the final race. All day long the streets of the Old Part play host to droves of youths clad in their team colours who party there in a cheerful atmosphere.\n\n===Santa Ageda Bezpera===\nSaint Agatha's Eve is a traditional event taking place at the beginning of February or end of January in many spots of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. It holds a small but cherished slot in the city's run-up to the Carnival. Groups dressed up in Basque traditional farmer costume march across the neighbourhood singing and wielding a characteristic stick beaten on the ground to the rhythm of the traditional [[Saint Agatha]]'s tune.<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\"/> The singers ask for a small donation, which can be money, a drink or something to eat.\n\n===Caldereros===\n[[File:San Sebastian Puerto.jpg|thumb|View of the harbour]]\nThis is a local festival held on the first Saturday of February linked to the upcoming [[Carnival]], where different groups of people dressed in [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsy) tinkers attire take to the streets banging rhythmically a hammer or spoon against a pot or pan, and usually bar-hop while they sing the traditional songs for the occasion. They were just male voices some time ago, but women participate and sing currently too, and the main event is at the City Hall, where the city band plays marches while the crowds bang the pots and pans. The festival began in 1884.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Santo Tomas===\nThis popular festival takes place on 21 December, a date frequently shrouded in winter cold. From early in the morning, stalls are arranged across the city centre and people from all [[Gipuzkoa]] flock to the streets of the centre and the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n#Old Part|Old Part]], with crowds of people often dressed in traditional Basque \"farmer\" outfit turning out and filling the area. Traditional and typical produce is showcased and sold on the stalls, while the main drink is cider and the most popular snacks are txistorra (a type of thin, uncured chorizo) wrapped in talos (flatbread). A large pig is on display in the Konstituzio Plaza, which is raffled off during the festival.<ref name=\"SaezGarcia\"/>\n\n===Olentzero===\nAs in other Basque cities, towns and villages, on Christmas Eve the [[Olentzero]] and the accompanying carol singers usually dressed in Basque farmer costume take over the streets, especially in the city centre, asking for small donations in bars, shops and banks after singing their repertoire. Sometimes Olentzero choirs roam around the streets in later dates, on the 31st for example, and are often related to cultural, social or political associations and demands.\n\n==Economy and industry==\nThe main economic activities are commerce and tourism.  San Sebasti\u00e1n is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Spain.<ref name=\"ingeba1\"/>\n\nThe international technology organisation [[Ikusi]] is based in San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n\n==Transport==\nThe city is served by [[Euskotren Trena]], the main Basque rail operator. Euskotren Trena operates trains to [[Bilbao]] and other destinations, as well as the [[Metro Donostialdea]] and [[Cercan\u00edas San Sebasti\u00e1n]] within the San Sebasti\u00e1n metropolitan area. There are frequent trains via [[San Sebasti\u00e1n railway station]] from [[Madrid\u2013Hendaye railway|Madrid to Hendaye]] in France, which is connected to the French rail network. The city is also served by [[San Sebasti\u00e1n Airport]] in the nearby municipality of [[Hondarribia]]. San Sebasti\u00e1n Airport currently has no international destinations.
