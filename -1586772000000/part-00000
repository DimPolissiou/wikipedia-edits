The largest party in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] with initially 63 seats in the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] and 158 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]], it also has the largest number of mayors, local and county councilors and county presidents thus being the biggest and most influential political force in the country.\n\nPSD traces its origins to the [[Democratic National Salvation Front]], a breakaway group established in 1992 from the post-communist [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]]. In 1993 this merged with three other parties to become the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR). The present name was adopted after a merger with the smaller [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1990\u20132001)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR) in 2001. Since its formation, it has always been one of the two dominant parties of the country. The PDSR governed Romania from 1992 to 1996, while the PSDR was a junior coalition partner between 1996 and 2000. The merged PSD was the senior party in the coalitions governing from 2000 to 2004, and from March 2014 to November 2015, as well as one of the main coalition partners between December 2008 and October 2009 (with the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]]) and again between May 2012 and March 2014 (as part of the [[Social Liberal Union]]). The party left government after Prime Minister Victor Ponta resigned in November 2015, only to return as the senior governing party in January 2017, after a major victory in the legislative elections. The founder of the party, [[Ion Iliescu]], became President of the Republic, in office from the end of Communism in 1989 to 1996, and again from 2000 to 2004.\n\n==History==\nOn 7 April 1992, the struggle for power inside the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] ({{lang-ro|Frontul Salv\u0103rii Na\u021bionale}}, FSN) between the more hard-line group led by [[Ion Iliescu]] and the more reformist group led by [[Petre Roman]] resulted in the Iliescu group withdrawing from FSN and the founding of the [[Democratic National Salvation Front]] ({{lang-ro|Frontul Democrat al Salv\u0103rii Na\u021bionale}}, FDSN), which would later become the present-day PSD.\n\nFDSN won the [[1992 Romanian general election|1992 elections]] and went on to govern Romania until 1996. On 10 July 1993 it took the name of Party of Social Democracy in Romania ({{lang-ro|Partidul Democra\u021biei Sociale in Rom\u00e2nia}}, PDSR) upon merger with the Socialist Democratic Party of Romania, the Republican Party and the Cooperative Party.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1996 the PDSR ruled in coalition with the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Romanian National Unity Party]] (PUNR) and [[Greater Romania Party]] (PRM), and the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Socialist Party of Labour]]. PUNR had ministers in the cabinet chaired by [[Nicolae V\u0103c\u0103roiu]] from March 1994 to September 1996. PRM was not present at the Cabinet, but was given some posts in the State administration. The PDSR went into opposition after the [[1996 Romanian legislative election|1996 election]], which was won by the right-wing coalition [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] (CDR).\n\nAfter 4 years of governmental turmoil and economic downfall, poorly managed by the crumbling CDR, saw PDSR making a fulminant comeback, winning the November 2000 elections, this time in a coalition named the [[Social Democratic Pole of Romania]] along with the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1990-2001)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR) and the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Romanian Humanist Party]] (PUR). PSDR merged with PDSR on 16 June 2001, and the resulting party took its present name, PSD.\n\nIn November 2004, [[Adrian N\u0103stase]], the PSD candidate and incumbent Prime Minister, won the first round of the presidential elections but did not have a majority and had to go to a second round of voting, which he narrowly lost to [[Traian B\u0103sescu]] of the opposition [[Justice and Truth]] alliance, who became Romania's 4th president. In the [[2004 Romanian legislative election|legislative elections of 2004]], the PSD gained the largest share of the vote but because it did not have a majority, the other parties that managed to enter parliament, UDMR and PUR, abandoned their respective pre-electoral agreements with PSD and joined the Justice and Truth Alliance, mainly at the pressure of the recently elected president.\n\n[[Mircea Geoan\u0103]] was elected president of the party in April 2005 by delegates at a PSD Party Congress held in Bucharest. His victory represented a surprise defeat for former President Ion Iliescu, who was expected to defeat Geoan\u0103 handily.\n\nOn 17 April 2008, the Social Democratic Party and the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] announced they would form a political alliance for [[2008 Romanian local election|the 2008 local elections]].<ref name=\"setimes.com 2008\">{{cite web | title=Romania's PSD and PC form alliance (SETimes.com) | website=setimes.com | date=17 April 2008 | url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2008/04/17/nb-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607004256/http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2008/04/17/nb-04 | archive-date=7 June 2008 | url-status=dead | access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2010, the Congress elected [[Victor Ponta]] as president, after Mircea Geoana lost the presidential elections in December 2009.\n\nOn 5 February 2011, the PSD formed a [[political alliance]] known as the [[Social Liberal Union]] (USL) with the Conservative Party and [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]].<ref name=\"CRIENGLISH 2011\">{{cite web | last=Zhang | title=Romanian Oppositions Form Alliance | website=CRIENGLISH | date=6 February 2011 | url=http://english.cri.cn/6966/2011/02/06/1461s619327.htm | access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref><!-- irretrievably lost <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n241429|title=FOCUS Information Agency|work=FOCUS Information Agency|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>--> The USL was disbanded on 25 February 2014 with exit of the National Liberal Party which immediately entered opposition.<ref name=\"Author 2014\">{{cite web | last=Bivol | first=Alex | title=Romania's Liberals to leave ruling coalition, government | website=The Sofia Globe | date=25 February 2014 | url=https://sofiaglobe.com/2014/02/25/romanias-liberals-to-leave-ruling-coalition-government/ | access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, [[Liviu Dragnea]] was elected by the Congress of the PSD as the new president of the party, with 97% of the votes from the members.

The largest party in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] with initially 63 seats in the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] and 158 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]], it also has the largest number of mayors, local and county councilors and county presidents thus being the biggest and most influential political force in the country.\n\nPSD traces its origins to the [[Democratic National Salvation Front]], a breakaway group established in 1992 from the post-communist [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]]. In 1993 this merged with three other parties to become the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR). The present name was adopted after a merger with the smaller [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1990\u20132001)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR) in 2001. Since its formation, it has always been one of the two dominant parties of the country. The PDSR governed Romania from 1992 to 1996, while the PSDR was a junior coalition partner between 1996 and 2000. The merged PSD was the senior party in the coalitions governing from 2000 to 2004, and from March 2014 to November 2015, as well as one of the main coalition partners between December 2008 and October 2009 (with the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]]) and again between May 2012 and March 2014 (as part of the [[Social Liberal Union]]). The party left government after Prime Minister Victor Ponta resigned in November 2015, only to return as the senior governing party in January 2017, after a major victory in the legislative elections. The founder of the party, [[Ion Iliescu]], became President of the Republic, in office from the end of Communism in 1989 to 1996, and again from 2000 to 2004.\n\n==History==\nOn 7 April 1992, the struggle for power inside the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] ({{lang-ro|Frontul Salv\u0103rii Na\u021bionale}}, FSN) between the more hard-line group led by [[Ion Iliescu]] and the more reformist group led by [[Petre Roman]] resulted in the Iliescu group withdrawing from FSN and the founding of the [[Democratic National Salvation Front]] ({{lang-ro|Frontul Democrat al Salv\u0103rii Na\u021bionale}}, FDSN), which would later become the present-day PSD.\n\nFDSN won the [[1992 Romanian general election|1992 elections]] and went on to govern Romania until 1996. On 10 July 1993 it took the name of Party of Social Democracy in Romania ({{lang-ro|Partidul Democra\u021biei Sociale in Rom\u00e2nia}}, PDSR) upon merger with the Socialist Democratic Party of Romania, the Republican Party and the Cooperative Party.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1996 the PDSR ruled in coalition with the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Romanian National Unity Party]] (PUNR) and [[Greater Romania Party]] (PRM), and the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Socialist Party of Labour]]. PUNR had ministers in the cabinet chaired by [[Nicolae V\u0103c\u0103roiu]] from March 1994 to September 1996. PRM was not present at the Cabinet, but was given some posts in the State administration. The PDSR went into opposition after the [[1996 Romanian legislative election|1996 election]], which was won by the right-wing coalition [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] (CDR).\n\nAfter 4 years of governmental turmoil and economic downfall, poorly managed by the crumbling CDR, saw PDSR making a fulminant comeback, winning the November 2000 elections, this time in a coalition named the [[Social Democratic Pole of Romania]] along with the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1990-2001)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR) and the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Romanian Humanist Party]] (PUR). PSDR merged with PDSR on 16 June 2001, and the resulting party took its present name, PSD.\n\nIn November 2004, [[Adrian N\u0103stase]], the PSD candidate and incumbent Prime Minister, won the first round of the presidential elections but did not have a majority and had to go to a second round of voting, which he narrowly lost to [[Traian B\u0103sescu]] of the opposition [[Justice and Truth]] alliance, who became Romania's 4th president. In the [[2004 Romanian legislative election|legislative elections of 2004]], the PSD gained the largest share of the vote but because it did not have a majority, the other parties that managed to enter parliament, UDMR and PUR, abandoned their respective pre-electoral agreements with PSD and joined the Justice and Truth Alliance, mainly at the pressure of the recently elected president.\n\n[[Mircea Geoan\u0103]] was elected president of the party in April 2005 by delegates at a PSD Party Congress held in Bucharest.

On the line \"''Listen to my heart...beat''\", Brian stated: \"I felt very deeply about that line. One of the sweetest songs I ever sang. I have to say I'm proud of it. The innocence of youth in my voice, of being young and childlike. I think that's what people liked.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Composition==\nAuthor [[Geoffrey Himes]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\" was a guitar-less ballad that featured Brian singing in a devotional high tenor about the romantic moment when words fail. A string quartet played the minor seventh chords at close intervals, while the tympani boomed and a fat-toned electric bass drifted from the expected root note to create harmonic tensions within the lush sound. When Brian sang in an intimate hush, \"Don't talk; take my hand and listen to my heartbeat. Listen! Listen! Listen!\" the music demanded that you listen just as closely to its throbbing pulse.<ref name=HimesSurf>{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Himes|title=Surf Music|url=http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|website=teachrock.org|publisher=Rock and Roll: An American History|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125223127/http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-25}}</ref>}}\n\n== Recording ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n\n{{Listen\n|pos=right\n|filename=Don't Talk piano demo.ogg\n|title=\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\" (Demo)\n|description=Home recording of Wilson performing the basic chord patterns of the song on solo piano.\n}}\n\nThere were several early attempts at recording the song, including Brian playing the instrumental on an acoustic piano. Later he recorded a multitracked, instrumental a capella demo of himself singing all parts; this was released in the 1990 CD remaster, which erroneously claimed it was the entire band recording a scrapped overdub, as \"Unreleased Backgrounds.\" Carol Kaye recalls Wilson playing this recording for the musicians to give them a feel for the song.\n\nThe first real attempt at recording the song was at a session held at 9am on February 11, 1966 at [[United Western Recorders|Western Studios]] in Hollywood, California. The session - engineered by Chuck Britz and produced by Brian Wilson - saw the recording of the basic instrumental track as well as Wilson's lead vocal. The song is one of the few Beach Boys records that features no backing vocals. However, a session on October 13 of the previous year did see backing vocals recorded, although it is unclear on whether or not they were ever to be included. A string overdub was later recorded on April 3, 1966 again at Western Studios although this time with H.

It is the fourth track on the album ''[[Pet Sounds]]''. The song was [[demo tape|demoed]] as a wordless [[chorale]].<ref>Laura Tunbridge, The Song Cycle, (Cambridge University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0-521-72107-5}}, p.174.</ref>\n\nThe song is one of three tracks on ''Pet Sounds'' where Brian is the only Beach Boy performing. On the line \"''Listen to my heart...beat''\", Brian stated: \"I felt very deeply about that line. One of the sweetest songs I ever sang. I have to say I'm proud of it. The innocence of youth in my voice, of being young and childlike. I think that's what people liked.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Composition==\nAuthor [[Geoffrey Himes]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\" was a guitar-less ballad that featured Brian singing in a devotional high tenor about the romantic moment when words fail. A string quartet played the minor seventh chords at close intervals, while the tympani boomed and a fat-toned electric bass drifted from the expected root note to create harmonic tensions within the lush sound. When Brian sang in an intimate hush, \"Don't talk; take my hand and listen to my heartbeat. Listen! Listen! Listen!\" the music demanded that you listen just as closely to its throbbing pulse.<ref name=HimesSurf>{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Himes|title=Surf Music|url=http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|website=teachrock.org|publisher=Rock and Roll: An American History|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125223127/http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-25}}</ref>}}\n\n== Recording ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n\n{{Listen\n|pos=right\n|filename=Don't Talk piano demo.ogg\n|title=\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\" (Demo)\n|description=Home recording of Wilson performing the basic chord patterns of the song on solo piano.\n}}\n\nThere were several early attempts at recording the song, including Brian playing the instrumental on an acoustic piano. Later he recorded a multitracked, instrumental a capella demo of himself singing all parts; this was released in the 1990 CD remaster, which erroneously claimed it was the entire band recording a scrapped overdub, as \"Unreleased Backgrounds.\" Carol Kaye recalls Wilson playing this recording for the musicians to give them a feel for the song.\n\nThe first real attempt at recording the song was at a session held at 9am on February 11, 1966 at [[United Western Recorders|Western Studios]] in Hollywood, California. The session - engineered by Chuck Britz and produced by Brian Wilson - saw the recording of the basic instrumental track as well as Wilson's lead vocal. The song is one of the few Beach Boys records that features no backing vocals. However, a session on October 13 of the previous year did see backing vocals recorded, although it is unclear on whether or not they were ever to be included. A string overdub was later recorded on April 3, 1966 again at Western Studios although this time with H. Bowen David engineering the session.\n\n=== Personnel ===\n{{Update|section|date=July 2016}}\n\nSourced from liner notes included with the 1999 mono/stereo reissue of ''Pet Sounds''.<ref name=\"PS1999\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Pet Sounds|others=[[The Beach Boys]]|year=1999|first=|last=|authorlink=|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=CD Liner|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Pet_Sounds_Musicians.html}}</ref>\n\n'''The Beach Boys'''\n* [[Brian Wilson]] \u2013 lead vocal<ref name=\"tracks\">{{cite web | last =Elliott | first =Brad  | url =http://www.beachboysfanclub.com/ps-tracks.html  | title = Pet Sounds Track Notes | publisher =beachboysfanclub.com | date=August 31, 1999 | accessdate = March 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n'''Additional musicians'''\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* Arnold Belnick \u2013 violin\n* [[Hal Blaine]] \u2013 drums\n* Norman Botnick \u2013 viola\n* [[Glen Campbell]] \u2013 12-string rhythm guitar\n* [[Frank Capp]] \u2013 [[vibraphone]], [[timpani]]\n* [[Al de Lory]] \u2013 organ\n* [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]] \u2013 percussion\n* [[Carol Kaye]] \u2013 bass guitar\n* Lyle Ritz \u2013 [[upright bass]]\n* Joseph Saxon \u2013 cello\n* Ralph Schaeffer \u2013 violin\n* Sid Sharp \u2013 violin\n* [[Billy Strange]] \u2013 12-string lead guitar\n* Tibor Zelig \u2013 violin\n}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Elvis Costello]] has been quoted as saying, \"I heard 'Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)' played on the cello.
