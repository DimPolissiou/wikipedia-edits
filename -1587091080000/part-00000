For that purpose, Cyril and his brother Methodius started to translate religious literature to Old Church Slavonic, allegedly based on the [[Slavic languages|Slavic dialects]] spoken in the hinterland of their hometown,  [[Thessaloniki]],<ref>After the [[Slavs]] invaded it.<br/>{{Harvnb|Curta|2006|p=214}}: \"At the emperor's request, Constantine and his brother started the translation of religious texts into Old Church Slavonic, a literary language most likely based on the Macedonian dialect allegedly used in the hinterland of their home-town, Thessalonica.\"</ref> in today's [[Greece]].\n\nAs part of the preparation for the mission, in 862/863, the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was created and the most important prayers and [[liturgical book]]s, including the Aprakos Evangeliar (a [[Gospel Book]] [[lectionary]] containing only feast-day and Sunday readings), the [[Psalter]], and [[Acts of the Apostles]], were translated. (The Gospels were also translated early, but it is unclear whether Sts. Cyril or Methodius had a hand in this.)\n\nThe language and the alphabet were taught at the Great Moravian Academy ({{lang-sk|Ve\u013ekomoravsk\u00e9 u\u010dili\u0161te}}) and were used for government and religious documents and books between 863 and 885. The texts written during this phase contain characteristics of the Slavic [[vernacular]]s in Great Moravia.\n\nIn 885, the use of Old Church Slavonic in Great Moravia was prohibited by [[Pope Stephen V]] in favour of [[Latin]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&pg=PA310 310]}}.</ref>\n\nStudents of the two [[equal-to-apostles|apostles]] who were expelled from Great Moravia in 886, including [[Clement of Ohrid]] and [[Saint Naum]], brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] and were received and accepted officially by [[Boris I of Bulgaria]].

Old Church Slavonic spread to other South-Eastern, Central, and Eastern European Slavic territories, most notably [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Lesser Poland]], and principalities of the [[Kievan Rus']] while retaining characteristically [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] linguistic features.\n\nLater texts written in each of those territories then began to take on characteristics of the local Slavic vernaculars and, by the mid-11th century, Old Church Slavonic had diversified into a number of regional varieties (known as ''recensions'').

In Bulgaria it was a relatively open vowel, commonly reconstructed as {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, but further north its pronunciation was more closed and it eventually became a diphthong {{IPA|/je/}} (e.g. in modern standard [[Croatian language|Croatian]]) or even {{IPA|/i/}} in many areas (e.g. in [[Chakavian]] Croatian, [[Shtokavian]] [[Ikavian]] Croatian dialects or [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]) or {{IPA|/e/}} (modern standard [[Serbian language|Serbian]]).\n* The [[yer]]  ([[yer|\u044c]]) and ([[yer|\u044a]]) vowels \u012d and \u016d are often called \"ultrashort\" and were lower, more centralised and shorter than their counterparts i and y/u. They disappeared in most positions in the word, already sporadically in the earliest texts but more frequently later on. They also tended to merge with other vowels, particularly \u012d with e and \u016d with o, but differently in different areas.\n* The exact articulation of the nasal vowels is unclear because different areas tend to merge them with different vowels. \u0119 /\u025b\u0303/ is occasionally seen to merge with e or \u011b in South Slavic, but becomes ja early on in East Slavic. \u01eb /\u0254\u0303/ generally merges with u or o, but in Bulgaria, \u01eb was apparently unrounded and eventually merged with \u016d.\n\n===Phonotactics===\nSeveral notable constraints on the distribution of the phonemes can be identified, mostly resulting from the tendencies occurring within the [[Common Slavic]] period, such as ''intrasyllabic synharmony'' and the ''law of open syllables''. For consonant and vowel clusters and sequences of a consonant and a vowel, the following constraints can be ascertained:<ref>{{Harvnb|Huntley|1993|pp=127\u20138}}.</ref>\n* Two adjacent consonants tend not to share identical features of [[manner of articulation]]\n* No syllable ends in a consonant\n* Every obstruent agrees in voicing with the following obstruent\n* Velars do not occur before front vowels\n* Phonetically palatalized consonants do not occur before certain back vowels\n* The back vowels /y/ and /\u044a/ as well as front vowels other than /i/ do not occur word-initially: the two back vowels take prothetic /v/ and the front vowels prothetic /j/. Initial /a/ may take either prothetic consonant or none at all.\n* Vowel sequences are attested in only one lexeme (''pa\u01eb\u010dina'' 'spider's web') and in the suffixes /aa/ and /\u011ba/ of the imperfect\n* At morpheme boundaries, the following vowel sequences occur: /ai/, /au/, /ao/, /oi/, /ou/, /oo/, /\u011bi/, /\u011bo/\n\n===Morphophonemic alternations===\nAs a result of the [[Slavic first palatalization|first]] and the [[Slavic second palatalization|second]] Slavic palatalizations, velars alternate with dentals and palatals. In addition, as a result of a process usually termed ''iotation'' (or ''iodization''), velars and dentals alternate with palatals in various inflected forms and in word formation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ '''Alternations in velar consonants'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\"| original\n| /k/\n| /g/\n| /x/\n| /sk/\n| /zg/\n| /sx/\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" | first palatalization and iotation\n| /\u010d/\n| /\u017e/\n| /\u0161/\n| /\u0161t/\n| /\u017ed/\n| /\u0161/\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" | second palatalization\n| /c/\n| /dz/\n| /s/\n| /sc/, /st/\n| /zd/\n| /sc/\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Alternations in other consonants'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\"| original\n| /b/\n| /p/\n| /sp/\n| /d/\n| /zd/\n| /t/\n| /st/\n| /z/\n| /s/\n| /l/\n| /sl/\n| /m/\n| /n/\n| /sn/\n| /zn/\n| /r/\n| /tr/\n| /dr/\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\"| iotation\n| /bl'/\n| /pl'/\n|\n| /\u017ed/\n| /\u017ed/\n| /\u0161t/\n| /\u0161t/\n| /\u017e/\n| /\u0161/\n| /l'/\n| /\u0161l'/\n| /ml'/\n| /n'/\n| /\u0161n'/\n| /\u017en'/\n| /r'/\n| /\u0161tr'/\n| /\u017edr'/\n|}\n\nIn some forms the alternations of /c/ with /\u010d/ and of /dz/ with /\u017e/ occur, in which the corresponding velar is missing.

The phonetic value of the corresponding vocalized strong [[yers|jer]] is dialect-specific.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{main|Old Church Slavonic grammar}}\nAs an ancient Indo-European language, OCS has a highly inflective morphology. Inflected forms are divided in two groups, nominals and verbs. Nominals are further divided into nouns, adjectives and pronouns. Numerals inflect either as nouns or pronouns, with 1-4 showing gender agreement as well.\n\nNominals can be declined in three [[grammatical gender]]s (masculine, feminine, neuter), three numbers (singular, plural, [[dual grammatical number|dual]]) and seven [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[dative case|dative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], and [[locative case|locative]]. There are five basic inflectional classes for nouns: ''o/jo''-stems, ''a/ja''-stems, ''i''-stems, ''u''-stems and consonant stems. Forms throughout the inflectional paradigm usually exhibit morphophonemic alternations.\n\nFronting of vowels after palatals and ''j'' yielded dual inflectional class ''o'' : ''jo'' and ''a'' : ''ja'', whereas palatalizations affected stem as a synchronic process (N sg. ''vl\u044ck\u044a'', V sg. ''vl\u044c\u010de''; L sg. ''vl\u044cc\u011b''). Productive classes are ''o/jo-'', ''a/ja-'' and ''i''-stems.

The language has a Southern Slavic basis with an admixture of Western Slavic features inherited during the mission of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] to [[Great Moravia]] (863\u2013885).\n\nThe only well-preserved manuscript of the Moravian recension, the [[Kiev Missal|Kiev Folia]], is characterised by the replacement of some Southern Slavic phonetic and lexical features with Western Slavic ones. Manuscripts written in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] (1185-1396) have, on the other hand, few Western Slavic features.\n\nOld Church Slavonic is valuable to historical linguists since it preserves archaic features believed to have once been common to all Slavic languages such as these:\n\n* Most significantly, the [[yer]] ([[extra-short]]) vowels: {{IPA|/\u012d/}} and {{IPA|/\u016d/}}\n* [[Nasal vowel]]s: {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}}\n* [[Near-open vowel|Near-open]] articulation of the yat vowel ({{IPA|/\u00e6/}})\n* [[Palatal consonant]]s {{IPA|/\u0272/}} and {{IPA|/\u028e/}} from Proto-Slavic *\u0148 and *\u013e\n* Proto-Slavic declension system based on stem endings, including those that later disappeared in attested languages (such as ''u''-stems)\n* [[Dual (grammatical number)|Dual]] as a distinct grammatical number from singular and plural\n* [[Aorist]], [[imperfect]], Proto-Slavic paradigms for participles\n\nOld Church Slavonic is also likely to have preserved an extremely archaic type of accentuation (probably{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} close to the [[Chakavian dialect]] of modern Serbo-Croatian), but unfortunately, no accent marks appear in the written manuscripts.\n\nThe Southern Slavic nature of the language is evident from the following variations:\n\n* Phonetic:\n** ra > {{IPA|/la/}} by means of [[liquid metathesis]] of Proto-Slavic *or, *ol clusters\n** s\u011b from Proto-Slavic *x\u011b < *xai\n** cv, (d)zv from Proto-Slavic *kv\u011b, *gv\u011b < *kvai, *gvai\n*morphosyntactic use of the dative possessive case in personal pronouns and nouns: '\u0440\u046b\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0438' (''r\u01ebka ti'', \"your hand\"), '\u043e\u0442\u044a\u043f\u043e\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0463\u0445\u043e\u043c\u044a' (''ot\u016dpu\u0161ten\u012dje gr\u011bxom\u016d'', \"remission of sins\"); [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] future tense using the verb '\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0463\u0442\u0438' (''xot\u011bti'', \"to want\"); use of the comparative form '\u043c\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0438' (''m\u012dniji'', \"smaller\") to denote \"younger\".\n**morphosyntactic use of suffixed demonstrative pronouns '\u0442\u044a, \u0442\u0430, \u0442\u043e' (''t\u016d, ta, to'').

In the mid-1970s, Lunt held that the differences in the initial OCS were neither great enough nor consistent enough to grant a distinction between a 'Macedonian' recension and a 'Bulgarian' one. A decade later, however, Lunt argued in favour of such a distinction, illustrating his point with paleographic, phonological and other differences.<ref>See: \"American contributions to the Tenth International Congress of Slavists\", Sofia, September 1988, Alexander M.

In all cases, denasalization of the [[yus]]es occurred; so that only Old Church Slavonic, modern [[Polish language|Polish]] and some isolated [[Bulgarian dialects]] retained the old Slavonic nasal vowels.\n\n====Serbian recension====\nThe Serbian recension<ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=7BXJgfIo_fYC&pg=PA4 4]}}.</ref> was written mostly in Cyrillic, but also in the Glagolitic alphabet (depending on region); by the 12th century the Serbs used exclusively the Cyrillic alphabet (and [[Latin script]] in coastal areas). The 1186 [[Miroslav Gospels]] belong to the Serbian recension. They feature the following linguistic characteristics:\n\n* Nasal vowels were denasalised and in one case closed: *\u0119 > e, *\u01eb > u, e.g. OCS r\u01ebka > Sr. ruka (\"hand\"), OCS j\u0119zyk\u044a > Sr. jezik (\"tongue, language\")\n* Extensive use of diacritical signs by the [[Manasija|Resava]] dialect\n* Use of letters ''i, y'' for the sound {{IPA|/i/}} in other manuscripts of the Serbian recension\n\nDue to the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria in 1396, Serbia saw an influx of educated scribes and clergy who re-introduced a more classical form, closer resembling the Bulgarian recension.\nThe letter \ua648 was also created, in place of the sounds *d\u0361\u0291, *t\u0255, *d\u0291 and d\u0361\u0292,also used during the Bosnian recession.\n\n====Russian recension====\nThe Russian recension emerged after the 10th century on the basis of the earlier Bulgarian recension, from which it differed slightly.

The common term \"Middle Bulgarian\" is usually contrasted to \"Old Bulgarian\" (an alternative name for Old Church Slavonic), and loosely used for manuscripts whose language demonstrates a broad spectrum of regional and temporal dialect features after the 11th century.<ref>The definite article in contemporary standard Bulgarian, Gerald L.

[[Havl\u00edk's law|weak-positioned]] [[yers]] *\u044a and *\u044c in merged, probably representing some schwa-like sound, and only one of the letters was used (usually '\u044a'). Evident in earliest documents like [[Ba\u0161ka tablet]].\n* PSl. [[Havl\u00edk's law|strong-positioned]] [[yers]] *\u044a and *\u044c were vocalized into a in most \u0160tokavian and \u010cakavian speeches, e.g. Cr. ''pas'' : OCS ''p\u044cs\u044a'' (\"dog\")\n* PSl. hard and soft syllabic liquids *r and r\u2032 retained syllabicity and were written as simply r, as opposed to OCS sequences of mostly r\u044c and r\u044a, e.g. ''krst\u044a'' and ''trg\u044a'' as opposed to OCS ''kr\u044cst\u044a'' and ''tr\u044ag\u044a'' (\"cross\", \"market\")\n* PSl. #v\u044cC and #v\u044aC > #uC, e.g. Cr. ''udova'' : OCS. ''v\u044adova'' (\"widow\")\n\n==Canon==\nThe core corpus of Old Church Slavonic manuscripts is usually referred to as ''canon''. Manuscripts must satisfy certain linguistic, chronological and cultural criteria to be incorporated into the canon: they must not significantly depart from the language and tradition of Sts. Cyril and Methodius, usually known as the ''Cyrillo-Methodian tradition''.\n\nFor example, the [[Freising Fragments]], dating from the 10th century, show some linguistic and cultural traits of Old Church Slavonic, but they are usually not included in the canon, as some of the phonological features of the writings appear to belong to certain Pannonian Slavic dialect of the period. Similarly, the [[Ostromir Gospels]] exhibits dialectal features that classify it as [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]], rather than South Slavic so it is not included in the canon either. On the other hand, the [[Kiev Missal]] is included in the canon even though it manifests some West Slavic features and contains Western liturgy because of the Bulgarian linguistic layer and connection to the Moravian mission.\n\nManuscripts are usually classified in two groups, depending on the alphabet used, Cyrillic or Glagolitic.

The [[Second Book of Enoch]] was only preserved in Old Church Slavonic, although the original most certainly had been [[Greek language|Greek]] or even [[Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic]].\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name of the language in Old Church Slavonic texts was simply ''Slavic'' (\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u0301\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a \u0469\ua641\ua651\u0301\u043a\u044a, ''slov\u011bn\u012dsk\u016d j\u0119zyk\u016d''),<ref name=nandris>{{Harvnb|Nandris|1959|p=2}}.</ref> derived from the word for ''Slavs'' (\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u0301\u043d\u0454, ''slov\u011bne''), the self-designation of the compilers of the texts. This name is preserved in the modern names of the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] languages. The language is sometimes called ''Old Slavic'', which may be confused with the distinct [[Proto-Slavic language]]. Different strains of [[Nationalism|nationalists]] have tried to 'claim' Old Church Slavonic; thus OCS has also been variously called \"Old Bulgarian\", \"Old Croatian\", \"Old Macedonian\", or \"Old Serbian\", or even \"Old Slovak\", \"Old Slovenian\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kamusella|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JzkWDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA34 34]}}.</ref> The commonly accepted terms in modern English-language [[Slavistics|Slavic studies]] are ''Old Church Slavonic'' and ''Old Church Slavic''.\n\nThe term ''Old Bulgarian''<ref>[http://www.centerslo.net/files/File/simpozij/sim20/ziffer.pdf Ziffer, Giorgio \u2013 On the Historicity of Old Church Slavonic UDK 811.163.1(091)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627094728/http://www.centerslo.net/files/File/simpozij/sim20/ziffer.pdf |date=2008-06-27 }}</ref> ({{lang-de|Altbulgarisch}}) is the only designation used by [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian-language]] writers.

For that purpose, Cyril and his brother Methodius started to translate religious literature to Old Church Slavonic, allegedly based on the [[Slavic languages|Slavic dialects]] spoken in the hinterland of their hometown,  [[Thessaloniki]],<ref>After the [[Slavs]] invaded it.<br/>{{Harvnb|Curta|2006|p=214}}: \"At the emperor's request, Constantine and his brother started the translation of religious texts into Old Church Slavonic, a literary language most likely based on the Macedonian dialect allegedly used in the hinterland of their home-town, Thessalonica.\"</ref> in today's [[Greece]].\n\nAs part of the preparation for the mission, in 862/863, the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was created and the most important prayers and [[liturgical book]]s, including the Aprakos Evangeliar (a [[Gospel Book]] [[lectionary]] containing only feast-day and Sunday readings), the [[Psalter]], and [[Acts of the Apostles]], were translated. (The Gospels were also translated early, but it is unclear whether Sts. Cyril or Methodius had a hand in this.)\n\nThe language and the alphabet were taught at the Great Moravian Academy ({{lang-sk|Ve\u013ekomoravsk\u00e9 u\u010dili\u0161te}}) and were used for government and religious documents and books between 863 and 885. The texts written during this phase contain characteristics of the Slavic [[vernacular]]s in Great Moravia.\n\nIn 885, the use of Old Church Slavonic in Great Moravia was prohibited by [[Pope Stephen V]] in favour of [[Latin]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&pg=PA310 310]}}.</ref>\n\nStudents of the two [[equal-to-apostles|apostles]] who were expelled from Great Moravia in 886, including [[Clement of Ohrid]] and [[Saint Naum]], brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] and were received and accepted officially by [[Boris I of Bulgaria]].

Old Church Slavonic spread to other South-Eastern, Central, and Eastern European Slavic territories, most notably [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Lesser Poland]], and principalities of the [[Kievan Rus']] while retaining characteristically [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] linguistic features.\n\nLater texts written in each of those territories then began to take on characteristics of the local Slavic vernaculars and, by the mid-11th century, Old Church Slavonic had diversified into a number of regional varieties (known as ''recensions'').

They also tended to merge with other vowels, particularly \u012d with e and \u016d with o, but differently in different areas.\n* The exact articulation of the nasal vowels is unclear because different areas tend to merge them with different vowels. \u0119 /\u025b\u0303/ is occasionally seen to merge with e or \u011b in South Slavic, but becomes ja early on in East Slavic. \u01eb /\u0254\u0303/ generally merges with u or o, but in Bulgaria, \u01eb was apparently unrounded and eventually merged with \u016d.\n\n===Phonotactics===\nSeveral notable constraints on the distribution of the phonemes can be identified, mostly resulting from the tendencies occurring within the [[Common Slavic]] period, such as ''intrasyllabic synharmony'' and the ''law of open syllables''. For consonant and vowel clusters and sequences of a consonant and a vowel, the following constraints can be ascertained:<ref>{{Harvnb|Huntley|1993|pp=127\u20138}}.</ref>\n* Two adjacent consonants tend not to share identical features of [[manner of articulation]]\n* No syllable ends in a consonant\n* Every obstruent agrees in voicing with the following obstruent\n* Velars do not occur before front vowels\n* Phonetically palatalized consonants do not occur before certain back vowels\n* The back vowels /y/ and /\u044a/ as well as front vowels other than /i/ do not occur word-initially: the two back vowels take prothetic /v/ and the front vowels prothetic /j/. Initial /a/ may take either prothetic consonant or none at all.\n* Vowel sequences are attested in only one lexeme (''pa\u01eb\u010dina'' 'spider's web') and in the suffixes /aa/ and /\u011ba/ of the imperfect\n* At morpheme boundaries, the following vowel sequences occur: /ai/, /au/, /ao/, /oi/, /ou/, /oo/, /\u011bi/, /\u011bo/\n\n===Morphophonemic alternations===\nAs a result of the [[Slavic first palatalization|first]] and the [[Slavic second palatalization|second]] Slavic palatalizations, velars alternate with dentals and palatals. In addition, as a result of a process usually termed ''iotation'' (or ''iodization''), velars and dentals alternate with palatals in various inflected forms and in word formation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ '''Alternations in velar consonants'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\"| original\n| /k/\n| /g/\n| /x/\n| /sk/\n| /zg/\n| /sx/\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" | first palatalization and iotation\n| /\u010d/\n| /\u017e/\n| /\u0161/\n| /\u0161t/\n| /\u017ed/\n| /\u0161/\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" | second palatalization\n| /c/\n| /dz/\n| /s/\n| /sc/, /st/\n| /zd/\n| /sc/\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Alternations in other consonants'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\"| original\n| /b/\n| /p/\n| /sp/\n| /d/\n| /zd/\n| /t/\n| /st/\n| /z/\n| /s/\n| /l/\n| /sl/\n| /m/\n| /n/\n| /sn/\n| /zn/\n| /r/\n| /tr/\n| /dr/\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\"| iotation\n| /bl'/\n| /pl'/\n|\n| /\u017ed/\n| /\u017ed/\n| /\u0161t/\n| /\u0161t/\n| /\u017e/\n| /\u0161/\n| /l'/\n| /\u0161l'/\n| /ml'/\n| /n'/\n| /\u0161n'/\n| /\u017en'/\n| /r'/\n| /\u0161tr'/\n| /\u017edr'/\n|}\n\nIn some forms the alternations of /c/ with /\u010d/ and of /dz/ with /\u017e/ occur, in which the corresponding velar is missing.

The phonetic value of the corresponding vocalized strong [[yers|jer]] is dialect-specific.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{main|Old Church Slavonic grammar}}\nAs an ancient Indo-European language, OCS has a highly inflective morphology. Inflected forms are divided in two groups, nominals and verbs. Nominals are further divided into nouns, adjectives and pronouns. Numerals inflect either as nouns or pronouns, with 1-4 showing gender agreement as well.\n\nNominals can be declined in three [[grammatical gender]]s (masculine, feminine, neuter), three numbers (singular, plural, [[dual grammatical number|dual]]) and seven [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[dative case|dative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], and [[locative case|locative]]. There are five basic inflectional classes for nouns: ''o/jo''-stems, ''a/ja''-stems, ''i''-stems, ''u''-stems and consonant stems. Forms throughout the inflectional paradigm usually exhibit morphophonemic alternations.\n\nFronting of vowels after palatals and ''j'' yielded dual inflectional class ''o'' : ''jo'' and ''a'' : ''ja'', whereas palatalizations affected stem as a synchronic process (N sg. ''vl\u044ck\u044a'', V sg. ''vl\u044c\u010de''; L sg. ''vl\u044cc\u011b''). Productive classes are ''o/jo-'', ''a/ja-'' and ''i''-stems.

The language has a Southern Slavic basis with an admixture of Western Slavic features inherited during the mission of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] to [[Great Moravia]] (863\u2013885).\n\nThe only well-preserved manuscript of the Moravian recension, the [[Kiev Missal|Kiev Folia]], is characterised by the replacement of some Southern Slavic phonetic and lexical features with Western Slavic ones. Manuscripts written in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] (1185-1396) have, on the other hand, few Western Slavic features.\n\nOld Church Slavonic is valuable to historical linguists since it preserves archaic features believed to have once been common to all Slavic languages such as these:\n\n* Most significantly, the [[yer]] ([[extra-short]]) vowels: {{IPA|/\u012d/}} and {{IPA|/\u016d/}}\n* [[Nasal vowel]]s: {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}}\n* [[Near-open vowel|Near-open]] articulation of the yat vowel ({{IPA|/\u00e6/}})\n* [[Palatal consonant]]s {{IPA|/\u0272/}} and {{IPA|/\u028e/}} from Proto-Slavic *\u0148 and *\u013e\n* Proto-Slavic declension system based on stem endings, including those that later disappeared in attested languages (such as ''u''-stems)\n* [[Dual (grammatical number)|Dual]] as a distinct grammatical number from singular and plural\n* [[Aorist]], [[imperfect]], Proto-Slavic paradigms for participles\n\nOld Church Slavonic is also likely to have preserved an extremely archaic type of accentuation (probably{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} close to the [[Chakavian dialect]] of modern Serbo-Croatian), but unfortunately, no accent marks appear in the written manuscripts.\n\nThe Southern Slavic nature of the language is evident from the following variations:\n\n* Phonetic:\n** ra > {{IPA|/la/}} by means of [[liquid metathesis]] of Proto-Slavic *or, *ol clusters\n** s\u011b from Proto-Slavic *x\u011b < *xai\n** cv, (d)zv from Proto-Slavic *kv\u011b, *gv\u011b < *kvai, *gvai\n*morphosyntactic use of the dative possessive case in personal pronouns and nouns: '\u0440\u046b\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0438' (''r\u01ebka ti'', \"your hand\"), '\u043e\u0442\u044a\u043f\u043e\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0463\u0445\u043e\u043c\u044a' (''ot\u016dpu\u0161ten\u012dje gr\u011bxom\u016d'', \"remission of sins\"); [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] future tense using the verb '\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0463\u0442\u0438' (''xot\u011bti'', \"to want\"); use of the comparative form '\u043c\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0438' (''m\u012dniji'', \"smaller\") to denote \"younger\".\n**morphosyntactic use of suffixed demonstrative pronouns '\u0442\u044a, \u0442\u0430, \u0442\u043e' (''t\u016d, ta, to'').

In the mid-1970s, Lunt held that the differences in the initial OCS were neither great enough nor consistent enough to grant a distinction between a 'Macedonian' recension and a 'Bulgarian' one. A decade later, however, Lunt argued in favour of such a distinction, illustrating his point with paleographic, phonological and other differences.<ref>See: \"American contributions to the Tenth International Congress of Slavists\", Sofia, September 1988, Alexander M.

In all cases, denasalization of the [[yus]]es occurred; so that only Old Church Slavonic, modern [[Polish language|Polish]] and some isolated [[Bulgarian dialects]] retained the old Slavonic nasal vowels.\n\n====Serbian recension====\nThe Serbian recension<ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=7BXJgfIo_fYC&pg=PA4 4]}}.</ref> was written mostly in Cyrillic, but also in the Glagolitic alphabet (depending on region); by the 12th century the Serbs used exclusively the Cyrillic alphabet (and [[Latin script]] in coastal areas). The 1186 [[Miroslav Gospels]] belong to the Serbian recension. They feature the following linguistic characteristics:\n\n* Nasal vowels were denasalised and in one case closed: *\u0119 > e, *\u01eb > u, e.g. OCS r\u01ebka > Sr. ruka (\"hand\"), OCS j\u0119zyk\u044a > Sr. jezik (\"tongue, language\")\n* Extensive use of diacritical signs by the [[Manasija|Resava]] dialect\n* Use of letters ''i, y'' for the sound {{IPA|/i/}} in other manuscripts of the Serbian recension\n\nDue to the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria in 1396, Serbia saw an influx of educated scribes and clergy who re-introduced a more classical form, closer resembling the Bulgarian recension.\nThe letter \ua648 was also created, in place of the sounds *d\u0361\u0291, *t\u0255, *d\u0291 and d\u0361\u0292,also used during the Bosnian recession.\n\n====Russian recension====\nThe Russian recension emerged after the 10th century on the basis of the earlier Bulgarian recension, from which it differed slightly.

The common term \"Middle Bulgarian\" is usually contrasted to \"Old Bulgarian\" (an alternative name for Old Church Slavonic), and loosely used for manuscripts whose language demonstrates a broad spectrum of regional and temporal dialect features after the 11th century.<ref>The definite article in contemporary standard Bulgarian, Gerald L.

[[Havl\u00edk's law|weak-positioned]] [[yers]] *\u044a and *\u044c in merged, probably representing some schwa-like sound, and only one of the letters was used (usually '\u044a'). Evident in earliest documents like [[Ba\u0161ka tablet]].\n* PSl. [[Havl\u00edk's law|strong-positioned]] [[yers]] *\u044a and *\u044c were vocalized into a in most \u0160tokavian and \u010cakavian speeches, e.g. Cr. ''pas'' : OCS ''p\u044cs\u044a'' (\"dog\")\n* PSl. hard and soft syllabic liquids *r and r\u2032 retained syllabicity and were written as simply r, as opposed to OCS sequences of mostly r\u044c and r\u044a, e.g. ''krst\u044a'' and ''trg\u044a'' as opposed to OCS ''kr\u044cst\u044a'' and ''tr\u044ag\u044a'' (\"cross\", \"market\")\n* PSl. #v\u044cC and #v\u044aC > #uC, e.g. Cr. ''udova'' : OCS. ''v\u044adova'' (\"widow\")\n\n==Canon==\nThe core corpus of Old Church Slavonic manuscripts is usually referred to as ''canon''. Manuscripts must satisfy certain linguistic, chronological and cultural criteria to be incorporated into the canon: they must not significantly depart from the language and tradition of Sts. Cyril and Methodius, usually known as the ''Cyrillo-Methodian tradition''.\n\nFor example, the [[Freising Fragments]], dating from the 10th century, show some linguistic and cultural traits of Old Church Slavonic, but they are usually not included in the canon, as some of the phonological features of the writings appear to belong to certain Pannonian Slavic dialect of the period. Similarly, the [[Ostromir Gospels]] exhibits dialectal features that classify it as [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]], rather than South Slavic so it is not included in the canon either. On the other hand, the [[Kiev Missal]] is included in the canon even though it manifests some West Slavic features and contains Western liturgy because of the Bulgarian linguistic layer and connection to the Moravian mission.\n\nManuscripts are usually classified in two groups, depending on the alphabet used, Cyrillic or Glagolitic.

The [[Second Book of Enoch]] was only preserved in Old Church Slavonic, although the original most certainly had been [[Greek language|Greek]] or even [[Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic]].\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name of the language in Old Church Slavonic texts was simply ''Slavic'' (\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u0301\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a \u0469\ua641\ua651\u0301\u043a\u044a, ''slov\u011bn\u012dsk\u016d j\u0119zyk\u016d''),<ref name=nandris>{{Harvnb|Nandris|1959|p=2}}.</ref> derived from the word for ''Slavs'' (\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u0301\u043d\u0454, ''slov\u011bne''), the self-designation of the compilers of the texts. This name is preserved in the modern names of the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] languages. The language is sometimes called ''Old Slavic'', which may be confused with the distinct [[Proto-Slavic language]]. Different strains of [[Nationalism|nationalists]] have tried to 'claim' Old Church Slavonic; thus OCS has also been variously called \"Old Bulgarian\", \"Old Croatian\", \"Old Macedonian\", or \"Old Serbian\", or even \"Old Slovak\", \"Old Slovenian\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kamusella|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JzkWDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA34 34]}}.</ref> The commonly accepted terms in modern English-language [[Slavistics|Slavic studies]] are ''Old Church Slavonic'' and ''Old Church Slavic''.\n\nThe term ''Old Bulgarian''<ref>[http://www.centerslo.net/files/File/simpozij/sim20/ziffer.pdf Ziffer, Giorgio \u2013 On the Historicity of Old Church Slavonic UDK 811.163.1(091)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627094728/http://www.centerslo.net/files/File/simpozij/sim20/ziffer.pdf |date=2008-06-27 }}</ref> ({{lang-de|Altbulgarisch}}) is the only designation used by [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian-language]] writers.

The most substantial of these merchants apparently was Benjamin Levy, probably the same mentioned in the \"''[[Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society]]''\" (i. 21).<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society]]|volume=i|page=21|oclc=610404578}}</ref><ref name=Jewish/>}}\n\nIn 1781 Jacob Hart, father-in-law of [[Haym Salomon]], headed a subscription of \u00a32,000 ($10,000) loaned to [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] for the relief of the detachment under his command.<ref name=\"Jewish\">{{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2420-baltimore|article=BALTIMORE|accessdate=Feb 11, 2014}}<br />'''''Jewish Encyclopedia'' bibliography:'''\n*Archives of the congregations;\n*files of the Occident and of the local newspapers;\n*personal reminiscences of older members of the Jewish community;\n*''[[Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society|Publications of the American-Jewish Historical Society]]'', No. 1, pp. 21, 22;\n**No. 2, pp. 65, 66;\n**No, 4, pp. 94\u201396.</ref>\n\n== Jewish cemetery in 1786 ==\n\nThe existence of a [[Jewish cemetery]] in 1786 indicates a [[Jewish community]] of some size. How long previous to that year the cemetery had been established is not known. The earliest mention of it occurs in a document (the document was in the possession of Mr. Mendes Cohen of Baltimore), dated July 12, 1786, headed \"Mr. Carroll's <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> claims\". It is a \"list of the names of the Persons who occupy the ground (supposed to be about 2 acres) on the east side of [[Jones Falls|Jones's Falls]], . . . with an account of the improvements\". One of the items is \"The Jews burying-ground, 1 small lot enclosed\", situated in Ensor's Town, near [[Monument Street|East Monument street]]. A deed dated Dec. 26, 1801, conveys this same burying-ground from Charles Carroll to Levi Solomon and [[Solomon Etting]], for a consideration of five shillings; and another, dated Dec. 29, 1801, for a consideration of $80, conveys it to the same parties from Wm. McMechen and John Leggett. Interment has been made in it as late as 1832, the same year in which the oldest Jewish cemetery now in use was established. No indications can be discovered of the removal of remains buried in it when the cemetery was abandoned.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nAccording to the 1906 ''Jewish Encyclopedia'':{{bq|On the testimony of a resident close by, the last tombstone was removed, surreptitiously, presumably for building purposes, as recently as from forty to fifty years ago.<ref name=Jewish/>}}\n\n== The Etting family ==\n\nWith the advent of the Etting family, the history of the Jewish community in Baltimore becomes better documented. It is uncertain when the Etting brothers, Reuben and [[Solomon Etting|Solomon]], together with Levi Solomon, their uncle, came to Baltimore from [[York, Pa.]] On Jan. 4, 1796, Solomon Etting's name appears in the \"''Advertiser''\" as one of five persons authorized \"to receive proposals in writing for a house or suitable lot\" for a bank to be established in Baltimore Town. But there are indirect indications that the family settled in Baltimore before 1787. In the list of stockholders of the same bank, published at the end of 1796, appear the following names: Solomon, Kitty, Reuben, Shinah, and Hetty Etting; Jacob F., [[Philadelphia]], Benjamin, and Hetty Levy; and Levy and Myer Solomon. In the first directory of \"Baltimore Town and [[Fell's Point]]\", also published in 1796 \u2013 the year of the incorporation of Baltimore as a city \u2013 there are, in addition to the above, two [[Hart (surname)|Hart]]s, three [[Jacob (surname)|Jacob]]s, Philip Itzchkin, \u2013 Kahn, Benjamin Lyon, Solomon Raphael, and Isaac Solomon; and in the lists of letters remaining at the post-office occur the names of Hhym Levenstene and Benjamin Myers. Accordingly, the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' estimates the Jewish population of Baltimore in 1796 at fifteen families.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Jews elected to City Council ==\n\nIn 1798 the Collmus family arrived from [[Bohemia]]; and in 1808 the six sons of Israel J. Cohen came, with their mother, from [[Richmond, Va.]] The Cohens and the Ettings played a prominent part in the history of Baltimore Jewry, and in that of the city also. Both families acquired an enviable reputation for integrity and business tact; and their members were honored with offices of trust, by corporations and in the city government. Their names figure most prominently in the emancipation struggle of 1818\u201326, during which time the \"[[Jew Bill (Maryland)|Jew Bill]]\" was debated in the legislature of Maryland. This bill proposed \"to consider the justice and expediency of extending to those persons professing the Jewish religion the same privileges that are enjoyed by [[Christians]]\". Immediately upon its passage, and its ratification in the [[legislative session]] of 1825\u201326, it was applied practically in the election of Solomon Etting and [[Jacob I. Cohen Jr.|Jacob I. Cohen, JR.]], to seats in the [[Baltimore City Council|city council of Baltimore]].<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nIn more recent times, the 5th District has been represented by two Jews, first by Rochelle \"Rikki\" Spector from 1997\u20132016, and then by Isaac \"Yitzy\" Schleifer since 2016, who is also the first openly Orthodox Jew to hold office in Baltimore City.\n\n== Organization of Religious worship ==\n\nAfter 1826 the recorded history of the Jews of Baltimore ceases to be the history of prominent individuals, and becomes that of a community. Almost coincidentally with the removal of civil disabilities occurs the first of a series of regular meetings for religious [[Jewish services|services]], whose continuity has been uninterrupted. According to the recollections of one participant, this meeting took place in Holliday street, near Pleasant street, at the house of Zalma Rehin\u00e9, a former resident of Richmond, Va., and an uncle of [[Isaac Leeser]]. According to the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', this may possibly have been the beginning of the congregation Nidche Israel, later known as the \"[[Baltimore Hebrew Congregation]],\" or as the \"Stadt-Schul\", probably because almost simultaneously with its origin another settlement of Jews, at Fell's Point \u2013 an outlying and at first separate district \u2013 began to crystallize into a congregation, called the \"Fell's Point Hebrew Friendship Congregation\", and regularly organized since 1838. The Nidche Israel soon found it necessary to rent rooms on North Exeter street, near what is now Lexington street. Thence the congregation moved to a one-story dwelling off High street, near the bend between [[Fayette Street|Fayette]] and Gay streets, or near what is now Lexington street, the entrance being through a narrow alley. In 1837 a three-story brick building was bought, at the southwest corner of Harrison street and \u00c6tna lane. In 1845 the congregation removed to Lloyd and Watson streets, the new synagogue being dedicated by the Rev. S. M. Isaacs of New York and the Rev. Isaac Leeser of Philadelphia, together with the ministers of the congregation, [[Abraham Rice|A. Rice]] and A. Ansell (Anshel). Here it worshiped until April 6, 1889, when a new building was erected on [[Madison Avenue (Baltimore)|Madison avenue]] and Robert street. The date of the congregational charter is Jan. 29, 1830 (supplementary act, 1851). The incorporators were Moses Millem (Mulheim), Joseph Osterman, John M. Dyer, Louis Silver, and Levi Benjamin.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThe first rabbi of the congregation was the above-mentioned Abraham Rice (Reiss), whose piety and character have left a lasting impress upon the community, especially through his influence upon the youths he taught, some of them later becoming its leaders. Rice established a school for instruction in [[Hebrew]] in 1845, and he officiated as the rabbi of the congregation from 1840 to 1849, and again from the spring of 1862 to Oct. 29 of the same year, the date of his death. Other rabbis of the congregation have been: Julius Spiro, in conjunction with Mr. Rice (1846\u201347); Henry Hochheimer (1849\u201359); [[Bernard Illowy|B. Illoway]] (1859\u201361); Abraham Hofman (1868\u201373); Maurice Fluegel (1881\u201384); A. S. Bettelheim (1886\u201390); and Adolf Guttmacher (1891). The burial-ground belonging to the congregation was bought in 1832, at which time it covered three acres.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nRabbis of the Fell's Point Congregation, later worshiping on Eden street, have been: Aaron G\u00fcnzburg (1848\u201356); Henry Hochheimer (1859\u201392); W. Willner (1892\u201394); Clifton H. Levy (1894\u201396): and M. Rosenstein (1896). This congregation, as well as the one or two ''chebrot'' of which records up to 1842 have been preserved, had separated from, or organized themselves independently of, the mother congregation, Nidche Israel, only for reasons of convenience, on account of the extended space over which the community was scattered.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nIn 1842 the desire for a radical [[Reform Judaism|change in the liturgy]] resulted in the formation of the Har Sinai Verein, whose rabbis have been: Max Sutro (about 1842); Moritz Brown (about 1849\u201355); [[David Einhorn (rabbi)|David Einhorn]] (1855\u201361); S. Deutsch (1862\u201373); [[Jacob Mayer]] (1874\u201376); [[Emil G. Hirsch]] (1877\u201378); S. Sale (1878\u201383); [[David Philipson]] (1884\u201388); Tobias Shanfarber (1888\u201398); and Charles A. Rubenstein (1898). The congregation later erected a new house of worship on [[Bolton Street|Bolton]] and Wilson streets.<ref name=Jewish/> In 1873, a new charter was granted and the name was changed from Har Sinai Verein to [[Har Sinai Congregation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harsinai-md.org/history_2.php |title=Other important dates in Har Sinai Congregation history |publisher=Har Sinai Congregation |accessdate=Feb 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311003941/http://www.harsinai-md.org/history_2.php |archivedate=March 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== \"Oheb Shalom\" Congregation ==\n{{Main|Temple Oheb Shalom (Baltimore, Maryland)}}\nA similar desire for a revised liturgy, but along more conservative lines, led to the formation of the Oheb Shalom Congregation in Sept., 1853, on the part of a number of dissidents from the original body. Rabbis of this congregation, whose new synagogue on [[Eutaw Place|Eutaw place]] and Lanvale street was considered one of the most beautiful structures in the city, have been the following: \u2013 Salomon (1854); S. M. Landsberg (1856\u201357); [[Benjamin Szold]]; and [[William Rosenau]] (1892). [[Alois Kaiser]], known as a composer of [[synagogue music]], has been the cantor of this congregation since 1866.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThis was followed by the formation of three [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] congregations, the earliest of which was the Bikur Cholim Congregation, incorporated in 1865. The [[Chizuk Amuno Congregation|Chizuk Emoonah Congregation]] was formed in 1871 by dissidents from the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation, which had begun to introduce innovations into the synagogue service. The rabbi of the Chizuk Emoonah was Henry W. Schneeberger, who has occupied the rabbinate since 1876. A new synagogue has later been built by the congregation at [[McCulloh Street|McCulloh]] and [[Mosher Street|Mosher street]]s. In 1878, the Shearith Israel Congregation was formed by the consolidation of two small congregations. S. Schaffer was its rabbi since 1893.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nSince then, in the organization of twenty other congregations in Baltimore \u2013 only eight of which having a house of worship of their own \u2013 the determining factor, in a few cases, has been convenience of locality, but more frequently the bond of national affiliation brought from European countries and reinforced by conservatism in religious sentiment.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nAn attempt was made in 1856\u201359 to hold services according to the liturgy of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish and Portuguese]] [[Sephardim]], of which [[Solomon Nunes Carvalho]] was the chief promoter. The congregation was regularly organized in 1857, under the name \"Beth Israel\", with Jacob M. De Solla as minister.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nOf the eight large cemeteries in the city, one, called \"Rosedale\", was used by seven congregations and three societies; another, on the [[Philadelphia Road|Philadelphia road]], by eight congregations and two societies; and a third, on the Washington road, by three congregations and one society. Each of five congregations, the Baltimore Hebrew, the Fell's Point, the Har Sinai, the Oheb Shalom, and the [[B'nai Israel Synagogue (Baltimore)|B'nai Israel]], had a cemetery of its own. Besides, there was a small cemetery, now disused, on the Philadelphia road, which was formerly maintained by what was called, for unknown reasons, \"Die Irische \u1e24ebra\". The Cohen family and the Etting family owned private cemeteries.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Charitable societies ==\n\nThe first [[Jewish charity|charitable]] association was the Hebrew Assistance Society (1843?), incorporated in 1856 as the \"Hebrew Benevolent Society of Baltimore\". In the latter year was founded also the Hebrew Ladies' [[Sewing circle|Sewing Society]], which, though an independent body, has always adapted its activities to those of the general organization. The building of the [[LifeBridge Health#Sinai Hospital|Hebrew Hospital and Asylum Association]] \u2013 a society for the [[Bikur cholim|care of the sick]] and the shelter of the aged \u2013 was dedicated in 1868, the first steps toward this end having been taken in 1859; and in 1872 the [[Hebrew Orphan Asylum (Baltimore, Maryland)|Hebrew Orphan Asylum]] was established. Both these institutions had active auxiliary organizations. The other charitable institutions with permanent homes were the Hebrew Friendly Inn and Aged Home, established in 1891, and the Working Girls' Home, founded in 1899 by the Daughters in Israel, and supported by that association.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThere were, besides, two Hebrew free [[Chevra kadisha|burial societies]], a Hebrew [[Gemach|free loan association]], the Daughters in Israel of Baltimore City (a personal service sisterhood with various activities), and a number of mutual [[Benefit society|benefit]] and relief associations. The [[Baron de Hirsch]] Fund from the first established a local committee in Baltimore whose affairs have been administered by Dr. A. Friedenwald.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Educational establishments ==\n\nCongregational [[Jewish schools|schools]], at which daily instruction was given in Hebrew and [[German language|German]], and later in English, flourished until after 1870. The most successful were conducted by Joseph Sachs and Jonas Goldsmith. The Society for Educating Poor and Orphan Hebrew Children (later named \"Hebrew Education Society of Baltimore\") was founded in 1852, and incorporated in 1860. In 1901, it had two schools, a daily [[Hebrew school]], and a weekly mission school for religious instruction, whose work was supplemented by that of the Frank Free Sabbath School, established and supported by Mrs. S. L. Frank. The first Sunday school, patterned after the one founded by Miss [[Rebecca Gratz]] in Philadelphia, was opened in 1856. In it a large number of children were taught during the years preceding the establishment of congregational religious schools. The [[Talmud Torah]] School, with a building of its own, was established in 1889, and the Hebrew Free [[Kindergarten]] and [[Day Nursery]] in 1895. The organization known as \"The Maccabeans\" maintained an evening class and a library for the use of boys and young men; continuing in a measure the work begun by the Night School, existing from 1889 to 1899 under the auspices of the [[Isaac Baer Levinsohn|Isaac bar Levison]] Hebrew Literary Society, and supported in part by the Baron de Hirsch Fund, for the purpose of teaching English to immigrants.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nAt three different times short-lived attempts have been made to maintain [[Young Men's Hebrew Association|Young Men's Hebrew associations]], the first of which existed from 1854 to 1860.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThere were three [[Zionist]] societies; a branch of the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]]; a section and a junior section of the Council of Jewish Women; six lodges of the [[Independent Order of B'nai B'rith|Independent Order B'nai B'rith]]; three of the Independent Order B'rith Abraham; one of the Independent Order Free Sons of Israel; three of the Independent Order Free Sons of Judah; four of the Independent Order Sons of Benjamin; five of the Order Ahawas Israel; seven of the Order B'rith Abraham; and one of the Order Kesher Shel Barzel.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n[[Chabad]] continues the legacy of [[Jewish education]] in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Mindy|title=Jewish School in Baltimore Gets an Unusual Gift: A Building|url=http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/2777701/jewish/Jewish-School-in-Baltimore-Gets-an-Unusual-Gift-A-Building.htm|publisher=Chabad.org|date=November 30, 2014|quote=It's not often that someone receives a 55,000-square-foot building as a gift.

In the city, Jews have filled numerous minor offices, notably as [[Councilman|councilmen]], [[justices of the peace]], [[Board of election supervisors|supervisors of elections]], and in the city [[Department of Law|law department]], as well as on boards and special commissions. Myer Block was judge of the [[Orphans' Court]] in Baltimore; [[Jacob Harry Hollander|Jacob H. Hollander]] was secretary to the International [[Bimetallism|Bimetallic]] Commission, and the first [[treasurer]] of [[Porto Rico]] under American jurisdiction. [[Isidor Rayner]] served as [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] in the [[Fiftieth Congress|fiftieth]], the [[Fifty-second Congress|fifty-second]], and the [[Fifty-third Congress|fifty-third]] [[United States Congress|congress]]es, after having sat in the [[Maryland House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] and the [[Maryland State Senate|Senate of the state]]; later he was [[Attorney General of Maryland|attorney-general of the state]]. Among the state senators have been Jacob M. Moses and Lewis Putzel; and among the delegates: Mendes I. Cohen, [[Martin Emerich]], Harry A. Fuld, M. S. Hess, Emanuel H. Jacobi, Martin Lehmayer, Lewis Putzel, and Charles J. Wiener. In the business world the Jews of Baltimore have occupied an important position. To a great extent they controlled the manufacture of wearing apparel for men. Several of the largest department stores were conducted by Jews; and as [[financiers]] they bore an enviable reputation for probity and for a spirit of far-sighted and cautious enterprise.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nBaltimore Jews have had prominent representatives in all the professions. Jewish [[physicians]], men and women, have occupied positions as [[professors]] in the [[medical colleges]], including: A. B. Arnold, Joshua I. Cohen, Aaron Friedenwald, Harry Friedenwald, and Julius Friedenwald. Jews have devoted themselves to the writing of medical and legal works. There were [[List of Jewish American journalists|Jewish journalists]] on the editorial staffs of several of the daily newspapers. The following Jews have been connected with [[Johns Hopkins University]] in the capacity of [[List of Johns Hopkins University people#Notable faculty|professors and instructors]]: [[J. J. Sylvester]], [[Fabian Franklin]], Abraham Cohen, [[Maurice Bloomfield]], [[Cyrus Adler]], [[Jacob Hollander|J. H. Hollander]], [[Simon Flexner]], Caspar Levias, and William Rosenau. In the [[Baltimore Public Schools|public schools]] upward of sixty Jewish teachers were employed. [[Ephraim Keyser]] has won reputation as a [[sculpture|sculptor]], and Mendes Cohen as a [[civil engineer]].<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThe wider educational life has found promoters among the Jews. Jacob I. Cohen, JR., was active in the establishment of the public-school system of Baltimore; and his nephews were instrumental in placing in the Johns Hopkins University the \"Cohen Collection of Egyptian Antiquities\", collected by his brother, Col. Mendes I. Cohen, in [[Egypt]]. At the same university Leopold Strouse established a rabbinical library, to which he made annual additions; Mrs. S. L. Frank and Albert W. Rayner have founded a [[Semitic studies|Semitic]] fellowship in memory of their father, William S. Rayner; and Henry and Mrs. Sonneborn have presented the university with a collection of [[Jewish ceremonial art|Jewish ceremonial]] objects. At the Cohen residence was a library valuable to [[Bible]] students, collected by Dr. Joshua I. Cohen (a [[Library catalog|catalogue]] of this library, compiled by Cyrus Adler, was privately printed in 1887).<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Military services ==\n\nJews enlisted from Baltimore for service in each of the [[List of US wars|national wars]]. Nathaniel Levy fought under Lafayette in the [[Yorktown campaign|campaign of 1781]]; and Reuben Etting (not the one mentioned above) was taken [[prisoner]] by the [[British Army|British]] at [[Charlestown, South Carolina|Charlestown]]. Among the [[Defense (military)|defenders]] of [[Fort McHenry]], near Baltimore, during the [[War of 1812]], were the brothers Mendes I. and Philip I. Cohen. In [[The Mexican War|the Mexican war]], Moritz Henry Weil served as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in [[Company (military unit)|Company]] A, [[3rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment|Third Regiment, United States Artillery]], and Louis Hamburger as a private in Company C, Baltimore Battalion. According to the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', \"[a] company of militia composed entirely of Jews was formed, with Levi Benjamin as [[First lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]]; but it is not probable that it saw active service\". In the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil war]] there were as many Baltimore Jews in the [[Confederate army|Confederate]] as in the Federal army.

A directory of 1835 gives the names of 40 householders in Baltimore, identified as Jews by a Jewish resident whose memory goes back to that year. To these can be added at least 15 more names culled from the records of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation, making a Jewish population of about 300 souls, bearing such names as [[Cohen (surname)|Cohen]], [[Dyer (surname)|Dyer]], Friedenwald, [[Horwitz]], Kayton, Keyser, [[Preiss]], and [[Rosenstock]], whose descendants continued to be prominent in Baltimore and other cities. In the \"''[[The Occident and American Jewish Advocate|Occident]]''\" of Dec., 1856, an anonymous correspondent put the number of Jews then residing in the city at 8,000 \u2013 an exaggerated estimate according to the ''Jewish Encyclopedia''.

As an immigrant port of entry and border town between [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]] and as a manufacturing center in its own right, Baltimore has been well-positioned to reflect developments in [[American Jewish]] life. Yet, the [[Jewish community]] of Baltimore has maintained its own distinctive character as well.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |title=Baltimore |edition=2nd |volume=3 |pages=97}}</ref>\n\n== Earliest Jews in Baltimore ==\n\nThe 1906 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' states:{{bq|It can not be determined when Jews first settled in Baltimore. There were none among the buyers of lots when Baltimore Town was laid out in 1729\u201330; but as Jews are known to have been resident in Maryland in the middle of the seventeenth century, it is not hazardous to suppose that the quickly growing town attracted some of their descendants early in its history. Family traditions, not yet verified, seem to point to the presence of Jews in Baltimore in the middle of the eighteenth century. In his \"''The Hebrews in America''\" (p. 93),<ref>{{cite book|year=1888|title=The Hebrews in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mXYWjKbnRwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Hebrews+in+America&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KyL8UpGCJMP_kAe6jYCYDQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=93&f=false|location=New York|page=93|lccn=03004959|oclc=258059568|accessdate=Feb 12, 2014}}</ref> [[Isaac Markens]] mentions Jacob Myers as the earliest Jew in Baltimore, probably basing his assertion upon the following passage from Griffith's \"''Annals of Baltimore''\" (1824), p. 37:<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Thomas Waters|year=1824|title=Annals of Baltimore|location=Baltimore|page=37|lccn=rc01003421|oclc=3291920}}</ref>{{bq|\"In 1758 Mr. Jacob Myers took the southeast corner of [[Gay Street (Baltimore)|Gay]] and [[Baltimore Street|Baltimore street]]s and built an inn.\"}} There is reason to believe, however, that Myers was not a Jew. \"''The Maryland Journal and Baltimore Advertiser''\" \u2013 the earliest paper published in Baltimore \u2013 the first issue of which appeared in 1773, shows by its advertisements for that year that Jews were then settled in Baltimore as traders, especially in West Indian products.

How long previous to that year the cemetery had been established is not known. The earliest mention of it occurs in a document (the document was in the possession of Mr. Mendes Cohen of Baltimore), dated July 12, 1786, headed \"Mr. Carroll's <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> claims\". It is a \"list of the names of the Persons who occupy the ground (supposed to be about 2 acres) on the east side of [[Jones Falls|Jones's Falls]], . . . with an account of the improvements\". One of the items is \"The Jews burying-ground, 1 small lot enclosed\", situated in Ensor's Town, near [[Monument Street|East Monument street]]. A deed dated Dec. 26, 1801, conveys this same burying-ground from Charles Carroll to Levi Solomon and [[Solomon Etting]], for a consideration of five shillings; and another, dated Dec. 29, 1801, for a consideration of $80, conveys it to the same parties from Wm. McMechen and John Leggett. Interment has been made in it as late as 1832, the same year in which the oldest Jewish cemetery now in use was established. No indications can be discovered of the removal of remains buried in it when the cemetery was abandoned.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nAccording to the 1906 ''Jewish Encyclopedia'':{{bq|On the testimony of a resident close by, the last tombstone was removed, surreptitiously, presumably for building purposes, as recently as from forty to fifty years ago.<ref name=Jewish/>}}\n\n== The Etting family ==\n\nWith the advent of the Etting family, the history of the Jewish community in Baltimore becomes better documented. It is uncertain when the Etting brothers, Reuben and [[Solomon Etting|Solomon]], together with Levi Solomon, their uncle, came to Baltimore from [[York, Pa.]] On Jan. 4, 1796, Solomon Etting's name appears in the \"''Advertiser''\" as one of five persons authorized \"to receive proposals in writing for a house or suitable lot\" for a bank to be established in Baltimore Town. But there are indirect indications that the family settled in Baltimore before 1787. In the list of stockholders of the same bank, published at the end of 1796, appear the following names: Solomon, Kitty, Reuben, Shinah, and Hetty Etting; Jacob F., [[Philadelphia]], Benjamin, and Hetty Levy; and Levy and Myer Solomon. In the first directory of \"Baltimore Town and [[Fell's Point]]\", also published in 1796 \u2013 the year of the incorporation of Baltimore as a city \u2013 there are, in addition to the above, two [[Hart (surname)|Hart]]s, three [[Jacob (surname)|Jacob]]s, Philip Itzchkin, \u2013 Kahn, Benjamin Lyon, Solomon Raphael, and Isaac Solomon; and in the lists of letters remaining at the post-office occur the names of Hhym Levenstene and Benjamin Myers. Accordingly, the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' estimates the Jewish population of Baltimore in 1796 at fifteen families.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Jews elected to City Council ==\n\nIn 1798 the Collmus family arrived from [[Bohemia]]; and in 1808 the six sons of Israel J. Cohen came, with their mother, from [[Richmond, Va.]] The Cohens and the Ettings played a prominent part in the history of Baltimore Jewry, and in that of the city also. Both families acquired an enviable reputation for integrity and business tact; and their members were honored with offices of trust, by corporations and in the city government. Their names figure most prominently in the emancipation struggle of 1818\u201326, during which time the \"[[Jew Bill (Maryland)|Jew Bill]]\" was debated in the legislature of Maryland. This bill proposed \"to consider the justice and expediency of extending to those persons professing the Jewish religion the same privileges that are enjoyed by [[Christians]]\". Immediately upon its passage, and its ratification in the [[legislative session]] of 1825\u201326, it was applied practically in the election of Solomon Etting and [[Jacob I. Cohen Jr.|Jacob I. Cohen, JR.]], to seats in the [[Baltimore City Council|city council of Baltimore]].<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nIn more recent times, the 5th District has been represented by two Jews, first by Rochelle \"Rikki\" Spector from 1997\u20132016, and then by Isaac \"Yitzy\" Schleifer since 2016, who is also the first openly Orthodox Jew to hold office in Baltimore City.\n\n== Organization of Religious worship ==\n\nAfter 1826 the recorded history of the Jews of Baltimore ceases to be the history of prominent individuals, and becomes that of a community. Almost coincidentally with the removal of civil disabilities occurs the first of a series of regular meetings for religious [[Jewish services|services]], whose continuity has been uninterrupted. According to the recollections of one participant, this meeting took place in Holliday street, near Pleasant street, at the house of Zalma Rehin\u00e9, a former resident of Richmond, Va., and an uncle of [[Isaac Leeser]]. According to the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', this may possibly have been the beginning of the congregation Nidche Israel, later known as the \"[[Baltimore Hebrew Congregation]],\" or as the \"Stadt-Schul\", probably because almost simultaneously with its origin another settlement of Jews, at Fell's Point \u2013 an outlying and at first separate district \u2013 began to crystallize into a congregation, called the \"Fell's Point Hebrew Friendship Congregation\", and regularly organized since 1838. The Nidche Israel soon found it necessary to rent rooms on North Exeter street, near what is now Lexington street. Thence the congregation moved to a one-story dwelling off High street, near the bend between [[Fayette Street|Fayette]] and Gay streets, or near what is now Lexington street, the entrance being through a narrow alley. In 1837 a three-story brick building was bought, at the southwest corner of Harrison street and \u00c6tna lane. In 1845 the congregation removed to Lloyd and Watson streets, the new synagogue being dedicated by the Rev. S. M. Isaacs of New York and the Rev. Isaac Leeser of Philadelphia, together with the ministers of the congregation, [[Abraham Rice|A. Rice]] and A. Ansell (Anshel). Here it worshiped until April 6, 1889, when a new building was erected on [[Madison Avenue (Baltimore)|Madison avenue]] and Robert street. The date of the congregational charter is Jan. 29, 1830 (supplementary act, 1851). The incorporators were Moses Millem (Mulheim), Joseph Osterman, John M. Dyer, Louis Silver, and Levi Benjamin.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThe first rabbi of the congregation was the above-mentioned Abraham Rice (Reiss), whose piety and character have left a lasting impress upon the community, especially through his influence upon the youths he taught, some of them later becoming its leaders. Rice established a school for instruction in [[Hebrew]] in 1845, and he officiated as the rabbi of the congregation from 1840 to 1849, and again from the spring of 1862 to Oct. 29 of the same year, the date of his death. Other rabbis of the congregation have been: Julius Spiro, in conjunction with Mr. Rice (1846\u201347); Henry Hochheimer (1849\u201359); [[Bernard Illowy|B. Illoway]] (1859\u201361); Abraham Hofman (1868\u201373); Maurice Fluegel (1881\u201384); A. S. Bettelheim (1886\u201390); and Adolf Guttmacher (1891). The burial-ground belonging to the congregation was bought in 1832, at which time it covered three acres.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nRabbis of the Fell's Point Congregation, later worshiping on Eden street, have been: Aaron G\u00fcnzburg (1848\u201356); Henry Hochheimer (1859\u201392); W. Willner (1892\u201394); Clifton H. Levy (1894\u201396): and M. Rosenstein (1896). This congregation, as well as the one or two ''chebrot'' of which records up to 1842 have been preserved, had separated from, or organized themselves independently of, the mother congregation, Nidche Israel, only for reasons of convenience, on account of the extended space over which the community was scattered.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nIn 1842 the desire for a radical [[Reform Judaism|change in the liturgy]] resulted in the formation of the Har Sinai Verein, whose rabbis have been: Max Sutro (about 1842); Moritz Brown (about 1849\u201355); [[David Einhorn (rabbi)|David Einhorn]] (1855\u201361); S. Deutsch (1862\u201373); [[Jacob Mayer]] (1874\u201376); [[Emil G. Hirsch]] (1877\u201378); S. Sale (1878\u201383); [[David Philipson]] (1884\u201388); Tobias Shanfarber (1888\u201398); and Charles A. Rubenstein (1898). The congregation later erected a new house of worship on [[Bolton Street|Bolton]] and Wilson streets.<ref name=Jewish/> In 1873, a new charter was granted and the name was changed from Har Sinai Verein to [[Har Sinai Congregation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harsinai-md.org/history_2.php |title=Other important dates in Har Sinai Congregation history |publisher=Har Sinai Congregation |accessdate=Feb 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311003941/http://www.harsinai-md.org/history_2.php |archivedate=March 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== \"Oheb Shalom\" Congregation ==\n{{Main|Temple Oheb Shalom (Baltimore, Maryland)}}\nA similar desire for a revised liturgy, but along more conservative lines, led to the formation of the Oheb Shalom Congregation in Sept., 1853, on the part of a number of dissidents from the original body. Rabbis of this congregation, whose new synagogue on [[Eutaw Place|Eutaw place]] and Lanvale street was considered one of the most beautiful structures in the city, have been the following: \u2013 Salomon (1854); S. M. Landsberg (1856\u201357); [[Benjamin Szold]]; and [[William Rosenau]] (1892). [[Alois Kaiser]], known as a composer of [[synagogue music]], has been the cantor of this congregation since 1866.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThis was followed by the formation of three [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] congregations, the earliest of which was the Bikur Cholim Congregation, incorporated in 1865. The [[Chizuk Amuno Congregation|Chizuk Emoonah Congregation]] was formed in 1871 by dissidents from the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation, which had begun to introduce innovations into the synagogue service. The rabbi of the Chizuk Emoonah was Henry W. Schneeberger, who has occupied the rabbinate since 1876. A new synagogue has later been built by the congregation at [[McCulloh Street|McCulloh]] and [[Mosher Street|Mosher street]]s. In 1878, the Shearith Israel Congregation was formed by the consolidation of two small congregations. S. Schaffer was its rabbi since 1893.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nSince then, in the organization of twenty other congregations in Baltimore \u2013 only eight of which having a house of worship of their own \u2013 the determining factor, in a few cases, has been convenience of locality, but more frequently the bond of national affiliation brought from European countries and reinforced by conservatism in religious sentiment.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nAn attempt was made in 1856\u201359 to hold services according to the liturgy of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish and Portuguese]] [[Sephardim]], of which [[Solomon Nunes Carvalho]] was the chief promoter. The congregation was regularly organized in 1857, under the name \"Beth Israel\", with Jacob M. De Solla as minister.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nOf the eight large cemeteries in the city, one, called \"Rosedale\", was used by seven congregations and three societies; another, on the [[Philadelphia Road|Philadelphia road]], by eight congregations and two societies; and a third, on the Washington road, by three congregations and one society. Each of five congregations, the Baltimore Hebrew, the Fell's Point, the Har Sinai, the Oheb Shalom, and the [[B'nai Israel Synagogue (Baltimore)|B'nai Israel]], had a cemetery of its own. Besides, there was a small cemetery, now disused, on the Philadelphia road, which was formerly maintained by what was called, for unknown reasons, \"Die Irische \u1e24ebra\". The Cohen family and the Etting family owned private cemeteries.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Charitable societies ==\n\nThe first [[Jewish charity|charitable]] association was the Hebrew Assistance Society (1843?), incorporated in 1856 as the \"Hebrew Benevolent Society of Baltimore\". In the latter year was founded also the Hebrew Ladies' [[Sewing circle|Sewing Society]], which, though an independent body, has always adapted its activities to those of the general organization. The building of the [[LifeBridge Health#Sinai Hospital|Hebrew Hospital and Asylum Association]] \u2013 a society for the [[Bikur cholim|care of the sick]] and the shelter of the aged \u2013 was dedicated in 1868, the first steps toward this end having been taken in 1859; and in 1872 the [[Hebrew Orphan Asylum (Baltimore, Maryland)|Hebrew Orphan Asylum]] was established. Both these institutions had active auxiliary organizations. The other charitable institutions with permanent homes were the Hebrew Friendly Inn and Aged Home, established in 1891, and the Working Girls' Home, founded in 1899 by the Daughters in Israel, and supported by that association.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThere were, besides, two Hebrew free [[Chevra kadisha|burial societies]], a Hebrew [[Gemach|free loan association]], the Daughters in Israel of Baltimore City (a personal service sisterhood with various activities), and a number of mutual [[Benefit society|benefit]] and relief associations. The [[Baron de Hirsch]] Fund from the first established a local committee in Baltimore whose affairs have been administered by Dr. A. Friedenwald.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Educational establishments ==\n\nCongregational [[Jewish schools|schools]], at which daily instruction was given in Hebrew and [[German language|German]], and later in English, flourished until after 1870. The most successful were conducted by Joseph Sachs and Jonas Goldsmith. The Society for Educating Poor and Orphan Hebrew Children (later named \"Hebrew Education Society of Baltimore\") was founded in 1852, and incorporated in 1860. In 1901, it had two schools, a daily [[Hebrew school]], and a weekly mission school for religious instruction, whose work was supplemented by that of the Frank Free Sabbath School, established and supported by Mrs. S. L. Frank. The first Sunday school, patterned after the one founded by Miss [[Rebecca Gratz]] in Philadelphia, was opened in 1856. In it a large number of children were taught during the years preceding the establishment of congregational religious schools. The [[Talmud Torah]] School, with a building of its own, was established in 1889, and the Hebrew Free [[Kindergarten]] and [[Day Nursery]] in 1895. The organization known as \"The Maccabeans\" maintained an evening class and a library for the use of boys and young men; continuing in a measure the work begun by the Night School, existing from 1889 to 1899 under the auspices of the [[Isaac Baer Levinsohn|Isaac bar Levison]] Hebrew Literary Society, and supported in part by the Baron de Hirsch Fund, for the purpose of teaching English to immigrants.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nAt three different times short-lived attempts have been made to maintain [[Young Men's Hebrew Association|Young Men's Hebrew associations]], the first of which existed from 1854 to 1860.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThere were three [[Zionist]] societies; a branch of the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]]; a section and a junior section of the Council of Jewish Women; six lodges of the [[Independent Order of B'nai B'rith|Independent Order B'nai B'rith]]; three of the Independent Order B'rith Abraham; one of the Independent Order Free Sons of Israel; three of the Independent Order Free Sons of Judah; four of the Independent Order Sons of Benjamin; five of the Order Ahawas Israel; seven of the Order B'rith Abraham; and one of the Order Kesher Shel Barzel.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n[[Chabad]] continues the legacy of [[Jewish education]] in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Mindy|title=Jewish School in Baltimore Gets an Unusual Gift: A Building|url=http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/2777701/jewish/Jewish-School-in-Baltimore-Gets-an-Unusual-Gift-A-Building.htm|publisher=Chabad.org|date=November 30, 2014|quote=It's not often that someone receives a 55,000-square-foot building as a gift.

Jacobi, Martin Lehmayer, Lewis Putzel, and Charles J. Wiener. In the business world the Jews of Baltimore have occupied an important position. To a great extent they controlled the manufacture of wearing apparel for men. Several of the largest department stores were conducted by Jews; and as [[financiers]] they bore an enviable reputation for probity and for a spirit of far-sighted and cautious enterprise.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nBaltimore Jews have had prominent representatives in all the professions. Jewish [[physicians]], men and women, have occupied positions as [[professors]] in the [[medical colleges]], including: A. B. Arnold, Joshua I. Cohen, Aaron Friedenwald, Harry Friedenwald, and Julius Friedenwald. Jews have devoted themselves to the writing of medical and legal works. There were [[List of Jewish American journalists|Jewish journalists]] on the editorial staffs of several of the daily newspapers. The following Jews have been connected with [[Johns Hopkins University]] in the capacity of [[List of Johns Hopkins University people#Notable faculty|professors and instructors]]: [[J. J. Sylvester]], [[Fabian Franklin]], Abraham Cohen, [[Maurice Bloomfield]], [[Cyrus Adler]], [[Jacob Hollander|J. H. Hollander]], [[Simon Flexner]], Caspar Levias, and William Rosenau. In the [[Baltimore Public Schools|public schools]] upward of sixty Jewish teachers were employed. [[Ephraim Keyser]] has won reputation as a [[sculpture|sculptor]], and Mendes Cohen as a [[civil engineer]].<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nThe wider educational life has found promoters among the Jews. Jacob I. Cohen, JR., was active in the establishment of the public-school system of Baltimore; and his nephews were instrumental in placing in the Johns Hopkins University the \"Cohen Collection of Egyptian Antiquities\", collected by his brother, Col. Mendes I. Cohen, in [[Egypt]]. At the same university Leopold Strouse established a rabbinical library, to which he made annual additions; Mrs. S. L. Frank and Albert W. Rayner have founded a [[Semitic studies|Semitic]] fellowship in memory of their father, William S. Rayner; and Henry and Mrs. Sonneborn have presented the university with a collection of [[Jewish ceremonial art|Jewish ceremonial]] objects. At the Cohen residence was a library valuable to [[Bible]] students, collected by Dr. Joshua I. Cohen (a [[Library catalog|catalogue]] of this library, compiled by Cyrus Adler, was privately printed in 1887).<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Military services ==\n\nJews enlisted from Baltimore for service in each of the [[List of US wars|national wars]]. Nathaniel Levy fought under Lafayette in the [[Yorktown campaign|campaign of 1781]]; and Reuben Etting (not the one mentioned above) was taken [[prisoner]] by the [[British Army|British]] at [[Charlestown, South Carolina|Charlestown]]. Among the [[Defense (military)|defenders]] of [[Fort McHenry]], near Baltimore, during the [[War of 1812]], were the brothers Mendes I. and Philip I. Cohen. In [[The Mexican War|the Mexican war]], Moritz Henry Weil served as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in [[Company (military unit)|Company]] A, [[3rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment|Third Regiment, United States Artillery]], and Louis Hamburger as a private in Company C, Baltimore Battalion. According to the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', \"[a] company of militia composed entirely of Jews was formed, with Levi Benjamin as [[First lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]]; but it is not probable that it saw active service\". In the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil war]] there were as many Baltimore Jews in the [[Confederate army|Confederate]] as in the Federal army. Leopold Blumenberg served as [[Brevet (military)#United States|brevet]] [[brigadier-general]], [[United States Volunteers]], Fifth Maryland Infantry (see [[Simon Wolf|S.

To the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Baltimore Jewry sent its due quota of soldiers (see ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'' 5661,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1900_1901_7_Statistics.pdf|title=American Jewish Year Book|editor-last=Adler|editor-first=Cyrus|editor-link=Cyrus Adler|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[Jewish Publication Society of America|The Jewish Publication Society of America]]|accessdate=Mar 18, 2014}}</ref> pp.&nbsp;563\u2013565).<ref name=Jewish/>\n\nA few street names reveal the early presence of Jews: According to the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', there were two alleys, each called \"Jew alley\", one in the eastern section of the city, on which the old burying-ground is situated; and the other in the western section, probably deriving its name from residences of Jews on [[Eutaw Street|Eutaw street]]; Abraham street, in close proximity to the old burying-ground; Cohen alley, so named from the residence of one of the Cohen brothers on [[Mulberry Street (Baltimore)|Mulberry street]]; and Etting street, of obvious derivation.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Statistics ==\n\nIn 1825, while the \"Jew Bill\" was under discussion, Solomon Etting computed the number of Jews in Maryland to be 150. A directory of 1835 gives the names of 40 householders in Baltimore, identified as Jews by a Jewish resident whose memory goes back to that year. To these can be added at least 15 more names culled from the records of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation, making a Jewish population of about 300 souls, bearing such names as [[Cohen (surname)|Cohen]], [[Dyer (surname)|Dyer]], Friedenwald, [[Horwitz]], Kayton, Keyser, [[Preiss]], and [[Rosenstock]], whose descendants continued to be prominent in Baltimore and other cities. In the \"''[[The Occident and American Jewish Advocate|Occident]]''\" of Dec., 1856, an anonymous correspondent put the number of Jews then residing in the city at 8,000 \u2013 an exaggerated estimate according to the ''Jewish Encyclopedia''. In 1901 estimates of the Jewish population varied from 35,000 to 40,000, in a total population of 508,957.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Notable Jews from Baltimore ==\n<!-- In alphabetical order -->\n\n=== Deceased ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Rosalie Silber Abrams]]\n*[[Bernard Ades]]\n*[[Larry Adler]]\n*[[David Bachrach]]\n*[[Jacob Beser]]\n*[[Elsbeth Levy Bothe]]\n*[[Leo Bretholz]]\n*[[Old Bay Seasoning|Gustav Brunn]]\n*[[Meyer Cardin]]\n*[[Solomon Nunes Carvalho]]\n*[[Cass Elliot]]\n*[[Andy Cohen (baseball)|Andy Cohen]]\n*[[Jacob I.

The game follows the adventure of a [[claymation]] character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets, rather than 2- or 3-dimensional computer graphics, like many other games at its time. The gameplay consists mostly of the player guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance in the game. As the player advances through different areas of the game, there are various video sequences that help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, ''The Neverhood'' aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence of the game.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Neverhood'' is a [[point-and-click adventure]] game which emphasizes the solving of puzzles through character action rather than inventory usage.<ref name=\"GPro96\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Neverhood: A Curious Wad of Klay Finds his Soul|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996 |page=54}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe titular Neverhood is a surreal landscape dotted with buildings and other hints of life, all suspended above an endless void. However, the Neverhood itself is bizarrely deserted, with its only inhabitants being Klaymen (the main protagonist and player character), Willie Trombone (a dim individual who assists Klaymen in his travels), Klogg (the game's antagonist who resembles a warped version of Klaymen), and various fauna that inhabit the Neverhood (most infamously the 'weasels', monstrous, crablike creatures that pursue Klaymen and Willie at certain points in the game). Much of the game's background information is limited to the 'Hall Of Records' which is notorious for its length, taking several minutes to travel from one end of the hall to the other.\n\nThe game begins with Klaymen waking up in a room and exploring the Neverhood, collecting various discs appearing to contain a disjointed story narrated by Willie (which Klaymen can view through various terminals scattered throughout the land). As Klaymen travels the Neverhood, he occasionally crosses paths with Willie, who agrees to help him in his journey, while Klogg spies on them from afar. Eventually, Klaymen's quest directs him to Klogg's castle, and for this Klaymen enlists the help of Big Robot Bil, a towering automaton and a friend of Willie's.\n\nAs Bil (with Klaymen and Willie on board) marches to Klogg's castle, Klogg unleashes his guardian, the Clockwork Beast, to intercept Bil. The two giants clash and Bil proves victorious, but as he forces open the castle door for Klaymen to enter, Klogg gravely injures Bil by firing a cannon at him. Klaymen manages to get in, but Bil loses his footing and falls into the void with Willie still inside. Alone in Klogg's castle, Klaymen finds the last of Willie's discs, revealing the full context of his tale; the Neverhood itself is the creation of a godlike being named Hoborg, who created the Neverhood in the hopes of making himself happy. Realizing that he was still alone, Hoborg creates himself a companion by planting a seed into the ground, which grows into Klogg. As Hoborg welcomes Klogg to the Neverhood, the latter tries to take Hoborg's crown, which Hoborg forbids Klogg from doing. Envious, Klogg manages to steal Hoborg's crown, rendering Hoborg inert in the process, and the crown's energies disfigure Klogg. With Hoborg lifeless, any further development of the Neverhood ground to a halt.\n\nHaving witnessed this, Willie (himself and Bil being creations of Hoborg's brother Ottoborg) discovers that Hoborg was about to plant a seed to create another companion. Willie takes the seed and plants it far away from Klogg, with Willie hoping that whoever grew from the seed would defeat Klogg. That seed in turn grew into Klaymen. The story ends with Willie giving Klaymen the throne room key [[Fourth wall|through the terminal screen]], hoping that Klaymen knows what to do once he confronts Klogg. Afterwards, Klaymen manages to enter the throne room, with Klogg and a motionless Hoborg waiting for him. Klogg tries to dissuade Klaymen from reviving Hoborg by tempting him with Hoborg's crown. From here, the player may choose to take up Klogg's offer or take the crown to revive Hoborg. If the player chooses to take the crown for himself, Klogg gloats at his apparent victory, only for the crown to disfigure Klaymen similarly to Klogg. The now-villanous Klaymen overpowers Klogg and declares himself the new ruler of the Neverhood.\n\nIf the player chooses to revive Hoborg, Klaymen distracts Klogg and manages to put the crown atop Hoborg's head, reviving him. As Hoborg thanks Klaymen, Klogg attempts to ambush them both, only to set off his own cannon which blasts him out of the castle and into the void. Returning to the building where Klaymen first started, Hoborg continues populating the Neverhood and orders a celebration when he is finished. However, Klaymen remains sorrowful over the loss of Willie and Bil, and Hoborg decides to use his powers to save Willie and Bil (to Klaymen's delight), and the game ends with Hoborg telling Klaymen \"Man, things are good\".\n\n==Development==\nDoug TenNapel came up with the idea of a [[plasticine]] world in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], creating approximately 17 structures.<ref name=\"Name\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/pc/the-neverhood-chronicles |title= Review of The Neverhood Chronicles |author= |date=2004-06-05 |work= |publisher= [[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Due to his dissatisfaction with the way [[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]] ran [[Shiny Entertainment]], TenNapel left the company in 1995.

A Japan-only sports action game, it was based on the characters of the Neverhood, but was not developed by the designers of the original games; it also did not feature the previous releases' distinctive Claymation design techniques. The game is a variation on [[air hockey]], only played with [[gun]]s instead of mallets.

The game follows the adventure of a [[claymation]] character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets, rather than 2- or 3-dimensional computer graphics, like many other games at its time. The gameplay consists mostly of the player guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance in the game. As the player advances through different areas of the game, there are various video sequences that help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, ''The Neverhood'' aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence of the game.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Neverhood'' is a [[point-and-click adventure]] game which emphasizes the solving of puzzles through character action rather than inventory usage.<ref name=\"GPro96\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Neverhood: A Curious Wad of Klay Finds his Soul|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996 |page=54}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe titular Neverhood is a surreal landscape dotted with buildings and other hints of life, all suspended above an endless void. However, the Neverhood itself is bizarrely deserted, with its only inhabitants being Klaymen (the main protagonist and player character), Willie Trombone (a dim individual who assists Klaymen in his travels), Klogg (the game's antagonist who resembles a warped version of Klaymen), and various fauna that inhabit the Neverhood (most infamously the 'weasels', monstrous, crablike creatures that pursue Klaymen and Willie at certain points in the game). Much of the game's background information is limited to the 'Hall Of Records' which is notorious for its length, taking several minutes to travel from one end of the hall to the other.\n\nThe game begins with Klaymen waking up in a room and exploring the Neverhood, collecting various discs appearing to contain a disjointed story narrated by Willie (which Klaymen can view through various terminals scattered throughout the land). As Klaymen travels the Neverhood, he occasionally crosses paths with Willie, who agrees to help him in his journey, while Klogg spies on them from afar. Eventually, Klaymen's quest directs him to Klogg's castle, and for this Klaymen enlists the help of Big Robot Bil, a towering automaton and a friend of Willie's.\n\nAs Bil (with Klaymen and Willie on board) marches to Klogg's castle, Klogg unleashes his guardian, the Clockwork Beast, to intercept Bil. The two giants clash and Bil proves victorious, but as he forces open the castle door for Klaymen to enter, Klogg gravely injures Bil by firing a cannon at him. Klaymen manages to get in, but Bil loses his footing and falls into the void with Willie still inside. Alone in Klogg's castle, Klaymen finds the last of Willie's discs, revealing the full context of his tale; the Neverhood itself is the creation of a godlike being named Hoborg, who created the Neverhood in the hopes of making himself happy. Realizing that he was still alone, Hoborg creates himself a companion by planting a seed into the ground, which grows into Klogg. As Hoborg welcomes Klogg to the Neverhood, the latter tries to take Hoborg's crown, which Hoborg forbids Klogg from doing. Envious, Klogg manages to steal Hoborg's crown, rendering Hoborg inert in the process, and the crown's energies disfigure Klogg. With Hoborg lifeless, any further development of the Neverhood ground to a halt.\n\nHaving witnessed this, Willie (himself and Bil being creations of Hoborg's brother Ottoborg) discovers that Hoborg was about to plant a seed to create another companion. Willie takes the seed and plants it far away from Klogg, with Willie hoping that whoever grew from the seed would defeat Klogg. That seed in turn grew into Klaymen. The story ends with Willie giving Klaymen the throne room key [[Fourth wall|through the terminal screen]], hoping that Klaymen knows what to do once he confronts Klogg. Afterwards, Klaymen manages to enter the throne room, with Klogg and a motionless Hoborg waiting for him. Klogg tries to dissuade Klaymen from reviving Hoborg by tempting him with Hoborg's crown. From here, the player may choose to take up Klogg's offer or take the crown to revive Hoborg. If the player chooses to take the crown for himself, Klogg gloats at his apparent victory, only for the crown to disfigure Klaymen similarly to Klogg. The now-villanous Klaymen overpowers Klogg and declares himself the new ruler of the Neverhood.\n\nIf the player chooses to revive Hoborg, Klaymen distracts Klogg and manages to put the crown atop Hoborg's head, reviving him. As Hoborg thanks Klaymen, Klogg attempts to ambush them both, only to set off his own cannon which blasts him out of the castle and into the void. Returning to the building where Klaymen first started, Hoborg continues populating the Neverhood and orders a celebration when he is finished.
