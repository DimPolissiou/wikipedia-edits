An [[LP record|LP]] compilation of all seven, titled  ''From Then to You'' in the UK and ''The Beatles' Christmas Album'' in the US, was sent out in 1970.\n\nConceived as a means to appease fan-club members whose letters, due to their sheer volume, were not always being answered in a timely manner, the records included the Beatles' messages of thanks to \"loyal Beatle people\", along with skits, Christmas carols, and original compositions.\n\nUntil 2017, none of the original recordings had been subject to general release, though a version of \"[[Christmas Time (Is Here Again)]]\", an original composition which appeared in edited form on the 1967 record, eventually gained an official release in 1995, as part of ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' project.

One of them, which contained the 1963\u20131966 recordings, was called ''Christmas Reflections'', on a label called Desert Vibrations Heritage Series (HSRD-SP1). The other, with the recordings from 1967 to 1969, was called ''Happy Michaelmas'' and was on a label called The Adirondack Group (AG-8146).<ref name=Cox>{{cite book |first=Perry |last=Cox |author2=Joe Lindsay  |title=The Complete Beatles U.S. Record Price Guide, 1st Edition |publisher=O'Sullivan Woodside |location=Phoenix, Arizona |pages=102\u2013105 |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-89019-082-1}}</ref>\n\nLess than a year later, on 29 September 1983, an entrepreneur announced that he was going to issue all seven messages on one record, which he planned to call ''John, Paul, George and Ringo''.{{sfn|Badman2005}} The Beatles' representatives quickly sued, claiming copyright and trademark violations, and won in court.<ref>{{cite web |title=Citations and Summaries |publisher=CopyrightData.com |url= http://chart.copyrightdata.com/c10G.html#s185 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref> As a result, the 1983 album was never released, and the two 1982 LPs were withdrawn.\n<br>\n\n===Released extracts===\nThe first three minutes of the music bed of the 1967 single, with greetings recorded for the 1966 single superimposed during the final minute, was released under the title \"[[Christmas Time (Is Here Again)]]\" as one of the B-sides of the \"[[Free as a Bird]]\" single in December 1995.  (Starr recorded his own cover of \"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\" on his 1999 Christmas album, ''[[I Wanna Be Santa Claus]]''.)\n\nDialogue from the 1965 and 1966 recordings were featured as the tail-end of the 2006 compilation, ''[[Love (The Beatles album)|Love]]''.

They are native only to the island of [[Madagascar]]. Most existing lemurs are small, have a pointed snout, large eyes, and a long tail. They chiefly live in trees ([[arboreal]]), and are active at night ([[nocturnal]]).  \n\nLemurs share resemblance with other primates, but evolved independently from [[monkey]]s and [[ape]]s. Due to Madagascar's highly seasonal climate, [[Evolution of lemurs|lemur evolution]] has produced a level of [[species diversity]] rivaling that of any other primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000&nbsp;years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male [[gorilla]]. Most species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic classification]] is controversial and depends on which [[Species problem|species concept]] is used. \n\nLemurs range in weight from the {{convert|30|g|oz|adj=on}} [[mouse lemur]] to the {{convert|9|kg|lb|adj=on}} [[indri]]. Lemurs share many common basal primate traits, such as divergent [[digit (anatomy)|digits]] on their hands and feet, and [[nail (anatomy)|nails]] instead of [[claw]]s (in most species). However, their [[Brain-to-body mass ratio|brain-to-body size ratio]] is smaller than that of [[Anthropoidea|anthropoid]] primates. As with all [[strepsirrhine]] primates, they have a \"wet nose\" ([[rhinarium]]). Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates, and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Lemurs have a relatively low [[basal metabolic rate]], and as a result may exhibit [[dormancy]] such as [[hibernation]] or [[torpor]]. They also have [[seasonal breeder|seasonal breeding]] and [[dominance (ethology)|female social dominance]]. Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists. Two species of lemurs may coexist in the same forest due to different diets. \n\nLemur research during the 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection. Modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior did not begin in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by political issues on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and [[human evolution]]. Many lemur species are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and hunting. Many lemur species have already gone extinct in the last 2000 years due to human activity, and are collectively referred to as the \"[[Subfossil lemur|subfossil lemurs]]\". Although local traditions generally help protect lemurs and their forests, [[Illegal logging in Madagascar|illegal logging]], widespread poverty, and political instability hinder and undermine conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world's most endangered mammals, noting that {{as of|2013|lc=y}} up to 90% of all lemur species face extinction within the next 20 to 25&nbsp;years.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name lemur is derived from the [[Latin]]  ''[[lemures]]'',{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85\u201386}} which refers to specters or ghosts that were [[exorcism|exorcised]] during the [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria festival]] of ancient Rome.<ref name=\"ley196608\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |last3=\n |first3=\n |date=August 1966\n |title=Scherazade's Island\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n06_1966-08#page/n45/mode/2up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=45\u201355\n |type=\n}}</ref>{{R|2008Lux}}\n\n[[Carl Linnaeus]], the founder of modern [[binomial nomenclature]], gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']].

Like other strepsirrhine [[primate]]s, such as [[loris]]es, [[potto]]s, and [[galago]]s, they share ancestral (or [[Cladistics#plesiomorphy|plesiomorphic]]) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes ([[simian]]s). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on [[Madagascar]].{{R|1997Kay}} All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as [[adapiformes|adapiforms]] during the [[Eocene]] (56 to 34&nbsp;[[Year#Symbols y and yr|mya]]) or [[Paleocene]] (66 to 56&nbsp;mya).{{R|1997Kay}}{{Sfn|Gould|Sauther|2006|pp=vii\u2013xiii}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a [[toothcomb]], which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}{{Sfn|Preston-Mafham|1991|pp=141\u2013188}}{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}} A more recent [[hypothesis]] is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is supported by comparative studies of the [[cytochrome&nbsp;b]] gene and the presence of the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}}{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}} Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by [[molecular phylogenetic]] studies.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}} The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65&nbsp;mya according to molecular studies,{{R|2004YoderYang}} although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55&nbsp;mya for this divergence.{{r|2006Godinot}} However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually [[subfossil]]s dating to the [[Late Pleistocene]].{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}\n\nOnce part of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], the island of Madagascar has been isolated since it broke away from eastern [[Africa]] (~160&nbsp;mya), [[Antarctica]] (~80\u2013130&nbsp;mya), and [[Indian Plate|India]] (~80\u201390&nbsp;mya).{{Sfn|Flynn|Wyss|2003|pp=34\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=23\u201326}} Since ancestral lemurs are thought to have originated in Africa around 62 to 65&nbsp;mya, they must have crossed the [[Mozambique Channel]], a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560&nbsp;km (350&nbsp;mi).{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}} In 1915, [[paleontologist]] [[William Diller Matthew]] noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random [[rafting event]]s, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers.{{R|1915Matthew}} This form of [[biological dispersal]] can occur randomly over millions of years.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=14\u201315}} In the 1940s, American paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] coined the term \"sweepstakes hypothesis\" for such random events.{{R|NatureNews_20Jan10}} Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar,{{R|2008Horvath}}{{Sfn|Krause|2003|pp=40\u201347}} but until recently this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong [[ocean current]]s flow away from the island.{{R|2010AliHuber}} In {{Nowrap|January 2010}}, a report demonstrated that around 60&nbsp;mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650&nbsp;km (1,030&nbsp;mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different [[ocean gyre]], producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30&nbsp;days or less\u2014short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the [[plate tectonics|continental plates]] drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20&nbsp;mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs and the rest of the terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa.{{R|2010AliHuber}} Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] mammalian groups, such as [[squirrel]]s.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}} They were also spared from having to compete with [[monkey]]s, which evolved later.

In one taxonomy, the infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids ([[Lorisidae|lorisids]] and galagos).{{R|2006Godinot}}{{Sfn|Cartmill|2010|p=15}} Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs.{{Sfn|Hartwig|2011|pp=20\u201321}} In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves, the [[aye-aye]] was placed in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, while the rest of the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n\nAlthough it is generally agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, the relationship between the other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12&nbsp;million-year window between the Late Eocene (42&nbsp;mya) and into the Oligocene (30&nbsp;mya).{{R|2004YoderYang|2008Horvath}} The two main competing hypotheses are shown in the adjacent image.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" border=\"1\" width=\"850pt\"\n|+ Competing taxonomic nomenclature for lemurs and their kin\n|-\n! 2 infraorders{{Sfn|Cartmill|2010|p=15}}\n! 3 infraorders{{Sfn|Hartwig|2011|pp=20\u201321}}\n! 4 infraorders{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n|-\n|\n* Order [[Primate]]s\n** Suborder [[Strepsirrhini]]\n*** Infraorder {{extinct}}[[Adapiformes]]\n*** Infraorder [[Lemuriformes]]\n**** '''Superfamily Lemuroidea'''\n***** Family {{extinct}}[[Monkey lemur|Archaeolemuridae]]\n***** Family [[Cheirogaleidae]]\n***** Family [[Aye-aye|Daubentoniidae]]\n***** Family [[Indriidae]]\n***** Family [[Lemuridae]]\n***** Family [[Sportive lemur|Lepilemuridae]]\n***** Family {{extinct}}[[Megaladapis|Megaladapidae]]\n***** Family {{extinct}}[[Sloth lemur|Palaeopropithecidae]]\n**** Superfamily [[Lorisoidea]]\n** Suborder [[Haplorrhini]]\n|\n* Order Primates\n** Suborder Strepsirrhini\n*** Infraorder {{extinct}}Adapiformes\n*** '''Infraorder Lemuriformes'''\n**** '''Superfamily Lemuroidea'''\n***** Family {{extinct}}Archaeolemuridae\n***** Family Cheirogaleidae\n***** Family Daubentoniidae\n***** Family Indriidae\n***** Family Lemuridae\n***** Family Lepilemuridae\n***** Family {{extinct}}Megaladapidae\n***** Family {{extinct}}Palaeopropithecidae\n*** Infraorder Lorisiformes\n** Suborder Haplorrhini\n|\n* Order Primates\n** Suborder Strepsirrhini\n*** Infraorder {{extinct}}Adapiformes\n*** '''Infraorder [[Aye-aye|Chiromyiformes]]'''\n*** '''Infraorder Lemuriformes'''\n**** Superfamily Cheirogaleoidea\n***** Family Cheirogaleidae\n**** Superfamily Lemuroidea\n***** Family {{extinct}}Archaeolemuridae\n***** Family Indriidae\n***** Family Lemuridae\n***** Family Lepilemuridae\n***** Family {{extinct}}Megaladapidae\n***** Family {{extinct}}Palaeopropithecidae\n*** Infraorder Lorisiformes\n** Suborder Haplorrhini\n|}\n\n[[File:Lepilemur sahamalazensis c.png|thumb|upright|alt=A sportive lemur (small body, long legs, brown fur, large eyes, and thick, furry tail) clings to the side of a tree, with its head turned towards the camera.|The [[Sahamalaza sportive lemur]] (''Lepilemur sahamalazensis'') was identified as a distinct species in 2006.]]\nLemur taxonomy has changed significantly since the first taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.

Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus ''Daubentonia'' as a specialized [[indriidae|indriid]], a [[Cladistics|sister group]] to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}} Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes,{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}}{{R|1996YoderVilgalys}} and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.{{R|2008MittermeierGroves}}\n\nRelationships among lemur families have also proven to be problematic and have yet to be definitively resolved.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}} To further complicate the issue, several [[Paleogene]] fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as ''[[Bugtilemur]]'', have been classified as lemurs.{{R|2001Marivaux}} However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence,{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}}{{R|1996YoderVilgalys}} and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}}{{R|2008Horvath|2008Orlando}} Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct [[koala lemur]]s (Megaladapidae).

The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus ''Lemur'' into separate genera for the [[ring-tailed lemur]], [[ruffed lemur]]s, and [[True lemur|brown lemurs]] due to a host of morphological differences.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=209\u2013323}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=137\u2013175}}\n\nDue to several taxonomic revisions by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, the number of recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008.{{R|2007Yoder|2008MittermeierGroves}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=85\u201388}} With continuing [[cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] and [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] research, as well as ongoing [[field study|field studies]], particularly with [[cryptic species]] such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing.{{R|2007Yoder}} However, the rapid increase in the number of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the [[Species#Definitions of species|species concept]] used, [[conservation movement|conservationists]] often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection.

Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species apart from the rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.\n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Microcebus murinus -Artis Zoo, Amsterdam, Netherlands-8c.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A tiny mouse lemur holds a cut piece of fruit in its hands and eats|[[Mouse lemur]]s primarily eat fruit, although their diet also includes insects.]]\nLemur diets are highly variable and demonstrate a high degree of plasticity,{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects ([[omnivore|omnivory]]), while the larger species are more [[herbivore|herbivorous]], consuming mostly plant material.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}} For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small [[vertebrate]]s when necessary{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=209\u2013323}} and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore.{{Sfn|Cuozzo|Yamashita|2006|pp=67\u201396}} [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli'') is mostly [[frugivore|frugivorous]], but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}\n\nA common assumption in [[mammalogy]] is that small mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material and must have a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, it was thought that the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects ([[insectivore|insectivory]]). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}\n\nPlant material makes up the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are [[woody plant]]s, including [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, or [[liana]]s. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the [[bamboo lemur]]s (genus ''Hapalemur''), and the [[black-and-white ruffed lemur]] (''Varecia variegata'') are known to consume [[herb]]s. While Madagascar is rich in [[fern]] diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible reason for this is that ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds\u2014common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of [[tannin]]s in their [[frond]]s. Likewise, [[mangrove]]s appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids.{{Sfn|Powzyk|Mowry|2006|pp=353\u2013368}} The [[golden bamboo lemur]] (''Hapalemur aureus''), for instance, eats giant bamboo (''[[Cathariostachys madagascariensis]]''), which contains high levels of [[cyanide]]. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} At the [[Duke Lemur Center]] (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating [[poison ivy]] (''Taxicodendron radicans''), yet have shown no ill effects.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=284\u2013391}}\n\n[[File:Prolemur simus Cedric Girard-Buttoz.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A brown-colored lemur clings to a shaft of giant bamboo while eating a fragment in its hands.|Up to 95% of the [[greater bamboo lemur]]'s diet consists of bamboo.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=209\u2013323}}]]\nMany of the larger lemur species consume leaves ([[folivore|folivory]]),{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} particularly the indriids.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=176\u2013204}} However, some smaller lemurs such as [[sportive lemur]]s (genus ''Lepilemur'') and [[woolly lemur]]s (genus ''Avahi'') also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so.{{Sfn|Thalmann|Ganzhorn|2003|pp=1336\u20131340}} The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of the part of the leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nMany lemurs that eat leaves tend to do so during times of fruit scarcity, sometimes suffering weight loss as a result.{{Sfn|Wright|2006|pp=385\u2013402}} Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit ([[frugivore|frugivory]]) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86&nbsp;native plant families and 15&nbsp;alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from ''[[Ficus]]'' (fig) species.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}} In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of [[vitamin C]], but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C.{{R|1969Nakajima}} Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause [[hemosiderosis]], a type of [[iron overload|iron overload disorder]], since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity have been shown to be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species.{{R|2006Williams}} The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.{{R|2006Glenn}}\n\nOnly eight species of lemur are known to be [[seed predation|seed predators]] (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most observations only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the [[diademed sifaka]] (''Propithecus diadema''), the [[golden-crowned sifaka]] (''Propithecus tattersalli''), the indri,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Richard|2003|pp=1345\u20131348}} and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through ''[[Canarium]]'' seeds, which are harder than the seeds that [[New World monkey]]s are known to break open.{{Sfn|Sterling|McCreless|2006|pp=159\u2013184}} At least 36&nbsp;genera from 23&nbsp;families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\n[[Inflorescence]]s (clusters of flowers) of at least 60&nbsp;plant families are eaten by lemurs ranging in size from the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed ([[nectarivore|nectarivory]]) along with the pollen ([[palynivore|palynivory]]). At least 24&nbsp;native species from 17&nbsp;plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nBark and plant exudates such as [[tree sap]] are consumed by a few lemur species. The exploitation of exudates has been reported in 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the [[Masoala fork-marked lemur]] (''Phaner furcifer'') and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the [[red-tailed sportive lemur]] (''Lepilemur ruficaudatus''), the [[common brown lemur]] (''Eulemur fulvus''), and [[Verreaux's sifaka]] (''Propithecus verreauxi''). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on ''[[Afzelia bijuga]]'' (genus ''[[Afzelia]]'') at [[Nosy Mangabe]] in the northeast.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nSoil consumption ([[geophagy]]) has also been reported and likely helps with [[digestion]], provides minerals and salts, and helps absorb toxins. Sifakas have been observed eating soil from [[termite]] mounds, possibly adding beneficial [[Gut flora|intestinal flora]] to aid the digestion of [[cellulose]] from their folivorous diet.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=284\u2013391}}\n\n===Social systems===\n[[File:CHEIROGALEUS-1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A small squirrel-like lemur, with a long, slender body and a thick tail, looks over its shoulder from a palm tree.|[[Dwarf lemur]]s are solitary but social, foraging alone but often sleeping in groups.]]\n\nLemurs are social and live in groups that usually include fewer than 15&nbsp;individuals.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} Observed [[social organisation|social organization]] patterns include \"[[solitary but social]]\", \"[[Fission-fusion society|fission-fusion]]\", \"[[pair bond]]s\", and \"[[multi-male group]]\".{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=3\u201337}} Nocturnal lemurs are mostly solitary but social, foraging alone at night but often nesting in groups during the day. The degree of socialization varies by species, gender, location, and season.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} In many nocturnal species, for instance, the females, along with their young, will share nests with other females and possibly one male, whose larger [[home range]] happens to overlap one or more female nesting groups. In [[sportive lemur]]s and [[fork-marked lemur]]s, one or two females may share a home range, possibly with a male. In addition to sharing nests, they will also interact vocally or physically with their range-mate while they forage at night.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} Diurnal lemurs exhibit many of the social systems seen in monkeys and apes,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} living in relatively permanent and cohesive social groups. Multi-male groups are the most common, just as they are in most anthropoid primates. [[True lemur]]s utilize this social system, often living in groups of ten or less. Ruffed lemurs have been shown to live in fission-fusion societies,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}} and Indri forms pair bonds.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=3\u201337}}\n\nSome lemurs exhibit female [[philopatry]], where females stay within their natal range and the males migrate upon reaching maturity, and in other species both sexes will migrate.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} In some cases, female philopatry may help explain the evolution of female-bonded multi-male groups, such as those of the ring-tailed lemur, [[Milne-Edwards' sifaka]] (''Propithecus edwardsi''), and the Verreaux's sifaka. Their ancestors may have been more solitary, with females that lived in mother-daughter pairs (or dyads). Over time, these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother-daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide home range. If this is true, then multi-male groups in lemurs may differ fundamentally in their internal structure from those in [[catarrhini|catarrhine]] primates (Old World monkeys and apes).{{R|1998Jolly}}\n\n[[File:Lemur catta 002.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two adult ring-tailed lemurs lick each other's face while a juvenile moves around on its mother's back.|Social grooming serves many functions for social lemurs.]]\n\nThe presence of female [[dominance (ethology)|social dominance]] sets lemurs apart from most other primates and mammals;{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}{{Sfn|Rowe|1996|p=27}}{{R|2008Dunham}} in most primate societies, males are dominant unless females band together to form coalitions that displace them.{{R|1990Young}} However, many ''Eulemur'' species are exceptions{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=257\u2013269}}{{Sfn|Overdorff|Johnson|2003|pp=1320\u20131324}} and the [[greater bamboo lemur]] (''Prolemur simus'') does not exhibit female dominance.{{Sfn|Tan|2006|pp=369\u2013382}} When females are dominant within a group, the way they maintain dominance varies. Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression. Male [[crowned lemur]]s (''Eulemur coronatus''), on the other hand, will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them. Female aggression is often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.{{R|2002Digby}}\n\nThere have been many hypotheses that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{R|2008Dunham}} but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given the high costs of reproduction and the scarcity of resources available.{{R|2008Dunham}} Indeed, female dominance has been shown to be linked to increased maternal investment.{{R|1990Young}} However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple [[game theory]]. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes.{{R|2008Dunham}} The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: [[Mating plug|copulatory plugs]], which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.{{R|2009Dunham}}\n\nIn general, levels of [[agonistic behaviour|agonism]] (or aggression) tend to correlate with relative canine height. The ring-tailed lemur has long, sharp upper canine teeth in both sexes, and it also exhibits high levels of agonism. The Indri, on the other hand, has smaller canines and exhibits lower levels of aggression.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|pp=41\u201364}} When neighboring groups of the same species defend their territories, the conflict can take the form of ritualized defense. In sifakas, these ritualized combats involve staring, growling, scent-marking, and leaping to occupy certain sections of the tree. The indri defends its home range with ritualized \"singing\" battles.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}\n\nLike other primates, lemurs groom socially ([[Social grooming|allogroom]]) to ease tensions and solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, between mother and infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances.{{R|1966Jolly}} Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{R|1966Jolly}} Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and for the same reasons as anthropoids.{{R|1966Jolly}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Activity patterns===\nThe [[Chronobiology|biological rhythm]] can vary from nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most larger lemurs.

Some lemurs [[defecation|defecate]] in specific areas, otherwise known as [[latrine behavior]]. Although many animals exhibit this behavior, it is a rare trait among primates. Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}\n\nCompared to other mammals, primates in general are very vocal, and lemurs are no exception.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}} Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs.{{Sfn|Jolly|2003|pp=1329\u20131331}}{{Sfn|Vasey|2003|pp=1332\u20131336}} Some of the most common calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls.

However, to endure the extreme dry season, three of the five species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (''Cheirogaleus medius''), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}} Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] preferences, [[Tropical rainforest#Layers|forest strata]] used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} A classic example involves [[Niche differentiation|resource partitioning]] between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, and the [[eastern lesser bamboo lemur]] (''Hapalemur griseus'').

[[Alison Jolly]] began her research here in 1962.]]\nLemurs are mentioned in sailors' voyage logs as far back as 1608 and in 1658 that at least seven lemur species were described in detail by the French merchant, [[\u00c9tienne de Flacourt]], who may also have been the only westerner to see and chronicle the existence of a giant (now extinct) lemur, which he called the ''[[Subfossil lemur#Lingering populations|tretretretre]]''. Around 1703 merchants and sailors began bringing lemurs back to Europe, at which time [[James Petiver]], an apothecary in London, described and illustrated the mongoose lemur. Starting in 1751, the London illustrator [[George Edwards (naturalist)|George Edwards]] began describing and illustrating some lemur species, of which a few were included in various editions of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' by Carl Linnaeus. In the 1760s and 1770s, French naturalists [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] began describing the anatomy of several lemur species. The first traveling naturalist to comment on lemurs was [[Philibert Commer\u00e7on]] in 1771, although it was [[Pierre Sonnerat]] who recorded a greater variety of lemur species during his travels.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}}\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was an explosion of new lemur descriptions and names, which later took decades to sort out. During this time, professional collectors gathered specimens for [[museum]]s, [[menagerie]]s, and [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets]]. Some of the major collectors were [[Johann Maria Hildebrandt]] and [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]]. From these collections, as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats, museum [[systematics|systematists]] including [[Albert G\u00fcnther]] and [[John Edward Gray]] continued to contribute new names for new lemur species. However, the most notable contributions from this century includes the work of [[Alfred Grandidier]], a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself to the study of Madagascar's natural history and local people. With the help of [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]], most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time. However, lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s, being standardized by [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]] in 1931.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}}\n\nAlthough lemur taxonomy had developed, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of lemur behavior and ecology began to blossom. [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] and [[Arlette Petter-Rousseaux]] toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, [[David Attenborough]] introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of [[John Buettner-Janusch]], who founded the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in 1966, [[Alison Jolly]] traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux's sifaka at [[Berenty Private Reserve]]. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as [[Alison Richard]], [[Robert Sussman]], [[Ian Tattersall]], and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of [[Elwyn L. Simons]] and the conservation efforts of [[Patricia Wright]].{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}} In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nEx situ research (or off-site research) is also popular among researchers looking to answer questions that are difficult to test in the field. For example, efforts to [[Full genome sequencing|sequence the genome]] of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates.{{R|2007Yoder}} One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

This international NGO supports Madagascar's [[Parc Ivoloina]], helps protect [[Betampona Reserve]] and other protected areas, and promotes field research, breeding programs, conservation planning, and education in zoos.{{Sfn|Sargent|Anderson|2003|pp=1543\u20131545}} One of their major projects involved the release of captive black-and-white ruffed lemurs, designed to help restock the dwindling population within Betampona Reserve.{{Sfn|Sargent|Anderson|2003|pp=1543\u20131545}}{{Sfn|Britt|Iambana|Welch|Katz|2003|pp=1545\u20131551}}\n\n[[Habitat corridor]]s are needed for linking these protected areas so that small populations are not isolated.{{Sfn|Mittermeier|Konstant|Rylands|2003|pp=1538\u20131543}} In {{Nowrap|September 2003}} in [[Durban]], South Africa, Madagascar's former president [[Marc Ravalomanana]] promised to triple the size of the island's protected areas in five years.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=15\u201317}} This became known as the \"Durban Vision\".{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=52\u201384}} In June&nbsp;2007, the [[World Heritage Committee]] included a sizable portion of Madagascar's eastern rainforests as a new [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].{{R|2007Yoder}}\n\nDebt relief may help Madagascar protect its biodiversity.{{R|ScienceDaily_14Jun08}} With the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|political crisis]] in 2009, [[Illegal logging in Madagascar|illegal logging]] has proliferated and now threatens rainforests in the northeast, including its lemur inhabitants and the ecotourism that the local communities rely upon.{{R|2009eStandardsForum}}\n\nCaptive lemur populations are maintained locally and outside of Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited.

It has a very short tail and its face, hands, and upper back are black while the rest of it is white.|The [[indri]] is known locally as ''babakoto'', which translates to \"Ancestor of Man\".]]\n\nIn Malagasy culture lemurs, and animals in general, have [[soul]]s (''ambiroa'') which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if killed in a cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other elements of daily life, have been a source of [[taboo]]s, known locally as ''fady'', which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the [[ancestor]] of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} In general, ''fady'' extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.{{R|2001Simons}}\n\nOne example of lemur ''fady'' told around 1970 comes from [[Ambatofinandrahana]] in the [[Fianarantsoa Province]]. According to the account, a man brought a lemur home in a trap, but alive. His children wanted to keep the lemur as a pet, but when the father told them it was not a domestic animal, the children asked to kill it. After the children tortured the lemur, it eventually died and was eaten. A short time later, all the children died of illness. As a result, the father declared that anyone who tortures lemurs for fun shall \"be destroyed and have no descendants.\"{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\n''Fady'' can not only help protect lemurs and their forests under stable [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic situations]], but they can also lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town.{{Sfn|Goodman|Ganzhorn|Rakotondravony|2003|pp=1159\u20131186}}{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} In other ways, ''fady'' does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} ''Fady'' can vary from village to village within the same region.{{Sfn|Sterling|2003|pp=1348\u20131351}} If people move to a new village or region, their ''fady'' may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. ''Fady'' restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.{{Sfn|Goodman|Ganzhorn|Rakotondravony|2003|pp=1159\u20131186}}\n\nThe aye-aye is almost universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar,{{R|2001Simons}} though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road outside of town (so others can carry the bad fortunes away) or burn their village and move.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=205\u2013207}}{{Sfn|Sterling|2003|pp=1348\u20131351}} The superstitions behind aye-aye ''fady'' include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein,{{Sfn|Goodman|Ganzhorn|Rakotondravony|2003|pp=1159\u20131186}} that they embody ancestral spirits,{{Sfn|Sterling|2003|pp=1348\u20131351}} or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=48\u2013161}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=205\u2013207}} As of 1970, the people of the [[Marolambo]] District in the [[Toamasina Province]] feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\nThere are also widespread ''fady'' about indri and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption because of their resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or [[orthograde posture]]. The resemblance is even stronger for indri, which lack the long tail of most living lemurs.{{Sfn|Thalmann|Powzyk|2003|pp=1342\u20131345}}{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305\u2013326}} Known locally as ''babakoto'' (\"Ancestor of Man\"), the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} Other lemur ''fady'' include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a [[woolly lemur]], or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\nLemurs have also become popular in [[Western culture]] in recent years. The original 2005 animated film ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' was seen by an estimated 100&nbsp;million people in theaters and 200\u2013300&nbsp;million people on DVD worldwide.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=85\u201388}} Prior to this movie, ''[[Zoboomafoo]]'', a [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) children's television series from 1999 to 2001,{{R|WashingtonTimes1021}} helped to popularize sifakas by featuring a live [[Coquerel's sifaka]] from the Duke Lemur Center as well as a puppet.{{R|USAToday0330}} A twenty-episode series called ''Lemur Kingdom'' (in the United States) or ''[[Lemur Street]]'' (in the United Kingdom and Canada) aired in 2008 on [[Animal Planet]]. It combined the typical animal [[documentary film|documentary]] with [[dramatic programming|dramatic narration]] to tell the story of two groups of ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve.{{R|NYDailyNews0208|WashingtonPost0208|AfricaNews1228|TGAM0208}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n<!------------------------------------------------------------\nThis article uses list-defined references in conjunction with\nthe {{r}} and {{Sfn}} templates to keep the body text clean.\nPlease follow existing examples within the text and refer to\n\nthe following documentation pages if needed:\n\nList-defined references:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LDR\n\nTemplate {{r}}:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:R\n\nTemplate {{Sfn}}:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Sfn\n\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a\ndiscussion of different citation methods and how to generate\nfootnotes using the <ref> tags.\n------------------------------------------------------------->\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<!-- Journal sources -->\n<ref name=\"IUCN\">{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org | title = IUCN 2014 | year = 2012 | work =[[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.]] Version 2014.3 | publisher = [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] | accessdate = 12 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"2012Dunkel_et_al\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dunkel | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Zijlstra | first2 = J.S. | last3 = Groves | first3 = C.P. | title = Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 | url = http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf | journal = Lemur News | volume = 16 | year = 2012 | issn = 1608-1439 | pages = 64\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<!--unused<ref name=\"2012McLain\">{{Cite journal | last1 = McLain | first1 = A.

They chiefly live in trees ([[arboreal]]), and are active at night ([[nocturnal]]).  \n\nLemurs share resemblance with other primates, but evolved independently from [[monkey]]s and [[ape]]s. Due to Madagascar's highly seasonal climate, [[Evolution of lemurs|lemur evolution]] has produced a level of [[species diversity]] rivaling that of any other primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000&nbsp;years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male [[gorilla]]. Most species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic classification]] is controversial and depends on which [[Species problem|species concept]] is used. \n\nLemurs range in weight from the {{convert|30|g|oz|adj=on}} [[mouse lemur]] to the {{convert|9|kg|lb|adj=on}} [[indri]]. Lemurs share many common basal primate traits, such as divergent [[digit (anatomy)|digits]] on their hands and feet, and [[nail (anatomy)|nails]] instead of [[claw]]s (in most species). However, their [[Brain-to-body mass ratio|brain-to-body size ratio]] is smaller than that of [[Anthropoidea|anthropoid]] primates. As with all [[strepsirrhine]] primates, they have a \"wet nose\" ([[rhinarium]]). Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates, and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Lemurs have a relatively low [[basal metabolic rate]], and as a result may exhibit [[dormancy]] such as [[hibernation]] or [[torpor]]. They also have [[seasonal breeder|seasonal breeding]] and [[dominance (ethology)|female social dominance]]. Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists. Two species of lemurs may coexist in the same forest due to different diets. \n\nLemur research during the 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection. Modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior did not begin in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by political issues on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and [[human evolution]]. Many lemur species are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and hunting. Many lemur species have already gone extinct in the last 2000 years due to human activity, and are collectively referred to as the \"[[Subfossil lemur|subfossil lemurs]]\". Although local traditions generally help protect lemurs and their forests, [[Illegal logging in Madagascar|illegal logging]], widespread poverty, and political instability hinder and undermine conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world's most endangered mammals, noting that {{as of|2013|lc=y}} up to 90% of all lemur species face extinction within the next 20 to 25&nbsp;years.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name lemur is derived from the [[Latin]]  ''[[lemures]]'',{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85\u201386}} which refers to specters or ghosts that were [[exorcism|exorcised]] during the [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria festival]] of ancient Rome.<ref name=\"ley196608\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |last3=\n |first3=\n |date=August 1966\n |title=Scherazade's Island\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n06_1966-08#page/n45/mode/2up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=45\u201355\n |type=\n}}</ref>{{R|2008Lux}}\n\n[[Carl Linnaeus]], the founder of modern [[binomial nomenclature]], gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']]. He included three species under the genus ''Lemur'': ''Lemur tardigradus'' (the [[red slender loris]], now known as ''Loris tardigradus''), ''Lemur catta'' (the [[ring-tailed lemur]]), and ''Lemur volans'' (the [[Philippine flying lemur|Philippine colugo]], now known as ''Cynocephalus volans'').{{Sfn|Linnaeus|1758|pp=29\u201330}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = ''Lemures dixi hos, quod noctu imprimis obambulant, hominibus quodanmodo similes, & lento passu vagantur.''<br />[I call them lemurs, because they go around mainly by night, in a certain way similar to humans, and roam with a slow pace.]\n |source = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], ''Museum Adolphi Friderici Regis''{{Sfn|Linnaeus|1754|p=4}}<br />in reference to the [[red slender loris]]{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n |width = 25%\n |align = right\n}}\nAlthough the term \"lemur\" was first intended for [[slender loris]]es, it was soon limited to the [[endemic]] Malagasy primates, which have been known as \"lemurs\" ever since.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=43\u201344}} According to Linnaeus' own explanation, the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}} Being familiar with the works of [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]] and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term \"lemur\" for these nocturnal primates.{{Sfn|Blunt|Stearn|2002|p=252}} \n\nIt was noted in 2012 that it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, [[Tapetum lucidum|reflective eyes]], and ghostly cries of lemurs.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}} It has also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that some Malagasy people have held legends that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors,{{Sfn|Nield|2007|p=41}} but this is unlikely given that the name was selected for slender lorises from India.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n\n==Evolution==\n{{Main|Evolution of lemurs}}\n\nLemurs are primates belonging to the suborder [[Strepsirrhini]]. Like other strepsirrhine [[primate]]s, such as [[loris]]es, [[potto]]s, and [[galago]]s, they share ancestral (or [[Cladistics#plesiomorphy|plesiomorphic]]) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes ([[simian]]s). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on [[Madagascar]].{{R|1997Kay}} All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as [[adapiformes|adapiforms]] during the [[Eocene]] (56 to 34&nbsp;[[Year#Symbols y and yr|mya]]) or [[Paleocene]] (66 to 56&nbsp;mya).{{R|1997Kay}}{{Sfn|Gould|Sauther|2006|pp=vii\u2013xiii}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a [[toothcomb]], which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}{{Sfn|Preston-Mafham|1991|pp=141\u2013188}}{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}} A more recent [[hypothesis]] is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is supported by comparative studies of the [[cytochrome&nbsp;b]] gene and the presence of the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}}{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242\u20131247}} Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by [[molecular phylogenetic]] studies.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}} The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65&nbsp;mya according to molecular studies,{{R|2004YoderYang}} although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55&nbsp;mya for this divergence.{{r|2006Godinot}} However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually [[subfossil]]s dating to the [[Late Pleistocene]].{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}\n\nOnce part of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], the island of Madagascar has been isolated since it broke away from eastern [[Africa]] (~160&nbsp;mya), [[Antarctica]] (~80\u2013130&nbsp;mya), and [[Indian Plate|India]] (~80\u201390&nbsp;mya).{{Sfn|Flynn|Wyss|2003|pp=34\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=23\u201326}} Since ancestral lemurs are thought to have originated in Africa around 62 to 65&nbsp;mya, they must have crossed the [[Mozambique Channel]], a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560&nbsp;km (350&nbsp;mi).{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}} In 1915, [[paleontologist]] [[William Diller Matthew]] noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random [[rafting event]]s, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers.{{R|1915Matthew}} This form of [[biological dispersal]] can occur randomly over millions of years.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2006|pp=3\u201318}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=14\u201315}} In the 1940s, American paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] coined the term \"sweepstakes hypothesis\" for such random events.{{R|NatureNews_20Jan10}} Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar,{{R|2008Horvath}}{{Sfn|Krause|2003|pp=40\u201347}} but until recently this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong [[ocean current]]s flow away from the island.{{R|2010AliHuber}} In {{Nowrap|January 2010}}, a report demonstrated that around 60&nbsp;mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650&nbsp;km (1,030&nbsp;mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different [[ocean gyre]], producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30&nbsp;days or less\u2014short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the [[plate tectonics|continental plates]] drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20&nbsp;mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs and the rest of the terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa.{{R|2010AliHuber}} Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] mammalian groups, such as [[squirrel]]s.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}} They were also spared from having to compete with [[monkey]]s, which evolved later.

In one taxonomy, the infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids ([[Lorisidae|lorisids]] and galagos).{{R|2006Godinot}}{{Sfn|Cartmill|2010|p=15}} Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs.{{Sfn|Hartwig|2011|pp=20\u201321}} In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves, the [[aye-aye]] was placed in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, while the rest of the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n\nAlthough it is generally agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, the relationship between the other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12&nbsp;million-year window between the Late Eocene (42&nbsp;mya) and into the Oligocene (30&nbsp;mya).{{R|2004YoderYang|2008Horvath}} The two main competing hypotheses are shown in the adjacent image.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" border=\"1\" width=\"850pt\"\n|+ Competing taxonomic nomenclature for lemurs and their kin\n|-\n! 2 infraorders{{Sfn|Cartmill|2010|p=15}}\n! 3 infraorders{{Sfn|Hartwig|2011|pp=20\u201321}}\n! 4 infraorders{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n|-\n|\n* Order [[Primate]]s\n** Suborder [[Strepsirrhini]]\n*** Infraorder {{extinct}}[[Adapiformes]]\n*** Infraorder [[Lemuriformes]]\n**** '''Superfamily Lemuroidea'''\n***** Family {{extinct}}[[Monkey lemur|Archaeolemuridae]]\n***** Family [[Cheirogaleidae]]\n***** Family [[Aye-aye|Daubentoniidae]]\n***** Family [[Indriidae]]\n***** Family [[Lemuridae]]\n***** Family [[Sportive lemur|Lepilemuridae]]\n***** Family {{extinct}}[[Megaladapis|Megaladapidae]]\n***** Family {{extinct}}[[Sloth lemur|Palaeopropithecidae]]\n**** Superfamily [[Lorisoidea]]\n** Suborder [[Haplorrhini]]\n|\n* Order Primates\n** Suborder Strepsirrhini\n*** Infraorder {{extinct}}Adapiformes\n*** '''Infraorder Lemuriformes'''\n**** '''Superfamily Lemuroidea'''\n***** Family {{extinct}}Archaeolemuridae\n***** Family Cheirogaleidae\n***** Family Daubentoniidae\n***** Family Indriidae\n***** Family Lemuridae\n***** Family Lepilemuridae\n***** Family {{extinct}}Megaladapidae\n***** Family {{extinct}}Palaeopropithecidae\n*** Infraorder Lorisiformes\n** Suborder Haplorrhini\n|\n* Order Primates\n** Suborder Strepsirrhini\n*** Infraorder {{extinct}}Adapiformes\n*** '''Infraorder [[Aye-aye|Chiromyiformes]]'''\n*** '''Infraorder Lemuriformes'''\n**** Superfamily Cheirogaleoidea\n***** Family Cheirogaleidae\n**** Superfamily Lemuroidea\n***** Family {{extinct}}Archaeolemuridae\n***** Family Indriidae\n***** Family Lemuridae\n***** Family Lepilemuridae\n***** Family {{extinct}}Megaladapidae\n***** Family {{extinct}}Palaeopropithecidae\n*** Infraorder Lorisiformes\n** Suborder Haplorrhini\n|}\n\n[[File:Lepilemur sahamalazensis c.png|thumb|upright|alt=A sportive lemur (small body, long legs, brown fur, large eyes, and thick, furry tail) clings to the side of a tree, with its head turned towards the camera.|The [[Sahamalaza sportive lemur]] (''Lepilemur sahamalazensis'') was identified as a distinct species in 2006.]]\nLemur taxonomy has changed significantly since the first taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.

Only the ring-tailed lemur, the [[bamboo lemur]]s (genus ''Hapalemur''), and the [[black-and-white ruffed lemur]] (''Varecia variegata'') are known to consume [[herb]]s. While Madagascar is rich in [[fern]] diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible reason for this is that ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds\u2014common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of [[tannin]]s in their [[frond]]s.

Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.{{Sfn|Birkinshaw|Colquhoun|2003|pp=1207\u20131220}}\n\nMany lemurs that eat leaves tend to do so during times of fruit scarcity, sometimes suffering weight loss as a result.{{Sfn|Wright|2006|pp=385\u2013402}} Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit ([[frugivore|frugivory]]) when available.

Only the [[Masoala fork-marked lemur]] (''Phaner furcifer'') and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the [[red-tailed sportive lemur]] (''Lepilemur ruficaudatus''), the [[common brown lemur]] (''Eulemur fulvus''), and [[Verreaux's sifaka]] (''Propithecus verreauxi'').

Their ancestors may have been more solitary, with females that lived in mother-daughter pairs (or dyads). Over time, these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother-daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide home range.

Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression.

Female aggression is often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.{{R|2002Digby}}\n\nThere have been many hypotheses that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not,{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{R|2008Dunham}} but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given the high costs of reproduction and the scarcity of resources available.{{R|2008Dunham}} Indeed, female dominance has been shown to be linked to increased maternal investment.{{R|1990Young}} However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple [[game theory]]. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes.{{R|2008Dunham}} The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: [[Mating plug|copulatory plugs]], which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.{{R|2009Dunham}}\n\nIn general, levels of [[agonistic behaviour|agonism]] (or aggression) tend to correlate with relative canine height. The ring-tailed lemur has long, sharp upper canine teeth in both sexes, and it also exhibits high levels of agonism. The Indri, on the other hand, has smaller canines and exhibits lower levels of aggression.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|pp=41\u201364}} When neighboring groups of the same species defend their territories, the conflict can take the form of ritualized defense. In sifakas, these ritualized combats involve staring, growling, scent-marking, and leaping to occupy certain sections of the tree. The indri defends its home range with ritualized \"singing\" battles.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}\n\nLike other primates, lemurs groom socially ([[Social grooming|allogroom]]) to ease tensions and solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, between mother and infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances.{{R|1966Jolly}} Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{R|1966Jolly}} Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and for the same reasons as anthropoids.{{R|1966Jolly}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Activity patterns===\nThe [[Chronobiology|biological rhythm]] can vary from nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most larger lemurs.

Some lemurs [[defecation|defecate]] in specific areas, otherwise known as [[latrine behavior]]. Although many animals exhibit this behavior, it is a rare trait among primates. Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}}\n\nCompared to other mammals, primates in general are very vocal, and lemurs are no exception.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=392\u2013514}} Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs.{{Sfn|Jolly|2003|pp=1329\u20131331}}{{Sfn|Vasey|2003|pp=1332\u20131336}} Some of the most common calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls.

However, to endure the extreme dry season, three of the five species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (''Cheirogaleus medius''), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=107\u2013148}} Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] preferences, [[Tropical rainforest#Layers|forest strata]] used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}} A classic example involves [[Niche differentiation|resource partitioning]] between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, and the [[eastern lesser bamboo lemur]] (''Hapalemur griseus'').

[[Alison Jolly]] began her research here in 1962.]]\nLemurs are mentioned in sailors' voyage logs as far back as 1608 and in 1658 that at least seven lemur species were described in detail by the French merchant, [[\u00c9tienne de Flacourt]], who may also have been the only westerner to see and chronicle the existence of a giant (now extinct) lemur, which he called the ''[[Subfossil lemur#Lingering populations|tretretretre]]''. Around 1703 merchants and sailors began bringing lemurs back to Europe, at which time [[James Petiver]], an apothecary in London, described and illustrated the mongoose lemur. Starting in 1751, the London illustrator [[George Edwards (naturalist)|George Edwards]] began describing and illustrating some lemur species, of which a few were included in various editions of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' by Carl Linnaeus. In the 1760s and 1770s, French naturalists [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] began describing the anatomy of several lemur species. The first traveling naturalist to comment on lemurs was [[Philibert Commer\u00e7on]] in 1771, although it was [[Pierre Sonnerat]] who recorded a greater variety of lemur species during his travels.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}}\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was an explosion of new lemur descriptions and names, which later took decades to sort out. During this time, professional collectors gathered specimens for [[museum]]s, [[menagerie]]s, and [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets]]. Some of the major collectors were [[Johann Maria Hildebrandt]] and [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]]. From these collections, as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats, museum [[systematics|systematists]] including [[Albert G\u00fcnther]] and [[John Edward Gray]] continued to contribute new names for new lemur species. However, the most notable contributions from this century includes the work of [[Alfred Grandidier]], a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself to the study of Madagascar's natural history and local people. With the help of [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]], most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time. However, lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s, being standardized by [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]] in 1931.{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}}\n\nAlthough lemur taxonomy had developed, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of lemur behavior and ecology began to blossom. [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] and [[Arlette Petter-Rousseaux]] toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, [[David Attenborough]] introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of [[John Buettner-Janusch]], who founded the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in 1966, [[Alison Jolly]] traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux's sifaka at [[Berenty Private Reserve]]. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as [[Alison Richard]], [[Robert Sussman]], [[Ian Tattersall]], and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of [[Elwyn L. Simons]] and the conservation efforts of [[Patricia Wright]].{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|pp=19\u201340}}{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=27\u201336}} In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nEx situ research (or off-site research) is also popular among researchers looking to answer questions that are difficult to test in the field. For example, efforts to [[Full genome sequencing|sequence the genome]] of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates.{{R|2007Yoder}} One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

This international NGO supports Madagascar's [[Parc Ivoloina]], helps protect [[Betampona Reserve]] and other protected areas, and promotes field research, breeding programs, conservation planning, and education in zoos.{{Sfn|Sargent|Anderson|2003|pp=1543\u20131545}} One of their major projects involved the release of captive black-and-white ruffed lemurs, designed to help restock the dwindling population within Betampona Reserve.{{Sfn|Sargent|Anderson|2003|pp=1543\u20131545}}{{Sfn|Britt|Iambana|Welch|Katz|2003|pp=1545\u20131551}}\n\n[[Habitat corridor]]s are needed for linking these protected areas so that small populations are not isolated.{{Sfn|Mittermeier|Konstant|Rylands|2003|pp=1538\u20131543}} In {{Nowrap|September 2003}} in [[Durban]], South Africa, Madagascar's former president [[Marc Ravalomanana]] promised to triple the size of the island's protected areas in five years.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=15\u201317}} This became known as the \"Durban Vision\".{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=52\u201384}} In June&nbsp;2007, the [[World Heritage Committee]] included a sizable portion of Madagascar's eastern rainforests as a new [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].{{R|2007Yoder}}\n\nDebt relief may help Madagascar protect its biodiversity.{{R|ScienceDaily_14Jun08}} With the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|political crisis]] in 2009, [[Illegal logging in Madagascar|illegal logging]] has proliferated and now threatens rainforests in the northeast, including its lemur inhabitants and the ecotourism that the local communities rely upon.{{R|2009eStandardsForum}}\n\nCaptive lemur populations are maintained locally and outside of Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited.

It has a very short tail and its face, hands, and upper back are black while the rest of it is white.|The [[indri]] is known locally as ''babakoto'', which translates to \"Ancestor of Man\".]]\n\nIn Malagasy culture lemurs, and animals in general, have [[soul]]s (''ambiroa'') which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if killed in a cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other elements of daily life, have been a source of [[taboo]]s, known locally as ''fady'', which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the [[ancestor]] of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} In general, ''fady'' extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.{{R|2001Simons}}\n\nOne example of lemur ''fady'' told around 1970 comes from [[Ambatofinandrahana]] in the [[Fianarantsoa Province]]. According to the account, a man brought a lemur home in a trap, but alive. His children wanted to keep the lemur as a pet, but when the father told them it was not a domestic animal, the children asked to kill it. After the children tortured the lemur, it eventually died and was eaten. A short time later, all the children died of illness. As a result, the father declared that anyone who tortures lemurs for fun shall \"be destroyed and have no descendants.\"{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\n''Fady'' can not only help protect lemurs and their forests under stable [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic situations]], but they can also lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town.{{Sfn|Goodman|Ganzhorn|Rakotondravony|2003|pp=1159\u20131186}}{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} In other ways, ''fady'' does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|pp=149\u2013229}}{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} ''Fady'' can vary from village to village within the same region.{{Sfn|Sterling|2003|pp=1348\u20131351}} If people move to a new village or region, their ''fady'' may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. ''Fady'' restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.{{Sfn|Goodman|Ganzhorn|Rakotondravony|2003|pp=1159\u20131186}}\n\nThe aye-aye is almost universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar,{{R|2001Simons}} though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road outside of town (so others can carry the bad fortunes away) or burn their village and move.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=205\u2013207}}{{Sfn|Sterling|2003|pp=1348\u20131351}} The superstitions behind aye-aye ''fady'' include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein,{{Sfn|Goodman|Ganzhorn|Rakotondravony|2003|pp=1159\u20131186}} that they embody ancestral spirits,{{Sfn|Sterling|2003|pp=1348\u20131351}} or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=48\u2013161}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=205\u2013207}} As of 1970, the people of the [[Marolambo]] District in the [[Toamasina Province]] feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\nThere are also widespread ''fady'' about indri and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption because of their resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or [[orthograde posture]]. The resemblance is even stronger for indri, which lack the long tail of most living lemurs.{{Sfn|Thalmann|Powzyk|2003|pp=1342\u20131345}}{{Sfn|Irwin|2006|pp=305\u2013326}} Known locally as ''babakoto'' (\"Ancestor of Man\"), the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}} Other lemur ''fady'' include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a [[woolly lemur]], or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|pp=97\u2013101}}\n\nLemurs have also become popular in [[Western culture]] in recent years. The original 2005 animated film ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' was seen by an estimated 100&nbsp;million people in theaters and 200\u2013300&nbsp;million people on DVD worldwide.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=85\u201388}} Prior to this movie, ''[[Zoboomafoo]]'', a [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) children's television series from 1999 to 2001,{{R|WashingtonTimes1021}} helped to popularize sifakas by featuring a live [[Coquerel's sifaka]] from the Duke Lemur Center as well as a puppet.{{R|USAToday0330}} A twenty-episode series called ''Lemur Kingdom'' (in the United States) or ''[[Lemur Street]]'' (in the United Kingdom and Canada) aired in 2008 on [[Animal Planet]]. It combined the typical animal [[documentary film|documentary]] with [[dramatic programming|dramatic narration]] to tell the story of two groups of ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve.{{R|NYDailyNews0208|WashingtonPost0208|AfricaNews1228|TGAM0208}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n<!------------------------------------------------------------\nThis article uses list-defined references in conjunction with\nthe {{r}} and {{Sfn}} templates to keep the body text clean.\nPlease follow existing examples within the text and refer to\n\nthe following documentation pages if needed:\n\nList-defined references:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LDR\n\nTemplate {{r}}:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:R\n\nTemplate {{Sfn}}:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Sfn\n\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a\ndiscussion of different citation methods and how to generate\nfootnotes using the <ref> tags.\n------------------------------------------------------------->\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<!-- Journal sources -->\n<ref name=\"IUCN\">{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org | title = IUCN 2014 | year = 2012 | work =[[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.]] Version 2014.3 | publisher = [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] | accessdate = 12 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"2012Dunkel_et_al\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dunkel | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Zijlstra | first2 = J.S. | last3 = Groves | first3 = C.P. | title = Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 | url = http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf | journal = Lemur News | volume = 16 | year = 2012 | issn = 1608-1439 | pages = 64\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<!--unused<ref name=\"2012McLain\">{{Cite journal | last1 = McLain | first1 = A.

{"title_page": "The Turkish harpist (Manuchehri)", "text_new": "{{short description|11th-century poem by Manuchehri}}\n'''Manuchehri's Turkish harpist''' is a poem by the 11th-century Persian royal court poet [[Manuchehri]]. It is also known as {{lang|fa-Latn|Dar mahd-e Espahbad Man\u016bchehr ebn-e Q\u0101b\u016bs}} ({{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u062f\u062d \u0627\u0633\u067e\u0647\u0628\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0686\u0647\u0631 \u0622\u0628\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0633}}) \"In praise of the Espahbad Manuchehr son of Qabus\", or [[Qasida]] no. 39 in the collected works of Manuchehri.<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/manoochehri/divanm/ghaside-ghete/sh39/ Qasida 39] (Ganjoor website).</ref>\n\nThe poem is a ''[[qasida|qas\u012bda]]'' (praise poem) in the Arabic style, consisting of 30 or 31 verses,<ref>Kazimirski's text omits verse 13.</ref> all with the same rhyme. The first ten lines praise the beauty and skill of a harpist who is playing at the autumn festival of Mehrgan. Lines 11\u201316 describe the fierceness and warlike qualities of Manuchehr, to whom the poem is addressed, and lines 17\u201323 describe the ruler's splendid war horse. The poet goes on to encourage Manuchehr to enjoy the feast and ends with a prayer that his career will continue to be successful and glorious.\n\nThe poem is notable for its musical rhymes, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang \u010dang ... sang sang ... tang tang}}, which imitate the thrumming of the harp (''[[chang (instrument)|chang]]'') and play on different meanings of the words. As with many of Manuchehri's poems he expresses his delight in the feast and the joys of life.<ref>Cf. Shokrpour et al (2014).</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\nManuchehri's patron, after whom he took his pen-name Manuchehri, [[Manuchihr|Manuchehr]] son of Qabus, was ruler of the region of [[Tabaristan]], also known as [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], on the south side of the Caspian Sea. Manuchehr was not completely independent, but was a vassal of Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (d. 1030). The title Espahbad or Espahbod was given to an army commander or minor ruler not directly appointed by the Sultan, but who was a vassal like Manuchehr or his father.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 360.</ref> The title goes back to pre-Islamic times.<ref>Browne (1906), p. 92.</ref>\n\nManuchehr died c. 1030, so the poem was evidently written therefore before this date. Sometime after Manuchehr's death, Manuchehri migrated to [[Ghazni]] (in present day Afghanistan) where be became a court poet to Mahmud's son, [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]].\n\nThe poem was written to celebrate the autumn festival of [[Mehregan|Mehrg\u0101n]] (also pronounced Mehreg\u0101n or Mehrag\u0101n), a festival dating back to pre-Islamic times which is held 195 days after the spring festival of [[Nowruz]].\n\n==Sex of the harpist==\nThe sex of the harpist is not completely clear. Although harpists were often illustrated as female, yet the instrument was also played by men: both [[Rudaki]]<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref> and Manuchehri's contemporary [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] are said to have been excellent harpists.<ref>Browne (1906), vol. 2, p. 124.</ref> It was possible for the same person to be both a soldier and to play the harp, as this verse of Farrokhi, in another ''qasida'' using the rhyme ''-ang'' and playing on the two meanings of {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u010dang}}, makes clear:<ref>Quoted by EIr (2004); cf. [https://ganjoor.net/farrokhi/divanf/ghasidefk/sh104/ Farrokhi qaside 104 (Ganjoor)], verse 1.</ref>\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u0631 \u06a9\u0634 \u0627\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u06a9 \u0648 \u0628\u06cc\u06a9\u0633\u0648 \u0641\u06a9\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u062c\u0646\u06af}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0686\u0646\u06af \u0628\u0631 \u06af\u06cc\u0631 \u0648 \u0628\u0646\u0647 \u062f\u0631\u0642\u0647 \u0648 \u0634\u0645\u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0686\u0646\u06af}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|bar-ka\u0161 ey Tork o be yek s\u016b fekan \u012bn j\u0101me-ye jang}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>\u010dang</u> bar-g\u012br o beneh darge o \u0161am\u0161\u012br az \u010dang}}\n\n:Take off, o Turk, and throw aside these clothes of war!\n:Pick up the harp ({{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}) and put down the shield and sword from your hand ({{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}})!\n\nBoth Kazimirski and the author of EIr (2004) translate Manuchehri's poem as if the harpist is male, and this also accords with the Arabic masculine adjective {{lang|fa-Latn|ma'\u0161\u016bq}} \"beloved\" used in verse 4, as opposed to the feminine {{lang|fa-Latn|ma'\u0161\u016bqe}}.\n\n==The poem==\nThe first ten verses of the poem are shown below. The transcription shows the modern Iranian pronunciation. The letter ''x'' is used for ''kh'' (as in Khayyam), ''q'' for both ''qeyn'' and ''gh\u0101f''; \" ' \" is a glottal stop. \n\nThe metre of the poem is known as ''ramal''; in Elwell-Sutton's classification 2.4.15 (see [[Persian metres]]). In most lines there is a break or ''[[caesura]]'' after the 7th syllable, but in some lines the break is after the 8th or 6th. The pattern is as follows (\u2013 = long syllable, u = short syllable):\n: \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013\n\nOverlong syllables (which take up the position of long plus a short in the metrical pattern) are underlined.\n\n:1\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0622\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0648

several meanings: (1) a harp; (2) a hand with fingers bent; (3) anything crooked or bent; (4) the talon of a bird or claws of a wild animal; (5) a person crippled in hand or foot.<ref>\u0654F. J. Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=400 p. 400].</ref>\n\nKazimirski translates {{lang|fa-Latn|sang}} (literally, a stone) as \"the stone which weighs on the heart\" and \"the burden of his griefs ({{lang|fr|le fardeau de ses chagrins}})\".<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The author of EIr (2004) translates it as \"self-restraint\".\n\nA ''[[parasang|farsang]]'', which Ancient Greek authors called a parasang, is a unit equivalent to the distance travelled in an hour, still used today. In modern times it is defined as a distance of 6 km (about 3.7 miles), but in the past it varied with the terrain. The European equivalent was the [[league (unit)|league]].\n\n===Verse 2===\nThe word {{lang|fa-Latn|tang}} also has several meanings.<ref>F. J. Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=330 page 330].</ref> These include (1) narrow, straight, tight; (2) a horse-girth or strap for fastening on a load; (3) half a load (as much as is carried upon one side of an animal). \n\n{{lang|fa-Latn|bartang}} is the upper strap or over-strap used for tying on a load.\n\nThe harp is seen metaphorically as a horse which the player is riding. The strings of a harp were often made of horsehair. \"Since harp strings were usually made of horsehair, Man\u016b\u010dehr\u012b likens a harp to a horse \u201cwith its head up and its mane down\u201d.<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref>.\n\n===Verse 4===\nIt is a frequent metaphor of Persian love poetry that the curly locks ({{lang|fa-Latn|zolf}}) of the beloved keep the lover in bondage.<ref>J.

Kazimirski suggests that it means that \"an Ethiopian (a race known to be constantly joyful) has put his hand in the harpist's and is moving it so rapidly over the instrument that the hands appear to be invisible, as if they have been cut off.\" However, this is not certain.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The word {{lang|fa-Latn|Zang\u012b}} is the word generally used in Persian poetry for a negro or black man. It is also chosen here for its rhyme with {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}.\n\n===Verse 7===\n{{lang|fa-Latn|R\u016bm}} was the name given to the remnant of the former Roman empire (by this time Greek-speaking) in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), hence {{lang|fa-Latn|R\u016bm\u012b}} means \"Greek\" or from Asia Minor: see [[R\u00fbm]].

It is also known as {{lang|fa-Latn|Dar mahd-e Espahbad Man\u016bchehr ebn-e Q\u0101b\u016bs}} ({{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u062f\u062d \u0627\u0633\u067e\u0647\u0628\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0686\u0647\u0631 \u0622\u0628\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0633}}) \"In praise of the Espahbad Manuchehr son of Qabus\", or [[Qasida]] no. 39 in the collected works of Manuchehri.<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/manoochehri/divanm/ghaside-ghete/sh39/ Qasida 39] (Ganjoor website).</ref>\n\nThe poem is a ''[[qasida|qas\u012bda]]'' (praise poem) in the Arabic style, consisting of 30 or 31 verses,<ref>Kazimirski's text omits verse 13.</ref> all with the same rhyme. The first ten lines praise the beauty and skill of a harpist who is playing at the autumn festival of Mehrgan. Lines 11\u201316 describe the fierceness and warlike qualities of Manuchehr, to whom the poem is addressed, and lines 17\u201323 describe the ruler's splendid war horse. The poet goes on to encourage Manuchehr to enjoy the feast and ends with a prayer that his career will continue to be successful and glorious.\n\nThe poem is notable for its musical rhymes, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang \u010dang ... sang sang ... tang tang}}, which imitate the thrumming of the harp (''[[chang (instrument)|chang]]'') and play on different meanings of the words. As with many of Manuchehri's poems he expresses his delight in the feast and the joys of life.<ref>Cf. Shokrpour et al (2014).</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\nManuchehri's patron, after whom he took his pen-name Manuchehri, [[Manuchihr|Manuchehr]] son of Qabus, was ruler of the region of [[Tabaristan]], also known as [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], on the south side of the Caspian Sea. Manuchehr was not completely independent, but was a vassal of Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (d. 1030). The title Espahbad or Espahbod was given to an army commander or minor ruler not directly appointed by the Sultan, but who was a vassal like Manuchehr or his father.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 360.</ref> The title goes back to pre-Islamic times.<ref>Browne (1906), p. 92.</ref>\n\nManuchehr died c. 1030, so the poem was evidently written therefore before this date. Sometime after Manuchehr's death, Manuchehri migrated to [[Ghazni]] (in present day Afghanistan) where be became a court poet to Mahmud's son, [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]].\n\nThe poem was written to celebrate the autumn festival of [[Mehregan|Mehrg\u0101n]] (also pronounced Mehreg\u0101n or Mehrag\u0101n), a festival dating back to pre-Islamic times which is held 195 days after the spring festival of [[Now Ruz]].\n\n==Sex of the harpist==\nThe sex of the harpist is not completely clear. Although harpists were often illustrated as female, yet the instrument was also played by men: both [[Rudaki]]<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref> and Manuchehri's contemporary [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] are said to have been excellent harpists.<ref>Browne (1906), vol. 2, p. 124.</ref> It was possible for the same person to be both a soldier and to play the harp, as this verse of Farrokhi, in another ''qasida'' using the rhyme ''-ang'' and playing on the two meanings of {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u010dang}}, makes clear:<ref>Quoted by EIr (2004); cf.

The transcription shows the modern Iranian pronunciation. The letter ''x'' is used for ''kh'' (as in Khayyam), ''q'' for both ''qeyn'' and ''gh\u0101f''; \" ' \" is a glottal stop. \n\nThe metre of the poem is known as ''ramal''; in Elwell-Sutton's classification 2.4.15 (see [[Persian metres]]). In most lines there is a break or ''[[caesura]]'' after the 7th syllable, but in some lines the break is after the 8th or 6th. The pattern is as follows (\u2013 = long syllable, u = short syllable):\n: \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013\n\nOverlong syllables (which take up the

several meanings: (1) a harp; (2) a hand with fingers bent; (3) anything crooked or bent; (4) the talon of a bird or claws of a wild animal; (5) a person crippled in hand or foot.<ref>\u0654F. J. Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=400 p. 400].</ref>\n\nKazimirski translates {{lang|fa-Latn|sang}} (literally, a stone) as \"the stone which weighs on the heart\" and \"the burden of his griefs ({{lang|fr|le fardeau de ses chagrins}})\".<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The author of EIr (2004) translates it as \"self-restraint\".\n\nA ''[[parasang|farsang]]'', which Ancient Greek authors called a parasang, is a unit equivalent to the distance travelled in an hour, still used today. In modern times it is defined as a distance of 6 km (about 3.7 miles), but in the past it varied with the terrain. The European equivalent was the [[league (unit)|league]].\n\n===Verse 2===\nThe word {{lang|fa-Latn|tang}} also has several meanings.<ref>F. J. Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=330 page 330].</ref> These include (1) narrow, straight, tight; (2) a horse-girth or strap for fastening on a load; (3) half a load (as much as is carried upon one side of an animal). \n\n{{lang|fa-Latn|bartang}} is the upper strap or over-strap used for tying on a load.\n\nThe harp is seen metaphorically as a horse which the player is riding. The strings of a harp were often made of horsehair. \"Since harp strings were usually made of horsehair, Man\u016b\u010dehr\u012b likens a harp to a horse \u201cwith its head up and its mane down\u201d.<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref>.\n\n===Verse 4===\nIt is a frequent metaphor of Persian love poetry that the curly locks ({{lang|fa-Latn|zolf}}) of the beloved keep the lover in bondage.<ref>J.

Kazimirski suggests that it means that \"an Ethiopian (a race known to be constantly joyful) has put his hand in the harpist's and is moving it so rapidly over the instrument that the hands appear to be invisible, as if they have been cut off.\" However, this is not certain.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The word {{lang|fa-Latn|Zang\u012b}} is the word generally used in Persian poetry for a negro or black man. It is also chosen here for its rhyme with {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}.\n\n===Verse 7===\n{{lang|fa-Latn|R\u016bm}} was the name given to the remnant of the former Roman empire (by this time Greek-speaking) in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), hence {{lang|fa-Latn|R\u016bm\u012b}} means \"Greek\" or from Asia Minor: see [[R\u00fbm]].
