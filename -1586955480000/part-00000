As the amount of sunlight varies, the load characteristic that gives the highest power transfer efficiency changes, so that the efficiency of the system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep the power transfer at highest efficiency. This load characteristic is called the ''maximum power point'' (MPP) and MPPT is the process of finding this point and keeping the load characteristic there. Electrical circuits can be designed to present arbitrary loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems, and MPPT solves the problem of choosing the best load to be presented to the cells in order to get the most usable power out.\n\n[[Solar cell]]s have a complex relationship between temperature and total resistance that produces a non-linear output efficiency which can be analyzed based on the [[Current\u2013voltage characteristic|I-V curve]].<ref name=\"Seyedmahmoudian 402\u2013414\">{{Cite journal |title = A Comparative Study on Procedure and State of the Art of Conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques for Photovoltaic System |journal=International Journal of Computer and Electrical Engineering |pages=402\u2013414 |volume=6 |issue=5 |doi=10.17706/ijcee.2014.v6.859 |first=Mohammadmehdi |last=Seyedmahmoudian |first2=Arash |last2=Mohamadi |first3=Swarna |last3=Kumary|year=2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Analytical Modeling of Partially Shaded Photovoltaic Systems |journal=Energies |date=2013-01-04 |pages=128\u2013144 |volume=6 |issue=1 |doi=10.3390/en6010128 |first=Mohammadmehdi |last=Seyedmahmoudian |first2=Saad |last2=Mekhilef |first3=Rasoul |last3=Rahmani |first4=Rubiyah |last4=Yusof |first5=Ehsan Taslimi |last5=Renani}}</ref> It is the purpose of the MPPT system to sample the output of the PV cells and apply the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power for any given environmental conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Surawdhaniwar |first=Sonali |author-first2=Ritesh |author-last2=Diwan |title=Study of Maximum Power Point Tracking Using Perturb and Observe Method |journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering & Technology |date=July 2012 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=106\u2013110}}</ref> MPPT devices are typically integrated into an [[electric power converter]] system that provides voltage or current conversion, filtering, and regulation for driving various loads, including power grids, batteries, or motors.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to AC power and may incorporate MPPT: such inverters sample the output power (I-V curve) from the solar modules and apply the proper resistance (load) so as to obtain maximum power.\n* The power at the MPP (P<sub>mpp</sub>) is the product of the MPP voltage (V<sub>mpp</sub>) and MPP current (I<sub>mpp</sub>).\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|I-V curve}}\n[[Image:Solar-Cell-IV-curve-with-MPP.png|thumb|Photovoltaic solar cell I-V curves where a line intersects the knee of the curves where the maximum power transfer point is located.]]\n\n[[Photovoltaic cell]]s have a complex relationship between their operating environment and the maximum [[Electric power|power]] they can produce.

This is sometimes called the 'characteristic resistance' of the cell. This is a dynamic quantity which changes depending on the level of illumination, as well as other factors such as temperature and the age of the cell. If the resistance is lower or higher than this value, the power drawn will be less than the maximum available, and thus the cell will not be used as efficiently as it could be. Maximum power point trackers utilize different types of control circuit or logic to search for this point and thus to allow the converter circuit to extract the [[Impedance matching#Power transfer|maximum power]] available from a cell.\n\n[[File:Power-voltage (P -V) curve.png|thumb|power-voltage (P -V) curve]]\nIf a full Power-voltage (P -V)curve is available then the maximum power point can be obtained using a [[bisection method]].\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nWhen a load is directly connected to the solar panel, the operating point of the panel will rarely be at peak power. The impedance seen by the panel determines the operating point of the solar panel. Thus by varying the impedance seen by the panel, the operating point can be moved towards peak power point. Since panels are DC devices, DC-DC converters must be utilized to transform the impedance of one circuit (source) to the other circuit (load). Changing the duty ratio of the DC-DC converter results in an impedance change as seen by the panel. At a particular impedance (i.e. duty ratio) the operating point will be at the peak power transfer point.  The I-V curve of the panel can vary considerably with variation in atmospheric conditions such as radiance and temperature. Therefore, it is not feasible to fix the duty ratio with such dynamically changing operating conditions.\n\nMPPT implementations utilize algorithms that frequently sample panel voltages and currents, then adjust the duty ratio as needed.  Microcontrollers are employed to implement the algorithms. Modern implementations often utilize larger computers for analytics and load forecasting.\n\n== Classification ==\nControllers can follow several strategies to optimize the power output of an array. Maximum power point trackers may implement different algorithms and switch between them based on the operating conditions of the array.<ref>Rahmani, R.; Seyedmahmoudian, M.;, Mekhilef, S.; Yusof, R.; 2013.

The controller maintains this voltage until the irradiation changes and the process is repeated.\n\nThe incremental conductance method is based on the observation that at the maximum power point\ndP/dV = 0, and that P = IV. The current from the array can be expressed as a function of the voltage: P = I(V)V. Therefore, dP/dV = VdI/dV + I(V). Setting this equal to zero yields: dI/dV = -I(V)/V. Therefore, the maximum power point is achieved when the incremental conductance is equal to the negative of the instantaneous conductance.\n\n===Current sweep ===\nThe current sweep method uses a sweep waveform for the PV array current such that the I-V characteristic of the PV array is obtained and updated at fixed time intervals.

Although the fully charged battery pack voltage may be close to the PV panel's maximum power point voltage, this is unlikely to be true at sunrise when the battery has been partially discharged. Charging may begin at a voltage considerably below the PV panel maximum power point voltage, and an MPPT can resolve this mismatch.\n\nWhen the batteries in an off-grid system are fully charged and PV production exceeds local loads, an MPPT can no longer operate the panel at its maximum power point as the excess power has no load to absorb it. The MPPT must then shift the PV panel operating point away from the peak power point until production exactly matches demand.

As the amount of sunlight varies, the load characteristic that gives the highest power transfer efficiency changes, so that the efficiency of the system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep the power transfer at highest efficiency. This load characteristic is called the ''maximum power point'' (MPP) and MPPT is the process of finding this point and keeping the load characteristic there. Electrical circuits can be designed to present arbitrary loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems, and MPPT solves the problem of choosing the best load to be presented to the cells in order to get the most usable power out.\n\n[[Solar cell]]s have a complex relationship between temperature and total resistance that produces a non-linear output efficiency which can be analyzed based on the [[Current\u2013voltage characteristic|I-V curve]].<ref name=\"Seyedmahmoudian 402\u2013414\">{{Cite journal |title = A Comparative Study on Procedure and State of the Art of Conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques for Photovoltaic System |journal=International Journal of Computer and Electrical Engineering |pages=402\u2013414 |volume=6 |issue=5 |doi=10.17706/ijcee.2014.v6.859 |first=Mohammadmehdi |last=Seyedmahmoudian |first2=Arash |last2=Mohamadi |first3=Swarna |last3=Kumary|year=2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Analytical Modeling of Partially Shaded Photovoltaic Systems |journal=Energies |date=2013-01-04 |pages=128\u2013144 |volume=6 |issue=1 |doi=10.3390/en6010128 |first=Mohammadmehdi |last=Seyedmahmoudian |first2=Saad |last2=Mekhilef |first3=Rasoul |last3=Rahmani |first4=Rubiyah |last4=Yusof |first5=Ehsan Taslimi |last5=Renani}}</ref> It is the purpose of the MPPT system to sample the output of the PV cells and apply the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power for any given environmental conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Surawdhaniwar |first=Sonali |author-first2=Ritesh |author-last2=Diwan |title=Study of Maximum Power Point Tracking Using Perturb and Observe Method |journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering & Technology |date=July 2012 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=106\u2013110}}</ref> MPPT devices are typically integrated into an [[electric power converter]] system that provides voltage or current conversion, filtering, and regulation for driving various loads, including power grids, batteries, or motors.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to AC power and may incorporate MPPT: such inverters sample the output power (I-V curve) from the solar modules and apply the proper resistance (load) so as to obtain maximum power.\n* The power at the MPP (P<sub>mpp</sub>) is the product of the MPP voltage (V<sub>mpp</sub>) and MPP current (I<sub>mpp</sub>).\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|I-V curve}}\n[[Image:Solar-Cell-IV-curve-with-MPP.png|thumb|Photovoltaic solar cell I-V curves where a line intersects the knee of the curves where the maximum power transfer point is located.]]\n\n[[Photovoltaic cell]]s have a complex relationship between their operating environment and the maximum [[Electric power|power]] they can produce.

This is sometimes called the 'characteristic resistance' of the cell. This is a dynamic quantity which changes depending on the level of illumination, as well as other factors such as temperature and the age of the cell. If the resistance is lower or higher than this value, the power drawn will be less than the maximum available, and thus the cell will not be used as efficiently as it could be. Maximum power point trackers utilize different types of control circuit or logic to search for this point and thus to allow the converter circuit to extract the [[Impedance matching#Power transfer|maximum power]] available from a cell.\n\n[[File:Power-voltage (P -V) curve.png|thumb|power-voltage (P -V) curve]]\nIf a full Power-voltage (P -V)curve is available then the maximum power point can be obtained using a [[bisection method]].\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nWhen a load is directly connected to the solar panel, the operating point of the panel will rarely be at peak power. The impedance seen by the panel determines the operating point of the solar panel. Thus by varying the impedance seen by the panel, the operating point can be moved towards peak power point. Since panels are DC devices, DC-DC converters must be utilized to transform the impedance of one circuit (source) to the other circuit (load). Changing the duty ratio of the DC-DC converter results in an impedance change as seen by the panel. At a particular impedance (i.e. duty ratio) the operating point will be at the peak power transfer point.  The I-V curve of the panel can vary considerably with variation in atmospheric conditions such as radiance and temperature. Therefore, it is not feasible to fix the duty ratio with such dynamically changing operating conditions.\n\nMPPT implementations utilize algorithms that frequently sample panel voltages and currents, then adjust the duty ratio as needed.  Microcontrollers are employed to implement the algorithms. Modern implementations often utilize larger computers for analytics and load forecasting.\n\n== Classification ==\nControllers can follow several strategies to optimize the power output of an array. Maximum power point trackers may implement different algorithms and switch between them based on the operating conditions of the array.<ref>Rahmani, R.; Seyedmahmoudian, M.;, Mekhilef, S.; Yusof, R.; 2013.

The controller maintains this voltage until the irradiation changes and the process is repeated.\n\nThe incremental conductance method is based on the observation that at the maximum power point\ndP/dV = 0, and that P = IV. The current from the array can be expressed as a function of the voltage: P = I(V)V. Therefore, dP/dV = VdI/dV + I(V). Setting this equal to zero yields: dI/dV = -I(V)/V. Therefore, the maximum power point is achieved when the incremental conductance is equal to the negative of the instantaneous conductance.\n\n===Current sweep ===\nThe current sweep method uses a sweep waveform for the PV array current such that the I-V characteristic of the PV array is obtained and updated at fixed time intervals.

In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.

In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.

They achieved widespread success when their second album ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]'' topped the UK charts in 1997. In the [[United Kingdom]] they have had six number one albums and thirteen Top Twenty singles, including two number ones. In the United States they have won six [[Grammy Award|Grammy Awards]] including \"Best Rock Instrumental Performance\", \"Best Dance Recording\" and \"Best Dance/Electronic Album\" of the year as recently as 2020.<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/grammy-winners-2020-the-full-list.html Grammy Winners List 2020] by Zoe Haylock, Vulture.com, January 27, 2020.</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== 1984\u20131995: Formation and early career ===\nEd Simons was born in [[Herne Hill]], [[South London]], on 9 June 1970 to a barrister mother and an absent father.{{Weasel inline|date=August 2018}} Simons' two main interests when he was young were [[aeroplanes]] and musicals. Simons attended two South London public schools, [[Alleyn's School]] and [[Dulwich College]]. During his school years, he developed a fondness for [[rare groove]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] music, having frequented a club called the Mud Club from the age of 14. By the time he left school, his two main musical interests were two Manchester bands, [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[the Smiths]]. After finishing school with 11 [[General Certificate of Education|O]] levels and three A levels, he continued on to study history, especially late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] history, at the [[University of Manchester]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/Ed+Simons-33297.html|title=Ed Simons' history lessons|last=June 2010|first=26|website=Femalefirst.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nTom Rowlands, a childhood classmate of Simons, was born on 11 January 1971 in [[Kingston upon Thames]], London. When Rowlands was very young, his family relocated to [[Henley-on-Thames]]. He later attended [[Reading Blue Coat School]] in [[Berkshire]]. In his early teens, his interest in music broadened to other genres. Initially, some of his favourites included the ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!|Oh What a Lovely War]]'' soundtrack, [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]], the nascent [[gothic rock]] genre ([[Sisters of Mercy]], [[Fields of the Nephilim]]) and the [[Electro (music)|electro]] sounds of artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Heaven 17]]. He described the first [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] album, ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'', as \"the record that probably changed his life\", and commented that \"Miuzi Weighs a Ton\" was \"one of the most amazing tracks he had ever heard\". Rowlands also started collecting [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] records by artists like [[Eric B]] and [[Schoolly D]]. Rowlands left school with similar accomplishments to Simons, achieving nine O levels and three A levels. For university, he followed Simons to Manchester primarily to immerse himself in its music scene in general and the [[Fac 51 Hacienda|Ha\u00e7ienda]] in particular.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-chemical-brothers| title=Artist bio from Rhapsody|website=Rhapsody.com}}</ref>\n\nRowlands was also in a band called Ariel prior to meeting up with Simons.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Ariel was formed in London by Rowlands and his friends Brendan Melck and Mathew Berry. Their first single was \"Sea of Beats\", which was essentially a [[white label]]. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was \"Bokadilo\". Other songs, released on [[Gramophone record|12-inch]], included \"Mustn't Grumble\" and their most well-known, \"Rollercoaster\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the [[record label]] [[Deconstruction Records|deConstruction]]. They insisted that they get a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman [[Sally Ann Marsh]], and after some disappointing songs like \"Let It Slide\" (Rowlands would later describe it as \"a stinker\") the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song \"T Baby\" which was remixed by the pair. In regards to the remix, Ed stated that \"Ariel symbolically ended when Deconstruction asked us for a [[Dust Brothers]] remix of an Ariel track. That was the final nail in the coffin\". \n\nRowlands and Simons then started to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at a club called \"Naked Under Leather\" in the back of a pub in 1992,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> under the alias of \"The 237 Turbo Nutters\" (named after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn [[Rave culture|raving]] days). The pair would play hip hop, [[Techno music|techno]], and [[House music|house]].<ref>''Brothers Gonna Work It Out'' (XDUSTCD 101) booklet, page 2.</ref> Rowlands and Simons called themselves the Dust Brothers  <ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> after [[Dust Brothers|the US production duo]] famous for their work with the [[Beastie Boys]]. After a while, they began to run out of suitable instrumental hip hop tracks to use, so they started to make their own. Using a [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] hi-fi system, a computer, a sampler, and a keyboard, they recorded \"Song to the Siren\", which sampled [[This Mortal Coil]]. \"Song to the Siren\" was released on their own record label, called \"Diamond Records\" (after Ed's nickname). At this point The Dust Bros were the first ever back room DJ's in the \u2018Sumptuous Locarno Lounge\u2019at \u2018The Job Club\u2018 in Gossips night club in Dean St Soho from April 1992 till April 1993. In October 1992, they pressed 500 white label copies and took them to various dance record shops around London, but none would play it, saying that it was too slow (the track played at 111 [[beats per minute|BPM]]). They sent a copy to London DJ [[Andrew Weatherall]], who made it a permanent fixture in his DJ sets. Weatherall also signed the band to his [[Junior Boy's Own]] label.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In May 1993, Junior Boy's Own released \"Song to the Siren\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nAround June 1993, the Dust Brothers recorded their first remixes. The first was \"Packet of Peace\" for Justin Robertson's [[Lionrock]] group, followed by songs from [[Leftfield]], [[Republica]], and [[the Sandals]]. Later in 1993, the Dust Brothers completed work on their ''[[Fourteenth Century Sky]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], released in January 1994.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It contained the ground-breaking \"Chemical Beats\", which epitomised the duo's genre-defining [[big beat]] sound.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The EP also contained \"One Too Many Mornings\", which for the first time showed the less intense, more chilled-out side of the Dust Brothers. Both \"One Too Many Mornings\" and \"Chemical Beats\" would later appear on their debut album. ''Fourteenth Century Sky'' was followed later in 1994 by the ''[[My Mercury Mouth EP]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Chemical Beats\" was also part of the soundtrack for the first edition of the [[Wipeout (game)|Wipeout]] game series, having been featured in ''Wipeout'' for the [[PlayStation]] in 1995.\n\nIn October 1994, the Dust Brothers became resident DJs at the small, but influential [[Heavenly Recordings#The Social|Heavenly Sunday Social Club]] at the Albany pub in London's [[Great Portland Street]]. [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[James Dean Bradfield]], and [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers were subsequently asked to remix tracks by [[Manic Street Preachers]] and [[The Charlatans (British band)|the Charlatans]], plus [[Primal Scream]]'s \"Jailbird\" and [[the Prodigy]]'s \"Voodoo People\". These two remixes received [[television]] exposure, being playlisted by [[MTV]] Europe's \"The Party Zone\" in 1995. Early in 1994, the Dust Brothers were approached in the club one Sunday by Noel Gallagher, from [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who at the time were becoming one of the most prominent guitar bands in Britain. Gallagher told the duo that he had a [[Ibiza|Balearic]]-inspired track which he had written and would like the Dust Brothers to remix. However, over time, Gallagher changed his mind, and in the end the Brothers did not remix it.\n\nIn March 1995, the Dust Brothers began their first international tour, which included the United States \u2013 where they played with [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] and [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] \u2013 then a series of European festivals. Also around this time, objections were filed by [[Dust Brothers|the original Dust Brothers]] over the use of their name, and so Rowlands and Simons had to decide on a new name.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> They decided to call themselves \"The Chemical Brothers\" after \"Chemical Beats\" (Simons' grandmother had suggested they call themselves \"The Grit Brothers\").\n\nIn June 1995, they released their fourth single, the first under their new identity. \"Leave Home\" was released on Junior Boy's Own, as a preview of the imminent debut album and became the band's first chart hit, peaking at No. 17.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u20131998: ''Exit Planet Dust'' and ''Dig Your Own Hole'' ===\nIn July 1995, the Chemical Brothers released their debut album ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]'' (the title inspired by their name change) on Freestyle Dust/Junior Boy's Own. It entered the UK charts at No. 9<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and featured guest vocalist [[Beth Orton]] on the song \"Alive Alone\". It eventually went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, and was used on the soundtrack of the [[science fiction]] TV series pilot [[Virtuality (TV series)|Virtuality]]. Shortly after its release, the Chemical Brothers signed to [[Virgin Records]], to which they took their own offshoot label, Freestyle Dust. For their next single, \"[[Life Is Sweet (song)|Life Is Sweet]]\", released in September 1995, they again used a guest vocalist, featuring their friend Tim Burgess, singer of the Charlatans. It reached No. 25 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The single was also ''Select'' magazine's \"Single of the Month\" for October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsgallery.com/prodtype.asp?strParents=&CAT_ID=399&numRecordPosition=1|title=The Chemical Brothers Soundwaves Art --- St. Pauls Gallery|website=Stpaulsgallery.com|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> The release included a [[Daft Punk]] remix of \"Life Is Sweet\".\n\n[[The Stone Roses]] asked the duo to remix \"Begging You\", from their ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'' album. After beginning work on a remix which they viewed as having potential, they later rejected the idea and the work was cancelled.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn October 1995, the duo returned to the Heavenly Sunday Social for a second and final run of DJ dates. They then became residents at the Heavenly Social on Saturdays at Turnmills. In November, the Chemical Brothers played the [[Astoria Theatre]] in London. At this time the Brothers usually used a fusion of \"Chemical Beats\" and [[the Beatles]]' \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as their encore. During the encore, however, [[Keith Flint]] from the Prodigy jumped up on stage to dance, wearing a T-shirt sporting the slogan \"Occupation: mad bastard\". A few from the crowd subsequently joined in. This resulted in a power cable being kicked loose, bringing the show to a temporary close. The Chemical Brothers confessed to not being too bothered; \"because he's Keith from The Prodigy, and he can do whatever the fucking hell he likes\". Just before Christmas 1995, they played their biggest gig to date, with the Prodigy, at the [[Brixton Academy]].\n\nIn January 1996, ''Exit Planet Dust'' was certified gold. The Chemical Brothers released their first new material in six months on Virgin, the ''Loops of Fury'' EP. The four-track release was limited to 20,000 copies, but is now available for digital download. It entered the UK charts at No. 13. ''[[NME]]'' described the lead track as \"splashing waves of synths across hard-hitting beats\". The EP also contained a Dave Clarke remix of \"Chemical Beats\", and two other new tracks, \"Get Up on It Like This\" and \"(The Best Part Of) Breaking Up\".\n\nIn February 1996, ''Select'' magazine published a list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s thus far. ''Exit Planet Dust'' was listed at Number 39. In August 1996, the Chemical Brothers supported Oasis at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], where 125,000 people attended each of the two shows.\n\nDuring the 1995 [[Glastonbury Festival]], Rowlands and Simons had another conversation with [[Noel Gallagher]]. Gallagher told them how much he liked ''Exit Planet Dust'', and asked if he could sing on a future track, similar to the way [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] had worked on \"Life Is Sweet\". They did not think much of the offer at the time, given how busy Gallagher would be with the release of Oasis' ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', plus the complexities of dealing with each other's record companies. However, the duo later worked on a track which they thought would benefit from having a vocal on it. They sent Gallagher a tape of what they had done so far. He worked on it overnight, and left a message with them early the next morning that he was ready to record it. The track was called \"[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]\" and was finally released in October 1996. It entered the UK charts at the top, giving the duo their first ever Number One single.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Setting Sun\" was backed by a longer instrumental version, and also a new track \"Buzz Tracks\", which was not much more than a DJ tool. The three remaining members of the Beatles' lawyers later wrote to the Chemical Brothers, mistakenly claiming that they had sampled \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\". Virgin Records hired a [[Musicology|musicologist]] to prove that they did not sample the song.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1996, ''[[Live at the Social Volume 1]]'' was released by [[Heavenly Records]], which became the Chemical Brothers' first mix CD (excluding ''Xmas Dust Up'', a free album that came in a 1994 issue of ''NME''). It was also the duo's first live album (excluding the EP ''[[Live 05]]'').\n\nIn March 1997, the Brothers released the second track from their forthcoming album. \"[[Block Rockin' Beats]]\" went straight to No. 1 in the UK, possibly thanks, this time, to its [[Schoolly D]] vocal sample and re-working of the bass-line from [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s single \"Coup\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsng.net/samplesources.htm |title=Sample Sources |work=dsng.net |date= |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> The ''NME'' named it \"Single of the Week\" and said \"It throbs like your head might if you had just done a length underwater in a swimming pool full of [[Alkyl nitrites|amyl]].\" It later won them a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1997&genre=31 |title=Grammy Awards : Past Winners Search |website=Grammy.com|accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the US at this time, \"Setting Sun\" was sitting at Number 80 in the Billboard Top 100, after selling around 80,000 copies, an uncommon achievement for a European \"dance\" act. Sales from ''Exit Planet Dust'' were also around 150,000.\n\nOn 7 April 1997, the Chemical Brothers released their second album, ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]''. It was recorded at the band's own south London studio, with the title taken from graffiti on the wall outside. The album was well received,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |title=Dig Your Own Hole: The Chemical Brothers: Review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=3 April 1997 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116081718/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |archivedate=16 January 2009 }}</ref> with ''Mixmag'' rating it 10/10 and calling it \"mad enough to be thrilling, slick enough for not even remotely trendy coffee tables\".\n\nDuring the summer of 1997, the Brothers toured extensively, particularly in the United States. They also became residents at [[Tokyo]]'s Liquid Rooms. In August, the Chemical Brothers achieved a rapprochement with the US Dust Brothers, and asked them to remix the forthcoming single \"[[Elektrobank]]\". They themselves also became highly sought-after for remixes for other artists. In September, the next single from ''Dig Your Own Hole'', \"Elektrobank\" was released. In November, the pair played at [[Dublin]]'s Point Theatre, with support from [[Carl Cox]]. They also began a US tour in [[Detroit]].\n\nAt the end of the year, ''Dig Your Own Hole''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final track, the nine-minute-long \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\", gave rise to a limited-edition mini-EP of the same name. The [[B-side]] consisted of a live version of \"Setting Sun\", recorded at the [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands Festival]], Netherlands on 24 August 1997. Also in December, following four sold-out US shows, the Chemical Brothers toured the UK, concluding in a sold-out show at Brixton Academy, London\n\nIn 1998, they concentrated more on DJing, although some remixes did see the light of day, including \"I Think I'm in Love\" from [[Spiritualized]]. Both a vocal remix and an instrumental remix were included in the single release. Each clocked in at over seven-and-a-half minutes. Another remix completed by the Brothers was \"Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp\" by [[Mercury Rev]]. This was another extension in the association between the two bands, since Mercury Rev's Jonathon Donahue contributed to \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\" on ''Dig Your Own Hole''.\n\nIn September 1998, a second mix album, ''[[Brothers Gonna Work It Out]]'', was released. It contains some of their own tracks and remixes, as well as songs from artists who have influenced their sound, such as [[Renegade Soundwave]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], Carlos \"After Dark\" Berrios, and [[Kenny 'Dope' Gonzales]].\n\n=== 1999\u20132002: ''Surrender'' and ''Come with Us'' ===\nIn May 1999, the Chemical Brothers played three UK dates in [[Manchester]], [[Sheffield]] and [[Brighton]], their first since December 1997. Also that month, they released their first new original material in two years, a track called \"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\". This was more [[house music|house]]-influenced than big beat. In interviews at the time, Rowlands and Simons indicated that the track was inspired by nights out at Sheffield club Gatecrasher. The track was also one of their more commercially accessible tracks and went to number 3 in the UK charts.\n\nTheir third album, ''[[Surrender (The Chemical Brothers album)|Surrender]]'', was released in June 1999. It featured vocals from Noel Gallagher, Mercury Rev's [[Jonathan Donahue]], and [[Mazzy Star]]'s [[Hope Sandoval]]. As \"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\" had suggested, the album was more house-oriented than the previous two. On one of the album's stand out tracks, \"Out of Control\", [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] supported by [[Primal Scream]]'s [[Bobby Gillespie]] provided vocals. It reached No. 1 in the UK album charts. The [[Michel Gondry]]-directed [[music video]] for \"[[Let Forever Be]]\", which utilised ground-breaking video and film effects in its depiction of a young woman's nightmares, also received a lot of attention.\n\nLater that summer, the Brothers performed at the infamous [[Woodstock 99]] concert on 24 July, with positive reception. They later headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] dance tent on the Friday night, followed by a UK tour which ended in December and included [[Homelands (festival)|Homelands]] Scotland on 4 September. In November, \"Out of Control\", featuring Sumner and Gillespie on vocals, was released as a single. The release also contained the [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] remix. The final single from ''Surrender'', in February 2000, was the five track \"Music: Response\" EP, containing the title track and two remixes, plus [[Electronic Battle Weapon]] 4, named \"Freak of the Week\", and a track called \"Enjoyed\", which was essentially a remix of \"Out of Control\" by the Brothers themselves.\nA CD copy of ''Surrender'' was placed in the third ''[[Blue Peter]]'' [[time capsule]], buried in January 2000. That same month, they appeared on Primal Scream's album ''[[Xtrmntr]]'' at track 11 with a remix.\n\nIn June 2000, Tom and Ed played the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival. In August 2000 they played to a large crowd at the main stage at Creamfields festival, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In December 2000, the Chemical Brothers aired one of their new tracks, \"It Began in Afrika\" at their New York DJ gigs, supporting [[U2]].\n\nIn 2001, they were quite active with releases and live performances. Early in the year, they began working on a fourth album, provisionally titled ''Chemical Four''. The first track which fans got a taste of was \"It Began in Afrika\", as previously played in their DJ set in New York. The track would make its live debut in [[California]] in April 2001, at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. Another new track, \"Galaxy Bounce\", also got its public debut at Coachella. As had become customary for their releases and experiments, \"It Began in Afrika\" was first pressed as a promo, as part of the \"[[Electronic Battle Weapon]]\" series. It received much airplay on dance music radio shows in the UK, and became more and more popular in clubs over the course of the summer. It also became one of the \"anthems\" in [[Ibiza]] as the summer progressed. It was given a full commercial single release in September, reaching No. 8 in the UK singles chart, even though no promotional video was made for the track.\n\nRowlands and Simons also remixed a track from [[Fatboy Slim]]'s ''[[Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars]]'', entitled \"Song for Shelter\". This remix was released as a single on 3 September 2001 (one week before \"It Began in Afrika\") as the CD2 single for \"[[Song for Shelter / Ya Mama]]\". It reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Charts (sales were combined with the CD1 single).\n\nThe Chemical Brothers finished work on another album, ''[[Come with Us]]'', in October 2001. It featured collaborations with [[Richard Ashcroft]] of [[the Verve]] (\"The Test\"), and long-time collaborator [[Beth Orton]] (\"The State We're In\"). The album was released in January 2002, preceded by a single, \"Star Guitar\", a melodic [[Balearic beat]] number, with a promotional video by [[Michel Gondry]] that featured passing scenery synchronised to the beat viewed through a train window. What would be the second track on the album, \"It Began in Afrika\", was released 10 September 2001 to be circulated around the clubbing scene where it was a popular hit. \"Star Guitar\" was also released as a [[DVD]] single, the pair's first. ''Come with Us'', was less well received than their previous albums, but nonetheless went straight to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart in the first week of its release, selling 100,000 copies. In April, the title track from the album was released as a single with remixes by [[Fatboy Slim]] as part of a double A-sided release with \"The Test\".\n\nDuring the summer of 2002, the Chemical Brothers travelled the festival circuit to promote the album. Later in 2002, they released two EPs, one specifically aimed at Japan and the other the US (entitled ''[[AmericanEP]]''). Both contained remixes, live versions and B-sides. Additionally, the band produced [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s final non-album single \"[[Here to Stay (New Order song)|Here to Stay]]\", and remixed the song as well.\nOne of their other major songs from this album was \"Galaxy Bounce\", which was popular and featured as the main title music for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Project Gotham Racing (video game)|Project Gotham Racing]]''. It was also included on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. \"Star Guitar\" was featured as a song on the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]'s ''[[Lumines II]]''.\n\nTwo other songs, \"Come with Us (Introduction)\" and \"Star Guitar (Title Screen)\", were featured on a ''[[PlayStation 2]]'' racing game titled ''WRC II: Extreme''. Both songs are instrumental.\nThe song \"My Elastic Eye\" from the ''Come with Us'' album was played in the 2004 movie ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/soundtrack |title=The Butterfly Effect (2004) \u2013 Soundtracks |work=Imdb.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> starring [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Amy Smart]].\n\n=== 2003\u20132006: ''Push the Button'' ===\nEarly 2003 saw Rowlands and Simons back in the studio working on new material, including \"The Golden Path\", a collaboration with [[Wayne Coyne]] of [[the Flaming Lips]]. This was released in September 2003, at the same time as a \"best of\" album, entitled ''[[Singles 93\u201303]]'', marking ten years of the Chemical Brothers' releases. ''Singles 93\u201303'' included most, but not all, of their singles. A second new track, in addition to \"The Golden Path\", was included on the album, called \"Get Yourself High\". ''Singles 93\u201303'' was also released on DVD, with extra features including selected live performances and interviews with Rowlands, Simons, and many of their collaborators from throughout the period. \"Get Yourself High\", which featured Canadian rapper [[k-os]] on vocals, was released as a single in November 2003.\n\nIn late 2003 and 2004, the Chemical Brothers continued to work in the studio on new material and a remix of \"[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]\" by [[Kylie Minogue]]. After being released on rare white label vinyl, it was subsequently given a commercial release in March on CD (on her next single \"Red Blooded Woman\") and on exclusive 12-inch vinyl picture disc (containing two other Kylie remixes). In Summer 2004 they returned to the festival circuit, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], Tokyo, Scotland, and Ireland. They also visited [[South America]] for the second time (the first time being in 1999), arriving at [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], and [[Brazil]]. It was during these sets that they played new material, including \"Acid Children\", which proved to be one of the most popular new tracks.\n\nIn September 2004, the Chemical Brothers released the seventh \"Electronic Battle Weapon\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 7\" was being released as a one-sided promo-only 12-inch, containing \"Acid Children\". A marked departure from the Chemical Brothers' previous musical endeavours, it featured a screeching 303 bassline and a distinctive vocal sample; a pitch-altered vocal sample proclaiming \"You Are All My Children Now!\", which is lifted from the horror film ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]''. It was coupled with the projection of a sinister clown mouthing these same words at their live gigs.\n\nThe Electronic Battle Weapon series of promo releases have typically been newly recorded Chemical Brothers tracks, released on promo to allow DJs to test them in a club environment, and to gauge their popularity.\n\nIn 2004, the Chemical Brothers began work on ''[[Push the Button (The Chemical Brothers album)|Push the Button]]'', their fifth studio album, which features collaborations with [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]], [[Kele Okereke]], and [[Anwar Superstar]], amongst others. The album was released on 24 January 2005.\n\n\"[[Galvanize (song)|Galvanize]]\", which features rapper [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] on vocals, was the first single to be taken from ''Push the Button'', and premiered exclusively on [[iTunes]]. The single was released on 17 January 2005, and entered the UK chart at No. 3. The second single, \"[[Believe (Chemical Brothers song)|Believe]]\" (featuring Kele Okereke from [[Bloc Party]]), failed to crack the top 10, but still made it into the top 20, peaking at No. 18. \"The Boxer\", featuring Tim Burgess, became the duo's first single to fail to crack the top 40.\n\nThe album and single \"Galvanize\" won a Grammy at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006]]. One of the songs in this album, \"The Big Jump\", appears in the video game ''[[Burnout Revenge]]'', as well as ''[[Project Gotham Racing 3]]''. The track \"Surface to Air\" features a pulsing chord progression and bassline reminiscent of the intro to the [[The Strokes|Strokes]] song \"The Modern Age\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Chemical action, crowd reaction - Music - www.theage.com.au|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/Chemical-action-crowd-reaction/2005/01/27/1106415717077.html|website=Theage.com.au|accessdate=13 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAn unofficial, remixed version of the album entitled ''Flip the Switch'' was released as a free download, along with the ''Believe'' EP, featuring six further remixes of \"Believe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |title=Flip The Switch \u2013 The Chemical Brothers remixed |accessdate=13 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126182108/http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |archivedate=26 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, the Chemical Brothers were revealed as the first musicians to be involved in Tate Tracks.<ref name=\"Moss\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art39863|title=Tate Modern Makes Music With Chemical Brothers For Tate Tracks Project|last=Moss|first=Richard|date=31 August 2006|work=[[Culture24]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"TateTracks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tatetracks.org.uk|title=Tate Tracks|year=2006|publisher=[[Tate]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> [[Tate Modern]] invited various groups and songwriters to choose a work that inspired them from the gallery's collection of modern art and then write a track about it.

The double-sided vinyl was finally released just before the Chemical Brothers' much anticipated New Year's Eve gig at the famous [[Turnmills]] in London. The vinyl had a limited edition release worldwide and was received well by fans, DJs, and critics alike. Electronic Battle Weapon 8, at about six and a half minutes, was very distinct from the \"big acid\" style that the earlier Battle Weapons adhered to. It was characterised by 'thundering' drums with a rising synth line. A version of this track featured on the ''We Are the Night'' album and was entitled \"Saturate\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 9\" was a typical Chemicals dancefloor track with their trademark [[vocoder]] vocals coupled with sirens and a basic 'tribal' melody.\n\nAt the same [[Turnmills]] gig, the Brothers also played a previously unreleased song at midnight to welcome 2007, which went down well with the crowd. This track eventually emerged as \"Burst Generator\", found on the forthcoming album ''We Are the Night''. Many were left wondering if the latest in the Electronic Battle Weapon series were simply one-off experiments or signalled a new direction they could take with the new album, perhaps swaying from their genre defining big beat albums of the past. The song was also the band's 100th released song.\n\nOn 21 March 2007, the Chemical Brothers officially announced their forthcoming album on [[MySpace]]. The new album, entitled ''[[We Are the Night (album)|We Are the Night]]'', was released on 2 July 2007 in the United Kingdom and 17 July 2007 in the United States. The Chemical Brothers cited a delay in the production of artwork for this delay.<ref>[http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/home/ Album release date announced] \u2013 The Chemical Brothers Official Website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702042726/http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/home/ |date=2 July 2012 }}</ref> EMI subsequently released an online Chemical Brothers computer game as an apology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=23169_0_2_0_C |title=New album The Chemical Brothers delayed - here's a 'sorry guys' |date=18 May 2007 |work=side-line.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> The track listing was released to the fans on the official mailing list on 10 April.

The official release of the single was 4 June (digital download) and 14 June (12-inch, 7-inch and CD). The album went on general release in the UK on 2 July 2007.\n\nIn September 2007, the Chemical Brothers played a free live gig in Trafalgar Square as part of the Becks Fusions event. All who attended were provided with 3D glasses to view the on-screen visual effects.\n\nThe Chemical Brothers supplied a new track for the ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' soundtrack, titled \"Keep My Composure\". An alternate version of this track was released on ''[[Brotherhood (The Chemical Brothers album)|Brotherhood]]'', the duo's second singles compilation, which also featured the new single \"[[Midnight Madness (song)|Midnight Madness]]\" and a second disc of every Electronic Battle Weapon released to date. The Chemical Brothers continued to tour into 2008 to promote the collection, including a landmark date at [[Olympia London]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hasted |first1=Nick |title=The Chemical Brothers, Olympia, London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/the-chemical-brothers-olympia-london-915695.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010-2012: ''Further'', ''Hanna'' and ''Don't Think'' ===\nOn 30 March 2010, the band announced on their website that their seventh studio album, titled ''[[Further (The Chemical Brothers album)|Further]]'', would be released on 22 June and would be \"the band's first to be released with corresponding films made specifically to match each of the 8 audio tracks.\" The films were made with long-time visuals collaborators  [[Adam Smith (director)|Adam Smith]] and Marcus Lyall.

[[the Prodigy]], [[Fatboy Slim]], and other fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the [[big beat]] genre to the forefront of pop culture. They achieved widespread success when their second album ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]'' topped the UK charts in 1997. In the [[United Kingdom]] they have had six number one albums and thirteen Top Twenty singles, including two number ones. In the United States they have won six [[Grammy Award|Grammy Awards]] including \"Best Rock Instrumental Performance\", \"Best Dance Recording\" and \"Best Dance/Electronic Album\" of the year as recently as 2020.<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/grammy-winners-2020-the-full-list.html Grammy Winners List 2020] by Zoe Haylock, Vulture.com, January 27, 2020.</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== 1984\u20131995: Formation and early career ===\nEd Simons was born in [[Herne Hill]], [[South London]], on 9 June 1970 to a barrister mother and an absent father.{{Weasel inline|date=August 2018}} Simons' two main interests when he was young were [[aeroplanes]] and musicals. Simons attended two South London public schools, [[Alleyn's School]] and [[Dulwich College]]. During his school years, he developed a fondness for [[rare groove]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] music, having frequented a club called the Mud Club from the age of 14. By the time he left school, his two main musical interests were two Manchester bands, [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[the Smiths]]. After finishing school with 11 [[General Certificate of Education|O]] levels and three A levels, he continued on to study history, especially late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] history, at the [[University of Manchester]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/Ed+Simons-33297.html|title=Ed Simons' history lessons|last=June 2010|first=26|website=Femalefirst.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nTom Rowlands, a childhood classmate of Simons, was born on 11 January 1971 in [[Kingston upon Thames]], London. When Rowlands was very young, his family relocated to [[Henley-on-Thames]]. He later attended [[Reading Blue Coat School]] in [[Berkshire]]. In his early teens, his interest in music broadened to other genres. Initially, some of his favourites included the ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!|Oh What a Lovely War]]'' soundtrack, [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]], the nascent [[gothic rock]] genre ([[Sisters of Mercy]], [[Fields of the Nephilim]]) and the [[Electro (music)|electro]] sounds of artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Heaven 17]]. He described the first [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] album, ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'', as \"the record that probably changed his life\", and commented that \"Miuzi Weighs a Ton\" was \"one of the most amazing tracks he had ever heard\". Rowlands also started collecting [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] records by artists like [[Eric B]] and [[Schoolly D]]. Rowlands left school with similar accomplishments to Simons, achieving nine O levels and three A levels. For university, he followed Simons to Manchester primarily to immerse himself in its music scene in general and the [[Fac 51 Hacienda|Ha\u00e7ienda]] in particular.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-chemical-brothers| title=Artist bio from Rhapsody|website=Rhapsody.com}}</ref>\n\nRowlands was also in a band called Ariel prior to meeting up with Simons.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Ariel was formed in London by Rowlands and his friends Brendan Melck and Mathew Berry. Their first single was \"Sea of Beats\", which was essentially a [[white label]]. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was \"Bokadilo\". Other songs, released on [[Gramophone record|12-inch]], included \"Mustn't Grumble\" and their most well-known, \"Rollercoaster\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the [[record label]] [[Deconstruction Records|deConstruction]]. They insisted that they get a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman [[Sally Ann Marsh]], and after some disappointing songs like \"Let It Slide\" (Rowlands would later describe it as \"a stinker\") the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song \"T Baby\" which was remixed by the pair. In regards to the remix, Ed stated that \"Ariel symbolically ended when Deconstruction asked us for a [[Dust Brothers]] remix of an Ariel track. That was the final nail in the coffin\". \n\nRowlands and Simons then started to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at a club called \"Naked Under Leather\" in the back of a pub in 1992,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> under the alias of \"The 237 Turbo Nutters\" (named after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn [[Rave culture|raving]] days). The pair would play hip hop, [[Techno music|techno]], and [[House music|house]].<ref>''Brothers Gonna Work It Out'' (XDUSTCD 101) booklet, page 2.</ref> Rowlands and Simons called themselves the Dust Brothers  <ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> after [[Dust Brothers|the US production duo]] famous for their work with the [[Beastie Boys]]. After a while, they began to run out of suitable instrumental hip hop tracks to use, so they started to make their own. Using a [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] hi-fi system, a computer, a sampler, and a keyboard, they recorded \"Song to the Siren\", which sampled [[This Mortal Coil]]. \"Song to the Siren\" was released on their own record label, called \"Diamond Records\" (after Ed's nickname). At this point The Dust Bros Were the first ever back room DJ's in the \u2018Sumptuous Locarno Lounge\u2019at \u2018The Job Club\u2018 in Gossips night club in Dean St Soho from April 1992 till April 1993. In October 1992, they pressed 500 white label copies and took them to various dance record shops around London, but none would play it, saying that it was too slow (the track played at 111 [[beats per minute|BPM]]). They sent a copy to London DJ [[Andrew Weatherall]], who made it a permanent fixture in his DJ sets. Weatherall also signed the band to his [[Junior Boy's Own]] label.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In May 1993, Junior Boy's Own released \"Song to the Siren\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nAround June 1993, the Dust Brothers recorded their first remixes. The first was \"Packet of Peace\" for Justin Robertson's [[Lionrock]] group, followed by songs from [[Leftfield]], [[Republica]], and [[the Sandals]]. Later in 1993, the Dust Brothers completed work on their ''[[Fourteenth Century Sky]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], released in January 1994.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It contained the ground-breaking \"Chemical Beats\", which epitomised the duo's genre-defining [[big beat]] sound.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The EP also contained \"One Too Many Mornings\", which for the first time showed the less intense, more chilled-out side of the Dust Brothers. Both \"One Too Many Mornings\" and \"Chemical Beats\" would later appear on their debut album. ''Fourteenth Century Sky'' was followed later in 1994 by the ''[[My Mercury Mouth EP]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Chemical Beats\" was also part of the soundtrack for the first edition of the [[Wipeout (game)|Wipeout]] game series, having been featured in ''Wipeout'' for the [[PlayStation]] in 1995.\n\nIn October 1994, the Dust Brothers became resident DJs at the small, but influential [[Heavenly Recordings#The Social|Heavenly Sunday Social Club]] at the Albany pub in London's [[Great Portland Street]]. [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[James Dean Bradfield]], and [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers were subsequently asked to remix tracks by [[Manic Street Preachers]] and [[The Charlatans (British band)|the Charlatans]], plus [[Primal Scream]]'s \"Jailbird\" and [[the Prodigy]]'s \"Voodoo People\". These two remixes received [[television]] exposure, being playlisted by [[MTV]] Europe's \"The Party Zone\" in 1995. Early in 1994, the Dust Brothers were approached in the club one Sunday by Noel Gallagher, from [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who at the time were becoming one of the most prominent guitar bands in Britain. Gallagher told the duo that he had a [[Ibiza|Balearic]]-inspired track which he had written and would like the Dust Brothers to remix. However, over time, Gallagher changed his mind, and in the end the Brothers did not remix it.\n\nIn March 1995, the Dust Brothers began their first international tour, which included the United States \u2013 where they played with [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] and [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] \u2013 then a series of European festivals. Also around this time, objections were filed by [[Dust Brothers|the original Dust Brothers]] over the use of their name, and so Rowlands and Simons had to decide on a new name.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> They decided to call themselves \"The Chemical Brothers\" after \"Chemical Beats\" (Simons' grandmother had suggested they call themselves \"The Grit Brothers\").\n\nIn June 1995, they released their fourth single, the first under their new identity. \"Leave Home\" was released on Junior Boy's Own, as a preview of the imminent debut album and became the band's first chart hit, peaking at No. 17.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u20131998: ''Exit Planet Dust'' and ''Dig Your Own Hole'' ===\nIn July 1995, the Chemical Brothers released their debut album ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]'' (the title inspired by their name change) on Freestyle Dust/Junior Boy's Own. It entered the UK charts at No. 9<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and featured guest vocalist [[Beth Orton]] on the song \"Alive Alone\". It eventually went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, and was used on the soundtrack of the [[science fiction]] TV series pilot [[Virtuality (TV series)|Virtuality]]. Shortly after its release, the Chemical Brothers signed to [[Virgin Records]], to which they took their own offshoot label, Freestyle Dust. For their next single, \"[[Life Is Sweet (song)|Life Is Sweet]]\", released in September 1995, they again used a guest vocalist, featuring their friend Tim Burgess, singer of the Charlatans. It reached No. 25 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The single was also ''Select'' magazine's \"Single of the Month\" for October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsgallery.com/prodtype.asp?strParents=&CAT_ID=399&numRecordPosition=1|title=The Chemical Brothers Soundwaves Art --- St. Pauls Gallery|website=Stpaulsgallery.com|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> The release included a [[Daft Punk]] remix of \"Life Is Sweet\".\n\n[[The Stone Roses]] asked the duo to remix \"Begging You\", from their ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'' album. After beginning work on a remix which they viewed as having potential, they later rejected the idea and the work was cancelled.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn October 1995, the duo returned to the Heavenly Sunday Social for a second and final run of DJ dates. They then became residents at the Heavenly Social on Saturdays at Turnmills. In November, the Chemical Brothers played the [[Astoria Theatre]] in London. At this time the Brothers usually used a fusion of \"Chemical Beats\" and [[the Beatles]]' \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as their encore. During the encore, however, [[Keith Flint]] from the Prodigy jumped up on stage to dance, wearing a T-shirt sporting the slogan \"Occupation: mad bastard\". A few from the crowd subsequently joined in. This resulted in a power cable being kicked loose, bringing the show to a temporary close. The Chemical Brothers confessed to not being too bothered; \"because he's Keith from The Prodigy, and he can do whatever the fucking hell he likes\". Just before Christmas 1995, they played their biggest gig to date, with the Prodigy, at the [[Brixton Academy]].\n\nIn January 1996, ''Exit Planet Dust'' was certified gold. The Chemical Brothers released their first new material in six months on Virgin, the ''Loops of Fury'' EP. The four-track release was limited to 20,000 copies, but is now available for digital download. It entered the UK charts at No. 13. ''[[NME]]'' described the lead track as \"splashing waves of synths across hard-hitting beats\". The EP also contained a Dave Clarke remix of \"Chemical Beats\", and two other new tracks, \"Get Up on It Like This\" and \"(The Best Part Of) Breaking Up\".\n\nIn February 1996, ''Select'' magazine published a list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s thus far. ''Exit Planet Dust'' was listed at Number 39. In August 1996, the Chemical Brothers supported Oasis at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], where 125,000 people attended each of the two shows.\n\nDuring the 1995 [[Glastonbury Festival]], Rowlands and Simons had another conversation with [[Noel Gallagher]]. Gallagher told them how much he liked ''Exit Planet Dust'', and asked if he could sing on a future track, similar to the way [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] had worked on \"Life Is Sweet\". They did not think much of the offer at the time, given how busy Gallagher would be with the release of Oasis' ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', plus the complexities of dealing with each other's record companies. However, the duo later worked on a track which they thought would benefit from having a vocal on it. They sent Gallagher a tape of what they had done so far. He worked on it overnight, and left a message with them early the next morning that he was ready to record it. The track was called \"[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]\" and was finally released in October 1996. It entered the UK charts at the top, giving the duo their first ever Number One single.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Setting Sun\" was backed by a longer instrumental version, and also a new track \"Buzz Tracks\", which was not much more than a DJ tool. The three remaining members of the Beatles' lawyers later wrote to the Chemical Brothers, mistakenly claiming that they had sampled \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\". Virgin Records hired a [[Musicology|musicologist]] to prove that they did not sample the song.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1996, ''[[Live at the Social Volume 1]]'' was released by [[Heavenly Records]], which became the Chemical Brothers' first mix CD (excluding ''Xmas Dust Up'', a free album that came in a 1994 issue of ''NME''). It was also the duo's first live album (excluding the EP ''[[Live 05]]'').\n\nIn March 1997, the Brothers released the second track from their forthcoming album. \"[[Block Rockin' Beats]]\" went straight to No. 1 in the UK, possibly thanks, this time, to its [[Schoolly D]] vocal sample and re-working of the bass-line from [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s single \"Coup\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsng.net/samplesources.htm |title=Sample Sources |work=dsng.net |date= |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> The ''NME'' named it \"Single of the Week\" and said \"It throbs like your head might if you had just done a length underwater in a swimming pool full of [[Alkyl nitrites|amyl]].\" It later won them a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1997&genre=31 |title=Grammy Awards : Past Winners Search |website=Grammy.com|accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the US at this time, \"Setting Sun\" was sitting at Number 80 in the Billboard Top 100, after selling around 80,000 copies, an uncommon achievement for a European \"dance\" act. Sales from ''Exit Planet Dust'' were also around 150,000.\n\nOn 7 April 1997, the Chemical Brothers released their second album, ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]''. It was recorded at the band's own south London studio, with the title taken from graffiti on the wall outside. The album was well received,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |title=Dig Your Own Hole: The Chemical Brothers: Review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=3 April 1997 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116081718/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |archivedate=16 January 2009 }}</ref> with ''Mixmag'' rating it 10/10 and calling it \"mad enough to be thrilling, slick enough for not even remotely trendy coffee tables\".\n\nDuring the summer of 1997, the Brothers toured extensively, particularly in the United States. They also became residents at [[Tokyo]]'s Liquid Rooms. In August, the Chemical Brothers achieved a rapprochement with the US Dust Brothers, and asked them to remix the forthcoming single \"[[Elektrobank]]\". They themselves also became highly sought-after for remixes for other artists. In September, the next single from ''Dig Your Own Hole'', \"Elektrobank\" was released. In November, the pair played at [[Dublin]]'s Point Theatre, with support from [[Carl Cox]]. They also began a US tour in [[Detroit]].\n\nAt the end of the year, ''Dig Your Own Hole''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final track, the nine-minute-long \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\", gave rise to a limited-edition mini-EP of the same name. The [[B-side]] consisted of a live version of \"Setting Sun\", recorded at the [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands Festival]], Netherlands on 24 August 1997. Also in December, following four sold-out US shows, the Chemical Brothers toured the UK, concluding in a sold-out show at Brixton Academy, London\n\nIn 1998, they concentrated more on DJing, although some remixes did see the light of day, including \"I Think I'm in Love\" from [[Spiritualized]]. Both a vocal remix and an instrumental remix were included in the single release. Each clocked in at over seven-and-a-half minutes. Another remix completed by the Brothers was \"Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp\" by [[Mercury Rev]]. This was another extension in the association between the two bands, since Mercury Rev's Jonathon Donahue contributed to \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\" on ''Dig Your Own Hole''.\n\nIn September 1998, a second mix album, ''[[Brothers Gonna Work It Out]]'', was released. It contains some of their own tracks and remixes, as well as songs from artists who have influenced their sound, such as [[Renegade Soundwave]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], Carlos \"After Dark\" Berrios, and [[Kenny 'Dope' Gonzales]].\n\n=== 1999\u20132002: ''Surrender'' and ''Come with Us'' ===\nIn May 1999, the Chemical Brothers played three UK dates in [[Manchester]], [[Sheffield]] and [[Brighton]], their first since December 1997. Also that month, they released their first new original material in two years, a track called \"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\". This was more [[house music|house]]-influenced than big beat. In interviews at the time, Rowlands and Simons indicated that the track was inspired by nights out at Sheffield club Gatecrasher. The track was also one of their more commercially accessible tracks and went to number 3 in the UK charts.\n\nTheir third album, ''[[Surrender (The Chemical Brothers album)|Surrender]]'', was released in June 1999. It featured vocals from Noel Gallagher, Mercury Rev's [[Jonathan Donahue]], and [[Mazzy Star]]'s [[Hope Sandoval]]. As \"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\" had suggested, the album was more house-oriented than the previous two. On one of the album's stand out tracks, \"Out of Control\", [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] supported by [[Primal Scream]]'s [[Bobby Gillespie]] provided vocals. It reached No. 1 in the UK album charts. The [[Michel Gondry]]-directed [[music video]] for \"[[Let Forever Be]]\", which utilised ground-breaking video and film effects in its depiction of a young woman's nightmares, also received a lot of attention.\n\nLater that summer, the Brothers performed at the infamous [[Woodstock 99]] concert on 24 July, with positive reception. They later headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] dance tent on the Friday night, followed by a UK tour which ended in December and included [[Homelands (festival)|Homelands]] Scotland on 4 September. In November, \"Out of Control\", featuring Sumner and Gillespie on vocals, was released as a single. The release also contained the [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] remix. The final single from ''Surrender'', in February 2000, was the five track \"Music: Response\" EP, containing the title track and two remixes, plus [[Electronic Battle Weapon]] 4, named \"Freak of the Week\", and a track called \"Enjoyed\", which was essentially a remix of \"Out of Control\" by the Brothers themselves.\nA CD copy of ''Surrender'' was placed in the third ''[[Blue Peter]]'' [[time capsule]], buried in January 2000. That same month, they appeared on Primal Scream's album ''[[Xtrmntr]]'' at track 11 with a remix.\n\nIn June 2000, Tom and Ed played the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival. In August 2000 they played to a large crowd at the main stage at Creamfields festival, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In December 2000, the Chemical Brothers aired one of their new tracks, \"It Began in Afrika\" at their New York DJ gigs, supporting [[U2]].\n\nIn 2001, they were quite active with releases and live performances. Early in the year, they began working on a fourth album, provisionally titled ''Chemical Four''. The first track which fans got a taste of was \"It Began in Afrika\", as previously played in their DJ set in New York. The track would make its live debut in [[California]] in April 2001, at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. Another new track, \"Galaxy Bounce\", also got its public debut at Coachella. As had become customary for their releases and experiments, \"It Began in Afrika\" was first pressed as a promo, as part of the \"[[Electronic Battle Weapon]]\" series. It received much airplay on dance music radio shows in the UK, and became more and more popular in clubs over the course of the summer. It also became one of the \"anthems\" in [[Ibiza]] as the summer progressed. It was given a full commercial single release in September, reaching No. 8 in the UK singles chart, even though no promotional video was made for the track.\n\nRowlands and Simons also remixed a track from [[Fatboy Slim]]'s ''[[Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars]]'', entitled \"Song for Shelter\". This remix was released as a single on 3 September 2001 (one week before \"It Began in Afrika\") as the CD2 single for \"[[Song for Shelter / Ya Mama]]\". It reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Charts (sales were combined with the CD1 single).\n\nThe Chemical Brothers finished work on another album, ''[[Come with Us]]'', in October 2001. It featured collaborations with [[Richard Ashcroft]] of [[the Verve]] (\"The Test\"), and long-time collaborator [[Beth Orton]] (\"The State We're In\"). The album was released in January 2002, preceded by a single, \"Star Guitar\", a melodic [[Balearic beat]] number, with a promotional video by [[Michel Gondry]] that featured passing scenery synchronised to the beat viewed through a train window. What would be the second track on the album, \"It Began in Afrika\", was released 10 September 2001 to be circulated around the clubbing scene where it was a popular hit. \"Star Guitar\" was also released as a [[DVD]] single, the pair's first. ''Come with Us'', was less well received than their previous albums, but nonetheless went straight to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart in the first week of its release, selling 100,000 copies. In April, the title track from the album was released as a single with remixes by [[Fatboy Slim]] as part of a double A-sided release with \"The Test\".\n\nDuring the summer of 2002, the Chemical Brothers travelled the festival circuit to promote the album. Later in 2002, they released two EPs, one specifically aimed at Japan and the other the US (entitled ''[[AmericanEP]]''). Both contained remixes, live versions and B-sides. Additionally, the band produced [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s final non-album single \"[[Here to Stay (New Order song)|Here to Stay]]\", and remixed the song as well.\nOne of their other major songs from this album was \"Galaxy Bounce\", which was popular and featured as the main title music for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Project Gotham Racing (video game)|Project Gotham Racing]]''. It was also included on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. \"Star Guitar\" was featured as a song on the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]'s ''[[Lumines II]]''.\n\nTwo other songs, \"Come with Us (Introduction)\" and \"Star Guitar (Title Screen)\", were featured on a ''[[PlayStation 2]]'' racing game titled ''WRC II: Extreme''. Both songs are instrumental.\nThe song \"My Elastic Eye\" from the ''Come with Us'' album was played in the 2004 movie ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/soundtrack |title=The Butterfly Effect (2004) \u2013 Soundtracks |work=Imdb.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> starring [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Amy Smart]].\n\n=== 2003\u20132006: ''Push the Button'' ===\nEarly 2003 saw Rowlands and Simons back in the studio working on new material, including \"The Golden Path\", a collaboration with [[Wayne Coyne]] of [[the Flaming Lips]]. This was released in September 2003, at the same time as a \"best of\" album, entitled ''[[Singles 93\u201303]]'', marking ten years of the Chemical Brothers' releases. ''Singles 93\u201303'' included most, but not all, of their singles. A second new track, in addition to \"The Golden Path\", was included on the album, called \"Get Yourself High\". ''Singles 93\u201303'' was also released on DVD, with extra features including selected live performances and interviews with Rowlands, Simons, and many of their collaborators from throughout the period. \"Get Yourself High\", which featured Canadian rapper [[k-os]] on vocals, was released as a single in November 2003.\n\nIn late 2003 and 2004, the Chemical Brothers continued to work in the studio on new material and a remix of \"[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]\" by [[Kylie Minogue]]. After being released on rare white label vinyl, it was subsequently given a commercial release in March on CD (on her next single \"Red Blooded Woman\") and on exclusive 12-inch vinyl picture disc (containing two other Kylie remixes). In Summer 2004 they returned to the festival circuit, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], Tokyo, Scotland, and Ireland. They also visited [[South America]] for the second time (the first time being in 1999), arriving at [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], and [[Brazil]]. It was during these sets that they played new material, including \"Acid Children\", which proved to be one of the most popular new tracks.\n\nIn September 2004, the Chemical Brothers released the seventh \"Electronic Battle Weapon\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 7\" was being released as a one-sided promo-only 12-inch, containing \"Acid Children\". A marked departure from the Chemical Brothers' previous musical endeavours, it featured a screeching 303 bassline and a distinctive vocal sample; a pitch-altered vocal sample proclaiming \"You Are All My Children Now!\", which is lifted from the horror film ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]''. It was coupled with the projection of a sinister clown mouthing these same words at their live gigs.\n\nThe Electronic Battle Weapon series of promo releases have typically been newly recorded Chemical Brothers tracks, released on promo to allow DJs to test them in a club environment, and to gauge their popularity.\n\nIn 2004, the Chemical Brothers began work on ''[[Push the Button (The Chemical Brothers album)|Push the Button]]'', their fifth studio album, which features collaborations with [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]], [[Kele Okereke]], and [[Anwar Superstar]], amongst others. The album was released on 24 January 2005.\n\n\"[[Galvanize (song)|Galvanize]]\", which features rapper [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] on vocals, was the first single to be taken from ''Push the Button'', and premiered exclusively on [[iTunes]]. The single was released on 17 January 2005, and entered the UK chart at No. 3. The second single, \"[[Believe (Chemical Brothers song)|Believe]]\" (featuring Kele Okereke from [[Bloc Party]]), failed to crack the top 10, but still made it into the top 20, peaking at No. 18. \"The Boxer\", featuring Tim Burgess, became the duo's first single to fail to crack the top 40.\n\nThe album and single \"Galvanize\" won a Grammy at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006]]. One of the songs in this album, \"The Big Jump\", appears in the video game ''[[Burnout Revenge]]'', as well as ''[[Project Gotham Racing 3]]''. The track \"Surface to Air\" features a pulsing chord progression and bassline reminiscent of the intro to the [[The Strokes|Strokes]] song \"The Modern Age\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Chemical action, crowd reaction - Music - www.theage.com.au|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/Chemical-action-crowd-reaction/2005/01/27/1106415717077.html|website=Theage.com.au|accessdate=13 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAn unofficial, remixed version of the album entitled ''Flip the Switch'' was released as a free download, along with the ''Believe'' EP, featuring six further remixes of \"Believe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |title=Flip The Switch \u2013 The Chemical Brothers remixed |accessdate=13 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126182108/http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |archivedate=26 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, the Chemical Brothers were revealed as the first musicians to be involved in Tate Tracks.<ref name=\"Moss\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art39863|title=Tate Modern Makes Music With Chemical Brothers For Tate Tracks Project|last=Moss|first=Richard|date=31 August 2006|work=[[Culture24]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"TateTracks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tatetracks.org.uk|title=Tate Tracks|year=2006|publisher=[[Tate]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> [[Tate Modern]] invited various groups and songwriters to choose a work that inspired them from the gallery's collection of modern art and then write a track about it.

The double-sided vinyl was finally released just before the Chemical Brothers' much anticipated New Year's Eve gig at the famous [[Turnmills]] in London. The vinyl had a limited edition release worldwide and was received well by fans, DJs, and critics alike. Electronic Battle Weapon 8, at about six and a half minutes, was very distinct from the \"big acid\" style that the earlier Battle Weapons adhered to. It was characterised by 'thundering' drums with a rising synth line. A version of this track featured on the ''We Are the Night'' album and was entitled \"Saturate\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 9\" was a typical Chemicals dancefloor track with their trademark [[vocoder]] vocals coupled with sirens and a basic 'tribal' melody.\n\nAt the same [[Turnmills]] gig, the Brothers also played a previously unreleased song at midnight to welcome 2007, which went down well with the crowd. This track eventually emerged as \"Burst Generator\", found on the forthcoming album ''We Are the Night''. Many were left wondering if the latest in the Electronic Battle Weapon series were simply one-off experiments or signalled a new direction they could take with the new album, perhaps swaying from their genre defining big beat albums of the past. The song was also the band's 100th released song.\n\nOn 21 March 2007, the Chemical Brothers officially announced their forthcoming album on [[MySpace]]. The new album, entitled ''[[We Are the Night (album)|We Are the Night]]'', was released on 2 July 2007 in the United Kingdom and 17 July 2007 in the United States. The Chemical Brothers cited a delay in the production of artwork for this delay.<ref>[http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/home/ Album release date announced] \u2013 The Chemical Brothers Official Website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702042726/http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/home/ |date=2 July 2012 }}</ref> EMI subsequently released an online Chemical Brothers computer game as an apology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=23169_0_2_0_C |title=New album The Chemical Brothers delayed - here's a 'sorry guys' |date=18 May 2007 |work=side-line.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> The track listing was released to the fans on the official mailing list on 10 April.

This time it was the first single \"Do It Again\" off their new album, aired on his [[BBC Radio 1]] \"In New Music We Trust\" show. The official release of the single was 4 June (digital download) and 14 June (12-inch, 7-inch and CD). The album went on general release in the UK on 2 July 2007.\n\nIn September 2007, the Chemical Brothers played a free live gig in Trafalgar Square as part of the Becks Fusions event.

{"title_page": "Anime music video", "text_new": "[[File:AKROSS Con Screening (2009).jpg|thumb|264x264px|AKROSS Con Screening (2009) ]]\n{{Anime and manga}}\nAn '''anime music video''' ('''AMV'''), known in [[wasei-eigo]] as '''MAD''' ('''music anime douga'''), is a [[Fan labor|fan-made]] [[music video]] consisting of clips from one or more Japanese animated shows or movies set to an audio track, often songs or promotional trailer audio. The term is generally specific to Japanese anime, however, it can occasionally include American animation footage or video game footage. AMVs are not official music videos released by the musicians, they are fan compositions which synchronize edited video clips with an audio track. AMVs are most commonly posted and distributed over the Internet through AnimeMusicVideos.org or [[YouTube]]. [[Anime convention]]s frequently run AMV contests who usually show the finalists/winner's AMVs.\n\nAMVs should not be confused with music videos that employ original, professionally made animation (such as numerous music videos for songs by [[Iron Maiden]]), or with such short music video films (such as Japanese duo [[Chage and Aska]]'s song \"[[On Your Mark]]\" that was produced by the film company [[Studio Ghibli]]). AMVs should also not be confused with fan-made \"general animation\" videos using non-Japanese animated video sources like [[Western world|western]] cartoons, or with the practice of [[vidding]] in Western [[media fandom]], which [[convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] and has a distinct history and fan culture. Parallels can be drawn between AMVs and [[songvid]]s, animated fan-made videos using footage from movies, television series, or other sources.\n\nThe first anime music video was created in 1982 by 21-year-old Jim Kaposztas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fo20071115pm.html |last=Macias |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Macias |title=Remix this: anime gets hijacked |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> Kaposztas hooked up two [[VCR]]s to each other and edited the most violent scenes from ''[[Star Blazers]]'' to \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" by [[The Beatles]] to produce a humorous effect.<ref>{{cite av media |author=AnimeCons TV |url=https://animecons.tv/extra/17/jim-kaposztas-interview|title=Jim Kaposztas Interview|date=2 October 2011|accessdate=1 June 2018|publisher=AnimeCons TV}}</ref>\n\n==Creation==\nThe creation of an AMV centers on using various [[film editing|video editing]] styles to create a feeling of synchronization and unity. Some examples include: \n* Raw Editing: Using basic zooming in and out \"effects\" along with simple transitions. \n* FX (Effects) Editing: This style consists of large amounts of visual effects. This can be accomplished in programs such as Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects.\n* Timing Editing: The editor edits the clips such that the anime footage is in sync with the lyrics or beats (from the song) to create a perfect harmony. (E.g. Matching beats to gunshot scenes or making an anime character's lips move to make it seem like the character is saying or singing those words in the AMV)\n* Flow Editing: This requires the editor to use transitions and to keep the AMV flowing rather than to have it consist of rough cuts and choppy parts.\n* Animation Editing: Although it sounds similar to the term AMV editing, it is a new style where editors take a still image and animate it (making it move) (This also applies to Manga Music Videos (MMVs) which are similar to AMVs, instead they use manga as the main source of footage).\n* Masking: This style requires the editor to remove the background from the anime scene they would like to add effects to. It is a painstaking and time-consuming process.\n\n==Popularity==\n[[John Oppliger]] of [[AnimeNation]] has noted that fan-produced AMVs are popular mostly with Western fans but not with Japanese fans. One reason he cited was that Western fans experience a \"more purely\" visual experience inasmuch as most Western fans cannot understand the Japanese language, the original language of most [[anime]], and as a result \"the visuals make a greater impact\" on the senses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/09/08/ask-john-why-are-anime-music-videos-so-popular/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |authorlink=John Oppliger |title=Ask John: Why Are Anime Music Videos so Popular? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=2003-09-08 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430072040/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/09/08/ask-john-why-are-anime-music-videos-so-popular/ |archivedate=2009-04-30 }}</ref> The second reason he cited was that Westerners are \"encouraged by social pressure to grow out of cartoons and comics during the onset of adolescence\" whereas Japanese natives grow up with animation \"as a constant companion\";  as a result, English-speaking fans tend to utilize and reconstruct existing anime to create AMVs whereas Japanese fans \"are more intuitively inclined\" to create or expand on existing manga and anime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/06/23/ask-john-why-hasnt-doujinshi-caught-on-outside-of-japan/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |authorlink=John Oppliger |title=Ask John: Why Hasn\u2019t Doujinshi Caught on Outside of Japan? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=2005-06-23 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111225513/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/06/23/ask-john-why-hasnt-doujinshi-caught-on-outside-of-japan/ |archivedate=2012-01-11 }}</ref>\n\n== Legal issues ==\nThe Japanese culture is generally permissive with regard to the appropriation of ideas. Works such as [[d\u014djinshi]], unauthorized comics continuing the story of an official comic series, are actually encouraged by many anime makers.<ref name=\"lessig1\">{{cite book |last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |title=Free Culture |publisher=Authorama.com |date=March 25, 2004 |url=http://www.authorama.com/book/free-culture.html |accessdate=2009-09-08 |chapter=Chapter One: Creators |chapterurl=http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-4.html |quote=This is the phenomenon of d\u014djinshi. D\u014djinshi are also comics, but they are a kind of copycat comic. The creation of d\u014djinshi is governed by a creators' ethic stating that a work is not d\u014djinshi if it is just a copy; the artist must make a contribution to the art he copies by transforming it either subtly or significantly... These copycat comics exhibit significant market penetration as well. More than 33,000 \"circles\" of creators from across Japan produce d\u014djinshi. More than 450,000 Japanese come together twice a year, in the largest public gathering in the country, to exchange and sell them. This market exists in parallel to the mainstream commercial manga market. In some ways, it obviously competes with that market, but there is no sustained effort by those who control the commercial manga market to shut the d\u014djinshi market down. It flourishes, despite the competition and despite the law.\"}}</ref> These d\u014djinshi take an original copyrighted work and expand upon the story, allowing the characters to continue on after, before, or during the original story. Most anime producers encourage this practice, as it expands their series. Some see it as a tribute while others see it from a business viewpoint that it draws in more support for the anime than it would have had otherwise. Some [[Mangaka|manga artists]] create their own d\u014djinshi, such as Maki Murakami's \"circle\" Crocodile Ave (''[[Gravitation (manga)|Gravitation]]'').\n\nIn an interview with site AnimeNewsNetwork, [[Funimation|FUNimation]] Entertainment copyright specialist Evan Flournay said they generally see AMVs as a sort of free advertising. \"The basic thinking going into fan videos is thus: if it whets the audience's appetite, we'll leave it alone.

The following year, he used his theory to establish relationships between the temperature, [[pressure]] and [[density]] of [[gas]]es, and expressions for the [[latent heat]] of [[evaporation]] of a [[liquid]]. He accurately predicted the surprising fact that the apparent [[specific heat]] of [[saturated steam]] would be negative.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rankine|first=William|title=On the Mechanical Action of Heat, especially in Gases and Vapours|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|year=1850|volume=20|pages=147\u2013190|doi=10.1017/S008045680003307X|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/126047#page/177/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\nEmboldened by his success, in 1851 he set out to calculate the efficiency of heat engines and used his theory as a basis to deduce the principle, that the maximum efficiency possible for any heat engine is a function only of the two temperatures between which it operates. Though a similar result had already been derived by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], Rankine claimed that his result rested upon his hypothesis of molecular vortices alone, rather than upon Carnot's theory or some other additional assumption. The work marked the first step on Rankine's journey to develop a more complete theory of heat.\n\nRankine later recast the results of his molecular theories in terms of a macroscopic account of [[energy]] and its transformations. He defined and distinguished between ''actual energy'' which was lost in dynamic processes and ''[[potential energy]]'' by which it was replaced. He assumed the sum of the two energies to be constant, an idea already, although surely not for very long, familiar in the law of [[conservation of energy]]. From 1854, he made wide use of his ''thermodynamic function'' which he later realised was identical to the [[entropy]] of Clausius. By 1855, Rankine had formulated a ''science of [[energetics]]'' which gave an account of dynamics in terms of energy and its transformations rather than [[force]] and [[motion (physics)|motion]]. The theory was very influential in the 1890s. In 1859 he proposed the [[Rankine scale]] of temperature, an absolute or thermodynamic scale whose degree is equal to a [[Fahrenheit]] degree.\n\nEnergetics offered Rankine an alternative, and rather more mainstream, approach, to his science and, from the mid-1850s, he made rather less use of his molecular vortices. Yet he still claimed that Maxwell's work on electromagnetics was effectively an extension of his model. And, in 1864, he contended that the microscopic theories of heat proposed by Clausius and [[James Clerk Maxwell]], based on linear atomic motion, were inadequate. It was only in 1869 that Rankine admitted the success of these rival theories. By that time, his own model of the atom had become almost identical with that of Thomson.\n\nAs was his constant aim, especially as a teacher of engineering, he used his own theories to develop a number of practical results and to elucidate their physical principles including:\n\n*The [[Rankine\u2013Hugoniot equation]] for propagation of [[shock wave]]s, governs the behaviour of shock waves normal to the oncoming flow. It is named after physicists Rankine and the French engineer [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]];\n*The [[Rankine cycle]], an analysis of an ideal heat-engine with a condensor. Like other thermodynamic cycles, the maximum efficiency of the Rankine cycle is given by calculating the maximum efficiency of the [[Carnot cycle]];\n*Properties of steam, gases and vapours.\n\nThe history of [[rotordynamics]] is replete with the interplay of theory and practice. Rankine first performed an analysis of a [[spinning shaft]] in 1869, but his model was not adequate and he predicted that supercritical speeds could not be attained.\n\n==Fatigue studies==\n[[Image:Tender fatigued axle.JPG|thumbnail|right|Drawing of a fatigue failure in an axle, 1843.]]\nRankine was one of the first engineers to recognise that [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] failures of railway axles was caused by the initiation and growth of brittle cracks. In the early 1840s he examined many broken axles, especially after the [[Versailles train crash]] of 1842 when a locomotive axle suddenly fractured and led to the death of over 50 passengers. He showed that the axles had failed by progressive growth of a brittle crack from a shoulder or other [[stress concentration]] source on the shaft, such as a [[Key (engineering)|keyway]]. He was supported by similar direct analysis of failed axles by [[Joseph Glynn (engineer)|Joseph Glynn]], where the axles failed by slow growth of a brittle crack in a process now known as [[metal fatigue]]. It was likely that the front axle of one of the locomotives involved in the [[Versailles train crash]] failed in a similar way. Rankine presented his conclusions in a paper delivered to the Institution of Civil Engineers. His work was ignored however, by many engineers who persisted in believing that stress could cause \"re-crystallisation\" of the metal, a myth which has persisted even to recent times. The theory of recrystallisation was quite wrong, and inhibited worthwhile research until the work of [[William Fairbairn]] a few years later, which showed the weakening effect of repeated flexure on large beams. Nevertheless, fatigue remained a serious and poorly understood phenomenon, and was the root cause of many accidents on the railways and elsewhere. It is still a serious problem, but at least is much better understood today, and so can be prevented by careful design.\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Other work==\n[[File:William Rankine 1870s.jpg|thumb|Rankine in the 1870s]]\nHe served as [[Regius Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] from November 1855 until his death in December 1872, pursuing engineering research along a number of lines in civil and [[mechanical engineering]].\n\nRankine was instrumental in the formation of the forerunner of [[Glasgow and Strathclyde Universities Officer Training Corps|Glasgow University Officer Training Corps]], the 2nd Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps at Glasgow University in July 1859, becoming Major in 1860 after it was formed into the first company of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps; he served until 1864, when he resigned due to pressure of work \u2013 much of it associated with Naval Architecture.\n\n===Civil engineering===\nThe [[Rankine Lecture]]s, organised by the [[British Geotechnical Association]], are named in recognition of the significant contributions he made to:\n*[[Structural analysis|Forces in frame structures]];\n*[[Soil mechanics]]; most notably in [[lateral earth pressure theory]] and the stabilization of [[retaining wall]]s.

Though a similar result had already been derived by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], Rankine claimed that his result rested upon his hypothesis of molecular vortices alone, rather than upon Carnot's theory or some other additional assumption. The work marked the first step on Rankine's journey to develop a more complete theory of heat.\n\nRankine later recast the results of his molecular theories in terms of a macroscopic account of [[energy]] and its transformations. He defined and distinguished between ''actual energy'' which was lost in dynamic processes and ''[[potential energy]]'' by which it was replaced. He assumed the sum of the two energies to be constant, an idea already, although surely not for very long, familiar in the law of [[conservation of energy]]. From 1854, he made wide use of his ''thermodynamic function'' which he later realised was identical to the [[entropy]] of Clausius. By 1855, Rankine had formulated a ''science of [[energetics]]'' which gave an account of dynamics in terms of energy and its transformations rather than [[force]] and [[motion (physics)|motion]]. The theory was very influential in the 1890s. In 1859 he proposed the [[Rankine scale]] of temperature, an absolute or thermodynamic scale whose degree is equal to a [[Fahrenheit]] degree.\n\nEnergetics offered Rankine an alternative, and rather more mainstream, approach, to his science and, from the mid-1850s, he made rather less use of his molecular vortices. Yet he still claimed that Maxwell's work on electromagnetics was effectively an extension of his model. And, in 1864, he contended that the microscopic theories of heat proposed by Clausius and [[James Clerk Maxwell]], based on linear atomic motion, were inadequate. It was only in 1869 that Rankine admitted the success of these rival theories. By that time, his own model of the atom had become almost identical with that of Thomson.\n\nAs was his constant aim, especially as a teacher of engineering, he used his own theories to develop a number of practical results and to elucidate their physical principles including:\n\n*The [[Rankine\u2013Hugoniot equation]] for propagation of [[shock wave]]s, governs the behaviour of shock waves normal to the oncoming flow. It is named after physicists Rankine and the French engineer [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]];\n*The [[Rankine cycle]], an analysis of an ideal heat-engine with a condensor. Like other thermodynamic cycles, the maximum efficiency of the Rankine cycle is given by calculating the maximum efficiency of the [[Carnot cycle]];\n*Properties of steam, gases and vapours.\n\nThe history of [[rotordynamics]] is replete with the interplay of theory and practice. Rankine first performed an analysis of a [[spinning shaft]] in 1869, but his model was not adequate and he predicted that supercritical speeds could not be attained.\n\n==Fatigue studies==\n[[Image:Tender fatigued axle.JPG|thumbnail|right|Drawing of a fatigue failure in an axle, 1843.]]\nRankine was one of the first engineers to recognise that [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] failures of railway axles was caused by the initiation and growth of brittle cracks. In the early 1840s he examined many broken axles, especially after the [[Versailles train crash]] of 1842 when a locomotive axle suddenly fractured and led to the death of over 50 passengers. He showed that the axles had failed by progressive growth of a brittle crack from a shoulder or other [[stress concentration]] source on the shaft, such as a [[Key (engineering)|keyway]]. He was supported by similar direct analysis of failed axles by [[Joseph Glynn (engineer)|Joseph Glynn]], where the axles failed by slow growth of a brittle crack in a process now known as [[metal fatigue]]. It was likely that the front axle of one of the locomotives involved in the [[Versailles train crash]] failed in a similar way. Rankine presented his conclusions in a paper delivered to the Institution of Civil Engineers. His work was ignored however, by many engineers who persisted in believing that stress could cause \"re-crystallisation\" of the metal, a myth which has persisted even to recent times. The theory of recrystallisation was quite wrong, and inhibited worthwhile research until the work of [[William Fairbairn]] a few years later, which showed the weakening effect of repeated flexure on large beams. Nevertheless, fatigue remained a serious and poorly understood phenomenon, and was the root cause of many accidents on the railways and elsewhere. It is still a serious problem, but at least is much better understood today, and so can be prevented by careful design.\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Other work==\n[[File:William Rankine 1870s.jpg|thumb|Rankine in the 1870s]]\nHe served as [[Regius Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] from November 1855 until his death in December 1872, pursuing engineering research along a number of lines in civil and [[mechanical engineering]].\n\nRankine was instrumental in the formation of the forerunner of [[Glasgow and Strathclyde Universities Officer Training Corps|Glasgow University Officer Training Corps]], the 2nd Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps at Glasgow University in July 1859, becoming Major in 1860 after it was formed into the first company of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps; he served until 1864, when he resigned due to pressure of work \u2013 much of it associated with Naval Architecture.\n\n===Civil engineering===\nThe [[Rankine Lecture]]s, organised by the [[British Geotechnical Association]], are named in recognition of the significant contributions he made to:\n*[[Structural analysis|Forces in frame structures]];\n*[[Soil mechanics]]; most notably in [[lateral earth pressure theory]] and the stabilization of [[retaining wall]]s.
