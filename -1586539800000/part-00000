Beginning in 1920, he served as a faculty member at the [[University of North Carolina]], founding the university press, the journal ''[[Social Forces]]'', and what is now the Howard W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, all in the 1920s. He also founded the university's School of Public Welfare, one of the first in the Southeast. With doctorates in psychology and sociology, he wrote extensively across academic disciplines, influencing several fields.<ref>George B. Tindall, \"The significance of Howard W. Odum to Southern history: A preliminary estimate.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 24.3 (1958): 285-307.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in 1884 in [[Bethlehem, Georgia]], Howard W. Odum had parents, William Pleasants and Mary Ann (Thomas) Odum, who encouraged his pursuit of education. He attended local schools through high school.\n\nOdum graduated from [[Emory University]]. While working as a teacher, he collected material on black folk lore and songs for two dissertations while completing his master's at [[University of Mississippi]]. He received his first doctorate, in psychology, at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where he studied with [[G. Stanley Hall]]. He received his second doctorate, in sociology, at [[Columbia University]]. While at Columbia, he studied with [[Franklin Henry Giddings]], focusing on race. Both of his two dissertations on black studies were published: the first was on religious traits in folk songs, and the second was on black social life.<ref name=\"ncpedia\" /><ref name=\"oakley\" />\n\nHe was appointed to serve as Assistant Director of Research for President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s Research Committee on Social Trends, beginning in 1933. He wrote three novels in addition to more than 20 scholarly texts, was President of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1930, and was also a founding member of the Southern Regional Council.<ref name=\"asanet\" /> Odum was known for collecting extensive facts, ranging from oral history (including documentation of folk songs) to agricultural data.\n\nHis publication ''Southern Regions of the United States'' (1936) pulled together a wide variety of facts and figures about the Southeast. This book, used by government administrators, farmers, scholars, and others, remains relevant today as a historical text. Odum's prolific contribution to the social sciences has been an influence on multiple disciplines, including ecology. Both of his sons, [[Eugene Odum|Eugene]] and [[Howard T. Odum]], became internationally recognized scholars of zoologist and ecology. The Odum brothers frequently cited their father's holistic inquiry as an important influence in their own understanding of [[emergent properties]] and other ecological concepts.\n\nOdum became a faculty member in the School of Public Welfare (a precursor of the School of [[Social Work]]) and Department of [[Sociology]] at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1920, founding the School of Public Welfare,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} one of the earliest such schools in the Southeast. He was a visionary in establishing the [[University of North Carolina Press]]. While at Chapel Hill, Odum also founded the journal ''[[Social Forces]]'' in 1922<ref name=\"social\" /> and the H.W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science in 1924.<ref name=\"irss\" /> Odum was one of the most prolific academics who influenced the early development of the University of North Carolina; his vision and academic strengths attracted other scholars to campus. Odum hired and collaborated with the university's first female faculty member.  His productivity was renowned, and his scholarship reached from academic settings to the community\u2014including influences on race relations in the American South. His book ''Race and Rumors of Race'' (1943), exploring racial tensions in the South and rising activism among blacks, was an early documentation of the civil rights movement. Odum's views on race progressed over time and ultimately he was a leader, documenting folk life, hate crimes/lynchings, and the rich oral histories of African-American communities in the South. His work is difficult to classify under one discipline, although he identified most with sociology while being deeply committed to social welfare.<ref>Harvey A. Kantor, \"Howard W. Odum: The implications of folk, planning, and regionalism.\" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 79.2 (1973): 278-295.</ref>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nOdum married Anna Louise Kranz (1888\u20131965), also a student of Stanley Hall at Clark University. The couple had two sons, [[Eugene Odum|Eugene]] and [[Howard T. Odum]], and a daughter, Mary Frances Odum. The men both became zoologists and recognized scholars of ecology, at University of Georgia and University of Florida, respectively.

Beginning in 1920, he served as a faculty member at the [[University of North Carolina]], founding the university press, the journal ''[[Social Forces]]'', and what is now the Howard W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, all in the 1920s. He also founded the university's School of Public Welfare, one of the first in the Southeast. With doctorates in psychology and sociology, he wrote extensively across academic disciplines, influencing several fields.<ref>George B. Tindall, \"The significance of Howard W. Odum to Southern history: A preliminary estimate.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 24.3 (1958): 285-307.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in 1884 in [[Bethlehem, Georgia]], Howard W. Odum had parents, William Pleasants and Mary Ann (Thomas) Odum, who encouraged his pursuit of education. He attended local schools through high school.\n\nOdum graduated from [[Emory University]]. While working as a teacher, he collected material on black folk lore and songs for two dissertations while completing his master's at [[University of Mississippi]]. He received his first doctorate, in psychology, at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where he studied with [[G. Stanley Hall]]. He received his second doctorate, in sociology, at [[Columbia University]]. While at Columbia, he studied with [[Franklin Henry Giddings]], focusing on race. Both of his two dissertations on black studies were published: the first was on religious traits in folk songs, and the second was on black social life.<ref name=\"ncpedia\" /><ref name=\"oakley\" />\n\nHe was appointed to serve as Assistant Director of Research for President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s Research Committee on Social Trends, beginning in 1933. He wrote three novels in addition to more than 20 scholarly texts, was President of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1930, and was also a founding member of the Southern Regional Council.<ref name=\"asanet\" /> Odum was known for collecting extensive facts, ranging from oral history (including documentation of folk songs) to agricultural data.\n\nHis publication ''Southern Regions of the United States'' (1936) pulled together a wide variety of facts and figures about the Southeast. This book, used by government administrators, farmers, scholars, and others, remains relevant today as a historical text. Odum's prolific contribution to the social sciences has been an influence on multiple disciplines, including ecology. Both of his sons, [[Eugene Odum|Eugene]] and [[Howard T. Odum]], became internationally recognized scholars of zoologist and ecology. The Odum brothers frequently cited their father's holistic inquiry as an important influence in their own understanding of [[emergent properties]] and other ecological concepts.\n\nOdum became a faculty member in the School of Public Welfare (a precursor of the School of [[Social Work]]) and Department of [[Sociology]] at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1920, founding the School of Public Welfare,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} one of the earliest such schools in the Southeast. He was a visionary in establishing the [[University of North Carolina Press]]. While at Chapel Hill, Odum also founded the journal ''[[Social Forces]]'' in 1922<ref name=\"social\" /> and the H.W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science in 1924.<ref name=\"irss\" /> Odum was one of the most prolific academics who influenced the early development of the University of North Carolina; his vision and academic strengths attracted other scholars to campus. Odum hired and collaborated with the university's first female faculty member.  His productivity was renowned, and his scholarship reached from academic settings to the community\u2014including influences on race relations in the American South. His book ''Race and Rumors of Race'' (1943), exploring racial tensions in the South and rising activism among blacks, was an early documentation of the civil rights movement. Odum's views on race progressed over time and ultimately he was a leader, documenting folk life, hate crimes/lynchings, and the rich oral histories of African-American communities in the South. His work is difficult to classify under one discipline, although he identified most with sociology while being deeply committed to social welfare.<ref>Harvey A. Kantor, \"Howard W. Odum: The implications of folk, planning, and regionalism.\" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 79.2 (1973): 278-295.</ref>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nOdum married Anna Louise Kranz (1888\u20131965), also a student of Stanley Hall at Clark University. The couple had two sons, [[Eugene Odum|Eugene]] and [[Howard T. Odum]], and a daughter, Mary Frances Odum. The men both became zoologists and recognized scholars of ecology, at University of Georgia and University of Florida, respectively. Mary Frances married Phillip Schinan and lives in Chapel Hill.<ref name=\"ncpedia\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black Belt in the American South]]\n* [[Deep South]]\n* [[Southern United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"asanet\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/page.ww?section=Presidents&name=Howard+W.+Odum|title=American Sociological Association|website=Asanet.org|accessdate=30 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927175759/http://www.asanet.org/page.ww?name=Howard+W.+Odum&section=Presidents|archive-date=27 September 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"irss\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.irss.unc.edu/odum/jsp/content_node.jsp?nodeid=1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429151246/http://www.irss.unc.edu/odum/jsp/content_node.jsp?nodeid=1 |archive-date=2007-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ncpedia\">[https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/odum-howard-washington Rupert B.

Graham's idea for the design of the current bridge won out over other proposals, including a tunnel (deemed impractical due to Florida's high [[water table]]) and a simple reconstruction of the broken section of the old bridge that would not have improved shipping conditions. The new bridge's main span is 50% wider than the old bridge. The piers of the main span and the approaches for {{convert|1/4|mi|m}} in either direction are surrounded by large concrete barriers, called \"[[dolphin (structure)|dolphins]]\", that can protect the bridge piers from collisions by ships larger than the ''Summit Venture'' like tankers, container ships, and cruise ships.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/wonder/structure/sunshine_skyway.html |title=Building big: Databank: Sunshine Skyway Bridge |accessdate=July 4, 2007 |publisher=PBS Online}}</ref>\n\n=== Demolition of former bridge ===\nIn 1990 FDOT awarded the winning bid to Hardaway Company to demolish all steel and concrete sections of the older Sunshine Skyway Bridge.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=July 29, 2019 |title=Sunshine Skyway Bridge |website=Controlled Demolition, Inc. |url=http://www.controlled-demolition.com/sunshine-skyway-bridge}}</ref> The scope of the project required that all underwater piles and piers, and surface roadway, girders, and beams be dismantled. Special care had to be taken in removing underwater bridge elements near the shipping channel. Additionally, the concrete material, deck sections, pilings and steel girders were to be collected in order to be placed offshore and along the remaining bridge approaches to become artificial reefs for the new planned state fishing park. The main bridge span had to be removed in one piece in order not to block the main shipping canal leading to the Port of Tampa.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Demolition day nears for old Skyway|url=https://tampabay.com/archive/1991/09/08/demolition-day-nears-for-old-skyway/|website=Tampa Bay Times|date=September 8, 1991|last1=Meinheardt|first1=Jane}}</ref>\n\nDuring the disassembly work of the bridges\u2019 structural steel members, several difficult engineering challenges had to be resolved: the order of disassembly, a safe method for detonating charges on concrete and steel members in a publicly open and difficult to control area such as the Tampa Bay, and the development of a safe methodology for the removal in one piece of the bridge\u2019s main span and concrete piers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nAfter extensive research, the engineering team developed a 4 \u00d7 1:16 ratio pulley system where each of the four corners of the span was connected to two 25-ton<!--which kind of ton?--> winches (bolted to the pavement of the deck). These winches controlled the descent of the main {{convert|360|ft|m|adj=on}}, 608-ton span to a barge anchored {{convert|150|ft|m}} below. As part of the project design, the engineering team developed a real-time, computerized, synchronized descent calculator and control program to help each of the two winch management teams ensure that all winches were synchronized at the same {{convert|30|ft|m}} per minute descent rate.

The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI. Pont.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]] and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.  The Pope intended for it to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]] that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

In 1586, the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' (lit. \"Beggar's Hospice\") was built by the architect [[Domenico Fontana]] on the orders of [[Pope Sixtus V]] (r. 1585-1590) and marked the end of the ''Via Giulia''.<ref name=pie7976/> It was built to solve the begging problem in the city and was given a yearly endowment of 150,000 ''[[roman scudo|scudi]]'' which could employ 2,000 people.<ref name=cas415>Castagnoli (1988), p. 415</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century it had become fashionable for the various nations and city-states to have their own churches built in Rome known as the ''chiese nazionali''.<ref name=cas392/> The ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], along the [[procession]]al and pilgrim roads, were the preferred locations. The Florentines,  the Sienese, and the Neapolitans had their churches built in Via Giulia (the [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini|San Giovanni]], the [[Santa Caterina da Siena a Via Giulia|Santa Caterina]], and the [[Santo Spirito dei Napoletani|Santo Spirito]] respectively),<ref name=del473/><ref name=pie16/> while the Bolognese ([[Santi Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio|San Giovanni e Petronio]]), Spanish ([[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli|Santa Maria in Monserrato]]), English ([[San Tommaso di Canterbury]]) and Swedish ([[Santa Brigida, Rome|Santa Brigida]]) churches were built in the Regola ''rione''.<ref name=cas392>Castagnoli (1958), p. 392</ref>\n\nIn order to supply the quarter with sufficient drinking water, [[Pope Paul V]] (r. 1605-1621) had the [[Aqua Paola]] extend over the Tiber. In 1613, the ''Fontanone di Ponte Sisto'' (lit. \"The Big Fountain of the Sistine Bridge\") was built on the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the beggars' hospice on Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7978/> It was demolished in 1879 and rebuilt in 1898 on the opposite side of the [[Ponte Sisto]] in what is now ''Piazza Trilussa''.[[:File:Fontana di Ponte Sisto.jpg|(Fig.)]].<ref name=pie7978/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\n 1645 Antonio Tempesta Via Giulia marked.svg|Via Giulia; Particular from ''Almae urbis Romae prospectus'' by [[Antonio Tempesta]] (1645)\n</gallery>\nAt the end of the 16th century Via Giulia's path was fixed; it ended by the Florentine quarter to the north and the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' to the south.

The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]] and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.  The Pope intended for it to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]] that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

It was founded in 1894 as the '''Elkhart Institute of Science, Industry and the Arts''', and is affiliated with [[Mennonite Church USA]]. The college is [[school accreditation|accredited]] by the ]]Higher Learning Commission]]. Goshen has an enrollment of 950 students.<ref name=\"GC Quick Facts\" /> While Goshen maintains a distinctive liberal Mennonite worldview, it admits students of all religions. [[Mennonite]]s make up 43 percent of the student body.<ref name=\"GC Quick Facts\" />\n\nGoshen College is home to ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'' and the [[Mennonite Historical Library]], a research library compiling one of the world's most comprehensive collection of [[Anabaptist]] and Mennonite primary source material.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = American Historical Association| title = Mennonite Historical Library| encyclopedia = American Historical Association Archives Wiki| date = 2013-05-17| url = http://archiveswiki.historians.org/index.php/Mennonite_Historical_Library}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Goshen College (or Goshen, as it is commonly known) is intertwined with that of the history of Mennonites in America,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and so Goshen's history is best told in the context of this broader history.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} \"Old\" Mennonites had traditionally been suspicious of higher education, but by the late 19th century, opinion started to change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Decades earlier, [[mainline Protestant]] church denominations had begun to found colleges across America, with the hope of developing well-trained clergy for their congregations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} As more \"Old\" Mennonites sent their children to other Christian colleges, they realized that, without a college of their own, many of their youth would leave the church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, prompted in part as a reaction to mainline Christianity, the \"Old\" Mennonites started the Elkhart Institute in [[Elkhart, Indiana]] in August 1894, to prepare Mennonite youth for college.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today,{{when|date=April 2017}} Goshen is open to everyone, but this earlier vision and its historical relationship with the Mennonite Church remains visible: it is home to ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'', [[Mennonite Historical Library]], [[Mennonite Church USA Archives]], including Mennonite Central Committee archives, offices of \"The Mennonite\", and it has numerous alumni connections with the broader Mennonite Church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen was the first Mennonite school of higher education in North America to confer a four-year degree.{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}<ref>[[Bethel College (Kansas)|Bethel College]], which was incorporated in 1887 and opened at its present site in 1893, is older, but did not originally grant four-year degrees.{{Original research inline|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}</ref>  H.A. Mumaw, a practicing physician, first led the small operation; in 1894, a group of 15 \"Old\" Mennonite ministers and laymen started a corporation that they named the Elkhart Institute association.<ref>Schlabach, Theron F: ''Peace, Faith, Nation: Mennonites and Amish in Nineteenth Century America'', page 300. Herald Press, 1988</ref>  The first diploma was awarded in 1898.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Lured by businessmen to relocate several miles away to [[Goshen, Indiana]], the Institute moved in September 1903 and added a junior college course list, renaming itself Goshen College.{{when|date=April 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} By 1906, the Mennonite Board of Education had taken control of the college, dissolving the Elkhart Institute Association.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} A complete college course was established in 1908, and the first Bachelor of Arts degrees were conferred in 1910.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} After 1910, most of Goshen's students were enrolled in college courses. From 1914 to 1919, partly out of response to its constituents, Goshen College attempted a \"School of Agriculture,\" which sought to prepare Mennonite young people to return to their rural communities; the hope was that such a program would spark a technological revolution among some of the farmers, but it was never a success and was cut after [[World War I]], five years after it began.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The college-prep academy program of Goshen College was discontinued in 1935.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe school was closed during the 1923\u20131924 school year by the Mennonite Board of Education but reopened the following year. One of many factors in closing the college was denominational tension due to [[Liberal Christianity|modernist]] and [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] theologies of the 1920s and their impact on Mennonite theology at the school.<ref>Juhnke, James C: ''Vision, Doctrine, War: Mennonite Identity and Organization in America 1890\u20131930'', page 128. Herald Press, 1989</ref> In response to this crisis, many of Goshen's faculty and dozens of students, angry with the Mennonite Board of Education's decision, relocated to [[Bluffton University|Bluffton College]]. As part of the larger ongoing reaction against liberalism through the early 20th century, [[Hesston College]] and [[Eastern Mennonite University|Eastern Mennonite School]] were formed among \"Old\" Mennonites, although staunch traditionalists realized that no higher education was particularly safe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWhen the institution was reopened, it was marked by the new leadership of president [[Sanford Calvin Yoder|S.C. Yoder]] and dean [[Harold S. Bender|Noah Oyer,]] who manifested outstanding abilities. His character was one marked by simplicity, modesty, and refinement, as well as unusual wisdom and insight. Under his leadership the educational program of the College developed rapidly, and much of the strength of the present college program is due to his untiring and wise endeavors. After dean Oyer\u2019s untimely passing in 1931, Harold Bender became dean. He was a man whose influence upon the \"Old\" Mennonites was significant for much of the 20th century. Bender carefully piloted the stormy waters of theology by stating that [[Mennonitism]] was not [[liberalism]]. Bender later went on to say that [[fundamentalism]] also contributed to problems with theology and created ''[[The Anabaptist Vision]]'', a \"third way\" that sought to spell out the direction for the future Mennonite Church. More than arguing doctrine, Bender and a younger group of intellectuals at Goshen College sought to shape the Mennonite faith that was more ideological than institutional. The goal was to articulate a faith that could stand the test of academic scrutiny in broader society while carefully upholding traditional beliefs of the church. Out of this ideology, Bender started ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]''. Throughout this time, Goshen remained the epicenter of \"Old\" Mennonite theology and higher education, and became known as the \"Goshen Historical Renaissance\".<ref>Toews, Paul: ''Mennonites in American Society, 1930\u20131970: Modernity and the Persistence of Religious Community'', page 88. Herald Press, 1996</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s, Goshen was one of the [[Mennonite Central Committee]]'s key places to form a \"relief training school\" that helped to train volunteers for unpaid jobs in the [[Civilian Public Service]], an alternative to the Army. Many Mennonites chose the civilian service alternative because of their beliefs regarding Biblical pacifism and nonresistance.  Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.<ref>Rachel Waltner Goossen, ''Women Against the Good War: Conscientious Objection and Gender on the American Home Front, 1941\u20131947'' (1997) pp 98-111</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the college was granted care of [[Merry Lea Environmental Center|Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center]], a {{convert|1150|acre|km2|adj=mid}} nature preserve that now offers Goshen's master's degree in Environmental Science.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 1993, Harold and Wilma Good, longtime friends of the college, left their estate to Goshen. The estate was estimated at roughly $28 million, the majority in stock of the [[Smuckers|J.M. Smucker Company]]. Wilma was a daughter of the company's founder. The college sold the stock and added the funds to its endowment, more than doubling it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |title=Mennonite college endowments lag behind |publisher=Mennonite Weekly Review |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021020/http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe campus experienced a building boom in the later half of the 1990s through the present, with an estimated $30 million in new or renovated structures on campus. This included the addition of the Roman Gingerich Recreation-Fitness Center, the Music Center, the Connector, and the renovation of all dormitories. The college is currently working on a new campus master plan and strategic plan that will define the college's priorities for the years ahead. Today, more than 20,000 Goshen College alumni have been counted, residing in more than 85 countries.

Throughout the year, students can participate in the coed sports of outdoor soccer, volleyball, sand volleyball, kickball, touch football, ultimate frisbee, and wiffleball, as well as basketball, indoor soccer, and 3-on-3 basketball.<ref>{{cite web|title=Intramurals|url=https://www.goshen.edu/campuslife/intramurals/|website=Goshen College|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\n\nGoshen College has its own school newspaper, ''The Record'' and its own radio station, [[WGCS]], branded as 91.1FM The Globe. On March 12, 2011, The Globe was named the Best College Station in the Nation, winning first place at the 71st Annual Conference of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) in New York City. On March 2, 2013, The Globe was again named Best College Station in the Nation, making it the first college to win the award twice. Since then, 91.1 the Globe has been awarded \"Radio Station of the Year\" by the Indiana Association of State Broadcasters six time, their most recent in March of 2020.\nGlobe Media also produces a monthly news show, \"The Globe News Report\", which covers campus and community news, along with a weekly sports show, \"The Globe Sports Corner\", covering Goshen College Athletics. It has also been involved in several larger projects, including the broadcast of the school's annual Festival of Carols on [[WNIT (TV)|WNIT]]. In the summer of 2011, the Goshen College communication department launched FiveCore Media, a video production company aimed at providing services for both on-campus and off-campus clients. Globe Media also produces a weekly sports show, \"The Globe Sports Corner\", featuring athlete and coaches interviews, along with an in-depth story highlighting athletes and teams across campus.\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n[[File:Goshen College Music Center.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The Goshen College Music Center]]\nGoshen College students have a variety of shows to attend in the Music Center's Sauder Concert Hall or Rieth Recital Hall or the Umble Center, Goshen's theater.

All faculty members at the school are Christian, with at least eighty percent adhering to Mennonite convictions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The college holds convocations or chapels every Wednesday, with occasional special events, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Students are required to attend half of these services per semester.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen College operates a campus ministries team, headed by the campus pastor. The team includes an assistant campus minister and student leaders who help guide and plan spiritual life on campus for the school year. Activities include managing the network of Goshen's small groups, spiritual friendship, leading campus worship, and planning chapels. Campus worship night is a voluntary praise and reflection time held every Wednesday night. Students also hold a [[Taiz\u00e9]] prayer service once a month on Sunday nights at 9:00. Because service is an important aspect of Christian faith, volunteerism ties in with spiritual life on campus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n=== Volunteerism ===\nEvery September, Goshen College participates in an activity called Celebrate Service Day (CSD). Students team with professors and administrative faculty and go out into the larger Goshen community for a day of service. First-year students go with their colloquium advisers, while other students go with their dormitory floor or small group. Aside from CSD, many students donate their time to work at local kindergartens, elementary schools, hospitals, and nursing homes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Athletics ==\nGoshen College athletic teams are known as the \"Maple Leafs,\" chosen due to the city of Goshen being referred to as ''\"The Maple City.\"''{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen is a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] and competes in the [[Crossroads League]] (formerly known as the [[Mid-Central College Conference]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Name and Logo|url=http://www.crossroadsleague.com/f/Name_and_Logo.php|website=Crossroads League|publisher=Crossroads League|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>).

Goshen College maintains that SGH living is a privilege, and students must apply as a group to live in a residence. An application board consisting of resident directors, spiritual life, and physical plant review all potential candidates in the spring for the next school year. Each group must create a housing plan, division of responsibility, show examples of volunteerism, and a commitment to better the Goshen campus, as well as resolve conflict.

Herald Press, 1989</ref> In response to this crisis, many of Goshen's faculty and dozens of students, angry with the Mennonite Board of Education's decision, relocated to [[Bluffton University|Bluffton College]]. As part of the larger ongoing reaction against liberalism through the early 20th century, [[Hesston College]] and [[Eastern Mennonite University|Eastern Mennonite School]] were formed among \"Old\" Mennonites, although staunch traditionalists realized that no higher education was particularly safe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWhen the institution was reopened, it was marked by the new leadership of president [[Sanford Calvin Yoder|S.C. Yoder]] and dean [[Harold S. Bender|Noah Oyer,]] who manifested outstanding abilities. His character was one marked by simplicity, modesty, and refinement, as well as unusual wisdom and insight. Under his leadership the educational program of the College developed rapidly, and much of the strength of the present college program is due to his untiring and wise endeavors. After dean Oyer\u2019s untimely passing in 1931, Harold Bender became dean. He was a man whose influence upon the \"Old\" Mennonites was significant for much of the 20th century. Bender carefully piloted the stormy waters of theology by stating that [[Mennonitism]] was not [[liberalism]]. Bender later went on to say that [[fundamentalism]] also contributed to problems with theology and created ''[[The Anabaptist Vision]]'', a \"third way\" that sought to spell out the direction for the future Mennonite Church. More than arguing doctrine, Bender and a younger group of intellectuals at Goshen College sought to shape the Mennonite faith that was more ideological than institutional. The goal was to articulate a faith that could stand the test of academic scrutiny in broader society while carefully upholding traditional beliefs of the church. Out of this ideology, Bender started ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]''. Throughout this time, Goshen remained the epicenter of \"Old\" Mennonite theology and higher education, and became known as the \"Goshen Historical Renaissance\".<ref>Toews, Paul: ''Mennonites in American Society, 1930\u20131970: Modernity and the Persistence of Religious Community'', page 88. Herald Press, 1996</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s, Goshen was one of the [[Mennonite Central Committee]]'s key places to form a \"relief training school\" that helped to train volunteers for unpaid jobs in the [[Civilian Public Service]], an alternative to the Army. Many Mennonites chose the civilian service alternative because of their beliefs regarding Biblical pacifism and nonresistance.  Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.<ref>Rachel Waltner Goossen, ''Women Against the Good War: Conscientious Objection and Gender on the American Home Front, 1941\u20131947'' (1997) pp 98-111</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the college was granted care of [[Merry Lea Environmental Center|Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center]], a {{convert|1150|acre|km2|adj=mid}} nature preserve that now offers Goshen's master's degree in Environmental Science.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 1993, Harold and Wilma Good, longtime friends of the college, left their estate to Goshen. The estate was estimated at roughly $28 million, the majority in stock of the [[Smuckers|J.M. Smucker Company]]. Wilma was a daughter of the company's founder.

The team includes an assistant campus minister and student leaders who help guide and plan spiritual life on campus for the school year. Activities include managing the network of Goshen's small groups, spiritual friendship, leading campus worship, and planning chapels. Campus worship night is a voluntary praise and reflection time held every Wednesday night. Students also hold a [[Taiz\u00e9]] prayer service once a month on Sunday nights at 9:00. Because service is an important aspect of Christian faith, volunteerism ties in with spiritual life on campus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n=== Volunteerism ===\nEvery September, Goshen College participates in an activity called Celebrate Service Day (CSD). Students team with professors and administrative faculty and go out into the larger Goshen community for a day of service.

International Political Science review]</ref>\n\n== Historical Background ==\n\n[[File:Boston Tea Party.jpg|thumb|The [[Boston Tea Party]] was an important example of boycotting against England |253x253px]]\nThe chase for a fair consumption has deep roots in consumption history, starting for example with the [[American Revolution]]. Sympathizers of the American cause, in those years, refused to buy English goods, to support colons rebellion. This act of conscious choice can be seen as the beginning of both critical and political consumption. Traces of these two concepts can be found at the turn of the nineteenth century, in the [[United States]], where the [[National Consumers League|National Consumer League]] promoted the so-called \u201c[[Whitelist]]s\u201d, in which all the companies that treated fairly their employees were listed.\n\nAt the end of the century, also the first forms of political activism in consumption took place in the United States and Europe, like the \u201cDont Buy Jewish\u201d boycotts. Several organizations were born in those times and in the following centuries, asking the consumers to join the mobilizations as active subjects.\n\nA variety of discourses about the \u201cduty\u201d and the \u201cresponsibilities\u201d of social actors arose after the 1999 [[World Trade Organization]] protests in [[Seattle]]. People were explicitly asked to think that to shop is to vote.<ref>[http://users2.unimi.it/rsassatelli/wp-content/uploads/Sassatelli-Critical-consumerism-BrewerTrentmann-2006.pdf Sassatelli, R. (2006) Virtue, Responsibility and Consumer Choice. Framing Critical Consumerism, 219]</ref>\n\n== Boycotting and \"Buycotting\" ==\n[[Boycott]]ing and \"buycotting\" ([[Anti-boycott]]), as a particularly self-conscious form of consumption, are expressions of an individual\u2019s political, ethical or environmental stance. Both boycotting and \"buycotting\" are discrete acts of critical consumption and they are mutually contingent. In fact, if the use-value or utility of a product is important, then it is difficult to view them as separate actions.\n[[File:La2-buynothing.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Buy Nothing Day|Buy Nothing Day (BND)]] demonstration in San Francisco, November 2000]]\n'''Boycotting''' refers to abstaining from buying, avoiding specific products or brands to punish companies for undesirable policies or business practices. \"'''Buycotting'''\" is a term coined by Friedman (1996); it refers to \u201cpositive buying\u201d that aims to foster corporations that represent values \u2013 fair trade, environmentalism, sustainable development \u2013 that consumers choose to support.\n\nWhen one boycotts a product or service, it does not mean that he abstains from consuming at all, but that he may select an alternative product or service. Equally, a choice to \"buycott\" could be understood as including a rejection or boycott of the non-ethical alternative. This interdependence is useful to explain the traditional pairing of boycotting and \"buycotting\" in much analysis of consumer politics.\n\nOne of the rising types of boycotting is the ad hoc one, which underlines the importance of consumers as political subjects. These initiatives show that critical consumption is really impacting in special occasions, gaining much more visibility than everyday boycotts. An example of this type of events is the [[Buy Nothing Day|Buy Nothing Day (BND)]].\n\n== Sustainability ==\nThe notion of [[sustainability]] has both a temporal dimension demonstrated by the trade-off between present and future generations, and a justice dimension which considers the different distribution of harm and benefit.<ref>Gamborg, C., &Sand\u00f8e, P. (2005a). Applying the notion of sustainability\u2014Dilemmas and the need for dialogue. In S. Holm & J. Gunning (Eds.), Ethics, Law and Society (pp. 123\u2013130). Hants: Ashgate.</ref> Under the term sustainability, notions of sustainable [[resource consumption]] by [[recycling]], [[environmental protection]], [[animal welfare]], [[social justice]], and climate responsibilities are gathered.<ref>Gamborg, C., &Sand\u00f8e, P. (2005b). Sustainability in farm animal breeding. A review. Animal Production Science, 92(3), 221\u2013231.</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nAlthough the \"good\" purposes of critical consumerism there are some critics and pitfalls connected to this practice of consumption: \n* [[Fair trade]] protocols invite to respect all the communities and their cultures, workers\u2019 rights and so on. At the same time, however, it appears as a hegemonic tool to impose a western culture of which the right standards must be.\n* It requires a huge production of green and ethical products, but it is difficult to realize in the small-scale local production.\n* People live in an asymmetrical world in terms of information. They take decisions just with the use of few elements.\n* \u201cA \u2018paradox of sustainability\u2019 arises because more substantive approaches to sustainability may be too complex to effectively motivate appropriate social responses.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/23760319/Agricultural_sustainability_what_it_is_and_what_it_is_not Thompson, P.

People who don\u2019t care about ethical consumption will keep on buying products they like, not depending on political consumption.<ref>[http://www.persee.fr/doc/assr_0335-5985_1992_num_80_1_1564_t1_0249_0000_3 De Certeau, M.

Newholm (2002). \"Voluntary Simplicity and the Ethics of Consumption.\" Psychology and Marketing 19(2): 167-185.]</ref> even though single individuals take decisions and choices, political consumption can also be seen as a mass phenomenon.

The campaign started on December 5, 1955 - when [[Rosa Parks]], an African American woman, was arrested for refusing to leave her seat to a white person. After that episode, boycotters organized a system of carpools, with car owners volunteering their vehicles or themselves driving people to various destinations.\n* A well-known effective boycott took place against [[Nestl\u00e9]] (1977\u201384) for its marketing campaign of breast milk substitute or infant formula, in the third world. This boycott mobilized consumers on a global-scale and it brought Nestl\u00e8 to the [[World Health Organization]] and United Nations International Children Emergency Fund ([[UNICEF]]) negotiating table.

International Political Science review]</ref>\n\n== Historical Background ==\n\n[[File:Boston Tea Party.jpg|thumb|The [[Boston Tea Party]] was an important example of boycotting against England |253x253px]]\nThe chase for a fair consumption has deep roots in consumption history, starting for example with the [[American Revolution]]. Sympathizers of the American cause, in those years, refused to buy English goods, to support colons rebellion. This act of conscious choice can be seen as the beginning of both critical and political consumption. Traces of these two concepts can be found at the turn of the nineteenth century, in the [[United States]], where the [[National Consumers League|National Consumer League]] promoted the so-called \u201c[[Whitelist]]s\u201d, in which all the companies that treated fairly their employees were listed.\n\nAt the end of the century, also the first forms of political activism in consumption took place in the United States and Europe, like the \u201cDont Buy Jewish\u201d boycotts. Several organizations were born in those times and in the following centuries, asking the consumers to join the mobilizations as active subjects.\n\nA variety of discourses about the \u201cduty\u201d and the \u201cresponsibilities\u201d of social actors arose after the 1999 [[World Trade Organization]] protests in [[Seattle]]. People were explicitly asked to think that to shop is to vote.<ref>[http://users2.unimi.it/rsassatelli/wp-content/uploads/Sassatelli-Critical-consumerism-BrewerTrentmann-2006.pdf Sassatelli, R. (2006) Virtue, Responsibility and Consumer Choice. Framing Critical Consumerism, 219]</ref>\n\n== Boycotting and \"Buycotting\" ==\n[[Boycott]]ing and \"buycotting\" ([[Anti-boycott]]), as a particularly self-conscious form of consumption, are expressions of an individual\u2019s political, ethical or environmental stance. Both boycotting and \"buycotting\" are discrete acts of critical consumption and they are mutually contingent. In fact, if the use-value or utility of a product is important, then it is difficult to view them as separate actions.\n[[File:La2-buynothing.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Buy Nothing Day|Buy Nothing Day (BND)]] demonstration in San Francisco, November 2000]]\n'''Boycotting''' refers to abstaining from buying, avoiding specific products or brands to punish companies for undesirable policies or business practices. \"'''Buycotting'''\" is a term coined by Friedman (1996); it refers to \u201cpositive buying\u201d that aims to foster corporations that represent values \u2013 fair trade, environmentalism, sustainable development \u2013 that consumers choose to support.\n\nWhen one boycotts a product or service, it does not mean that he abstains from consuming at all, but that he may select an alternative product or service. Equally, a choice to \"buycott\" could be understood as including a rejection or boycott of the non-ethical alternative. This interdependence is useful to explain the traditional pairing of boycotting and \"buycotting\" in much analysis of consumer politics.\n\nOne of the rising types of boycotting is the ad hoc one, which underlines the importance of consumers as political subjects. These initiatives show that critical consumption is really impacting in special occasions, gaining much more visibility than everyday boycotts. An example of this type of events is the [[Buy Nothing Day|Buy Nothing Day (BND)]].\n\n== Sustainability ==\nThe notion of [[sustainability]] has both a temporal dimension demonstrated by the trade-off between present and future generations, and a justice dimension which considers the different distribution of harm and benefit.<ref>Gamborg, C., &Sand\u00f8e, P. (2005a). Applying the notion of sustainability\u2014Dilemmas and the need for dialogue. In S. Holm & J. Gunning (Eds.), Ethics, Law and Society (pp. 123\u2013130). Hants: Ashgate.</ref> Under the term sustainability, notions of sustainable [[resource consumption]] by [[recycling]], [[environmental protection]], [[animal welfare]], [[social justice]], and climate responsibilities are gathered.<ref>Gamborg, C., &Sand\u00f8e, P. (2005b). Sustainability in farm animal breeding. A review. Animal Production Science, 92(3), 221\u2013231.</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nAlthough the \"good\" purposes of critical consumerism there are some critics and pitfalls connected to this practice of consumption: \n* [[Fair trade]] protocols invite to respect all the communities and their cultures, workers\u2019 rights and so on. At the same time, however, it appears as a hegemonic tool to impose a western culture of which the right standards must be.\n* It requires a huge production of green and ethical products, but it is difficult to realize in the small-scale local production.\n* People live in an asymmetrical world in terms of information. They take decisions just with the use of few elements.\n* \u201cA \u2018paradox of sustainability\u2019 arises because more substantive approaches to sustainability may be too complex to effectively motivate appropriate social responses.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/23760319/Agricultural_sustainability_what_it_is_and_what_it_is_not Thompson, P.

People who don\u2019t care about ethical consumption will keep on buying products they like, not depending on political consumption.<ref>[http://www.persee.fr/doc/assr_0335-5985_1992_num_80_1_1564_t1_0249_0000_3 De Certeau, M.

The campaign started on December 5, 1955 - when [[Rosa Parks]], an African American woman, was arrested for refusing to leave her seat to a white person. After that episode, boycotters organized a system of carpools, with car owners volunteering their vehicles or themselves driving people to various destinations.\n* A well-known effective boycott took place against [[Nestl\u00e9]] (1977\u201384) for its marketing campaign of breast milk substitute or infant formula, in the third world. This boycott mobilized consumers on a global-scale and it brought Nestl\u00e8 to the [[World Health Organization]] and United Nations International Children Emergency Fund ([[UNICEF]]) negotiating table. In 1981, the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes was adopted. However, political consumerist groups were not satisfied with the Code implementation and reinstated the boycott in 1988.<ref>Bar-Yam, Naomi Bromberg (1995). \"The Nestle Boycott: The Story of the WHO/UNICEF Code for Marketing Breastmilk Substitutes,\" Mothering (winter): 56-63.</ref>\n* [[Nike, Inc.|Nike inc.]] has been accused for many years of exploiting children labour to produce [[footwear]] and [[apparel]], even though the company has always denied such charge.
