He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvnb|Black|2007|p=735}}.</ref> His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are still widely read today.<ref>{{harvnb|Mazzeno|2008|p=76}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chesterton|2005|pp=100\u2013126}}.</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Portsmouth]], Dickens left school to work in a factory when [[John Dickens|his father]] was incarcerated in a [[debtors' prison]]. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five [[novellas]], hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed [[Penny reading|readings]] extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.\n\nDickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the [[serial (literature)|serial]] publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.<ref name=\"Grossman 2012 54\">{{harvnb|Grossman|2012|p=54}}</ref><ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\">{{harvnb|Lodge|2002|p=118}}.</ref> [[Cliffhanger]] endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.<ref name=\"NewYorker\">{{cite magazine|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|magazine=The New Yorker|date=2 December 2017}}</ref> The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.<ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\"/> For example, when his wife's [[chiropodist]] expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|pp=46\u201347}}.</ref> His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|1987|pp=267\u2013268}}.</ref> Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|ha'pennies]] to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=116}}.</ref>\n\nHis 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.<ref name=\"Garratt\"/> Dickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers\u2014from [[Leo Tolstoy]] to [[George Orwell]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], and [[Tom Wolfe]]\u2014for his [[Realism (arts)|realism]], comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and [[Child labour#Historical|social criticism]]. However, [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henry James]], and [[Virginia Woolf]] complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of sentimentalism.\n\nThe term ''Dickensian'' is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Dickensian \"Oxford Dictionaries&nbsp;\u2013 Dickensian\"].

His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy\".<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nCharles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the [[picaresque novel]]s of [[Tobias Smollett]] and [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[Gil Blas]]''.

His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.<ref>{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=11}}.</ref> Roylance was \"a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few alterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs Pipchin\" in ''Dombey and Son''.

To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's [[shoe polish|Blacking]] Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present [[Charing Cross railway station]], where he earned six [[shilling]]s a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age\".<ref name=Foster23/> As he recalled to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]] (from ''The Life of Charles Dickens''):\n\n<blockquote>The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.<ref name=Foster23>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of [[Covent Garden]] the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and watched them at work\u2014in Dickens biographer [[Simon Callow]]'s estimation, the public display was \"a new refinement added to his misery\".<ref name=Callow2009p25>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Courtyard of the former Marshalsea prison, 1897 (2).png|upright|thumb|The [[Marshalsea]] around 1897, after it had closed. Dickens based several of his characters on the experience of seeing his father in the debtors' prison, most notably [[Little Dorrit|Amy Dorrit]] from ''Little Dorrit''.]]\nA few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him \u00a3450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the [[Act of Parliament|Insolvent Debtors Act]], Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea,<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=157}}.</ref><!-- not for the bequest --> for the home of Mrs Roylance.\n\nCharles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: \"I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back\". His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=58}}.</ref>\n\nRighteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which [[working class|working-class]] people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most [[autobiographical novel|autobiographical, novel]], ''[[David Copperfield]]'':<ref>{{harvnb|Cain|2008|p=91}}.</ref> \"I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!\"<ref name = \"Wilson61\"/>\n\nDickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in [[Camden Town]], where he remained until March 1827, having spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good school: \"Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr Creakle's Establishment in ''David Copperfield''.\"<ref name = \"Wilson61\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=61}}.</ref>\n\nDickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, [[Gray's Inn]], as a junior [[law clerk|clerk]] from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers, and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively&mdash;he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every single day. His favourite actor was [[Charles Mathews]], and Dickens learnt his ''monopolylogues'', (farces in which Mathews played every character), by heart.<ref name=Callow2009p34>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|pp=34, 36}}</ref> Then, having learned [[Thomas Gurney (shorthand writer)|Gurney's]] system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at [[Doctors' Commons]], and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.<ref>{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=18}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=64}}.</ref> This education was to inform works such as ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'', ''Dombey and Son'', and especially ''Bleak House''&mdash;whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to \"go to law\".\n\nIn 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in ''David Copperfield''. Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1998|p=23}}.</ref>\n\n==Journalism and early novels==\n\nIn 1832, at age 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.<ref name=Callow2009p48>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=48}}</ref> He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame.

Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.<ref name=Tomalin1992p76>{{harvnb|Tomalin|1992|p=76}}</ref> In 1833, he submitted his first story, \"A Dinner at Poplar Walk\", to the London periodical ''[[Monthly Magazine]]''.<ref name = \"Patten(2001)16ff\">{{harvnb|Patten|2001|pp=16\u201318}}.</ref> William Barrow, a brother of his mother, offered him a job on ''The Mirror of Parliament'' and he worked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at [[Furnival's Inn]] and worked as a political journalist, reporting on [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]''. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: ''[[Sketches by Boz]]''\u2014Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp= 174\u2013176}}.</ref><ref name=\"Glancy 1999 6\">{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=6}}.</ref> Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname \"Moses\", which he had given to his youngest brother [[Augustus Dickens]], after a character in Oliver Goldsmith's ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''.

Hogarth invited Dickens to contribute ''Street Sketches'' and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house, excited by Hogarth's friendship with a hero of his, [[Walter Scott]], and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughters\u2014Georgina, Mary, and nineteen-year-old Catherine.<ref name=Callow2009p54>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=54}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Catherine Dickens.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Catherine Hogarth Dickens by [[Samuel Laurence|Samuel Lawrence]] (1838)]]\n\nDickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a friendship with [[William Harrison Ainsworth]], the author of the highwayman novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' (1834), whose bachelor salon in [[Harrow Road]] had become the meeting place for a set that included [[Daniel Maclise]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], and [[George Cruikshank]].

Seymour committed suicide after the second instalment, and Dickens, who wanted to write a connected series of sketches, hired \"[[Hablot Knight Browne|Phiz]]\" to provide the engravings (which were reduced from four to two per instalment) for the story. The resulting story became ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', and though the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the Cockney character [[Sam Weller (character)|Sam Weller]] in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity.<ref name=Callow2012p60>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=60}}</ref> The final instalment sold 40,000 copies.<ref name = \"Patten(2001)16ff\"/>\n\nIn November 1836, Dickens accepted the position of editor of ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]'', a position he held for three years, until he fell out with the owner.<ref>{{harvnb |Ackroyd|1990|pp= 201, 278\u2013279}}.</ref> In 1836 as he finished the last instalments of ''The Pickwick Papers'', he began writing the beginning instalments of ''[[Oliver Twist]]''\u2014writing as many as 90 pages a month\u2014while continuing work on ''Bentley's'' and also writing four plays, the production of which he oversaw.

He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and laughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=98}}.</ref>\n\nAfter living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1846\u201348). This and ''[[David Copperfield]]'' (1849\u201350) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.\n\nAt about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, [[Augustus Dickens|Augustus]], worked (John Chapman & Co.). It had been carried out by [[Thomas Powell (1809-1887)|Thomas Powell]], a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called ''The Living Authors of England'' with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (''[[Dombey and Son]]'') on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of the New York literary magazine ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications, and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co. to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moss|first1=Sidney P.|last2=Moss|first2=Carolyn J.|title=The Charles Dickens-Thomas Powell Vendetta|date=1996|publisher=The Whitston Publishing Company|location=Troy New York|pages=42\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett Coutts]], heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of [[Fallen woman|fallen women]] of the working class.

In 1836, in a pamphlet titled ''Sunday Under Three Heads'', he defended the people's right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays. \"Look into your churches- diminished congregations and scanty attendance.

''David Copperfield'' is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in ''Bleak House'' reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.<ref>{{harvnb|Polloczek|1999|p=133}}.</ref> Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in ''Little Dorrit'' resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=}}.</ref> Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in ''David Copperfield'' and Lucie Manette in ''A Tale of Two Cities.''<ref>{{harvnb|Slater|1983|pp=43, 47}}</ref>{{refn|Slater detects also Ellen Ternan in the portrayal of Lucie Manette.|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nDickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=653}}.</ref>\n\n===Episodic writing===\n[[File:Publicit\u00e9 pour Great Expectations dans All the Year Round.jpeg|thumb|right|225px|Advertisement for ''Great Expectations'', serialised in the weekly literary magazine ''[[All the Year Round]]'' from December 1860 to August 1861]]\nA pioneer of [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] fiction, most of Dickens's major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as ''Master Humphrey's Clock'' and ''Household Words'', later reprinted in book form.<ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\"/><ref name=\"Grossman 2012 54\"/> These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, and the series of regular [[cliffhanger]]s made each new episode widely anticipated.<ref name=\"NewYorker\"/> When ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in [[New York harbor]], shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=34}}.</ref> Dickens's talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.\n\n[[File:Charles Dickens, public reading, 1867.jpg|left|thumb|\"Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.\" Wood engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 7 December 1867]]\n\nAnother important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in ''The Old Curiosity Shop''), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in ''Oliver Twist''. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1983|pp=166\u2013169}}.</ref>\n\nDickens's serialisation of his novels was criticised by other authors. In Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]]'', there is a comment by Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship: \"See! They were writing up the log,\" said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. \"Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stevenson |first1=Robert Louis |title=The Novels and Tales of Robert Louis Stevenson: The Wrecker |date=1895 |publisher=Scribner\u2019s |page=245}}</ref>\n\n===Social commentary===\n[[File:Martin Chuzzlewit illus11.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nurse [[Sarah Gamp]] (left) from ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of [[Florence Nightingale]]]]\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of [[social commentary]]. He was a fierce critic of the poverty and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=345}}.</ref> Dickens's second novel, ''Oliver Twist'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Raina|1986|p=25}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bodenheimer|2011|p=147}}.</ref>\n\nAt a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues\u2014such as [[sanitation]] and the [[workhouse]]\u2014but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in ''Hard Times'' (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed \"Hands\" by the factory owners; that is, not really \"people\" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in ''The Pickwick Papers'' are claimed to have been influential in having the [[Fleet Prison]] shut down. [[Karl Marx]] asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\".<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\">{{harvnb|Kucich|Sadoff|2006|p=155}}.</ref> [[George Bernard Shaw]] even remarked that ''Great Expectations'' was more seditious than Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\" /> The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (''Bleak House'', 1853; ''Little Dorrit'', 1857; ''Our Mutual Friend'', 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual d\u00e9nouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|1990|p=48}}, citing [[Gillian Beer]]'s ''Darwin's Plots'' (1983, p.8).</ref>\n\n===Literary techniques===\n\n[[File:Bleakhouse1920c.jpg|thumb|[[Bleak House, Broadstairs|Bleak House]] (pictured in the 1920s) in [[Broadstairs]], Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels]]\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his [[caricature]]s and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by [[Oscar Wilde]]. \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears...of laughter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/boev1.html|title=Deconstructing Little Nell|last=Boev|first=Hristo|date=|website=The Victorian Web|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ellmann|1988|p=441}}: In conversation with [[Ada Leverson]].</ref> [[G.

Valerie Purton, in her book ''Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition'', sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \"sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes\", and that \"''Dombey and Son'' is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Purton |first=Valerie |title=Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition: Fielding, Richardson, Sterne, Goldsmith, Sheridan, Lamb |series=Anthem nineteenth century studies |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2012 |pages=xiii, 123 |isbn=978-0857284181}}</ref> The ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' online comments that, despite \"patches of emotional excess\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in ''A Christmas Carol'' (1843), \"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel |title=novel (literature) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Oliver Twist'' Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in ''Bleak House'' and Amy Dorrit in ''Little Dorrit''), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.<ref>{{harvnb|Marlow|1994|pp=149\u2013150}}.</ref> For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group.

He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvnb|Black|2007|p=735}}.</ref> His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are still widely read today.<ref>{{harvnb|Mazzeno|2008|p=76}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chesterton|2005|pp=100\u2013126}}.</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Portsmouth]], Dickens left school to work in a factory when [[John Dickens|his father]] was incarcerated in a [[debtors' prison]]. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five [[novellas]], hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed [[Penny reading|readings]] extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.\n\nDickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the [[serial (literature)|serial]] publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.<ref name=\"Grossman 2012 54\">{{harvnb|Grossman|2012|p=54}}</ref><ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\">{{harvnb|Lodge|2002|p=118}}.</ref> [[Cliffhanger]] endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.<ref name=\"NewYorker\">{{cite magazine|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|magazine=The New Yorker|date=2 December 2017}}</ref> The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.<ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\"/> For example, when his wife's [[chiropodist]] expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|pp=46\u201347}}.</ref> His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|1987|pp=267\u2013268}}.</ref> Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|ha'pennies]] to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=116}}.</ref>\n\nHis 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.<ref name=\"Garratt\"/> Dickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers\u2014from [[Leo Tolstoy]] to [[George Orwell]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], and [[Tom Wolfe]]\u2014for his [[Realism (arts)|realism]], comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and [[Child labour#Historical|social criticism]]. However, [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henry James]], and [[Virginia Woolf]] complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of sentimentalism.\n\nThe term ''Dickensian'' is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Dickensian \"Oxford Dictionaries&nbsp;\u2013 Dickensian\"].

His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,<ref name=West1999>{{cite journal |last=West |first=Gilian |title=Huffam and Son |journal=The Dickensian |volume=95 |number=447 |date=Spring 1999 |pages=5\u201318 |publisher=Dickens Fellowship}}</ref> rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1848).<ref name=West1999 />\n\nIn January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, [[Fitzrovia]].<ref name=Callow2012p5>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=5}}</ref> When Charles was four, they relocated to [[Sheerness]], and thence to [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]], Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy\".<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nCharles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the [[picaresque novel]]s of [[Tobias Smollett]] and [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[Gil Blas]]''. He read and reread ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' and the Collected Farces of [[Elizabeth Inchbald]].<ref name=Callow2012p7>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=7}}</ref> He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=22\u201324:29\u201330}}.</ref> His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a [[dame school]], and then at a school run by William Giles, a [[English Dissenters|dissenter]], in Chatham.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=41}}.</ref>\n[[File:Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=drawing|Illustration by Fred Bernard of Dickens at work in a shoe-blacking factory after his father had been sent to the [[Marshalsea]], published in the 1892 edition of Forster's ''Life of Dickens''<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=158}}.</ref>]]\n\nThis period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at [[Somerset House]], and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term of work) moved to [[Camden Town]] in London.<ref name=Callow2009p13>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=13}}</ref> The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts, and, living beyond his means,<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}:'recklessly improvident'.</ref> John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the [[Marshalsea]] [[debtors' prison]] in [[Southwark]], London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.<ref>{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=11}}.</ref> Roylance was \"a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few alterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs Pipchin\" in ''Dombey and Son''. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the [[Insolvency|Insolvent Court]], Archibald Russell, \"a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman... with a quiet old wife\" and lame son, in [[Lant Street]] in Southwark.<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=27}}.</ref> They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}.</ref>\n\nOn Sundays&mdash;with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]&mdash;he spent the day at the Marshalsea.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=53}}.</ref> Dickens later used the prison as a setting in ''[[Little Dorrit]]''. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's [[shoe polish|Blacking]] Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present [[Charing Cross railway station]], where he earned six [[shilling]]s a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age\".<ref name=Foster23/> As he recalled to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]] (from ''The Life of Charles Dickens''):\n\n<blockquote>The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots.

Of these, ''A Christmas Carol'' was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America.<ref>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|pp=146\u2013148}}</ref> The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane [[Ragged School]], caused Dickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and laughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=98}}.</ref>\n\nAfter living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1846\u201348). This and ''[[David Copperfield]]'' (1849\u201350) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.\n\nAt about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, [[Augustus Dickens|Augustus]], worked (John Chapman & Co.). It had been carried out by [[Thomas Powell (1809-1887)|Thomas Powell]], a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called ''The Living Authors of England'' with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (''[[Dombey and Son]]'') on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of the New York literary magazine ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications, and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co. to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moss|first1=Sidney P.|last2=Moss|first2=Carolyn J.|title=The Charles Dickens-Thomas Powell Vendetta|date=1996|publisher=The Whitston Publishing Company|location=Troy New York|pages=42\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett Coutts]], heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of [[Fallen woman|fallen women]] of the working class.

''David Copperfield'' is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in ''Bleak House'' reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.<ref>{{harvnb|Polloczek|1999|p=133}}.</ref> Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in ''Little Dorrit'' resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=}}.</ref> Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in ''David Copperfield'' and Lucie Manette in ''A Tale of Two Cities.''<ref>{{harvnb|Slater|1983|pp=43, 47}}</ref>{{refn|Slater detects also Ellen Ternan in the portrayal of Lucie Manette.|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nDickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=653}}.</ref>\n\n===Episodic writing===\n[[File:Publicit\u00e9 pour Great Expectations dans All the Year Round.jpeg|thumb|right|225px|Advertisement for ''Great Expectations'', serialised in the weekly literary magazine ''[[All the Year Round]]'' from December 1860 to August 1861]]\nA pioneer of [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] fiction, most of Dickens's major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as ''Master Humphrey's Clock'' and ''Household Words'', later reprinted in book form.<ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\"/><ref name=\"Grossman 2012 54\"/> These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, and the series of regular [[cliffhanger]]s made each new episode widely anticipated.<ref name=\"NewYorker\"/> When ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in [[New York harbor]], shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=34}}.</ref> Dickens's talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.\n\n[[File:Charles Dickens, public reading, 1867.jpg|left|thumb|\"Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.\" Wood engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 7 December 1867]]\n\nAnother important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in ''The Old Curiosity Shop''), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in ''Oliver Twist''. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1983|pp=166\u2013169}}.</ref>\n\nDickens's serialisation of his novels was criticised by other authors. In Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]]'', there is a comment by Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship: \"See! They were writing up the log,\" said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. \"Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stevenson |first1=Robert Louis |title=The Novels and Tales of Robert Louis Stevenson: The Wrecker |date=1895 |publisher=Scribner\u2019s |page=245}}</ref>\n\n===Social commentary===\n[[File:Martin Chuzzlewit illus11.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nurse [[Sarah Gamp]] (left) from ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of [[Florence Nightingale]]]]\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of [[social commentary]]. He was a fierce critic of the poverty and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=345}}.</ref> Dickens's second novel, ''Oliver Twist'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Raina|1986|p=25}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bodenheimer|2011|p=147}}.</ref>\n\nAt a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues\u2014such as [[sanitation]] and the [[workhouse]]\u2014but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in ''Hard Times'' (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed \"Hands\" by the factory owners; that is, not really \"people\" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in ''The Pickwick Papers'' are claimed to have been influential in having the [[Fleet Prison]] shut down. [[Karl Marx]] asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\".<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\">{{harvnb|Kucich|Sadoff|2006|p=155}}.</ref> [[George Bernard Shaw]] even remarked that ''Great Expectations'' was more seditious than Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\" /> The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (''Bleak House'', 1853; ''Little Dorrit'', 1857; ''Our Mutual Friend'', 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual d\u00e9nouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|1990|p=48}}, citing [[Gillian Beer]]'s ''Darwin's Plots'' (1983, p.8).</ref>\n\n===Literary techniques===\n\n[[File:Bleakhouse1920c.jpg|thumb|[[Bleak House, Broadstairs|Bleak House]] (pictured in the 1920s) in [[Broadstairs]], Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels]]\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his [[caricature]]s and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by [[Oscar Wilde]]. \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears...of laughter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/boev1.html|title=Deconstructing Little Nell|last=Boev|first=Hristo|date=|website=The Victorian Web|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ellmann|1988|p=441}}: In conversation with [[Ada Leverson]].</ref> [[G.

Valerie Purton, in her book ''Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition'', sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \"sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes\", and that \"''Dombey and Son'' is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Purton |first=Valerie |title=Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition: Fielding, Richardson, Sterne, Goldsmith, Sheridan, Lamb |series=Anthem nineteenth century studies |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2012 |pages=xiii, 123 |isbn=978-0857284181}}</ref> The ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' online comments that, despite \"patches of emotional excess\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in ''A Christmas Carol'' (1843), \"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel |title=novel (literature) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Oliver Twist'' Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in ''Bleak House'' and Amy Dorrit in ''Little Dorrit''), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.<ref>{{harvnb|Marlow|1994|pp=149\u2013150}}.</ref> For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group.
