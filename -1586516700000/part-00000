Beginning with ''[[Little Johnny Jones]]'' in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan wrote more than 50 shows and published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \"[[Over There]]\", \"[[Give My Regards to Broadway]]\", \"[[The Yankee Doodle Boy]]\" and \"[[You're a Grand Old Flag]]\". As a composer, he was one of the early members of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers ([[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers|ASCAP]]). He displayed remarkable theatrical longevity, appearing in films until the 1930s, and continuing to perform as a headline artist until 1940.\n\nKnown in the decade before World War I as \"the man who owned Broadway\", he is considered the father of American musical comedy.<ref name=Benjamin/> His life and music were depicted in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942) and the 1968 musical ''[[George M!]]''.

Cohan opposed the strike because in addition to being an actor in his productions, he was also the producer of the musical that set the terms and conditions of the actors' employment. During the strike, he donated $100,000 to finance the Actors' Retirement Fund in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. After Actors' Equity was recognized, Cohan refused to join the union as an actor, which hampered his ability to appear in his own productions. Cohan sought a waiver from Equity allowing him to act in any theatrical production. In 1930, Cohan won a law case against the [[Internal Revenue Service]] that allowed the deduction, for federal income tax purposes, of his business travel and entertainment expenses, even though he was not able to document them with certainty.

Cohan opposed the strike because in addition to being an actor in his productions, he was also the producer of the musical that set the terms and conditions of the actors' employment. During the strike, he donated $100,000 to finance the Actors' Retirement Fund in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. After Actors' Equity was recognized, Cohan refused to join the union as an actor, which hampered his ability to appear in his own productions. Cohan sought a waiver from Equity allowing him to act in any theatrical production. In 1930, Cohan won a law case against the [[Internal Revenue Service]] that allowed the deduction, for federal income tax purposes, of his business travel and entertainment expenses, even though he was not able to document them with certainty.

The first was in Alma Street, which closed in 1855 and is now a primary school. The second, at Skinner Street, started in 1852 and was operating until 1899, when this cemetery was already open. Burials were transferred by families from earlier cemeteries to here, including [[Mary Anne Morrell]] who died in 1832. Hers is one of the oldest gravestones and was moved here from Alma Street by her family in 1915. In 1930 ninety other gravestones were moved from Skinner Street to here. The Skinner Street cemetery is now the location of the Oval belonging to the [[John Curtin College of the Arts]], where it is estimated 200 bodies still remain.<ref name=hcwa>{{cite web | url = http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Content/PdfLoader.aspx?id=aa1038ca-2aec-4868-bd08-7f8aeef63737&type=assessment | title = Assessment Documentation - John Curtin College of the Arts | accessdate = 26 Aug 2013 | date = 23 Nov 2001 | format = pdf | work = Register of Historic Places | publisher = Heritage Council of Western Australia | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020420/http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Content/PdfLoader.aspx?id=aa1038ca-2aec-4868-bd08-7f8aeef63737&type=assessment | archivedate = 3 December 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Over 40,000 burials have taken place at this cemetery.<ref name=walk/>\n\nFor its first sixty years the cemetery was dedicated to burials but in 1959 a crematorium was opened here which allowed an alternative to those who preferred it.

The screenplay by [[William Broyles Jr.]] and [[Al Reinert]] dramatizes the aborted 1970 [[Apollo 13]] lunar mission and is an adaptation of the book ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]]'' by astronaut [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Jeffrey Kluger]]. The film depicts [[astronaut]]s Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] aboard Apollo 13 for America's third Moon landing mission. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power, forcing [[NASA]]'s flight controllers to abort the [[Moon landing]], and turning the mission into a struggle to get the three men home safely.\n\nHoward went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing [[NASA]]'s technical assistance in astronaut and flight controller training for his cast, and obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a [[reduced gravity aircraft]] for realistic depiction of the \"[[Free fall|weightlessness]]\" experienced by the astronauts in space.\n\nReleased to cinemas in the United States on June 30, 1995,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=apollo13.htm|title=Apollo 13|website=Box Office Mojo|language=English|date=30 June 1995|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> ''Apollo 13'' was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (winning for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]).<ref name=\"Oscar\">{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org|title=Academy Awards, USA: 1996|publisher=awardsdatabase.oscars.org|accessdate=8 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723203650/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/|archivedate=July 23, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In total, the film grossed over $355&nbsp;million worldwide during its theatrical releases.

Afterwards Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on [[Apollo 8]] in December, 1968, tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon to walk on its surface.\n\nThree months later, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's [[Vertical Assembly Building]], his boss [[Deke Slayton]] informs him that because of problems with [[Alan Shepard]]'s crew, his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of [[Apollo 14|14]]. Lovell, [[Ken Mattingly]], and [[Fred W. Haise, Jr.|Fred Haise]] train for their new mission. A few days before launch, Mattingly is exposed to [[rubella|German Measles]], and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, [[Jack Swigert]]. Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband getting killed in space, but goes to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] the night before launch to see him off.\n\nOn April 11, 1970, Flight Director [[Eugene F. Kranz|Gene Kranz]] gives the go-ahead from Houston's [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] for the Apollo 13 launch. As the [[Saturn V]] rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage fires to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the [[transposition, docking, and extraction|maneuver]] to connect the [[Apollo command module|command module]] ''Odyssey'' to the [[Lunar Module]] ''Aquarius'' and pull it away from the spent rocket.\n\nThree days into the mission, the crew makes a television transmission, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert turns on the [[liquid oxygen]] tank stirring fans as requested, one of the tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. They attempt to stop the leak by shutting off fuel cells #1 and #3, but to no avail. With the fuel cells closed, the Moon landing must be aborted, and Lovell and Haise must hurriedly power up ''Aquarius'' to use as a \"lifeboat\" for the return home, as Swigert shuts down ''Odyssey'' before its battery power runs out. In Houston, Kranz rallies his team to come up with a plan to bring the astronauts home safely, declaring \"failure is not an option\". Controller [[John Aaron]] recruits Mattingly to help him invent a procedure to restart ''Odyssey'' for the landing on Earth.\n\nAs Swigert and Haise watch the Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost chance of walking on its surface, then turns their attention to the business of getting home. With ''Aquarius'' running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffers freezing conditions, and Haise contracts a urinary infection and resulting fever. Swigert suspects Mission Control is withholding their inability to get them home; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly squelches the argument. When [[carbon dioxide]] approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way to make the command module's [[Square peg in a round hole#Literal cases|square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles]]. With the guidance systems on ''Aquarius'' shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine.\n\nMattingly and Aaron struggle to find a way to turn on the command module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts ''Odyssey'' by transferring extra power from ''Aquarius''. When the crew jettisons the service module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. As they release ''Aquarius'' and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no one is sure that ''Odyssey''{{'}}s [[ablative heat shield|heat shield]] is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to [[ionization blackout]] is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAs helicopters bring the three men aboard the recovery ship [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']] for a hero's welcome, Lovell's voice-over describes the subsequent investigation into the explosion, and the careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, and Kranz. He wonders if and when mankind will return to the Moon.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 100\n| footer    = \n| image1    = Tom Hanks 2016.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Kevin Bacon SDCC 2014.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = \n| image3    = Bill Paxton 2014.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Hanks, Bacon and Paxton portray the astronauts Lovell, Swigert and Haise respectively.\n}}\n'''Apollo Flight Crew:'''\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Apollo 13 Commander [[Jim Lovell]]: Jim Lovell stated that before his book ''[[Lost Moon]]'' was even written, the movie rights were being shopped to potential buyers<ref name=\"lost moon\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tomhanks-online.com/media/video/detail/420/apollo-13-making-of | title=Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13 | accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> and that his first reaction was that [[Kevin Costner]] would be a good choice to play him.<ref name=\"lost moon\" /><ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\">{{cite video | title = Apollo 13: 2-Disc Anniversary Edition (Disc 1), Special Features: Commentary track by Jim and Marilyn Lovell | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Universal Studios]]  | date=19 April 2005}}</ref> However, by the time Howard acquired the director's position, Costner's name never came up in serious discussion, and Hanks had already been interested in doing a film based on Apollo 13.

Two individual Lunar Modules and two command modules were constructed for filming. While each was a replica, composed of some of the original Apollo materials, they were built so that different sections were removable, which enabled filming to take place inside the capsules. Space Works also built modified Command and Lunar Modules for filming inside a [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|Boeing KC-135]] [[reduced gravity aircraft|reduced-gravity aircraft]], and the pressure suits worn by the actors, which are exact reproductions of those worn by the Apollo astronauts, right down to the detail of being airtight.

It is far and away the best thing Mr. Howard has done (and ''[[Far and Away]]'' was one of the other kind).\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE0D7123FF933A05755C0A963958260 |date=June 30, 1995 |first=Janet|last=Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|title=''Apollo 13'', a Movie for the Fourth of July |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}</ref> The academic critic Raymond Malewitz focuses on the DIY aspects of the \"mailbox\" filtration system to illustrate the emergence of an unlikely hero in late 20th-century American culture\u2014\"the creative, improvisational, but restrained thinker\u2014who replaces the older prodigal cowboy heroes of American mythology and provides the country a better, more frugal example of an appropriate 'husband'.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://stanfordpress.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/getting-rugged-with-thing-theory.html |date=September 5, 2014 |first=Raymond|last=Malewitz|title=getting Rugged With Thing Theory |publisher=Stanford UP |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMarilyn Lovell praised Quinlan's portrayal of her, stating she felt she could feel what Quinlan's character was going through, and remembered how she felt in her mind.<ref name=\"lost moon\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n\nA 10th-anniversary [[DVD]] of the film was released in 2005; it included both the theatrical version and the IMAX version, along with several extras.<ref name=\"DVDInfo\" >{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00371QQ2U|title=Apollo 13 Blu-Ray Release|publisher=[[Universal Studios]]|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref>  The IMAX version has a 1.66:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://lethlib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/306209031|title= Apollo 13 (DVD - 2005)  | publisher= [[Lethbridge Public Library]]|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, ''Apollo 13'' was released on [[HD DVD]] and on April 13, 2010 it was released on [[Blu-ray disc]] as the 15th-anniversary edition on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 13 accident.<ref name=\"DVDInfo\"/> The Film was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on October 17, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultrahd.highdefdigest.com/48734/apollo134kultrahdbluray.html|title=Apollo 13 - 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Ultra HD Review {{!}} High Def Digest|website=ultrahd.highdefdigest.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n!

In reality, the crew heard the bang 93 seconds later.<ref name=\"timeline\">[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_13h_Timeline.htm Apollo 13 Timeline], ''Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference'', NASA History Series, Office of Policy and Plans, Richard W.

Stabilization control system electrical disturbance indicated a power transient. 055:53:20.\"</ref>\n\nThe film portrays the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle being rolled out to the launch pad two days before launch. In reality, the launch vehicle was rolled out on the [[Mobile launcher platform#Saturn V and Space Shuttle|Mobile Launcher]] using the [[crawler-transporter]] weeks before the launch date.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe movie depicts Swigert and Haise arguing about who was at fault.  The show ''The Real Story: Apollo 13'' broadcast on the Smithsonian Channel includes Haise stating that no such argument took place and that there was no way anyone could have foreseen that stirring the tank would cause problems.<ref>[http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/the-real-story/apollo-13/679/141246 ''The Real Story: Apollo 13''], Season 4, Episode 3, 2012.  See this section beginning at 15:18.</ref>\n\nThe dialogue between ground control and the astronauts was taken nearly verbatim from transcripts and recordings, with the exception of one of the taglines of the film, \"[[Houston, we have a problem]].\" (This quote was voted #50 on the list \"[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]]\".) According to the mission transcript, the actual words uttered by Jack Swigert were \"Hey, we've got a problem here\" (talking over Haise, who had started \"Okay, Houston\"). Ground control responded by saying \"This is Houston, say again please.\" Jim Lovell then repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS13_PAO.PDF|title=Page 231 of Apollo 13's transcript at NASA Johnson Space Center|accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne other incorrect dialogue is after the re-entry blackout. In the movie, Tom Hanks (as Lovell) says \"Hello Houston... this is ''Odyssey''... it's good to see you again.\" In the actual re-entry, the Command Module's transmission was finally acquired by a [[Sikorsky SH-3D Sea King]] recovery helicopter which then relayed communications to Mission Control. CAPCOM and fellow astronaut [[Joe Kerwin]] (not Mattingly, who serves as CAPCOM in this scene in the movie) then made a call to the spacecraft \"Odyssey, Houston standing by. Over.\" Jack Swigert, not Lovell, replied \"Okay, Joe,\" and unlike in the movie, this was well before the parachutes deployed; the celebrations depicted at Mission Control were triggered by visual confirmation of their deployment.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://apollo13.spacelog.org/05:22:46:03/#log-line-513963|title=Apollo 13's re-entry transcript on Spacelog}}</ref>\n\nThe tagline \"Failure is not an option\", stated in the film by Gene Kranz, also became very popular, but was not taken from the historical transcripts. The following story relates the origin of the phrase, from an e-mail by Apollo 13 [[Flight Dynamics Officer]] Jerry Bostick:\n<blockquote>As far as the expression \"Failure is not an option,\" you are correct that Kranz never used that term. In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on \"What are the people in Mission Control really like?\" One of their questions was \"Weren't there times when everybody, or at least a few people, just panicked?\" My answer was \"No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.\" I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, \"That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now we just have to figure out who to have say it.\" Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceacts.com/notanoption.htm|title=Origin of Apollo 13 Quote: \"Failure Is Not an Option.\"|publisher=SPACEACTS.COM|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the film, Flight Director Gene Kranz and his White Team are portrayed as managing all of the essential parts of the flight, from liftoff to landing.  Consequently, the actual role of the other flight directors and teams, especially Glynn Lunney and his Black Team, were neglected.  In fact, it was Flight Director Lunney and his Black Team who got Apollo 13 through its most critical period in the hours immediately after the explosion, including the mid-course correction that sent Apollo 13 on a \"free return\" trajectory around the Moon and back to the Earth.  Astronaut Ken Mattingly, who was replaced as Apollo 13 Command Module Pilot at the last minute by Jack Swigert, later said:\n<blockquote>If there was a hero, Glynn Lunney was, by himself, a hero, because when he walked in the room, I guarantee you, nobody knew what the hell was going on.  Glynn walked in, took over this mess, and he just brought calm to the situation.  I've never seen such an extraordinary example of leadership in my entire career.  Absolutely magnificent.  No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night.  He and he alone brought all of the scared people together.  And you've got to remember that the flight controllers in those days were\u2014they were kids in their thirties.  They were good, but very few of them had ever run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren't used to that.  All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken.  They were faced with things that they didn't understand, and Glynn walked in there, and he just kind of took charge.<ref>Ken Mattingly, quoted in Go, Flight! The Unsung Heroes of Mission Control, 1965-1992, Rick Houston and Milt Heflin, 2015, University of Nebraska Press, p. 221</ref></blockquote>\n\nA [[Audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary track]], recorded by Jim and Marilyn Lovell and included with both DVD versions,<ref name=\"DVDInfo\" /> mentions several inaccuracies included in the film, all done for reasons of [[artistic license]]:\n{{Quote box|quote=We were working and watching the controls during that time.

Lovell points out in his commentary that Mattingly was a composite of several astronauts and engineers\u2014including [[Charles Duke]] (whose rubella led to Mattingly's grounding)\u2014all of whom played a role in solving that problem.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>\n* When Jack Swigert is getting ready to dock with the LM, a concerned NASA technician says: \"If Swigert can't dock this thing, we don't have a mission.\" Lovell and Haise also seem worried. In his DVD commentary, the real Jim Lovell says that if Swigert had been unable to dock with the LM, he or Haise could have done it. He also says that Swigert was a well-trained Command Module Pilot and that no one was really worried about whether he was up to the job,<ref name=\"nytlovell\"/> but he admitted that it made a nice subplot for the film. What the astronauts were really worried about, Lovell says, was the expected rendezvous between the Lunar Module and the Command Module after Lovell and Haise left the surface of the Moon.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>\n* A scene set the night before the launch, showing the astronauts' family members saying their goodbyes while separated by a road, to reduce the possibility of any last-minute [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of disease, depicted a tradition that did not begin until the [[Space Shuttle program]].<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>\n* The film depicts Marilyn Lovell dropping her wedding ring down a shower drain. According to Jim Lovell, this did occur,<ref name=\"nytlovell\"/> but the drain trap caught the ring and his wife was able to retrieve it.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>  Lovell has also confirmed that the scene in which his wife had a nightmare about him being \"sucked through an open door of a spacecraft into outer space\" also occurred, though he believes the nightmare was prompted by her seeing a scene in ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film they saw three months before Apollo 13 launched.<ref name=\"nytlovell\">{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/garden/at-the-movies-with-jim-lovell-in-space-no-room-for-fear.html | first=Lena | last= William | date= 19 July 1995 | title= In Space, No Room For Fear | newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= 30 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', a 1998 docudrama mini-series based around the Apollo missions\n* ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', a 2013 film about astronauts stranded in Earth orbit\n* [[Survival film]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Include-NASA}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Apollo 13 (film)}}\n{{wikiquotepar|Apollo 13|the film Apollo&nbsp;13}}\n* {{IMDb title|0112384|Apollo 13}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|67523|Apollo 13}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|134963|Apollo 13}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|apollo_13|Apollo 13}}\n* {{Mojo title|apollo13|Apollo 13}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Awards for ''Apollo 13''\n|list=\n{{Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture}}\n{{ScreenActorsGuildAward CastMotionPicture 1995\u20132000}}\n}}\n{{Ron Howard}}\n{{Brian Grazer}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Solar System|Space|Spaceflight|Film}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 soundtracks]]\n[[Category:1990s drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s historical films]]\n[[Category:Adventure films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:American aviation films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American historical films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:American survival films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (films)]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films about astronauts]]\n[[Category:Films about NASA]]\n[[Category:Films about the Apollo program]]\n[[Category:Films about space hazards]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ron Howard]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Brian Grazer]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1969]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1970]]\n[[Category:Films set in Florida]]\n[[Category:Films set in Houston]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Houston]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Sound Mixing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose editor won the Best Film Editing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Imagine Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:IMAX films]]\n[[Category:MCA Records soundtracks]]\n[[Category:Science docudramas]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Apollo 13]]\n[[Category:Jim Lovell]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1970s]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1995 film by Ron Howard}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Apollo 13\n| image          = Apollo thirteen movie.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| alt            = A thin light-gray crescent Moon stretches diagonally from lower left to upper right against a black background, with a blue and white crescent Earth in the far distance.

The screenplay by [[William Broyles Jr.]] and [[Al Reinert]] dramatizes the aborted 1970 [[Apollo 13]] lunar mission and is an adaptation of the book ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]]'' by astronaut [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Jeffrey Kluger]]. The film depicts [[astronaut]]s Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] aboard Apollo 13 for America's third Moon landing mission. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power, forcing [[NASA]]'s flight controllers to abort the [[Moon landing]], and turning the mission into a struggle to get the three men home safely.\n\nHoward went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing [[NASA]]'s technical assistance in astronaut and flight controller training for his cast, and obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a [[reduced gravity aircraft]] for realistic depiction of the \"[[Free fall|weightlessness]]\" experienced by the astronauts in space.\n\nReleased to cinemas in the United States on June 30, 1995,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=apollo13.htm|title=Apollo 13|website=Box Office Mojo|language=English|date=30 June 1995|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> ''Apollo 13'' was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (winning for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]).<ref name=\"Oscar\">{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org|title=Academy Awards, USA: 1996|publisher=awardsdatabase.oscars.org|accessdate=8 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723203650/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/|archivedate=July 23, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In total, the film grossed over $355 million worldwide during its theatrical releases. The film was very positively received by critics.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\nIn July 1969, astronaut [[Jim Lovell]] hosts a [[house party]] where guests watch [[Neil Armstrong]]'s televised first human steps on the Moon. Afterwards Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on [[Apollo 8]] in December, 1968, tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon to walk on its surface.\n\nThree months later, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's [[Vertical Assembly Building]], his boss [[Deke Slayton]] informs him that because of problems with [[Alan Shepard]]'s crew, his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of [[Apollo 14|14]]. Lovell, [[Ken Mattingly]], and [[Fred W. Haise, Jr.|Fred Haise]] train for their new mission. A few days before launch, Mattingly is exposed to [[rubella|German Measles]], and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, [[Jack Swigert]]. Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband getting killed in space, but goes to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] the night before launch to see him off.\n\nOn April 11, 1970, Flight Director [[Eugene F. Kranz|Gene Kranz]] gives the go-ahead from Houston's [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] for the Apollo 13 launch. As the [[Saturn V]] rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage fires to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the [[transposition, docking, and extraction|maneuver]] to connect the [[Apollo command module|command module]] ''Odyssey'' to the [[Lunar Module]] ''Aquarius'' and pull it away from the spent rocket.\n\nThree days into the mission, the crew makes a television transmission, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert turns on the [[liquid oxygen]] tank stirring fans as requested, one of the tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. They attempt to stop the leak by shutting off fuel cells #1 and #3, but to no avail. With the fuel cells closed, the Moon landing must be aborted, and Lovell and Haise must hurriedly power up ''Aquarius'' to use as a \"lifeboat\" for the return home, as Swigert shuts down ''Odyssey'' before its battery power runs out. In Houston, Kranz rallies his team to come up with a plan to bring the astronauts home safely, declaring \"failure is not an option\". Controller [[John Aaron]] recruits Mattingly to help him invent a procedure to restart ''Odyssey'' for the landing on Earth.\n\nAs Swigert and Haise watch the Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost chance of walking on its surface, then turns their attention to the business of getting home. With ''Aquarius'' running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffers freezing conditions, and Haise contracts a urinary infection and resulting fever. Swigert suspects Mission Control is withholding their inability to get them home; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly squelches the argument. When [[carbon dioxide]] approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way to make the command module's [[Square peg in a round hole#Literal cases|square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles]]. With the guidance systems on ''Aquarius'' shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine.\n\nMattingly and Aaron struggle to find a way to turn on the command module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts ''Odyssey'' by transferring extra power from ''Aquarius''. When the crew jettisons the service module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. As they release ''Aquarius'' and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no one is sure that ''Odyssey''{{'}}s [[ablative heat shield|heat shield]] is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to [[ionization blackout]] is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAs helicopters bring the three men aboard the recovery ship [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']] for a hero's welcome, Lovell's voice-over describes the subsequent investigation into the explosion, and the careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, and Kranz. He wonders if and when mankind will return to the Moon.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 100\n| footer    = \n| image1    = Tom Hanks 2016.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Kevin Bacon SDCC 2014.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = \n| image3    = Bill Paxton 2014.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Hanks, Bacon and Paxton portray the astronauts Lovell, Swigert and Haise respectively.\n}}\n'''Apollo Flight Crew:'''\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Apollo 13 Commander [[Jim Lovell]]: Jim Lovell stated that before his book ''[[Lost Moon]]'' was even written, the movie rights were being shopped to potential buyers<ref name=\"lost moon\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tomhanks-online.com/media/video/detail/420/apollo-13-making-of | title=Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13 | accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> and that his first reaction was that [[Kevin Costner]] would be a good choice to play him.<ref name=\"lost moon\" /><ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\">{{cite video | title = Apollo 13: 2-Disc Anniversary Edition (Disc 1), Special Features: Commentary track by Jim and Marilyn Lovell | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Universal Studios]]  | date=19 April 2005}}</ref> However, by the time Howard acquired the director's position, Costner's name never came up in serious discussion, and Hanks had already been interested in doing a film based on Apollo 13.

Space Works also built modified Command and Lunar Modules for filming inside a [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|Boeing KC-135]] [[reduced gravity aircraft|reduced-gravity aircraft]], and the pressure suits worn by the actors, which are exact reproductions of those worn by the Apollo astronauts, right down to the detail of being airtight.

It is far and away the best thing Mr. Howard has done (and ''[[Far and Away]]'' was one of the other kind).\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE0D7123FF933A05755C0A963958260 |date=June 30, 1995 |first=Janet|last=Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|title=''Apollo 13'', a Movie for the Fourth of July |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}</ref> The academic critic Raymond Malewitz focuses on the DIY aspects of the \"mailbox\" filtration system to illustrate the emergence of an unlikely hero in late 20th-century American culture\u2014\"the creative, improvisational, but restrained thinker\u2014who replaces the older prodigal cowboy heroes of American mythology and provides the country a better, more frugal example of an appropriate 'husband'.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://stanfordpress.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/getting-rugged-with-thing-theory.html |date=September 5, 2014 |first=Raymond|last=Malewitz|title=getting Rugged With Thing Theory |publisher=Stanford UP |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMarilyn Lovell praised Quinlan's portrayal of her, stating she felt she could feel what Quinlan's character was going through, and remembered how she felt in her mind.<ref name=\"lost moon\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n\nA 10th-anniversary [[DVD]] of the film was released in 2005; it included both the theatrical version and the IMAX version, along with several extras.<ref name=\"DVDInfo\" >{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00371QQ2U|title=Apollo 13 Blu-Ray Release|publisher=[[Universal Studios]]|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref>  The IMAX version has a 1.66:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://lethlib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/306209031|title= Apollo 13 (DVD - 2005)  | publisher= [[Lethbridge Public Library]]|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, ''Apollo 13'' was released on [[HD DVD]] and on April 13, 2010 it was released on [[Blu-ray disc]] as the 15th-anniversary edition on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 13 accident.<ref name=\"DVDInfo\"/> The Film was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on October 17, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultrahd.highdefdigest.com/48734/apollo134kultrahdbluray.html|title=Apollo 13 - 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Ultra HD Review {{!}} High Def Digest|website=ultrahd.highdefdigest.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n!

In reality, the crew heard the bang 93 seconds later.<ref name=\"timeline\">[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_13h_Timeline.htm Apollo 13 Timeline], ''Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference'', NASA History Series, Office of Policy and Plans, Richard W. Orloff, Sept. 2004. See \"Oxygen tank #2 fans on. Stabilization control system electrical disturbance indicated a power transient. 055:53:20.\"</ref>\n\nThe film portrays the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle being rolled out to the launch pad two days before launch. In reality, the launch vehicle was rolled out on the [[Mobile launcher platform#Saturn V and Space Shuttle|Mobile Launcher]] using the [[crawler-transporter]] weeks before the launch date.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe movie depicts Swigert and Haise arguing about who was at fault.  The show ''The Real Story: Apollo 13'' broadcast on the Smithsonian Channel includes Haise stating that no such argument took place and that there was no way anyone could have foreseen that stirring the tank would cause problems.<ref>[http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/the-real-story/apollo-13/679/141246 ''The Real Story: Apollo 13''], Season 4, Episode 3, 2012.  See this section beginning at 15:18.</ref>\n\nThe dialogue between ground control and the astronauts was taken nearly verbatim from transcripts and recordings, with the exception of one of the taglines of the film, \"[[Houston, we have a problem]].\" (This quote was voted #50 on the list \"[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]]\".) According to the mission transcript, the actual words uttered by Jack Swigert were \"Hey, we've got a problem here\" (talking over Haise, who had started \"Okay, Houston\"). Ground control responded by saying \"This is Houston, say again please.\" Jim Lovell then repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS13_PAO.PDF|title=Page 231 of Apollo 13's transcript at NASA Johnson Space Center|accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne other incorrect dialogue is after the re-entry blackout. In the movie, Tom Hanks (as Lovell) says \"Hello Houston... this is ''Odyssey''... it's good to see you again.\" In the actual re-entry, the Command Module's transmission was finally acquired by a [[Sikorsky SH-3D Sea King]] recovery helicopter which then relayed communications to Mission Control. CAPCOM and fellow astronaut [[Joe Kerwin]] (not Mattingly, who serves as CAPCOM in this scene in the movie) then made a call to the spacecraft \"Odyssey, Houston standing by. Over.\" Jack Swigert, not Lovell, replied \"Okay, Joe,\" and unlike in the movie, this was well before the parachutes deployed; the celebrations depicted at Mission Control were triggered by visual confirmation of their deployment.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://apollo13.spacelog.org/05:22:46:03/#log-line-513963|title=Apollo 13's re-entry transcript on Spacelog}}</ref>\n\nThe tagline \"Failure is not an option\", stated in the film by Gene Kranz, also became very popular, but was not taken from the historical transcripts. The following story relates the origin of the phrase, from an e-mail by Apollo 13 [[Flight Dynamics Officer]] Jerry Bostick:\n<blockquote>As far as the expression \"Failure is not an option,\" you are correct that Kranz never used that term. In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on \"What are the people in Mission Control really like?\" One of their questions was \"Weren't there times when everybody, or at least a few people, just panicked?\" My answer was \"No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.\" I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, \"That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now we just have to figure out who to have say it.\" Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceacts.com/notanoption.htm|title=Origin of Apollo 13 Quote: \"Failure Is Not an Option.\"|publisher=SPACEACTS.COM|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the film, Flight Director Gene Kranz and his White Team are portrayed as managing all of the essential parts of the flight, from liftoff to landing.  Consequently, the actual role of the other flight directors and teams, especially Glynn Lunney and his Black Team, were neglected.  In fact, it was Flight Director Lunney and his Black Team who got Apollo 13 through its most critical period in the hours immediately after the explosion, including the mid-course correction that sent Apollo 13 on a \"free return\" trajectory around the Moon and back to the Earth.  Astronaut Ken Mattingly, who was replaced as Apollo 13 Command Module Pilot at the last minute by Jack Swigert, later said:\n<blockquote>If there was a hero, Glynn Lunney was, by himself, a hero, because when he walked in the room, I guarantee you, nobody knew what the hell was going on.  Glynn walked in, took over this mess, and he just brought calm to the situation.  I've never seen such an extraordinary example of leadership in my entire career.  Absolutely magnificent.  No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night.  He and he alone brought all of the scared people together.  And you've got to remember that the flight controllers in those days were\u2014they were kids in their thirties.  They were good, but very few of them had ever run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren't used to that.  All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken.  They were faced with things that they didn't understand, and Glynn walked in there, and he just kind of took charge.<ref>Ken Mattingly, quoted in Go, Flight! The Unsung Heroes of Mission Control, 1965-1992, Rick Houston and Milt Heflin, 2015, University of Nebraska Press, p. 221</ref></blockquote>\n\nA [[Audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary track]], recorded by Jim and Marilyn Lovell and included with both DVD versions,<ref name=\"DVDInfo\" /> mentions several inaccuracies included in the film, all done for reasons of [[artistic license]]:\n{{Quote box|quote=We were working and watching the controls during that time. Because we came in shallow, it took us longer coming through the atmosphere where we had ionization. And the other thing was that we were just slow in answering.|source=\u2014Jim Lovell, on the real reason for the delay in replying after Apollo 13's four-minute re-entry into Earth's atmosphere<ref name=\"nytlovell\"/>|width=45%|align=right|salign=right}}\n* In the film, Mattingly plays a key role in solving a power consumption problem that Apollo 13 was faced with as it approached re-entry. Lovell points out in his commentary that Mattingly was a composite of several astronauts and engineers\u2014including [[Charles Duke]] (whose rubella led to Mattingly's grounding)\u2014all of whom played a role in solving that problem.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>\n* When Jack Swigert is getting ready to dock with the LM, a concerned NASA technician says: \"If Swigert can't dock this thing, we don't have a mission.\" Lovell and Haise also seem worried. In his DVD commentary, the real Jim Lovell says that if Swigert had been unable to dock with the LM, he or Haise could have done it. He also says that Swigert was a well-trained Command Module Pilot and that no one was really worried about whether he was up to the job,<ref name=\"nytlovell\"/> but he admitted that it made a nice subplot for the film. What the astronauts were really worried about, Lovell says, was the expected rendezvous between the Lunar Module and the Command Module after Lovell and Haise left the surface of the Moon.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>\n* A scene set the night before the launch, showing the astronauts' family members saying their goodbyes while separated by a road, to reduce the possibility of any last-minute [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of disease, depicted a tradition that did not begin until the [[Space Shuttle program]].<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>\n* The film depicts Marilyn Lovell dropping her wedding ring down a shower drain. According to Jim Lovell, this did occur,<ref name=\"nytlovell\"/> but the drain trap caught the ring and his wife was able to retrieve it.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>  Lovell has also confirmed that the scene in which his wife had a nightmare about him being \"sucked through an open door of a spacecraft into outer space\" also occurred, though he believes the nightmare was prompted by her seeing a scene in ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film they saw three months before Apollo 13 launched.<ref name=\"nytlovell\">{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/garden/at-the-movies-with-jim-lovell-in-space-no-room-for-fear.html | first=Lena | last= William | date= 19 July 1995 | title= In Space, No Room For Fear | newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= 30 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', a 1998 [[docudrama]] mini-series based around the Apollo missions\n* ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', a 2013 film about astronauts stranded in Earth orbit\n* ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film directed by [[John Sturges]], about astronauts marooned in an [[Apollo command and service module]]\n* Other [[survival film]]s\n\n== References ==\n{{Include-NASA}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Apollo 13 (film)}}\n{{wikiquotepar|Apollo 13|the film Apollo&nbsp;13}}\n* {{IMDb title|0112384|Apollo 13}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|67523|Apollo 13}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|134963|Apollo 13}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|apollo_13|Apollo 13}}\n* {{Mojo title|apollo13|Apollo 13}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Awards for ''Apollo 13''\n|list=\n{{Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture}}\n{{ScreenActorsGuildAward CastMotionPicture 1995\u20132000}}\n}}\n{{Ron Howard}}\n{{Brian Grazer}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Solar System|Space|Spaceflight|Film}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 soundtracks]]\n[[Category:1990s drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s historical films]]\n[[Category:Adventure films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:American aviation films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American historical films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:American survival films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (films)]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films about astronauts]]\n[[Category:Films about NASA]]\n[[Category:Films about the Apollo program]]\n[[Category:Films about space hazards]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ron Howard]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Brian Grazer]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1969]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1970]]\n[[Category:Films set in Florida]]\n[[Category:Films set in Houston]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Houston]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Sound Mixing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose editor won the Best Film Editing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Imagine Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:IMAX films]]\n[[Category:MCA Records soundtracks]]\n[[Category:Science docudramas]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Apollo 13]]\n[[Category:Jim Lovell]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1970s]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: 5 million \u2192 5\u00a0million", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13_(film)"}
