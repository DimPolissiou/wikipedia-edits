At [[Boston Children's Hospital]], the average age at diagnosis is 12 years.<ref>Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma, Boston Children's Hospital website, http://www.childrenshospital.org/health-topics/conditions/pleomorphic-xanthoastrocytoma</ref>\n\nPleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma usually develops within the [[supratentorial region]] (the area of the brain located above the [[tentorium cerebelli]]). It is generally located superficially (in the uppermost sections) in the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s and involves the [[leptomeninges]]. It rarely arises from the [[spinal cord]].\n\nThese tumors are formed through the [[mitosis]] of [[astrocytes]]. They are found in the area of the temples, in the brain's [[frontal lobe]] or on top of the [[parietal lobe]]. In about 20% of cases, tumors exist in more than one lobe.\n\n==Symptoms==\nChildren with PXA can present with a variety of symptoms. Complaints may vary, and patients may report symptoms that have been occurring for many months and are often linked with more common diseases. (For example, headaches are a common complaint.)\n\nSome children, however, will present with symptoms that start very suddenly, like [[seizure]]s.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Pleomorphic-xanthoastrocytoma-002.jpg|thumb|PXA as visualized on an [[MRI]]]]\nPXA is diagnosed through a combination of diagnostic processes:\n* Initially, a doctor will interview the patient and do a clinical exam, which will include a [[neurological examination]]. \n* A [[CT scan]] of the brain, and/or an [[MRI scan]] of the brain and spine, will be performed. A special dye may be injected into a vein before these scans to provide contrast and make tumors easier to see.\n* For children experiencing seizures, an [[EEG]] might be part of the diagnostic process (the goal being to record the brain's electrical activity in order to identify and localize seizure activity).\n* Finally, a [[biopsy]] of the tumor, taken through a needle during a simple surgical procedure, helps to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n==Treatment==\n[[File:Pleo xantho.jpg|thumb|Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, as visualized [[Histopathology|under a microscope]]]]\nSurgery is often the treatment of choice. Total resection (removal of the tumor) is often possible. However, the best choice of treatment will depend on many individual factors, including:\n* The patient's medical history and overall health condition\n* The type, location, and size of the tumor\n* The patient's age\n* How well the patient tolerates specific medications, procedures, or therapy\n* How slowly or quickly the tumor is expected to progress\n\nIf surgery is performed and the tumor is completely resected, further treatment may not be required. The patient will, however, need repeated MRIs to monitor for tumor re-growth.\n\nFor tumors that recur, another surgical resection might be attempted. For tumors that could not be completely removed, [[radiation therapy]] may also be recommended. Also called radiotherapy, this treatment uses high-energy radiation to damage or kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.\n\n===Effects of treatment on symptoms===\nSymptoms of PXA may disappear, or improve progressively, after treatment. For example:\n*Symptoms related to [[increased intracranial pressure|increased pressure in the brain]] often disappear after surgical removal of the tumor.\n*Effects like seizures might progressively improve as recovery progresses.\n*[[Steroid]] treatment is often used to control tissue swelling that may occur before and after surgery.\n\n===Side effects of treatment===\n\n====Brain surgery====\nChildren with PXA may experience seizures as a symptom of their disease. However, any person undergoing [[brain surgery]] is at risk of developing [[epileptic seizure]]s. Medication is administered to minimize or prevent seizure activity. Additionally, after surgery, parents should be informed of the risk of seizures, and educated on what to do in the event of a seizure.\n\nWith any brain surgery, there is also a risk of [[brain damage]].\n\n====Radiation therapy====\nRadiation therapy may cause swelling in the brain, related to tissue inflammation. This inflammation may lead to symptoms like headaches. It may be treated with oral medication.\n\n===Prognosis following treatment===\nWith treatment, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas are associated with a high rate of cure.<ref>Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma, Boston Children's Hospital website, http://www.childrenshospital.org/health-topics/conditions/p/pleomorphic-xanthoastrocytoma/treatments</ref>\n* Grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas are known to progress towards grade II tumors, which are more likely to recur after surgical removal.\n* Grade III anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas may evolve and show signs of [[anaplasia]], according to evidence in the medical literature.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Idotsmail H.

The program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous FTP ([[File Transfer Protocol]]) sites, creating a searchable database of file names; however, [[Archie search engine|Archie Search Engine]] did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manually.\n\nThe rise of [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] (created in 1991 by [[Mark McCahill]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]) led to two new search programs, [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]] and [[Jughead (search engine)|Jughead]]. Like Archie, they searched the file names and titles stored in Gopher index systems. Veronica (''V''ery ''E''asy ''R''odent-''O''riented ''N''et-wide ''I''ndex to ''C''omputerized ''A''rchives) provided a keyword search of most Gopher menu titles in the entire Gopher listings. Jughead (''J''onzy's ''U''niversal ''G''opher ''H''ierarchy ''E''xcavation ''A''nd ''D''isplay) was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific Gopher servers. While the name of the search engine \"[[Archie search engine|Archie Search Engine]]\" was not a reference to the [[Archie Comics|Archie comic book]] series, \"[[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]]\" and \"[[Jughead Jones|Jughead]]\" are characters in the series, thus referencing their predecessor.\n\nIn the summer of 1993, no search engine existed for the web, though numerous specialized catalogues were maintained by hand. [[Oscar Nierstrasz]] at the [[University of Geneva]] wrote a series of [[Perl]] scripts that periodically mirrored these pages and rewrote them into a standard format. This formed the basis for [[W3Catalog]], the web's first primitive search engine, released on September 2, 1993.<ref name=\"Announcement html\">{{cite web |url= http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www/browse_thread/thread/2176526a36dc8bd3/2718fd17812937ac?hl=en&lnk=gst&q=Oscar+Nierstrasz#2718fd17812937ac|title=Searchable Catalog of WWW Resources (experimental)|author=Oscar Nierstrasz|date=2 September 1993|author-link=Oscar Nierstrasz}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1993, Matthew Gray, then at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], produced what was probably the first [[web robot]], the [[Perl]]-based [[World Wide Web Wanderer]], and used it to generate an index called \"Wandex\".  The purpose of the Wanderer was to measure the size of the World Wide Web, which it did until late 1995.  The web's second search engine [[Aliweb]] appeared in November 1993.  Aliweb did not use a [[web robot]], but instead depended on being notified by website administrators of the existence at each site of an index file in a particular format.\n\n[[JumpStation]] (created in December 1993<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/old-whats-new/whats-new-1293.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010620073530/http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/old-whats-new/whats-new-1293.html |archivedate=2001-06-20 |title=Archive of NCSA what's new in December 1993 page |date=2001-06-20 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> by [[Jonathon Fletcher]]) used a [[web crawler|web robot]] to find web pages and to build its index, and used a [[web form]] as the interface to its query program.  It was thus the first WWW resource-discovery tool to combine the three essential features of a web search engine (crawling, indexing, and searching) as described below.  Because of the limited resources available on the platform it ran on, its indexing and hence searching were limited to the titles and headings found in the web pages the crawler encountered.\n\nOne of the first \"all text\" crawler-based search engines was [[WebCrawler]], which came out in 1994.  Unlike its predecessors, it allowed users to search for any word in any webpage, which has become the standard for all major search engines since. It was also the search engine that was widely known by the public.  Also in 1994, [[Lycos]] (which started at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) was launched and became a major commercial endeavor.\n\nThe first popular search engine on the Web was [[Yahoo! Search]].<ref>{{cite web |title=What is first mover? |url=https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/first-mover |website=SearchCIO |publisher=[[TechTarget]] |accessdate=5 September 2019 |date=September 2005}}</ref> The first product from [[Yahoo!]], founded by [[Jerry Yang]] and [[David Filo]] in January 1994, was a [[Web directory]] called [[Yahoo!

Information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keyword-based search.\n\nIn 1996, [[Robin Li]] developed the [[RankDex]] site-scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking<ref>Greenberg, Andy, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/1005/technology-baidu-robin-li-man-whos-beating-google.html \"The Man Who's Beating Google\"], ''Forbes'' magazine, October 5, 2009</ref><ref>Yanhong Li, \"Toward a Qualitative Search Engine,\" ''IEEE Internet Computing'', vol. 2, no. 4, pp. 24\u201329, July/Aug. 1998, {{DOI|10.1109/4236.707687}}</ref><ref name=\"rankdex\">[http://www.rankdex.com/about.html \"About: RankDex\"], ''rankdex.com''</ref> and received a US patent for the technology.<ref>USPTO, [https://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr=&vid=USPAT5920859&id=x04ZAAAAEBAJ&oi=fnd&dq=yanhong+li&printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q=yanhong%20li&f=false \"Hypertext Document Retrieval System and Method\"], US Patent number: 5920859, Inventor: Yanhong Li, Filing date: Feb 5, 1997, Issue date: Jul 6, 1999</ref> It was the first search engine that used hyperlinks to measure the quality of websites it was indexing,<ref>{{cite web |title=Baidu Vs Google: The Twins Of Search Compared |url=https://fourweekmba.com/baidu-vs-google/ |website=FourWeekMBA |accessdate=16 June 2019 |date=18 September 2018}}</ref> predating the very similar algorithm patent filed by [[Google]] two years later in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Altucher |first1=James |title=10 Unusual Things About Google |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesaltucher/2011/03/18/10-unusual-things-about-google-also-the-worst-vc-decision-i-ever-made/ |date=March 18, 2011 |website=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref> [[Larry Page]] referenced Li's work in some of his U.S. patents for PageRank.<ref name=\"patent\">{{cite web |title = Method for node ranking in a linked database |url = https://www.google.com/patents/US6285999 |publisher = Google Patents |accessdate = 19 October 2015 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151015185034/http://www.google.com/patents/US6285999 |archivedate = 15 October 2015 }}</ref> Li later used his Rankdex technology for the [[Baidu]] search engine, which was founded by Robin Li in China and launched in 2000.\n\nIn 1996, [[Netscape]] was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal as the featured search engine on Netscape's web browser. There was so much interest that instead Netscape struck deals with five of the major search engines: for $5 million a year, each search engine would be in rotation on the Netscape search engine page.  The five engines were Yahoo!, Magellan, Lycos, Infoseek, and Excite.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/YHOO/701084386x0x27155/9a3b5ed8-9e84-4cba-a1e5-77a3dc606566/YHOO_News_1997_7_8_General.pdf|title=Yahoo!

Search Marketing|goto.com]]. This move had a significant effect on the SE business, which went from struggling to one of the most profitable businesses in the Internet.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://psu.pb.unizin.org/ist110/chapter/2-1-search-engines/|title=Search Engines|last=Pursel|first=Bart|date=|website=Penn State Pressbooks|access-date=February 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSearch engines were also known as some of the brightest stars in the Internet investing frenzy that occurred in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gandal |first=Neil |authorlink= |year=2001 |title=The dynamics of competition in the internet search engine market |journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=1103\u20131117 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7187(01)00065-0  |url= http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/0h17g08v|accessdate=|quote= }}</ref> Several companies entered the market spectacularly, receiving record gains during their [[initial public offering]]s. Some have taken down their public search engine, and are marketing enterprise-only editions, such as Northern Light. Many search engine companies were caught up in the [[dot-com bubble]], a speculation-driven market boom that peaked in 1999 and ended in 2001.\n\nAround 2000, [[Google Search|Google's search engine]] rose to prominence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/about/company/history/ |title=Our History in depth |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2012-10-31}}</ref>  The company achieved better results for many searches with an algorithm called [[PageRank]], as was explained in the paper ''Anatomy of a Search Engine'' written by [[Sergey Brin]] and [[Larry Page]], the later founders of Google.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/361/1/1998-8.pdf|title=The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine|last1=Brin|first1=Sergey|last2=Page|first2=Larry}}</ref> This [[iterative algorithm]] ranks web pages based on the number and PageRank of other web sites and pages that link there, on the premise that good or desirable pages are linked to more than others. Larry Page's patent for PageRank cites [[Robin Li]]'s earlier [[RankDex]] patent as an influence.<ref name=\"patent\"/><ref name=\"rankdex\"/> Google also maintained a minimalist interface to its search engine. In contrast, many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a [[web portal]]. In fact, Google search engine became so popular that spoof engines emerged such as [[Mystery Seeker]].\n\nBy 2000, [[Yahoo!]] was providing search services based on Inktomi's search engine. Yahoo! acquired Inktomi in 2002, and [[Overture]] (which owned [[AlltheWeb]] and AltaVista) in 2003.  Yahoo! switched to Google's search engine until 2004, when it launched its own search engine based on the combined technologies of its acquisitions.\n\n[[Microsoft]] first launched MSN Search in the fall of 1998 using search results from Inktomi.  In early 1999 the site began to display listings from [[Looksmart]], blended with results from Inktomi. For a short time in 1999, MSN Search used results from AltaVista  instead. In 2004, [[Microsoft]] began a transition to its own search technology, powered by its own [[web crawler]] (called [[msnbot]]).\n\nMicrosoft's rebranded search engine, [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], was launched on June 1, 2009.  On July 29, 2009, Yahoo! and Microsoft finalized a deal in which [[Yahoo! Search]] would be powered by Microsoft Bing technology.\n\nAs of 2019, active search engine crawlers include those of [[Google Search|Google]], [[Sogou]], [[Baidu]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[Gigablast]], [[Mojeek]], [[DuckDuckGo]] and [[Yandex]].\n\n== Approach ==\n{{anchor|Workings}}\n{{main|Search engine technology}}\nA search engine maintains the following processes in near real time:\n# [[Web crawling]]\n# [[Index (search engine)|Indexing]]\n# [[Web search query|Searching]]<ref name=Jawadekar2011>{{citation |year=2011 |author=Jawadekar, Waman S |title=Knowledge Management: Text & Cases |chapter=8.

The \"spider\" checks for the standard filename ''[[robots.txt]]'', addressed to it. The robots.txt file contains directives for search spiders, telling it which pages to crawl. After checking for robots.txt and either finding it or not, the spider sends certain information back to be [[Search engine indexing|indexed]] depending on many factors, such as the titles, page content, [[JavaScript]], [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), headings, or its metadata in HTML [[meta tags]]. After a certain number of pages crawled, amount of data indexed, or time spent on the website, the spider stops crawling and moves on. \"[N]o web crawler may actually crawl the entire reachable web. Due to infinite websites, spider traps, spam, and other exigencies of the real web, crawlers instead apply a crawl policy to determine when the crawling of a site should be deemed sufficient. Some websites are crawled exhaustively, while others are crawled only partially\".<ref>Dasgupta, Anirban; Ghosh, Arpita; Kumar, Ravi; Olston, Christopher; Pandey, Sandeep; and Tomkins, Andrew. ''The Discoverability of the Web''. http://www.arpitaghosh.com/papers/discoverability.pdf</ref>\n\nIndexing means associating words and other definable tokens found on web pages to their domain names and HTML-based fields. The associations are made in a public database, made available for web search queries. A query from a user can be a single word, multiple words or a sentence. The index helps find information relating to the query as quickly as possible.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> Some of the techniques for indexing, and [[cache (computing)|caching]] are trade secrets, whereas web crawling is a straightforward process of visiting all sites on a systematic basis.\n\nBetween visits by the ''spider'', the cached version of page (some or all the content needed to render it) stored in the search engine working memory is quickly sent to an inquirer.  If a visit is overdue, the search engine can just act as a [[web proxy]] instead. In this case the page may differ from the search terms indexed.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> The cached page holds the appearance of the version whose words were previously indexed, so a cached version of a page can be useful to the web site when the actual page has been lost, but this problem is also considered a mild form of [[linkrot]].\n\n<!-- perhaps at web cache:\n, and Google's handling of it increases [[usability]] by satisfying [[user expectations]] that the search terms will be on the returned webpage. This satisfies the [[principle of least astonishment]], since the user normally expects that the search terms will be on the returned pages. Increased search relevance makes these cached pages very useful as they may contain data that may no longer be available elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n-->\n[[File:WebCrawlerArchitecture.svg|thumb|High-level architecture of a standard Web crawler]]\nTypically when a user enters a [[web search query|query]] into a search engine it is a few [[Keyword (Internet search)|keywords]].<ref>Jansen, B. J., Spink, A., and Saracevic, T. 2000. [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_real_life_real_users_and_real_needs.pdf Real life, real users, and real needs: A study and analysis of user queries on the web. Information Processing & Management]. 36(2), 207-227.</ref> The [[inverted index|index]] already has the names of the sites containing the keywords, and these are instantly obtained from the index.  The real processing load is in generating the web pages that are the search results list: Every page in the entire list must be [[weighting|weighted]] according to information in the indexes.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> Then the top search result item requires the lookup, reconstruction, and markup of the ''snippets'' showing the context of the keywords matched.  These are only part of the processing each search results web page requires, and further pages (next to the top) require more of this post processing.\n\nBeyond simple keyword lookups, search engines offer their own GUI- or command-driven operators and search parameters to refine the search results.  These provide the necessary controls for the user engaged in the feedback loop users create by ''filtering'' and ''weighting'' while refining the search results, given the initial pages of the first search results.\nFor example, from 2007 the Google.com search engine has allowed one to ''filter'' by date by clicking \"Show search tools\" in the leftmost column of the initial search results page, and then selecting the desired date range.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chitu|first1=Alex|title=Easy Way to Find Recent Web Pages|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/easy-way-to-find-recent-web-pages.html|website=Google Operating System|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=August 30, 2007}}</ref> It's also possible to ''weight'' by date because each page has a modification time. Most search engines support the use of the [[boolean operators]] AND, OR and NOT to help end users refine the [[web search query|search query]]. Boolean operators are for literal searches that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search. The engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as entered.  Some search engines provide an advanced feature called [[Proximity search (text)|proximity search]], which allows users to define the distance between keywords.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/>  There is also [[Concept search|concept-based searching]] where the research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases you search for. As well, natural language queries allow the user to type a question in the same form one would ask it to a human.<ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]\", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.</ref> A site like this would be ask.com.<ref>http://www.ask.com. Retrieved 10 September 2015.</ref>\n\nThe usefulness of a search engine depends on the [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] of the ''result set'' it gives back. While there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase, some pages may be more relevant, popular, or authoritative than others. Most search engines employ methods to [[rank order|rank]] the results to provide the \"best\" results first. How a search engine decides which pages are the best matches, and what order the results should be shown in, varies widely from one engine to another.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> The methods also change over time as Internet usage changes and new techniques evolve.  There are two main types of search engine that have evolved: one is a system of predefined and hierarchically ordered keywords that humans have programmed extensively. The other is a system that generates an \"[[inverted index]]\" by analyzing texts it locates. This first form relies much more heavily on the computer itself to do the bulk of the work.\n\nMost Web search engines are commercial ventures supported by [[advertising]] revenue and thus some of them allow advertisers to [[paid inclusion|have their listings ranked higher]] in search results for a fee. Search engines that do not accept money for their search results make money by running [[contextual advertising|search related ads]] alongside the regular search engine results. The search engines make money every time someone clicks on one of these ads.<ref>{{cite web|title=how search engine works?|url=http://globalforumonline.com/detail/how-does-search-engine-works/|publisher= GFO = 26 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Local search === \nIn 2007, [[Steve Ballmer]] stated that \"[[Sidewalk.com|Sidewalk]] was really aimed at what we now call [[local search (internet)|local search]]...

This leads to an effect that has been called a [[filter bubble]]. The term describes a phenomenon in which websites use [[algorithm]]s to selectively guess what information a user would like to see, based on information about the user (such as location, past click behaviour and search history). As a result, websites tend to show only information that agrees with the user's past viewpoint. This puts the user in a state of intellectual isolation without contrary information. Prime examples are Google's personalized search results and [[Facebook]]'s personalized news stream. According to [[Eli Pariser]], who coined the term, users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble. Pariser related an example in which one user searched Google for \"BP\" and got investment news about [[British Petroleum]] while another searcher got information about the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] and that the two search results pages were \"strikingly different\".<ref name=twsT43>{{cite news\n |first1= Lynn | last1= Parramore\n |title= The Filter Bubble\n |work= The Atlantic\n |quote= Since Dec. 4, 2009, Google has been personalized for everyone.

While search engine submission is sometimes presented as a way to promote a website, it generally is not necessary because the major search engines use web crawlers that will eventually find most web sites on the Internet without assistance. They can either submit one web page at a time, or they can submit the entire site using a [[sitemap]], but it is normally only necessary to submit the [[home page]] of a web site as search engines are able to crawl a well designed website.  There are two remaining reasons to submit a web site or web page to a search engine: to add an entirely new web site without waiting for a search engine to discover it, and to have a web site's record updated after a substantial redesign.\n\nSome search engine submission software not only submits websites to multiple search engines, but also adds links to websites from their own pages. This could appear helpful in increasing a website's ranking, because external links are one of the most important factors determining a website's ranking.  However, John Mueller of [[Google]] has stated that this \"can lead to a tremendous number of unnatural links for your site\" with a negative impact on site ranking.<ref name=\"CanBeHarmful\">{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=Barry |authorlink=Barry Schwartz (technologist) |url=https://www.seroundtable.com/search-engine-submission-google-15906.html |title=Google: Search Engine Submission Services Can Be Harmful |work=[[Search Engine Roundtable]] |date=2012-10-29 |accessdate=2016-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|\n* [[Comparison of web search engines]]\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n* [[List of search engines]]\n* [[Question answering]]\n* [[Filter bubble]]\n* [[Google effect]]\n* [[Internet search engines and libraries|Use of web search engines in libraries]]\n* [[Semantic Web]]\n* [[Spell checker]]\n* [[Web development tools]]\n* [[Search engine manipulation effect]]\n* [[Search engine privacy]]\n}}\n\n== References  ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal | author =Steve Lawrence; C.

The [[Whois|Who is]] user search dates back to 1982<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc812|title=RFC 812 - NICNAME/WHOIS|work=ietf.org}}</ref> and the [[Knowbot Information Service]] multi-network user search was first implemented in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/home/koe/iwooos-full.html|title=Knowbot programming: System support for mobile agents|work=cnri.reston.va.us}}</ref> The first well documented search engine that searched content files, namely [[FTP]] files, was [[Archie search engine|Archie]], which debuted on 10 September 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.archives/LWVA50W8BKk/wyRbF_lDc6cJ|title=[next] An Internet archive server server (was about Lisp)|last=Deutsch|first=Peter|date=September 11, 1990|website=groups.google.com|access-date=2017-12-29}}</ref>\n\nPrior to September 1993, the [[World Wide Web]] was entirely indexed by hand. There was a list of [[webserver]]s edited by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and hosted on the [[CERN]] webserver. One snapshot of the list in 1992 remains,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Servers.html |title=World-Wide Web Servers |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref> but as more and more web servers went online the central list could no longer keep up. On the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]]  site, new servers were announced under the title \"What's New!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.mcom.com/home/whatsnew/whats_new_0294.html |title=What's New! February 1994 |publisher=Home.mcom.com |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref>\n\nThe first tool used for searching content (as opposed to users) on the [[Internet]] was [[Archie search engine|Archie]].<ref name=LeidenUnivSE>\"Internet History - Search Engines\" (from [[Search Engine Watch]]), Universiteit Leiden, Netherlands, September 2001, web: [http://www.internethistory.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?c=7 LeidenU-Archie]. </ref> The name stands for \"archive\" without the \"v\". It was created by [[Alan Emtage]], Bill Heelan and J. Peter Deutsch, computer science students at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. The program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous FTP ([[File Transfer Protocol]]) sites, creating a searchable database of file names; however, [[Archie search engine|Archie Search Engine]] did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manually.\n\nThe rise of [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] (created in 1991 by [[Mark McCahill]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]) led to two new search programs, [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]] and [[Jughead (search engine)|Jughead]]. Like Archie, they searched the file names and titles stored in Gopher index systems. Veronica (''V''ery ''E''asy ''R''odent-''O''riented ''N''et-wide ''I''ndex to ''C''omputerized ''A''rchives) provided a keyword search of most Gopher menu titles in the entire Gopher listings. Jughead (''J''onzy's ''U''niversal ''G''opher ''H''ierarchy ''E''xcavation ''A''nd ''D''isplay) was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific Gopher servers. While the name of the search engine \"[[Archie search engine|Archie Search Engine]]\" was not a reference to the [[Archie Comics|Archie comic book]] series, \"[[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]]\" and \"[[Jughead Jones|Jughead]]\" are characters in the series, thus referencing their predecessor.\n\nIn the summer of 1993, no search engine existed for the web, though numerous specialized catalogues were maintained by hand. [[Oscar Nierstrasz]] at the [[University of Geneva]] wrote a series of [[Perl]] scripts that periodically mirrored these pages and rewrote them into a standard format. This formed the basis for [[W3Catalog]], the web's first primitive search engine, released on September 2, 1993.<ref name=\"Announcement html\">{{cite web |url= http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www/browse_thread/thread/2176526a36dc8bd3/2718fd17812937ac?hl=en&lnk=gst&q=Oscar+Nierstrasz#2718fd17812937ac|title=Searchable Catalog of WWW Resources (experimental)|author=Oscar Nierstrasz|date=2 September 1993|author-link=Oscar Nierstrasz}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1993, Matthew Gray, then at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], produced what was probably the first [[web robot]], the [[Perl]]-based [[World Wide Web Wanderer]], and used it to generate an index called \"Wandex\".  The purpose of the Wanderer was to measure the size of the World Wide Web, which it did until late 1995.  The web's second search engine [[Aliweb]] appeared in November 1993.  Aliweb did not use a [[web robot]], but instead depended on being notified by website administrators of the existence at each site of an index file in a particular format.\n\n[[JumpStation]] (created in December 1993<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/old-whats-new/whats-new-1293.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010620073530/http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/old-whats-new/whats-new-1293.html |archivedate=2001-06-20 |title=Archive of NCSA what's new in December 1993 page |date=2001-06-20 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> by [[Jonathon Fletcher]]) used a [[web crawler|web robot]] to find web pages and to build its index, and used a [[web form]] as the interface to its query program.  It was thus the first WWW resource-discovery tool to combine the three essential features of a web search engine (crawling, indexing, and searching) as described below.  Because of the limited resources available on the platform it ran on, its indexing and hence searching were limited to the titles and headings found in the web pages the crawler encountered.\n\nOne of the first \"all text\" crawler-based search engines was [[WebCrawler]], which came out in 1994.  Unlike its predecessors, it allowed users to search for any word in any webpage, which has become the standard for all major search engines since. It was also the search engine that was widely known by the public.  Also in 1994, [[Lycos]] (which started at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) was launched and became a major commercial endeavor.\n\nThe first popular search engine on the Web was [[Yahoo! Search]].<ref>{{cite web |title=What is first mover? |url=https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/first-mover |website=SearchCIO |publisher=[[TechTarget]] |accessdate=5 September 2019 |date=September 2005}}</ref> The first product from [[Yahoo!]], founded by [[Jerry Yang]] and [[David Filo]] in January 1994, was a [[Web directory]] called [[Yahoo!

Information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keyword-based search.\n\nIn 1996, [[Robin Li]] developed the [[RankDex]] site-scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking<ref>Greenberg, Andy, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/1005/technology-baidu-robin-li-man-whos-beating-google.html \"The Man Who's Beating Google\"], ''Forbes'' magazine, October 5, 2009</ref><ref>Yanhong Li, \"Toward a Qualitative Search Engine,\" ''IEEE Internet Computing'', vol. 2, no. 4, pp. 24\u201329, July/Aug. 1998, {{DOI|10.1109/4236.707687}}</ref><ref name=\"rankdex\">[http://www.rankdex.com/about.html \"About: RankDex\"], ''rankdex.com''</ref> and received a US patent for the technology.<ref>USPTO, [https://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr=&vid=USPAT5920859&id=x04ZAAAAEBAJ&oi=fnd&dq=yanhong+li&printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q=yanhong%20li&f=false \"Hypertext Document Retrieval System and Method\"], US Patent number: 5920859, Inventor: Yanhong Li, Filing date: Feb 5, 1997, Issue date: Jul 6, 1999</ref> It was the first search engine that used hyperlinks to measure the quality of websites it was indexing,<ref>{{cite web |title=Baidu Vs Google: The Twins Of Search Compared |url=https://fourweekmba.com/baidu-vs-google/ |website=FourWeekMBA |accessdate=16 June 2019 |date=18 September 2018}}</ref> predating the very similar algorithm patent filed by [[Google]] two years later in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Altucher |first1=James |title=10 Unusual Things About Google |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesaltucher/2011/03/18/10-unusual-things-about-google-also-the-worst-vc-decision-i-ever-made/ |date=March 18, 2011 |website=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref> [[Larry Page]] referenced Li's work in some of his U.S. patents for PageRank.<ref name=\"patent\">{{cite web |title = Method for node ranking in a linked database |url = https://www.google.com/patents/US6285999 |publisher = Google Patents |accessdate = 19 October 2015 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151015185034/http://www.google.com/patents/US6285999 |archivedate = 15 October 2015 }}</ref> Li later used his Rankdex technology for the [[Baidu]] search engine, which was founded by Robin Li in China and launched in 2000.\n\nIn 1996, [[Netscape]] was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal as the featured search engine on Netscape's web browser. There was so much interest that instead Netscape struck deals with five of the major search engines: for $5 million a year, each search engine would be in rotation on the Netscape search engine page.  The five engines were Yahoo!, Magellan, Lycos, Infoseek, and Excite.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/YHOO/701084386x0x27155/9a3b5ed8-9e84-4cba-a1e5-77a3dc606566/YHOO_News_1997_7_8_General.pdf|title=Yahoo!

In contrast, many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a [[web portal]]. In fact, Google search engine became so popular that spoof engines emerged such as [[Mystery Seeker]].\n\nBy 2000, [[Yahoo!]] was providing search services based on Inktomi's search engine. Yahoo! acquired Inktomi in 2002, and [[Overture]] (which owned [[AlltheWeb]] and AltaVista) in 2003.  Yahoo! switched to Google's search engine until 2004, when it launched its own search engine based on the combined technologies of its acquisitions.\n\n[[Microsoft]] first launched MSN Search in the fall of 1998 using search results from Inktomi.  In early 1999 the site began to display listings from [[Looksmart]], blended with results from Inktomi. For a short time in 1999, MSN Search used results from AltaVista  instead. In 2004, [[Microsoft]] began a transition to its own search technology, powered by its own [[web crawler]] (called [[msnbot]]).\n\nMicrosoft's rebranded search engine, [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], was launched on June 1, 2009.  On July 29, 2009, Yahoo! and Microsoft finalized a deal in which [[Yahoo! Search]] would be powered by Microsoft Bing technology.\n\nAs of 2019, active search engine crawlers include those of [[Google Search|Google]], [[Sogou]], [[Baidu]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[Gigablast]], [[Mojeek]], [[DuckDuckGo]] and [[Yandex]].\n\n== Approach ==\n{{anchor|Workings}}\n{{main|Search engine technology}}\nA search engine maintains the following processes in near real time:\n# [[Web crawling]]\n# [[Index (search engine)|Indexing]]\n# [[Web search query|Searching]]<ref name=Jawadekar2011>{{citation |year=2011 |author=Jawadekar, Waman S |title=Knowledge Management: Text & Cases |chapter=8.

The \"spider\" checks for the standard filename ''[[robots.txt]]'', addressed to it. The robots.txt file contains directives for search spiders, telling it which pages to crawl. After checking for robots.txt and either finding it or not, the spider sends certain information back to be [[Search engine indexing|indexed]] depending on many factors, such as the titles, page content, [[JavaScript]], [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), headings, or its metadata in HTML [[meta tags]]. After a certain number of pages crawled, amount of data indexed, or time spent on the website, the spider stops crawling and moves on. \"[N]o web crawler may actually crawl the entire reachable web. Due to infinite websites, spider traps, spam, and other exigencies of the real web, crawlers instead apply a crawl policy to determine when the crawling of a site should be deemed sufficient. Some websites are crawled exhaustively, while others are crawled only partially\".<ref>Dasgupta, Anirban; Ghosh, Arpita; Kumar, Ravi; Olston, Christopher; Pandey, Sandeep; and Tomkins, Andrew. ''The Discoverability of the Web''. http://www.arpitaghosh.com/papers/discoverability.pdf</ref>\n\nIndexing means associating words and other definable tokens found on web pages to their domain names and HTML-based fields. The associations are made in a public database, made available for web search queries. A query from a user can be a single word, multiple words or a sentence. The index helps find information relating to the query as quickly as possible.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> Some of the techniques for indexing, and [[cache (computing)|caching]] are trade secrets, whereas web crawling is a straightforward process of visiting all sites on a systematic basis.\n\nBetween visits by the ''spider'', the cached version of page (some or all the content needed to render it) stored in the search engine working memory is quickly sent to an inquirer.  If a visit is overdue, the search engine can just act as a [[web proxy]] instead. In this case the page may differ from the search terms indexed.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> The cached page holds the appearance of the version whose words were previously indexed, so a cached version of a page can be useful to the web site when the actual page has been lost, but this problem is also considered a mild form of [[linkrot]].\n\n<!-- perhaps at web cache:\n, and Google's handling of it increases [[usability]] by satisfying [[user expectations]] that the search terms will be on the returned webpage. This satisfies the [[principle of least astonishment]], since the user normally expects that the search terms will be on the returned pages. Increased search relevance makes these cached pages very useful as they may contain data that may no longer be available elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n-->\n[[File:WebCrawlerArchitecture.svg|thumb|High-level architecture of a standard Web crawler]]\nTypically when a user enters a [[web search query|query]] into a search engine it is a few [[Keyword (Internet search)|keywords]].<ref>Jansen, B.

Information Processing & Management]. 36(2), 207-227.</ref> The [[inverted index|index]] already has the names of the sites containing the keywords, and these are instantly obtained from the index.  The real processing load is in generating the web pages that are the search results list: Every page in the entire list must be [[weighting|weighted]] according to information in the indexes.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> Then the top search result item requires the lookup, reconstruction, and markup of the ''snippets'' showing the context of the keywords matched.  These are only part of the processing each search results web page requires, and further pages (next to the top) require more of this post processing.\n\nBeyond simple keyword lookups, search engines offer their own GUI- or command-driven operators and search parameters to refine the search results.  These provide the necessary controls for the user engaged in the feedback loop users create by ''filtering'' and ''weighting'' while refining the search results, given the initial pages of the first search results.\nFor example, from 2007 the Google.com search engine has allowed one to ''filter'' by date by clicking \"Show search tools\" in the leftmost column of the initial search results page, and then selecting the desired date range.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chitu|first1=Alex|title=Easy Way to Find Recent Web Pages|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/easy-way-to-find-recent-web-pages.html|website=Google Operating System|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=August 30, 2007}}</ref> It's also possible to ''weight'' by date because each page has a modification time. Most search engines support the use of the [[boolean operators]] AND, OR and NOT to help end users refine the [[web search query|search query]]. Boolean operators are for literal searches that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search. The engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as entered.  Some search engines provide an advanced feature called [[Proximity search (text)|proximity search]], which allows users to define the distance between keywords.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/>  There is also [[Concept search|concept-based searching]] where the research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases you search for. As well, natural language queries allow the user to type a question in the same form one would ask it to a human.<ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]\", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.</ref> A site like this would be ask.com.<ref>http://www.ask.com. Retrieved 10 September 2015.</ref>\n\nThe usefulness of a search engine depends on the [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] of the ''result set'' it gives back. While there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase, some pages may be more relevant, popular, or authoritative than others. Most search engines employ methods to [[rank order|rank]] the results to provide the \"best\" results first. How a search engine decides which pages are the best matches, and what order the results should be shown in, varies widely from one engine to another.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> The methods also change over time as Internet usage changes and new techniques evolve.  There are two main types of search engine that have evolved: one is a system of predefined and hierarchically ordered keywords that humans have programmed extensively. The other is a system that generates an \"[[inverted index]]\" by analyzing texts it locates. This first form relies much more heavily on the computer itself to do the bulk of the work.\n\nMost Web search engines are commercial ventures supported by [[advertising]] revenue and thus some of them allow advertisers to [[paid inclusion|have their listings ranked higher]] in search results for a fee. Search engines that do not accept money for their search results make money by running [[contextual advertising|search related ads]] alongside the regular search engine results. The search engines make money every time someone clicks on one of these ads.<ref>{{cite web|title=how search engine works?|url=http://globalforumonline.com/detail/how-does-search-engine-works/|publisher= GFO = 26 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Local search === \nIn 2007, [[Steve Ballmer]] stated that \"[[Sidewalk.com|Sidewalk]] was really aimed at what we now call [[local search (internet)|local search]]...

This leads to an effect that has been called a [[filter bubble]]. The term describes a phenomenon in which websites use [[algorithm]]s to selectively guess what information a user would like to see, based on information about the user (such as location, past click behaviour and search history). As a result, websites tend to show only information that agrees with the user's past viewpoint. This puts the user in a state of intellectual isolation without contrary information. Prime examples are Google's personalized search results and [[Facebook]]'s personalized news stream. According to [[Eli Pariser]], who coined the term, users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble. Pariser related an example in which one user searched Google for \"BP\" and got investment news about [[British Petroleum]] while another searcher got information about the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] and that the two search results pages were \"strikingly different\".<ref name=twsT43>{{cite news\n |first1= Lynn | last1= Parramore\n |title= The Filter Bubble\n |work= The Atlantic\n |quote= Since Dec. 4, 2009, Google has been personalized for everyone.

While search engine submission is sometimes presented as a way to promote a website, it generally is not necessary because the major search engines use web crawlers that will eventually find most web sites on the Internet without assistance. They can either submit one web page at a time, or they can submit the entire site using a [[sitemap]], but it is normally only necessary to submit the [[home page]] of a web site as search engines are able to crawl a well designed website.  There are two remaining reasons to submit a web site or web page to a search engine: to add an entirely new web site without waiting for a search engine to discover it, and to have a web site's record updated after a substantial redesign.\n\nSome search engine submission software not only submits websites to multiple search engines, but also adds links to websites from their own pages. This could appear helpful in increasing a website's ranking, because external links are one of the most important factors determining a website's ranking.  However, John Mueller of [[Google]] has stated that this \"can lead to a tremendous number of unnatural links for your site\" with a negative impact on site ranking.<ref name=\"CanBeHarmful\">{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=Barry |authorlink=Barry Schwartz (technologist) |url=https://www.seroundtable.com/search-engine-submission-google-15906.html |title=Google: Search Engine Submission Services Can Be Harmful |work=[[Search Engine Roundtable]] |date=2012-10-29 |accessdate=2016-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|\n* [[Comparison of web search engines]]\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n* [[List of search engines]]\n* [[Question answering]]\n* [[Filter bubble]]\n* [[Google effect]]\n* [[Internet search engines and libraries|Use of web search engines in libraries]]\n* [[Semantic Web]]\n* [[Spell checker]]\n* [[Web development tools]]\n* [[Search engine manipulation effect]]\n* [[Search engine privacy]]\n}}\n\n== References  ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal | author =Steve Lawrence; C.

traditional state in [[Nsukka]] Local Government Area of [[Enugu State]], [[Nigeria]]. A culturally rich, stable traditional political system with institutions of government dating back 900 years, it is one of the oldest civilisations in existence pre-colonial Nigeria. Today, it is made up of three autonomous communities/towns, listed in order of seniority: Akpa-Edem, Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani <ref>Edem Autonomous Communities http://www.ebeano.org/LocalGovernments.html</ref> but unified as a culturally inviolable and indivisible federated entity.\n\nEdem has an area of {{convert|50.492|km2|abbr=on}} with several hills providing stunning views from multiple points.  The population of Edem is 39,633 based on the National Population Commission census conducted in 2006.\n\nEdem shares common borders with [[Obimo]] on the south, [[Nsukka]] on the east, [[Ibagwa Ani]] on the north, and Nrobo on the west.  Towns along the border include Okpuje near Owa and Egu Amegu, Abbi near Egu Amegu Abbi, Ugwuoke Ugwuinyi near Egu Amegu, and Ero Uno near Edem-Ani.\n\nThe people of Edem are from the [[Igala people|Igala]] ethnic group but currently, located in the South East of Nigeria since the division of the country into states and geopolitical zones.  Due to their ancestry and proximity to [[Northern Nigeria]], as well as their location in the northern part of [[Igboland]], they are referred to as Northern Igbos. \n\n==Composition of Edem==\nEdem is made up of 38 villages:\n\n'''Akpa-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Oba\n* Amadiuba\n* Amadimogo\n* Amankwa\n* Dimunazu\n* Igoro Agbo\n* Igoro Ugwu\n* Isamani\n* Nkawushi\n* Okiti\n* Owa-Edem\n* Uwenu Na Uwani Obeke\n\n'''Ozi-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Uwenu\n* Amabunegu\n* Amamkpume\n* Amaudo\n* Amaukpa\n* Amaukwa\n* Dimoke\n* Ikwe Ezike\n* Obinegun \n* Ukpara\n* Umueyi\n* Umuoji\n* Umoko\n\n'''Edem-Ani Zone'''\n\n* Amaenu-Edem\n* Amaezumesu\n* Amaogwu\n* Isu\n* Nkofi\n* Odojo\n* Ogbododu\n* Owere-Ugwu\n* Owereagbo\n* Ozara\n* Ubogidi\n* Umuchiagwu\n* Umuchioke\n* Uwani-Edem\nEach of the villages is headed by an [[Onyishi]] according to their culture and traditions.\n\n==Life and Religion==\nEdem is known for having [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indigene#English indigenes] that live very long, frequently over 100 years.  This may be attributed to the quality of life or other factors.<ref>Oldest Man in Nigeria http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/news/national/2006/oct/25/national-25-10-2006-04.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118112440/http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/news/national/2006/oct/25/national-25-10-2006-04.htm |date=2006-11-18 }}</ref>\n\nChristianity is one of the main religions in Edem.

The people practice [[shifting cultivation]] and [[crop rotation]].\n\n[[Cash Crop|Cash crops]]: kolanuts, oil beans, [[breadfruit]], black-eyed beans, brown beans, yams, cocoyams, [[cowpea]]s, maize, cotton, and groundnuts.\n\nFruits: citrus fruits (tangerines, lemons, limes, grapefruits, and oranges), cashews, avocado pears, guavas, pawpaws, pineapples, bananas, watermelons, mangoes, pears, African star apples, black apples, blue apples, showasho and [[irvingia]](wild mangoes or bush mangoes).\n\nVegetables: light green [[amaranth]], dark green amaranth, ahihara, waterleaves, [[Vernonia|bitterleaves]], pumpkins, [[Eggplant|garden eggs]], [[Telfairia occidentalis|fluted pumpkins]], okra, red chili peppers, yellow chili peppers, [[alligator pepper]]s and black pepper.\n\nDue to the rocky nature of certain parts of Edem, another significant economic activity is the small-scale manual production of stone for construction.\n\n== Tourism ==\nNatural features that visitors can view include the Akatakata Waterfalls from Ugwu Ovo (\"Ovo hill\") down to Igoro Agbo, Okpu cave and stream in Nkawushi and a valley from Amaho down to Owa, all in Akpa-Edem.\n\nAnother major tourist attraction is the year-round hunting. The kingdom has large, thick forests where various types of wild animals can be hunted. These forests have some trees that are over a 100 years old.\n\nEdem has a beneficial temperature throughout the year. The lowest temperature is 19&nbsp;\u00b0C (66&nbsp;\u00b0F) and the hottest is 33&nbsp;\u00b0C (91&nbsp;\u00b0F), whether in the rainy season or dry season.\n\n==Festivals==\nThe five main festivals celebrated at different times of the year and, in some cases, on a zone-by-zone basis are as follows: Onunu Edem, Omabe Festival (celebrated in three stages: Uda Omabe, Ulo Omabe and Okiti Omabe), Egba Chukwu, Okputukputu Eze Edem and Edem Week.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{LGAs and communities of Enugu State}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Enugu State]]\n[[Category:Towns in Enugu
