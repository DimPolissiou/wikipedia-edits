Philip Dulaine ([[Maurice Chevalier]]) is the founder and CEO of Dulaine Enterprises and Cynthia is his closest surviving relative and heir. He tells her that his dying wish is for her to find the right man to marry. She's happy to tell him of the \"kind, considerate and handsome\" Warren Palmer whom Philip has never met and whom she has recently become engaged. Philip asks to meet Warren as soon as possible for the end seems close at hand.\n\nStuck in Boston because of airport difficulties, Warren is unable to be with Cynthia. Realizing that Philip will die a happier man if he can meet her fianc\u00e9, Cynthia approaches a stranger and asks if he would pose as Warren for an introduction to her grandfather. This man is Paul Benton ([[Robert Goulet]]), who has invented a heat-proof paint and desperately wants an audience with Philip Dulaine whose company has a contract with NASA. So, Benton agrees and the ruse is pulled off very successfully with Philip favorably impressed by the young man he believes to be Cynthia's fianc\u00e9. Especially after Philip makes the two kiss and sees Cynthia kick off her shoes just as her grandmother always did when Philip and she would kiss.\n\nPhilip tells the \"couple\" that Dulaine Enterprises is in danger of a hostile take-over and implores Cynthia to meet with the board to try to save the company. He insists against her protest that she take her \"fianc\u00e9\" along. The meeting at first proves disastrous for Cynthia until Benton announces that Cynthia will put her own money into the company. This satisfies the board, but Cynthia later tells Benton she is outraged with him for offering up her money without checking with her first. However, she does help him by sending him off on an interview with the best person at the company to help get his paint invention tested by NASA.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the Dulaine mansion and unbeknown to Cynthia, Philip has unexpectedly recovered and feels as healthy as ever. Throughout the rest of the film, he and his nurse ([[Hermione Gingold]]) perform a comical cat and mouse game - she trying to stop him from smoking the many cigars he has hidden around the mansion.\n\nPhilip learns of Benton's success with the board and now surely approves of his granddaughter's choice in a fianc\u00e9. But then Philip learns all about the ruse when he overhears Cynthia tell Benton that his presence is no longer required since the real Warren Palmer is arriving that afternoon.\n\nBecause Philip likes Paul Benton so much and thinks he is the right man for his granddaughter, he continues to pretend to be at death's door. Whenever Cynthia tries to tell him who her real fianc\u00e9 is, he coughs and feigns a weak heart making her afraid to shock him in any way. This makes it necessary for Benton to stick around and Philip uses the situation to his advantage - playing matchmaker in an attempt to ensure his granddaughter's happiness. After all, Philip is certain Benton spells true love for Cynthia since she cannot keep her shoes on whenever they are together.\n\nLater that afternoon, the real Warren Palmer arrives at the Dulaine mansion and is reluctantly forced to pose as Paul Benton. Meanwhile, Benton realizes he's fallen for Cynthia, so he manages to hamper some late night amorous activity between the engaged couple and also boobie-traps a romantic getaway they go off on together. In the car on the way over, Palmer serenades Cynthia with the song \"[[Almost There (Andy Williams song)|We're Almost There]]\". But their rendezvous is sabotaged by the jealous Benton and they are forced to return early.\n\nPhilip sends Cynthia and Benton to attend a shareholders' dinner dance, a scheme to have them spend more time together. They have a very enjoyable evening, until it ends up with the two rivals for Cynthia's affection fist fighting on the mansion's lawn.\n\nFinally Philip tells Cynthia that he is no longer dying and that her recent foot problems, just like her grandmother's condition, signifies which of the two men she truly loves. After a few more comedic scenes, Cynthia breaks off her engagement with Warren Palmer and winds up with Paul Benton.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Dee]] as Cynthia Dulaine\n* [[Robert Goulet]] as Paul Benton\n* [[Andy Williams]] as Warren Palmer\n* [[Maurice Chevalier]] as Philip Dulaine\n* [[Gene Raymond]] as Martin Wood\n* [[Charles Ruggles]] as Dr. Charles Crandall\n* [[Hermione Gingold]] as Miss Grimshaw\n* [[Allen Jenkins]] as Fred\n* [[Laurie Main]] as Harrison\n* [[Dort Clark]] as Albert\n* [[Hayden Rorke]] as MacDougall\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film was originally known as ''The Richest Girl in Town'' and was a remake of ''[[It Happened With Eve]]''.

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarking.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>\n\nOf the 7 whole or reconstructed vessels, 5 are of the type Fifield Bold, one of Huber Trailed, and one that is stylistically different from either Fisher or Huber.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted, and 4 types make up the vast majority of vessels.  The most common type is sharply everted with flat lip; the other most common forms are sharply everted with pointed lip, sharply everted and lip thickened to the interior, and sharply everted with flat lip thickened to the exterior.  The most common form of decoration observed on body sherds was medium parallel lines.  This was true for both plain and cordmarked surfaces but the trend was more pronounced with the cordmarked surfaces.  Wide-notched lip decoration was most common; many were medium notched or unnotched but few were fine-notched.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 62.5%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 6%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 1.5%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 23.5%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - about 5% of the assemblage was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Great Lakes]] and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  4% of Fisher sherds/vessels were classified as Fifield Trailed and 1% were Fiflield Bold.\n* Other types - 1%\n\n=== Chronology of Hoxie Farm pottery within the Huber sequence ===\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age. Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers no. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref>\n\nIn the Hoxie Farm site assemblage, 23.5%  of sherds are cordmarked, which is more than on any other Huber Culture site. Fine-line decoration is present on only 13% of decorated sherds.

James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the Oneota Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the only one that has been found in association with early Historic European trade goods.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  Hoxie Farm, Griesmer and Moccasin Bluff are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the Oneota tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like Fifield, where Fisher pottery is associated with late Prehistoric artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the Protohistoric or early Historic period.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe artifacts present at Hoxie Farm represent a well-rounded view of life in the Huber culture.  Several items of personal adornment were found here, such as hair accessories, bracelets, and pendants.  Domestic items include knives, scrapers, chisels, needles, and awls.  The bone or antler dice implies games or gambling went on at the site; gambling among Native American tribes has been well-documented.  A bone rasp indicates music was being performed for entertainment or for ceremonial purposes.  The presence of stemmed pipes and several pieces of art with magical or spiritual overtones reflects on the spiritual life of the community.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nThere is direct evidence of cultivated plants at Hoxie Farm. The remains of [[maize]] were found along with hoes made of bison scapula and elk scapula.  Deer bone was also present in abundance, along with arrowheads for bows-and-arrows, indicating the site residents still relied on hunting; and fish and turtle were also present in the animal bone remains, so they were also exploiting food resources of the nearby marshes and creeks.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nWith regards to seasonality of occupation, based on an analysis of the animal bone remains, the researchers determined the site was occupied from at least spring through fall.  In fact the site may have been occupied year-round since there are storage pits to keep food during the winter.  The presence of non-utilitarian items for music, games and religion also implies an extended residence.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nDespite the fact that the Hoxie Farm site had European trade goods and thus was occupied at a very late date in prehistory, the pottery traits indicate an early placement in the Huber sequence.  The answer may be that the site was occupied longer than the other Huber sites, and therefore the pottery from the entire Huber sequence is present, with early and late types intermixed.  Since the site was not stratified, there was no way for the researchers to segregate artifacts from different time periods.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | editor = James A.

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarking.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>\n\nOf the 7 whole or reconstructed vessels, 5 are of the type Fifield Bold, one of Huber Trailed, and one that is stylistically different from either Fisher or Huber.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted, and 4 types make up the vast majority of vessels.  The most common type is sharply everted with flat lip; the other most common forms are sharply everted with pointed lip, sharply everted and lip thickened to the interior, and sharply everted with flat lip thickened to the exterior.  The most common form of decoration observed on body sherds was medium parallel lines.  This was true for both plain and cordmarked surfaces but the trend was more pronounced with the cordmarked surfaces.  Wide-notched lip decoration was most common; many were medium notched or unnotched but few were fine-notched.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 62.5%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 6%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 1.5%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 23.5%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - about 5% of the assemblage was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Great Lakes]] and was at least partially coterminous with Huber.

Though its reading of peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp<small>O</small><sub>2</sub>) is not always identical to the more desirable reading of arterial oxygen saturation (Sa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub>) from [[arterial blood gas]] analysis, the two are correlated well enough that the safe, convenient, noninvasive, inexpensive pulse oximetry method is valuable for measuring oxygen saturation in [[medicine#Clinical practice|clinical]] use.\n\nIn its most common (transmissive) application mode, a sensor device is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, usually a [[fingertip]] or [[earlobe]], or in the case of an [[infant]], across a foot. The device passes two wavelengths of light through the body part to a photodetector. It measures the changing absorbance at each of the [[wavelength]]s, allowing it to determine the [[absorption spectroscopy|absorbances]] due to the pulsing [[arterial blood]] alone, excluding [[venous blood]], skin, bone, muscle, fat, and (in most cases) nail polish.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brand TM, Brand ME, Jay GD | title = Enamel nail polish does not interfere with pulse oximetry among normoxic volunteers | journal = Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 93\u20136 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 12212998 | doi = 10.1023/A:1016385222568 }}</ref>\n\nReflectance pulse oximetry is a less common alternative to transmissive pulse oximetry. This method does not require a thin section of the person's body and is therefore well suited to a universal application such as the feet, forehead, and chest, but it also has some limitations. Vasodilation and pooling of venous blood in the head due to compromised venous return to the heart can cause a combination of arterial and venous pulsations in the forehead region and lead to spurious Sp<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> results.  Such conditions occur while undergoing anesthesia with [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal intubation]] and mechanical ventilation or in patients in the [[Trendelenburg position]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = J\u00f8rgensen JS, Schmid ER, K\u00f6nig V, Faisst K, Huch A, Huch R | title = Limitations of forehead pulse oximetry | journal = Journal of Clinical Monitoring | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 253\u20136 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7561999 | doi = 10.1007/bf01617520 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1935, German physician Karl Matthes (1905\u20131962) developed the first 2-wavelength ear O<sub>2</sub> saturation meter with red and green filters (later red and infrared filters).

The concept is similar to today's conventional pulse oximetry, but was difficult to implement because of unstable [[photocell]]s and light sources; today this method is not used clinically. In 1964 Shaw assembled the first absolute reading ear oximeter, which used eight wavelengths of light.\n\nPulse oximetry was developed in 1972, by [[Takuo Aoyagi]] and Michio Kishi, bioengineers, at [[Nihon Kohden]] using the ratio of red to infrared light absorption of pulsating components at the measuring site.

From the operating room, the use of pulse oximetry rapidly spread throughout the hospital, first to [[recovery room]]s, and then to [[intensive care unit]]s. Pulse oximetry was of particular value in the neonatal unit where the patients do not thrive with inadequate oxygenation, but too much oxygen and fluctuations in oxygen concentration can lead to vision impairment or blindness from [[retinopathy of prematurity]] (ROP). Furthermore, obtaining an arterial blood gas from a neonatal patient is painful to the patient and a major cause of neonatal anemia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin JC, Strauss RG, Kulhavy JC, Johnson KJ, Zimmerman MB, Cress GA, Connolly NW, Widness JA | title = Phlebotomy overdraw in the neonatal intensive care nursery | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = E19 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10920175 | doi = 10.1542/peds.106.2.e19 }}</ref>  Motion artifact can be a significant limitation to pulse oximetry monitoring resulting in frequent false alarms and loss of data. This is because during motion and low peripheral [[perfusion]], many pulse oximeters cannot distinguish between pulsating arterial blood and moving venous blood, leading to underestimation of oxygen saturation.

The LEDs sequence through their cycle of one on, then the other, then both off about thirty times per second which allows the photodiode to respond to the red and infrared light separately and also adjust for the ambient light baseline.<ref name=\"oximetry\">{{cite web | url = http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=332 | title = Principles of pulse oximetry | work = Anaesthesia UK | date = 11 Sep 2004 |access-date=2015-02-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150224221820/http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=332 | archive-date=2015-02-24 }}</ref>\n\nThe amount of light that is transmitted (in other words, that is not absorbed) is measured, and separate normalized signals are produced for each wavelength.

Most monitors also display the pulse rate. Portable, battery-operated pulse oximeters are also available for transport or home blood-oxygen monitoring.\n\n===Advantages===\nPulse oximetry is particularly convenient for [[noninvasive]] continuous measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In contrast, blood gas levels must otherwise be determined in a laboratory on a drawn blood sample. Pulse oximetry is useful in any setting where a patient's [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] is unstable, including [[intensive care]], operating, recovery, emergency and hospital ward settings, [[aircraft pilot|pilots]] in unpressurized aircraft, for assessment of any patient's oxygenation, and determining the effectiveness of or need for supplemental [[oxygen]]. Although a pulse oximeter is used to monitor oxygenation, it cannot determine the metabolism of oxygen, or the amount of oxygen being used by a patient. For this purpose, it is necessary to also measure [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels. It is possible that it can also be used to detect abnormalities in ventilation. However, the use of a pulse oximeter to detect [[hypoventilation]] is impaired with the use of supplemental oxygen, as it is only when patients breathe room air that abnormalities in respiratory function can be detected reliably with its use. Therefore, the routine administration of supplemental oxygen may be unwarranted if the patient is able to maintain adequate oxygenation in room air, since it can result in hypoventilation going undetected.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu ES, Downs JB, Schweiger JW, Miguel RV, Smith RA | title = Supplemental oxygen impairs detection of hypoventilation by pulse oximetry | journal = Chest | volume = 126 | issue = 5 | pages = 1552\u20138 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15539726 | doi = 10.1378/chest.126.5.1552 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a6c3d035628f4f4e19da839a02240db7bc2a5763 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of their simplicity of use and the ability to provide continuous and immediate oxygen saturation values, pulse oximeters are of critical importance in [[emergency medicine]] and are also very useful for patients with respiratory or cardiac problems, especially [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], or for diagnosis of some [[sleep disorders]] such as [[apnea]] and [[hypopnea]].<ref name=\"Schlosshan_2004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schlosshan D, Elliott MW | title = Sleep . 3: Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome | journal = Thorax | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 347\u201352 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15047962 | pmc = 1763828 | doi = 10.1136/thx.2003.007179 }}</ref> Portable battery-operated pulse oximeters are useful for pilots operating in a non-pressurized aircraft above {{convert|10,000|feet|m}} or {{convert|12,500|feet|m}} in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/BA9AFBF96DBC56F0852566CF006798F9?OpenDocument&Highlight=oxygen |title=FAR Part 91 Sec. 91.211 effective as of 09/30/1963 |publisher=Airweb.faa.gov |date= |access-date=2015-04-02}}</ref> where supplemental oxygen is required. Portable pulse oximeters are also useful for mountain climbers and athletes whose oxygen levels may decrease at high [[altitudes]] or with exercise. Some portable pulse oximeters employ software that charts a patient's blood oxygen and pulse, serving as a reminder to check blood oxygen levels.\n\n===Limitations===\nPulse oximetry solely measures haemoglobin saturation, not [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] and is not a complete measure of respiratory sufficiency. It is not a substitute for [[blood gases]] checked in a laboratory, because it gives no indication of base deficit, carbon dioxide levels, blood [[pH]], or [[bicarbonate]] (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) concentration. The metabolism of oxygen can be readily measured by monitoring expired CO<sub>2</sub>, but saturation figures give no information about blood oxygen content. Most of the oxygen in the blood is carried by hemoglobin; in severe anemia, the blood contains less hemoglobin, which despite being saturated cannot carry as much oxygen. \n\nErroneously low readings may be caused by [[hypoperfusion]] of the extremity being used for monitoring (often due to a limb being cold, or from [[vasoconstriction]] secondary to the use of [[vasopressor]] agents); incorrect sensor application; highly [[Callus|calloused]] skin; or movement (such as shivering), especially during hypoperfusion. To ensure accuracy, the sensor should return a steady pulse and/or pulse waveform. Pulse oximetry technologies differ in their abilities to provide accurate data during conditions of motion and low perfusion.<ref name=\"Shah_2012\" /><ref name = \"Barker_2002\" />\n\nPulse oximetry also is not a complete measure of circulatory oxygen sufficiency. If there is insufficient [[Circulatory system|bloodflow]] or insufficient hemoglobin in the blood ([[anemia]]), tissues can suffer [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] despite high arterial oxygen saturation.\n\nSince pulse oximetry measures only the percentage of bound hemoglobin, a falsely high or falsely low reading will occur when hemoglobin binds to something other than oxygen:\n* Hemoglobin has a higher affinity to carbon monoxide than it does to oxygen, and a high reading may occur despite the patient's actually being hypoxemic. In cases of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], this inaccuracy may delay the recognition of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (low cellular oxygen level).\n* [[Cyanide poisoning]] gives a high reading because it reduces oxygen extraction from arterial blood. In this case, the reading is not false, as arterial blood oxygen is indeed high in early cyanide poisoning.\n* [[Methemoglobinemia]] characteristically causes pulse oximetry readings in the mid-80s.\n* COPD [especially chronic bronchitis] may cause false readings.<ref name=pmid26715772>{{cite journal | vauthors = Amalakanti S, Pentakota MR | title = Pulse Oximetry Overestimates Oxygen Saturation in COPD | journal = Respiratory Care | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 423\u20137 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26715772 | doi = 10.4187/respcare.04435 }}</ref>\n\nA noninvasive method that allows continuous measurement of the dyshemoglobins is the pulse [[CO-oximeter]], which was built in 2005 by Masimo.<ref>{{cite patent |country=UK |number=2320566  |status= |title= |pubdate= |gdate= |fdate= |pridate= |inventor= |invent1= |invent2= |assign1= |assign2= |class= |url=}}</ref> By using additional wavelengths,<ref name=\"MaiselEditorial\">{{Cite journal|last = Maisel | first = William | authorlink =  |author2=Roger J.

Most monitors also display the pulse rate. Portable, battery-operated pulse oximeters are also available for transport or home blood-oxygen monitoring.\n\n===Advantages===\nPulse oximetry is particularly convenient for [[noninvasive]] continuous measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In contrast, blood gas levels must otherwise be determined in a laboratory on a drawn blood sample. Pulse oximetry is useful in any setting where a patient's [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] is unstable, including [[intensive care]], operating, recovery, emergency and hospital ward settings, [[aircraft pilot|pilots]] in unpressurized aircraft, for assessment of any patient's oxygenation, and determining the effectiveness of or need for supplemental [[oxygen]]. Although a pulse oximeter is used to monitor oxygenation, it cannot determine the metabolism of oxygen, or the amount of oxygen being used by a patient. For this purpose, it is necessary to also measure [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels. It is possible that it can also be used to detect abnormalities in ventilation. However, the use of a pulse oximeter to detect [[hypoventilation]] is impaired with the use of supplemental oxygen, as it is only when patients breathe room air that abnormalities in respiratory function can be detected reliably with its use. Therefore, the routine administration of supplemental oxygen may be unwarranted if the patient is able to maintain adequate oxygenation in room air, since it can result in hypoventilation going undetected.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu ES, Downs JB, Schweiger JW, Miguel RV, Smith RA | title = Supplemental oxygen impairs detection of hypoventilation by pulse oximetry | journal = Chest | volume = 126 | issue = 5 | pages = 1552\u20138 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15539726 | doi = 10.1378/chest.126.5.1552 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a6c3d035628f4f4e19da839a02240db7bc2a5763 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of their simplicity of use and the ability to provide continuous and immediate oxygen saturation values, pulse oximeters are of critical importance in [[emergency medicine]] and are also very useful for patients with respiratory or cardiac problems, especially [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], or for diagnosis of some [[sleep disorders]] such as [[apnea]] and [[hypopnea]].<ref name=\"Schlosshan_2004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schlosshan D, Elliott MW | title = Sleep . 3: Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome | journal = Thorax | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 347\u201352 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15047962 | pmc = 1763828 | doi = 10.1136/thx.2003.007179 }}</ref> Portable battery-operated pulse oximeters are useful for pilots operating in a non-pressurized aircraft above {{convert|10,000|feet|m}} or {{convert|12,500|feet|m}} in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/BA9AFBF96DBC56F0852566CF006798F9?OpenDocument&Highlight=oxygen |title=FAR Part 91 Sec. 91.211 effective as of 09/30/1963 |publisher=Airweb.faa.gov |date= |access-date=2015-04-02}}</ref> where supplemental oxygen is required. Portable pulse oximeters are also useful for mountain climbers and athletes whose oxygen levels may decrease at high [[altitudes]] or with exercise. Some portable pulse oximeters employ software that charts a patient's blood oxygen and pulse, serving as a reminder to check blood oxygen levels.\n\n===Limitations===\nPulse oximetry solely measures hemoglobin saturation, not [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] and is not a complete measure of respiratory sufficiency. It is not a substitute for [[blood gases]] checked in a laboratory, because it gives no indication of base deficit, carbon dioxide levels, blood [[pH]], or [[bicarbonate]] (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) concentration. The metabolism of oxygen can be readily measured by monitoring expired CO<sub>2</sub>, but saturation figures give no information about blood oxygen content. Most of the oxygen in the blood is carried by hemoglobin; in severe anemia, the blood contains less hemoglobin, which despite being saturated cannot carry as much oxygen. \n\nErroneously low readings may be caused by [[hypoperfusion]] of the extremity being used for monitoring (often due to a limb being cold, or from [[vasoconstriction]] secondary to the use of [[vasopressor]] agents); incorrect sensor application; highly [[Callus|calloused]] skin; or movement (such as shivering), especially during hypoperfusion. To ensure accuracy, the sensor should return a steady pulse and/or pulse waveform. Pulse oximetry technologies differ in their abilities to provide accurate data during conditions of motion and low perfusion.<ref name=\"Shah_2012\" /><ref name = \"Barker_2002\" />\n\nPulse oximetry also is not a complete measure of circulatory oxygen sufficiency. If there is insufficient [[Circulatory system|bloodflow]] or insufficient hemoglobin in the blood ([[anemia]]), tissues can suffer [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] despite high arterial oxygen saturation.\n\nSince pulse oximetry measures only the percentage of bound hemoglobin, a falsely high or falsely low reading will occur when hemoglobin binds to something other than oxygen:\n* Hemoglobin has a higher affinity to carbon monoxide than it does to oxygen, and a high reading may occur despite the patient's actually being hypoxemic. In cases of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], this inaccuracy may delay the recognition of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (low cellular oxygen level).\n* [[Cyanide poisoning]] gives a high reading because it reduces oxygen extraction from arterial blood. In this case, the reading is not false, as arterial blood oxygen is indeed high in early cyanide poisoning.\n* [[Methemoglobinemia]] characteristically causes pulse oximetry readings in the mid-80s.\n* COPD [especially chronic bronchitis] may cause false readings.<ref name=pmid26715772>{{cite journal | vauthors = Amalakanti S, Pentakota MR | title = Pulse Oximetry Overestimates Oxygen Saturation in COPD | journal = Respiratory Care | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 423\u20137 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26715772 | doi = 10.4187/respcare.04435 }}</ref>\n\nA noninvasive method that allows continuous measurement of the dyshemoglobins is the pulse [[CO-oximeter]], which was built in 2005 by Masimo.<ref>{{cite patent |country=UK |number=2320566  |status= |title= |pubdate= |gdate= |fdate= |pridate= |inventor= |invent1= |invent2= |assign1= |assign2= |class= |url=}}</ref> By using additional wavelengths,<ref name=\"MaiselEditorial\">{{Cite journal|last = Maisel | first = William | authorlink =  |author2=Roger J.

She is the chair of the Department of Gender Studies at [[Charles University]] in Prague. She is the co-managing editor of ''Gender and Generation'', along with Kate\u0159ina Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1.\n\n==Biography==\nV\u011bra Sokolov\u00e1 was born in Czechoslovakia in 1970.{{sfn|Deutsche National Bibliothek|2020}} She earned a [[bachelor of science]] degree in geography at [[Charles University]] in 1992, before continuing her studies in the United States at [[California State University, Sacramento|California State University]] in Sacramento.{{sfn|Comparative History of Ideas Department|2014}} In the U. S., she studied history and cultural anthropology.{{sfn|Cerqueirov\u00e1|2004}} After graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' with a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in history in 1994, she completed a [[master's degree]] (1996) and a PhD in history at the [[University of Washington]] (2002).{{sfn|Comparative History of Ideas Department|2014}} Sokolov\u00e1 was one of the pioneering academics of gender studies in the Czech Republic, beginning to teach the subject before it was an accredited field in the country. She inaugurated the Queer Studies course in the arts faculty of Charles University in 2001.{{sfn|Hlup\u00e1|2003}} Since 2003 she has been the chair of the Department of Gender Studies in the Humanities Faculty of Charles University{{sfn|Comparative History of Ideas Department|2014}} and is the co-managing editor of the academic journal ''Gender and Generation'' of the department.{{sfn|Charles University|2015}}{{sfn|Havelkov\u00e1|Oates-Indruchov\u00e1|2014|p=x}} She has lectured abroad at the [[New School University]] in New York City, Baltimore's [[University of Maryland]] and the University of Washington.{{sfn|Hlup\u00e1|2003}} She also is a member of the Czech Republics Government Council's Committee for Sexual Minorities.{{sfn|Havelkov\u00e1|Oates-Indruchov\u00e1|2014|p=x}}\n\nSokolov\u00e1's research interests lie in the development of the idea of gender and its historic constructs in society. She has studied the history of the discipline, as it moved from women's studies, to feminist studies, and finally gender studies and is interested in the way that the definition of gender effects power relationships in society.{{sfn|Vodr\u00e1\u017eka|2009}} She has evaluated how feminist movements were different in Western and socialist countries, in that rather than a political movement, the state took over the mechanisms to modernize women's status in the East.{{sfn|Li\u0161kov\u00e1|2018|p=3}} She has analyzed the impact of the development of ethnic and gender studies on governmental policy. For example, under communism, [[Romani people|Roma]] ethnic groups were treated as deviant, but launching programs to reignite the study of the Romani people's ethnicity in the 1970s amplified their differences and escalated discrimination in society.{{sfn|Hegburg|2012|p=227}}{{sfn|Albert|Szilvasi|2017|p=26}} \nIn her studies on policy, Sokolov\u00e1 has shown that officials arbitrarily applied policy, based on ethnicity and gender. During the state socialist period, the national policy to increase births did not allow Czech and Slovak women to have abortions. Simultaneously a policy of forced sterilization was implemented on Romani women{{sfn|Bren|2010|p=168}} in an effort to correct falling birth rates among Czech and Slovak women.{{sfn|Albert|Szilvasi|2017|p=26}} \n\nAccording to Sokolov\u00e1, the invisibility of non-heterosexual lives in the Soviet period was erased with the birth of gender studies. Identification of homosexuals and lesbians created a consequence that they might be seen as criminals{{sfn|Li\u0161kov\u00e1|2018|pp=233\u2013234}} and hardened hetero-normative and binary definitions of society.{{sfn|Havelkov\u00e1|Oates-Indruchov\u00e1|2014|p=253}} She found that women's studies programs, or the interpretation of feminism projected to the country from Czech exiles living abroad, like [[Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd]],{{sfn|Cerqueirov\u00e1|2004}} created a disregard or anti-feminist reaction in the Czech Republic. This included lesbians, who were doubly discriminated against as women by society at large and as queer by the homosexual community.{{sfn|Sloboda|2010|p=5}} The Queer Studies course she launched at Charles University focuses on a critical analysis of how sexuality is used as a means of social control.{{sfn|Hlup\u00e1|2003}} She has been involved in the state television program for the LGBT community, known as ''Queer'' (formerly called ''LeGaTo'') since it began airing in 2004{{sfn|Cerqueirov\u00e1|2004}}{{sfn|Kulpa|Mizielinska|2016|p=132}} and participates in community activism on both a cultural and political level.{{sfn|Hlup\u00e1|2003}}\n\n==Selected works==\n*{{cite book |last=Sokolov\u00e1 |first=V\u011bra |editor-last1=Isaacs |editor-first1=Ann Katherine |title=Political Systems and Definitions of Gender Roles |date=2001 |publisher=Edizioni Plus, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa |location=Pisa |isbn=978-88-8492-072-0 |chapter=Representations of Homosexuality and the Separation of Gender and Sexuality in the Czech Republic Before and After 1989 |pages=273\u2013288}}\n*{{cite book |last=Sokolov\u00e1 |first=V\u011bra |editor-last1=Forrester |editor-first1=Sibelan |editor-last2=Zaborowska |editor-first2=Magdalena J. |editor-last3=Gapova |editor-first3=Elena |title=Over the Wall/After the Fall: Post-Communist Cultures through an East-West Gaze |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBxskEjDtkQC&pg=PA251 |date=2004 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=0-253-11035-1 |chapter='Don't Get Pricked!'

race walker|Vera Sokolova}}\n'''V\u011bra Sokolov\u00e1''' (born 1970) is a Czech academic who specializes in [[gender studies]] and specifically focuses on identity policy and the construction of sexuality from a historical and social perspective, evaluating the power, structuring and defining of sexuality to transcend binary boundaries. She is the chair of the Department of Gender Studies at [[Charles University]] in Prague. She is the co-managing editor of ''Gender and Generation'', along with Kate\u0159ina Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1.\n\n==Biography==\nV\u011bra Sokolov\u00e1 was born in Czechoslovakia in 1970.{{sfn|Deutsche National Bibliothek|2020}} She earned a [[bachelor of science]] degree in geography at [[Charles University]] in 1992, before continuing her studies in the United States at [[California State University, Sacramento|California State University]] in Sacramento.{{sfn|Comparative History of Ideas Department|2014}} In the U. S., she studied history and cultural anthropology.{{sfn|Cerqueirov\u00e1|2004}} After graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' with a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in history in 1994, she completed a [[master's degree]] (1996) and a PhD in history at the [[University of Washington]] (2002).{{sfn|Comparative History of Ideas Department|2014}} Sokolov\u00e1 was one of the pioneering academics of gender studies in the Czech Republic, beginning to teach the subject before it was an accredited field in the country. She inaugurated the Queer Studies course in the arts faculty of Charles University in 2001.{{sfn|Hlup\u00e1|2003}} Since 2003 she has been the chair of the Department of Gender Studies in the Humanities Faculty of Charles University{{sfn|Comparative History of Ideas Department|2014}} and is the co-managing editor of the academic journal ''Gender and Generation'' of the department.{{sfn|Charles University|2015}}{{sfn|Havelkov\u00e1|Oates-Indruchov\u00e1|2014|p=x}} She has lectured abroad at the [[New School University]] in New York City, Baltimore's [[University of Maryland]] and the University of Washington.{{sfn|Hlup\u00e1|2003}} She also is a member of the Czech Republics Government Council's Committee for Sexual Minorities.{{sfn|Havelkov\u00e1|Oates-Indruchov\u00e1|2014|p=x}}\n\nSokolov\u00e1's research interests lie in the development of the idea of gender and its historic constructs in society. She has studied the history of the discipline, as it moved from women's studies, to feminist studies, and finally gender studies and is interested in the way that the definition of gender effects power relationships in society.{{sfn|Vodr\u00e1\u017eka|2009}} She has evaluated how feminist movements were different in Western and socialist countries, in that rather than a political movement, the state took over the mechanisms to modernize women's status in the East.{{sfn|Li\u0161kov\u00e1|2018|p=3}} She has analyzed the impact of the development of ethnic and gender studies on governmental policy. For example, under communism, [[Romani people|Roma]] ethnic groups were treated as deviant, but launching programs to reignite the study of the Romani people's ethnicity in the 1970s amplified their differences and escalated discrimination in society.{{sfn|Hegburg|2012|p=227}}{{sfn|Albert|Szilvasi|2017|p=26}} \nIn her studies on policy, Sokolov\u00e1 has shown that officials arbitrarily applied policy, based on ethnicity and gender. During the state socialist period, the national policy to increase births did not allow Czech and Slovak women to have abortions. Simultaneously a policy of forced sterilization was implemented on Romani women{{sfn|Bren|2010|p=168}} in an effort to correct falling birth rates among Czech and Slovak women.{{sfn|Albert|Szilvasi|2017|p=26}} \n\nAccording to Sokolov\u00e1, the invisibility of non-heterosexual lives in the Soviet period was erased with the birth of gender studies. Identification of homosexuals and lesbians created a consequence that they might be seen as criminals{{sfn|Li\u0161kov\u00e1|2018|pp=233\u2013234}} and hardened hetero-normative and binary definitions of society.{{sfn|Havelkov\u00e1|Oates-Indruchov\u00e1|2014|p=253}} She found that women's studies programs, or the interpretation of feminism projected to the country from Czech exiles living abroad, like [[Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd]],{{sfn|Cerqueirov\u00e1|2004}} created a disregard or anti-feminist reaction in the Czech Republic. This included lesbians, who were doubly discriminated against as women by society at large and as queer by the homosexual community.{{sfn|Sloboda|2010|p=5}} The Queer Studies course she launched at Charles University focuses on a critical analysis of how sexuality is used as a means of social control.{{sfn|Hlup\u00e1|2003}} She has been involved in the state television program for the LGBT community, known as ''Queer'' (formerly called ''LeGaTo'') since it began airing in 2004{{sfn|Cerqueirov\u00e1|2004}}{{sfn|Kulpa|Mizielinska|2016|p=132}} and participates in community activism on both a cultural and political level.{{sfn|Hlup\u00e1|2003}}\n\n==Selected works==\n*{{cite book |last=Sokolov\u00e1 |first=V\u011bra |editor-last1=Isaacs |editor-first1=Ann Katherine |title=Political Systems and Definitions of Gender Roles |date=2001 |publisher=Edizioni Plus, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa |location=Pisa |isbn=978-88-8492-072-0 |chapter=Representations of Homosexuality and the Separation of Gender and Sexuality in the Czech Republic Before and After 1989 |pages=273\u2013288}}\n*{{cite book |last=Sokolov\u00e1 |first=V\u011bra |editor-last1=Forrester |editor-first1=Sibelan |editor-last2=Zaborowska |editor-first2=Magdalena J. |editor-last3=Gapova |editor-first3=Elena |title=Over the Wall/After the Fall: Post-Communist Cultures through an East-West Gaze |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBxskEjDtkQC&pg=PA251 |date=2004 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=0-253-11035-1 |chapter='Don't Get Pricked!'

Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09b9\u09af\u09cb\u0997\u09bf\u09a4\u09be}} '''''sh\u00f4'''-h\u00f4-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' \"cooperation\", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n===Consonant clusters===\n{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side).

However, throughout history there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in [[Perso-Arabic]].

The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/>\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=IAST1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=ITRANS1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=NatLib>{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=UCLA1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\"/> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-\u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].\n\nIn most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided in to 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in term of usages, cases are generally grouped in to only 4 categories.\n\n{| style=\"align:center; width:60%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Singular noun inflection\n!\n!

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+ Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.''

Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''.

Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09b9\u09af\u09cb\u0997\u09bf\u09a4\u09be}} '''''sh\u00f4'''-h\u00f4-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' \"cooperation\", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n===Consonant clusters===\n{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side).

However, throughout history there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in [[Perso-Arabic]].

The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/>\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=IAST1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=ITRANS1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=NatLib>{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=UCLA1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\"/> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-\u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].\n\nIn most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided in to 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in term of usages, cases are generally grouped in to only 4 categories.\n\n{| style=\"align:center; width:60%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Singular noun inflection\n!\n!

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+ Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.''

Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''.
