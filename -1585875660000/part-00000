If {{mvar|g}}\u2080 is finite, then  {{mvar|g}}<sub>obs</sub> tends to zero in the limit of infinite cut-off {{mvar|\u039b}}.\n\nIn fact, the proper interpretation of Eq.1 consists in its inversion, so that {{mvar|g}}\u2080 (related to the length scale 1/{{mvar|\u039b}}) is chosen to give a correct value of   {{mvar|g}}<sub>obs</sub>,\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>g_0=\\frac{g_{obs}}{1-\\beta_2 g_{obs} \\ln \\Lambda/m}~.</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nThe growth of {{mvar|g}}\u2080 with {{mvar|\u039b}} invalidates Eqs. ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) in the region {{mvar|g}}\u2080 \u2248 1 (since they were obtained for {{mvar|g}}\u2080 \u226a 1) and the existence of the \u201cLandau pole\" in Eq.2 has no physical meaning.\n\nThe actual behavior of the charge {{math|''g(\u03bc)''}} as a function of the momentum scale {{mvar|\u03bc}} is determined by the full [[Renormalization group|Gell-Mann\u2013Low equation]]\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\\frac{dg}{d \\ln \\mu} =\\beta(g)=\\beta_2 g^2+\\beta_3 g^3+\\ldots ~,</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\nwhich gives Eqs.({{EquationNote|1}}),({{EquationNote|2}}) if it is integrated under conditions {{math|''g(\u03bc)'' {{=}}''g''<sub>obs</sub>}} for {{mvar|\u03bc}} = {{mvar|m}} and {{math|''g(\u03bc)''}} = {{mvar|g}}\u2080  for  {{mvar|\u03bc}} = {{mvar|\u039b}}, when only the term with <math>\\beta_2</math> is retained in the right hand side.\n\nThe general behavior of <math>g(\\mu)</math> relies on the appearance of the function  {{math|''\u03b2(g)''}}.

Indeed, if {{mvar|g}}<sub>obs</sub> is finite, the theory is internally inconsistent. The only way to avoid it, is to tend <math>\\mu_0</math> to infinity, which is possible only for {{mvar|g}}<sub>obs</sub> \u2192 0.\n\n==Conclusions==\n\nAs a result, the question of whether the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] is nontrivial remains a serious unresolved question. Theoretical proofs of triviality of the pure scalar field theory exist, but the situation for the full standard model is unknown.  The implied constraints  on the standard model have been discussed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Callaway | first1 = D. \n| last2 = Petronzio | first2 = R. \n| doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(87)90657-2 \n| title = Is the standard model Higgs mass predictable? \n| journal = [[Nuclear Physics B]]\n| volume = 292 \n| pages = 497\u2013526 \n| year = 1987 \n| pmid =  \n| pmc = \n|bibcode = 1987NuPhB.292..497C | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/172532 \n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=I.

Indeed, if {{mvar|g}}<sub>obs</sub> is finite, the theory is internally inconsistent. The only way to avoid it, is to tend <math>\\mu_0</math> to infinity, which is possible only for {{mvar|g}}<sub>obs</sub> \u2192 0.\n\n==Conclusions==\n\nAs a result, the question of whether the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] is nontrivial remains a serious unresolved question. Theoretical proofs of triviality of the pure scalar field theory exist, but the situation for the full standard model is unknown.  The implied constraints  on the standard model have been discussed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Callaway | first1 = D. \n| last2 = Petronzio | first2 = R. \n| doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(87)90657-2 \n| title = Is the standard model Higgs mass predictable? \n| journal = [[Nuclear Physics B]]\n| volume = 292 \n| pages = 497\u2013526 \n| year = 1987 \n| pmid =  \n| pmc = \n|bibcode = 1987NuPhB.292..497C | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/172532 \n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=I.

Although the magnetic charges do not exist, it can be useful to think of them in this way. In particular, the arrangement of magnetization that reduces the magnetic energy can often be understood in terms of the ''pole-avoidance principle'', which states that the magnetization tries to reduce the poles as much as possible.<ref name=AharoniText/>\n\n==Effect on magnetization==\n\n===Single domain===\n<imagemap>File:SingleDomainMagneticCharges.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of the magnetic charges at the surface of a single-domain ferromagnet. The arrows indicate the direction of magnetization. The thickness of the colored region indicates the surface charge density.\ndefault [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/SingleDomainMagneticCharges.svg direct SVG link]\n</imagemap>\nOne way to remove the magnetic poles inside a ferromagnet is to make the magnetization uniform. This occurs in [[single-domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] ferromagnets. This still leaves the surface poles, so division into [[magnetic domains|domains]] reduces the poles further. However, very small ferromagnets are kept uniformly magnetized by the [[exchange interaction]].\n\nThe concentration of poles depends on the direction of magnetization (see the figure). If the magnetization is along the longest axis, the poles are spread across a smaller surface, so the energy is lower. This is a form of [[magnetic anisotropy]] called ''shape anisotropy''.\n\n===Multiple domains===\n[[File:ClosureDomainDemo.svg|thumb|left|Illustration of a magnet with four magnetic closure domains. The magnetic charges contributed by each domain are pictured at one domain wall. The charges balance, so the total charge is zero.]]\nIf the ferromagnet is large enough, its magnetization can divide into [[magnetic domains|domains]]. It is then possible to have the magnetization parallel to the surface. Within each domain the magnetization is uniform, so there are no volume poles, but there are surface poles at the interfaces ([[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain walls]]) between domains. However, these poles vanish if the magnetic moments on each side of the domain wall meet the wall at the same angle (so that the components {{math| '''n''' \u00b7 '''M'''}} are the same but opposite in sign). Domains configured this way are called ''closure domains''.\n\n==Demagnetizing factor==\nAn arbitrarily shaped magnetic object has a total magnetic field that varies with location inside the object and can be quite difficult to calculate.  This makes it very difficult to determine the magnetic properties of a material such as, for instance, how the magnetization of a material varies with the magnetic field.  For a uniformly magnetized sphere in a uniform magnetic field {{math|'''H'''<sub>0</sub>}} the internal magnetic field {{math|'''H'''}} is uniform:\n\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\\mathbf{H}=\\mathbf{H}_0 - \\frac{\\gamma}{4\\pi} \\mathbf{M}_0,</math>|{{EquationRef|11}}}}\n\nwhere {{math|'''M'''<sub>0</sub>}} is the magnetization of the sphere and {{math|<var>\u03b3</var>}} is called the demagnetizing factor and equals {{math|4<var>\u03c0</var>/3}} for a sphere.<ref name=Jackson/><ref name=Nayfeh/><ref name=Griffiths>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|loc=chapter 6}}</ref>\n\nThis equation can be generalized to include [[ellipsoid]]s having principal axes in x, y, and z directions such that each component has a relationship of the form:<ref name=Nayfeh/>\n\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>H_k=(H_0)_k - \\frac{\\gamma_k}{4\\pi} (M_0)_k, \\qquad  k = x,y,z.</math>|{{EquationRef|12}}}}\n\nOther important examples are an infinite plate (an ellipsoid with two of its axes going to infinity) which has {{math|<var>\u03b3</var>}} = {{math|4<var>\u03c0</var>}} in a direction normal to the plate and zero otherwise and an infinite cylinder (an ellipsoid with one of its axes tending toward infinity with the other two being the same) which has {{math|<var>\u03b3</var>}} = 0 along its axis and {{math|2<var>\u03c0</var>}} perpendicular to its axis.<ref>For tables or equations for the magnetizing factors of the general ellipsoid see {{cite journal\n|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.67.351\n|last = Osborn\n|first = J.

This ensures that the magnetic energy is finite.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown, Jr.|1962}}</ref> Sufficiently far away, the magnetic field looks like the field of a [[magnetic dipole]] with the same [[magnetic moment|moment]] as the finite body.\n\n===Uniqueness of the demagnetizing field===\n{{main|Uniqueness theorem for Poisson's equation}}\nAny two potentials that satisfy equations ({{EquationNote|5}}), ({{EquationNote|6}}) and ({{EquationNote|7}}), along with regularity at infinity, are identical. The demagnetizing field  {{math| '''H'''<sub>d</sub>}} is the gradient of this potential (equation {{EquationNote|4}}).\n\n===Energy===\nThe energy of the demagnetizing field is completely determined by an integral over the volume {{math| <var>V</var>}} of the magnet:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>E = -\\frac{\\mu_0}{2}\\int_\\text{magnet} \\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}_\\text{d} dV</math>|{{EquationRef|7}}}}\n\nSuppose there are two magnets with magnetizations {{math| '''M'''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math| '''M'''<sub>2</sub>}}.

Although the magnetic charges do not exist, it can be useful to think of them in this way. In particular, the arrangement of magnetization that reduces the magnetic energy can often be understood in terms of the ''pole-avoidance principle'', which states that the magnetization tries to reduce the poles as much as possible.<ref name=AharoniText/>\n\n==Effect on magnetization==\n\n===Single domain===\n<imagemap>File:SingleDomainMagneticCharges.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of the magnetic charges at the surface of a single-domain ferromagnet. The arrows indicate the direction of magnetization. The thickness of the colored region indicates the surface charge density.\ndefault [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/SingleDomainMagneticCharges.svg direct SVG link]\n</imagemap>\nOne way to remove the magnetic poles inside a ferromagnet is to make the magnetization uniform. This occurs in [[single-domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] ferromagnets. This still leaves the surface poles, so division into [[magnetic domains|domains]] reduces the poles further. However, very small ferromagnets are kept uniformly magnetized by the [[exchange interaction]].\n\nThe concentration of poles depends on the direction of magnetization (see the figure). If the magnetization is along the longest axis, the poles are spread across a smaller surface, so the energy is lower. This is a form of [[magnetic anisotropy]] called ''shape anisotropy''.\n\n===Multiple domains===\n[[File:ClosureDomainDemo.svg|thumb|left|Illustration of a magnet with four magnetic closure domains. The magnetic charges contributed by each domain are pictured at one domain wall. The charges balance, so the total charge is zero.]]\nIf the ferromagnet is large enough, its magnetization can divide into [[magnetic domains|domains]]. It is then possible to have the magnetization parallel to the surface. Within each domain the magnetization is uniform, so there are no volume poles, but there are surface poles at the interfaces ([[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain walls]]) between domains. However, these poles vanish if the magnetic moments on each side of the domain wall meet the wall at the same angle (so that the components {{math| '''n''' \u00b7 '''M'''}} are the same but opposite in sign). Domains configured this way are called ''closure domains''.\n\n==Demagnetizing factor==\nAn arbitrarily shaped magnetic object has a total magnetic field that varies with location inside the object and can be quite difficult to calculate.  This makes it very difficult to determine the magnetic properties of a material such as, for instance, how the magnetization of a material varies with the magnetic field.  For a uniformly magnetized sphere in a uniform magnetic field {{math|'''H'''<sub>0</sub>}} the internal magnetic field {{math|'''H'''}} is uniform:\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\mathbf{H}=\\mathbf{H}_0 - \\frac{\\gamma}{4\\pi} \\mathbf{M}_0,</math>|{{EquationRef|11}}}}\n\nwhere {{math|'''M'''<sub>0</sub>}} is the magnetization of the sphere and {{math|<var>\u03b3</var>}} is called the demagnetizing factor and equals {{math|4<var>\u03c0</var>/3}} for a sphere.<ref name=Jackson/><ref name=Nayfeh/><ref name=Griffiths>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|loc=chapter 6}}</ref>\n\nThis equation can be generalized to include [[ellipsoid]]s having principal axes in x, y, and z directions such that each component has a relationship of the form:<ref name=Nayfeh/>\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>H_k=(H_0)_k - \\frac{\\gamma_k}{4\\pi} (M_0)_k, \\qquad  k = x,y,z.</math>|{{EquationRef|12}}}}\n\nOther important examples are an infinite plate (an ellipsoid with two of its axes going to infinity) which has {{math|<var>\u03b3</var>}} = {{math|4<var>\u03c0</var>}} in a direction normal to the plate and zero otherwise and an infinite cylinder (an ellipsoid with one of its axes tending toward infinity with the other two being the same) which has {{math|<var>\u03b3</var>}} = 0 along its axis and {{math|2<var>\u03c0</var>}} perpendicular to its axis.<ref>For tables or equations for the magnetizing factors of the general ellipsoid see {{cite journal\n|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.67.351\n|last = Osborn\n|first = J.

It will assess the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal plasma and magnetic field, the energy flow that heats the solar corona and impels the solar wind, and the mechanisms that accelerate energetic particles.\n\nThe spacecraft's systems are protected from the extreme heat and radiation near the [[Sun]] by a solar shield.

The spacecraft systems and [[scientific instruments]] are located in the central portion of the shield's shadow, where direct radiation from the Sun is fully blocked. If the shield were not between the spacecraft and the Sun, the probe would be damaged and become inoperative within tens of seconds. As radio communication with Earth will take about eight minutes in each direction, the ''Parker Solar Probe'' will have to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself. This will be done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct [[sunlight]] coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from [[reaction wheels]] to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again. According to project scientist Nicky Fox, the team describe it as \"the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown\".{{r|bbc22jl18}}\n\nThe primary power for the mission is a dual system of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] ([[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic arrays]]). A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside {{Val|0.25|u=au}}, is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach. This secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain [[operating temperature]] of the solar panels and instrumentation.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090004577.pdf|title=Solar Power System Design for the Solar Probe+ Mission|conference=6th International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference |location=Cleveland, Ohio.|first1=Geoffrey A.|last1=Landis|first2=Paul C.|last2=Schmitz|first3=James|last3=Kinnison|first4=Martin|last4=Fraeman|first5=Lew|last5=Roufberg|first6=Steve|last6=Vernon |first7=Melissa |last7=Wirzburger|display-authors=1|date=July 28\u201330, 2008|id=AIAA 2008-5712}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techexplorist.com/traveling-sun-parker-solar-probe-melt/15586/ |title=Traveling to the Sun: Why won't Parker Solar Probe melt?|first=Pranjal|last=Mehar|website=Tech Explorist|date=July 20, 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Trajectory ==\n[[File:Animation of Parker Solar Probe trajectory.gif|thumb|right|An animation of ''Parker Solar Probe''{{'s}} trajectory from August 7, 2018 to August 29, 2025:<br/>{{legend2|magenta|''Parker Solar Probe''}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Yellow|[[Sun]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Lime|[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|[[Venus]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|RoyalBlue|[[Earth]]}}<br/>For more detailed animation, see [[:File:Animation of Parker Solar Probe trajectory.webm|this video.]]]]\n\nThe ''Parker Solar Probe'' mission design uses repeated [[gravity assist]]s at Venus to incrementally decrease its orbital [[perihelion]] to achieve a final altitude (above the surface) of approximately 8.5 solar radii, or about {{cvt|6|e6km|e6mi+au}}.<ref name=jhuapl>{{cite web|title=Solar Probe Plus: A NASA Mission to Touch the Sun|url=http://solarprobe.jhuapl.edu/|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory|date=September 4, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref> The spacecraft trajectory will include seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its elliptical orbit around the Sun, for a total of 24 orbits.{{r|extreme}} The near Sun radiation environment is predicted to cause spacecraft charging effects, radiation damage in materials and electronics, and communication interruptions, so the orbit will be highly elliptical with short times spent near the Sun.{{r|Fox 2016}}\n\nThe trajectory requires high launch energy, so the probe was launched on a [[Delta IV Heavy]] class [[launch vehicle]] and an upper stage based on the [[STAR-48|STAR 48BV]] solid rocket motor.{{r|Fox 2016}} Interplanetary [[gravity assist]]s will provide further deceleration relative to its [[heliocentric orbit]], which will result in a heliocentric speed record at [[perihelion]].{{r|Delta 4}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scharf|first1=Caleb A.|title=The Fastest Spacecraft Ever?|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-fastest-spacecraft-ever/|website=Scientific American Blog Network|language=en}}</ref> As the probe passes around the [[Sun]], it will achieve a velocity of up to {{cvt|200|km/s}}, which will temporarily make it the fastest human-made object, almost three times as fast as the previous record holder, [[Helios (spacecraft)#Helios-B|Helios-2]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0023.shtml|title=Aircraft Speed Records|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2014 |website=Aerospaceweb.org|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66135-fastest-spacecraft-speed|title=Fastest spacecraft speed|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2015|website=guinnessworldrecords.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219024804/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66135-fastest-spacecraft-speed |archive-date=December 19, 2016 |url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Parker Solar Probe \u2013 Check123, Video Encyclopedia|url=https://www.check123.com/videos/13450-parker-solar-probe|language=en|accessdate=June 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810211059/https://www.check123.com/videos/13450-parker-solar-probe|archive-date=August 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Like every object in an orbit, due to gravity the spacecraft will accelerate as it nears perihelion, then slow down again afterward until it reaches its [[aphelion]].\n\n==Mission==\n[[File:Parker Solar Probe Launch (NHQ201808120013).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Launch of ''Parker Solar Probe'' in 2018.]]\n[[File:Magnificent CME Erupts on the Sun - August 31.jpg|thumb|The overall goal is to increase understanding of Earth's star, the Sun{{mdash}} an astronomical body of immense impact on the Earth and the Solar System due to its release of light and solar wind, in addition to its large gravity.

On the second flyby, the period shortens to 130 days. After less than two orbits (only 198 days later) it encounters Venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of Venus. This encounter shortens its period to half of that of Venus, or about 112.5 days. After two orbits it meets Venus a fourth time at about the same place, shortening its period to about 102 days. After 237 days it meets Venus for the fifth time and its period is shortened to about 96 days, three-sevenths that of Venus. It then makes seven orbits while Venus makes three. The sixth encounter, almost two years after the fifth, brings its period down to 92 days, two-fifths that of Venus. After five more orbits (two orbits of Venus) it meets Venus for the seventh and last time, decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the Sun.<ref name=the_mission>See data and figure at {{cite web |url=http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Journey-to-the-Sun |title=Solar Probe Plus: The Mission |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image |Velocity of Parker Solar Probe wide.svg |900px |The speed of the probe and distance from the Sun, from launch until 2026.

It will assess the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal plasma and magnetic field, the energy flow that heats the solar corona and impels the solar wind, and the mechanisms that accelerate energetic particles.\n\nThe spacecraft's systems are protected from the extreme heat and radiation near the [[Sun]] by a solar shield. Incident solar radiation at perihelion is approximately {{val|{{#expr:475*1.361 round -1}}|u=kW|up=m2}}, or 475 times the [[solar constant|intensity at Earth orbit]].{{r|extreme|Fox 2016|p2=31}} The solar shield is hexagonal, mounted on the Sun-facing side of the spacecraft, {{cvt|2.3|m|ft}} in diameter,{{r|jhuapl}} {{cvt|11.4|cm}} thick, and is made of [[reinforced carbon\u2013carbon]] composite, which is designed to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft of about {{cvt|2500|F|C|order=flip}}.<ref name=extreme />\n\n[[File:Parker Solar Probe.webm|thumb|right|The NASA's ''Parker Solar Probe'' during extensive environmental testing.]]\nA white reflective [[alumina]] surface layer minimizes absorption. The spacecraft systems and [[scientific instruments]] are located in the central portion of the shield's shadow, where direct radiation from the Sun is fully blocked. If the shield were not between the spacecraft and the Sun, the probe would be damaged and become inoperative within tens of seconds. As radio communication with Earth will take about eight minutes in each direction, the ''Parker Solar Probe'' will have to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself. This will be done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct [[sunlight]] coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from [[reaction wheels]] to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again. According to project scientist Nicky Fox, the team describe it as \"the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown\".{{r|bbc22jl18}}\n\nThe primary power for the mission is a dual system of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] ([[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic arrays]]). A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside {{Val|0.25|u=au}}, is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach. This secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain [[operating temperature]] of the solar panels and instrumentation.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090004577.pdf|title=Solar Power System Design for the Solar Probe+ Mission|conference=6th International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference |location=Cleveland, Ohio.|first1=Geoffrey A.|last1=Landis|first2=Paul C.|last2=Schmitz|first3=James|last3=Kinnison|first4=Martin|last4=Fraeman|first5=Lew|last5=Roufberg|first6=Steve|last6=Vernon |first7=Melissa |last7=Wirzburger|display-authors=1|date=July 28\u201330, 2008|id=AIAA 2008-5712}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techexplorist.com/traveling-sun-parker-solar-probe-melt/15586/ |title=Traveling to the Sun: Why won't Parker Solar Probe melt?|first=Pranjal|last=Mehar|website=Tech Explorist|date=July 20, 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Trajectory ==\n[[File:Animation of Parker Solar Probe trajectory.gif|thumb|right|An animation of ''Parker Solar Probe''{{'s}} trajectory from August 7, 2018 to August 29, 2025:<br/>{{legend2|magenta|''Parker Solar Probe''}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Yellow|[[Sun]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Lime|[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|[[Venus]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|RoyalBlue|[[Earth]]}}<br/>For more detailed animation, see [[:File:Animation of Parker Solar Probe trajectory.webm|this video.]]]]\n\nThe ''Parker Solar Probe'' mission design uses repeated [[gravity assist]]s at Venus to incrementally decrease its orbital [[perihelion]] to achieve a final altitude (above the surface) of approximately 8.5 solar radii, or about {{cvt|6|e6km|e6mi+au}}.<ref name=jhuapl>{{cite web|title=Solar Probe Plus: A NASA Mission to Touch the Sun|url=http://solarprobe.jhuapl.edu/|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory|date=September 4, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref> The spacecraft trajectory will include seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its elliptical orbit around the Sun, for a total of 24 orbits.{{r|extreme}} The near Sun radiation environment is predicted to cause spacecraft charging effects, radiation damage in materials and electronics, and communication interruptions, so the orbit will be highly elliptical with short times spent near the Sun.{{r|Fox 2016}}\n\nThe trajectory requires high launch energy, so the probe was launched on a [[Delta IV Heavy]] class [[launch vehicle]] and an upper stage based on the [[STAR-48|STAR 48BV]] solid rocket motor.{{r|Fox 2016}} Interplanetary [[gravity assist]]s will provide further deceleration relative to its [[heliocentric orbit]], which will result in a heliocentric speed record at [[perihelion]].{{r|Delta 4}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scharf|first1=Caleb A.|title=The Fastest Spacecraft Ever?|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-fastest-spacecraft-ever/|website=Scientific American Blog Network|language=en}}</ref> As the probe passes around the [[Sun]], it will achieve a velocity of up to {{cvt|200|km/s}}, which will temporarily make it the fastest human-made object, almost three times as fast as the previous record holder, [[Helios (spacecraft)#Helios-B|Helios-2]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0023.shtml|title=Aircraft Speed Records|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2014 |website=Aerospaceweb.org|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66135-fastest-spacecraft-speed|title=Fastest spacecraft speed|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2015|website=guinnessworldrecords.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219024804/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66135-fastest-spacecraft-speed |archive-date=December 19, 2016 |url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Parker Solar Probe \u2013 Check123, Video Encyclopedia|url=https://www.check123.com/videos/13450-parker-solar-probe|language=en|accessdate=June 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810211059/https://www.check123.com/videos/13450-parker-solar-probe|archive-date=August 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Like every object in an orbit, due to gravity the spacecraft will accelerate as it nears perihelion, then slow down again afterward until it reaches its [[aphelion]].\n\n==Mission==\n[[File:Parker Solar Probe Launch (NHQ201808120013).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Launch of ''Parker Solar Probe'' in 2018.]]\n[[File:Magnificent CME Erupts on the Sun - August 31.jpg|thumb|The overall goal is to increase understanding of Earth's star, the Sun{{mdash}} an astronomical body of immense impact on the Earth and the Solar System due to its release of light and solar wind, in addition to its large gravity.

This encounter shortens its period to half of that of Venus, or about 112.5 days. After two orbits it meets Venus a fourth time at about the same place, shortening its period to about 102 days. After 237 days it meets Venus for the fifth time and its period is shortened to about 96 days, three-sevenths that of Venus. It then makes seven orbits while Venus makes three. The sixth encounter, almost two years after the fifth, brings its period down to 92 days, two-fifths that of Venus.

Some of the details will be described later.\n\n===Example 1===\nThis example is simple but clearly illustrates the point.  This type of matrix is used frequently in textbooks.<ref>{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|p=118}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Herstein|1964|p=261}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Beauregard|Fraleigh|1973|p=310}}</ref>\nSuppose\n:<math> A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. </math>\nThen there is only one eigenvalue, <math> \\lambda = 1</math>, and its algebraic multiplicity is ''m'' = 2.\n\nNotice that this matrix is in Jordan normal form but is not [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]]. Hence, this matrix is not diagonalizable.  Since there is one [[superdiagonal]] entry, there will be one generalized eigenvector of rank greater than 1 (or one could note that the vector space <math> V </math> is of dimension 2, so there can be at most one generalized eigenvector of rank greater than 1).  Alternatively, one could compute the dimension of the [[nullspace]] of  <math> A - \\lambda I </math> to be ''p'' = 1, and thus there are ''m'' \u2013 ''p'' = 1 generalized eigenvectors of rank greater than 1.\n\nThe ordinary eigenvector <math> \\mathbf v_1=\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}</math> is computed as usual (see the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Calculation|eigenvector]] page for examples).

The generalized eigenvector of rank 2 is then <math> \\mathbf v_2=\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}</math>, where ''a'' can have any scalar value.  The choice of ''a'' = 0 is usually the simplest.\n\nNote that\n\n:<math> (A-\\lambda I) \\mathbf v_2 =  \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\1 \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf v_1,</math>\n\nso that <math> \\mathbf v_2 </math> is a generalized eigenvector,\n\n:<math> (A-\\lambda I) \\mathbf v_1 =  \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf 0,</math>\n\nso that <math> \\mathbf v_1 </math> is an ordinary eigenvector, and that <math> \\mathbf v_1</math> and <math> \\mathbf v_2</math> are linearly independent and hence constitute a basis for the vector space <math> V </math>.\n\n===Example 2===\nThis example is more complex than [[Generalized eigenvector#Example 1|Example 1]].

Hence, this matrix is not diagonalizable.  Since there is one [[superdiagonal]] entry, there will be one generalized eigenvector of rank greater than 1 (or one could note that the vector space <math> V </math> is of dimension 2, so there can be at most one generalized eigenvector of rank greater than 1).  Alternatively, one could compute the dimension of the [[nullspace]] of  <math> A - \\lambda I </math> to be ''p'' = 1, and thus there are ''m'' \u2013 ''p'' = 1 generalized eigenvectors of rank greater than 1.\n\nThe ordinary eigenvector <math> \\mathbf v_1=\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}</math> is computed as usual (see the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Calculation|eigenvector]] page for examples).

The generalized eigenvector of rank 2 is then <math> \\mathbf v_2=\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}</math>, where ''a'' can have any scalar value.  The choice of ''a'' = 0 is usually the simplest.\n\nNote that\n\n:<math> (A-\\lambda I) \\mathbf v_2 =  \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\1 \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf v_1,</math>\n\nso that <math> \\mathbf v_2 </math> is a generalized eigenvector,\n\n:<math> (A-\\lambda I) \\mathbf v_1 =  \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf 0,</math>\n\nso that <math> \\mathbf v_1 </math> is an ordinary eigenvector, and that <math> \\mathbf v_1</math> and <math> \\mathbf v_2</math> are linearly independent and hence constitute a basis for the vector space <math> V </math>.\n\n===Example 2===\nThis example is more complex than [[Generalized eigenvector#Example 1|Example 1]].

{"title_page": "Bayesian interpretation of kernel regularization", "text_new": "{{context|date=May 2012}}\nIn [[machine learning]], [[kernel methods]] arise from the assumption of an inner product space or similarity structure on inputs. For some such methods, such as [[support vector machine]]s (SVMs), the original formulation and its [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] were not Bayesian in nature. It is helpful to understand them from a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] perspective.  Because the kernels are not necessarily positive semidefinite, the underlying structure may not be inner product spaces, but instead more general [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]]s.  In Bayesian probability kernel methods are a key component of [[Gaussian processes]], where the kernel function is known as the covariance function.  Kernel methods have traditionally been used in [[supervised learning]] problems where the ''input space'' is usually a ''space of vectors'' while the ''output space'' is a ''space of scalars''. More recently these methods have been extended to problems that deal with [[Kernel methods for vector output|multiple outputs]] such as in [[multi-task learning]].<ref name=AlvRosLaw11>{{cite arxiv|last=\u00c1lvarez|first=Mauricio A.|author2=Rosasco, Lorenzo |author3=Lawrence, Neil D. |title=Kernels for Vector-Valued Functions: A Review|eprint=1106.6251 |date=June 2011|class=stat.ML}}</ref>\n\nA mathematical equivalence between the regularization and the Bayesian point of view is easily proved in cases where the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is ''finite-dimensional''.

These beliefs are updated after taking into account observational data by means of a ''[[likelihood function]]'' that relates the prior beliefs to the observations.  Taken together, the prior and likelihood lead to an updated distribution called the [[Posterior probability|''posterior distribution'']] that is customarily used for predicting test cases.\n\n===The Gaussian process===\n\nA [[Gaussian process]] (GP) is a stochastic process in which any finite number of random variables that are sampled follow a joint [[Multivariate normal distribution|Normal distribution]].<ref name=RasWil06 />  The mean vector and covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution completely specify the GP.  GPs are usually used as a priori distribution for functions, and as such the mean vector and covariance matrix can be viewed as functions, where the covariance function is also called the ''kernel'' of the GP.  Let a function <math>f</math> follow a Gaussian process with mean function <math>m</math> and kernel function <math>k</math>,\n\n:<math>\nf \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m,k).\n</math>\n\nIn terms of the underlying Gaussian distribution, we have that for any finite set <math>\\mathbf{X} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}</math> if we let <math>f(\\mathbf{X}) = [f(\\mathbf{x}_1),\\ldots,f(\\mathbf{x}_n)]^\\top</math> then\n\n:<math>\nf(\\mathbf{X}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{m},\\mathbf{K}),\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{m} = m(\\mathbf{X}) = [m(\\mathbf{x}_1),\\ldots,m(\\mathbf{x}_N)]^\\top</math> is the mean vector and <math>\\mathbf{K} = k(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{X})</math> is the covariance matrix of the multivariate Gaussian distribution.\n\n===Derivation of the estimator===\n{{further|Minimum mean square error#Linear MMSE estimator for linear observation process}}\nIn a regression context, the likelihood function is usually assumed to be a Gaussian distribution and the observations to be independent and identically distributed (iid),\n\n:<math>\np(y|f,\\mathbf{x},\\sigma^2) = \\mathcal{N}(f(\\mathbf{x}),\\sigma^2).\n</math>\n\nThis assumption corresponds to the observations being corrupted with zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance <math>\\sigma^2</math>. The iid assumption makes it possible to factorize the likelihood function over the data points given the set of inputs <math>\\mathbf{X}</math> and the variance of the noise <math>\\sigma^2</math>, and thus the posterior distribution can be computed analytically.

For some such methods, such as [[support vector machine]]s (SVMs), the original formulation and its [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] were not Bayesian in nature. It is helpful to understand them from a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] perspective.  Because the kernels are not necessarily positive semidefinite, the underlying structure may not be inner product spaces, but instead more general [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]]s.  In Bayesian probability kernel methods are a key component of [[Gaussian processes]], where the kernel function is known as the covariance function.  Kernel methods have traditionally been used in [[supervised learning]] problems where the ''input space'' is usually a ''space of vectors'' while the ''output space'' is a ''space of scalars''.

These beliefs are updated after taking into account observational data by means of a ''[[likelihood function]]'' that relates the prior beliefs to the observations.  Taken together, the prior and likelihood lead to an updated distribution called the [[Posterior probability|''posterior distribution'']] that is customarily used for predicting test cases.\n\n===The Gaussian process===\n\nA [[Gaussian process]] (GP) is a stochastic process in which any finite number of random variables that are sampled follow a joint [[Multivariate normal distribution|Normal distribution]].<ref name=RasWil06 />  The mean vector and covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution completely specify the GP.  GPs are usually used as a priori distribution for functions, and as such the mean vector and covariance matrix can be viewed as functions, where the covariance function is also called the ''kernel'' of the GP.  Let a function <math>f</math> follow a Gaussian process with mean function <math>m</math> and kernel function <math>k</math>,\n\n:<math>\nf \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m,k).\n</math>\n\nIn terms of the underlying Gaussian distribution, we have that for any finite set <math>\\mathbf{X} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}</math> if we let <math>f(\\mathbf{X}) = [f(\\mathbf{x}_1),\\ldots,f(\\mathbf{x}_n)]^\\top</math> then\n\n:<math>\nf(\\mathbf{X}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{m},\\mathbf{K}),\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{m} = m(\\mathbf{X}) = [m(\\mathbf{x}_1),\\ldots,m(\\mathbf{x}_N)]^\\top</math> is the mean vector and <math>\\mathbf{K} = k(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{X})</math> is the covariance matrix of the multivariate Gaussian distribution.\n\n===Derivation of the estimator===\n{{further|Minimum mean square error#Linear MMSE estimator for linear observation process}}\nIn a regression context, the likelihood function is usually assumed to be a Gaussian distribution and the observations to be independent and identically distributed (iid),\n\n:<math>\np(y|f,\\mathbf{x},\\sigma^2) = \\mathcal{N}(f(\\mathbf{x}),\\sigma^2).\n</math>\n\nThis assumption corresponds to the observations being corrupted with zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance <math>\\sigma^2</math>. The iid assumption makes it possible to factorize the likelihood function over the data points given the set of inputs <math>\\mathbf{X}</math> and the variance of the noise <math>\\sigma^2</math>, and thus the posterior distribution can be computed analytically. For a test input vector <math>\\mathbf{x}'</math>, given the training data <math>S = \\{\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y}\\}</math>, the posterior distribution is given by\n\n:<math>\np(f(\\mathbf{x}')|S,\\mathbf{x}',\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) = \\mathcal{N}(m(\\mathbf{x}'),\\sigma^2(\\mathbf{x}')),\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\boldsymbol{\\phi}</math> denotes the set of parameters which include the variance of the noise <math>\\sigma^2</math> and any parameters from the covariance function <math>k</math> and where\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nm(\\mathbf{x}') & = \\mathbf{k}^\\top (\\mathbf{K} + \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I})^{-1} \\mathbf{Y}, \\\\\n\\sigma^2(\\mathbf{x}') & = k(\\mathbf{x}',\\mathbf{x}') - \\mathbf{k}^\\top (\\mathbf{K} + \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I})^{-1} \\mathbf{k}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==The connection between regularization and Bayes==\n\nA connection between regularization theory and Bayesian theory can only be achieved in the case of ''finite dimensional RKHS''. Under this assumption, regularization theory and Bayesian theory are connected through Gaussian process prediction.<ref name=Wah90>{{cite book|last=Wahba|first=Grace|title=Spline models for observational data|year=1990|publisher=SIAM}}</ref><ref name=RasWil06>{{cite book|last=Rasmussen|first=Carl Edward|title=Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning|year=2006|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=0-262-18253-X|url=http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/|author2=Williams, Christopher K. I.}}</ref>\n\nIn the finite dimensional case, every RKHS can be described in terms of a feature map <math>\\Phi : \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^p</math> such that<ref name=Vap98 />\n\n:<math>\nk(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}') = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\Phi^i(\\mathbf{x})\\Phi^i(\\mathbf{x}').\n</math>\n\nFunctions in the RKHS with kernel <math>\\mathbf{K}</math> can be then be written as\n\n:<math>\nf_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\mathbf{w}^i \\Phi^i(\\mathbf{x}) = \\langle \\mathbf{w},\\Phi(\\mathbf{x}) \\rangle,\n</math>\n\nand we also have that\n\n:<math>\n\\|f_{\\mathbf{w}} \\|_k = \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|.\n</math>\n\nWe can now build a Gaussian process by assuming <math> \\mathbf{w} = [w^1,\\ldots,w^p]^\\top </math> to be distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian distribution with zero mean and identity covariance matrix,\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{w} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\mathbf{I}) \\propto \\exp(-\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2).\n</math>\n\nIf we assume a Gaussian likelihood we have\n\n:<math>\nP(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{X},f) = \\mathcal{N}(f(\\mathbf{X}),\\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\| f_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{X}) - \\mathbf{Y} \\|^2\\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere <math> f_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{X}) = (\\langle\\mathbf{w},\\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_1)\\rangle,\\ldots,\\langle\\mathbf{w},\\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_n \\rangle) </math>. The resulting posterior distribution is the given by\n\n:<math>\nP(f|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y}) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\|f_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{X}) - \\mathbf{Y}\\|_n^2 + \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2\\right)\n</math>\n\nWe can see that a ''maximum posterior (MAP)'' estimate is equivalent to the minimization problem defining [[Tikhonov regularization]], where in the Bayesian case the regularization parameter is related to the noise variance.\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, the loss function in a regularization setting plays a different role than the likelihood function in the Bayesian setting. Whereas the loss function measures the error that is incurred when predicting <math>f(\\mathbf{x})</math> in place of <math>y</math>, the likelihood function measures how likely the observations are from the model that was assumed to be true in the generative process. From a mathematical perspective, however, the formulations of the regularization and Bayesian frameworks make the loss function and the likelihood function to have the same mathematical role of promoting the inference of functions <math>f</math> that approximate the labels <math>y</math> as much as possible.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Regularized least squares]]\n* [[Bayesian linear regression]]\n* [[Tikhonov_regularization#Bayesian_interpretation|Bayesian interpretation of Tikhonov regularization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bayesian statistics]]\n[[Category:Machine learning]]\n", "name_user": "Jonesey95", "label": "safe", "comment": "FixLintererrors usingAutoEd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_interpretation_of_kernel_regularization"}
