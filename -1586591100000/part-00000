The Kurmi fell into two such categories. In the ethnological map of India published in the 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India and based on the 1901 Census supervised by Risley, the Kurmi of the United Provinces were classified as \"Aryo-Dravidian,\" whereas the Kurmi of the [[Central Provinces]] were counted among \"Dravidians\".<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" /> In the 1901 Census of India, the category of [[varna]], the four-fold graded system, was included in the official classification of caste,<ref name=\"RudolphRudolph1984\">{{cite book|last1=Rudolph|first1=Lloyd I.|last2=Rudolph|first2=Susanne Hoeber|title=The Modernity of Tradition: Political Development in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7guY1ut-0lwC|year=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-73137-7|page=116}}</ref> the only time this was the case.{{efn|Although influential, Risley's attempt did not achieve the end which he sought: people were unable to determine in which group they should classify themselves, the localised system he adopted could not be transposed onto the national stage, and some groups took advantage of the situation deliberately to seek reclassification and therefore satisfy their aspirations.

Such a man was to be blamed for his own decline, fecklessly mortgaging and then selling off his lands to maintain his unproductive dependents. By the same logic, a flourishing field of wheat would belong to a non-twice-born tiller, wheat being a crop requiring skill and enterprise on the part of the cultivator.

The governor\u2019s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William R. |last=Pinch|title=Peasants and monks in British India|url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc|url-access=registration |year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20061-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/89 89]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at [[Lucknow]] to protest against the police recruitment policy.

The governor\u2019s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William R. |last=Pinch|title=Peasants and monks in British India|url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc|url-access=registration |year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20061-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/89 89]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at [[Lucknow]] to protest against the police recruitment policy.

This body then campaigned for Kurmis to classify themselves as Kshatriya in the 1901 census and, in 1910, led to the formation of the [[All India Kurmi Kshatriya Mahasabha]].<ref name=Jaffrelot2003p197>{{cite book |title=India's silent revolution: the rise of the lower castes in North India |page=197 |first=Christophe |last=Jaffrelot |publisher=C.

However, the organisation was hobbled by competition from the Congress-backed [[Backward Class]] Federation, which was formed around the same time, and by co-option of community leaders by the Congress party. The Triveni Sangh suffered badly in the 1937 elections, although it did win in some areas. The organisation also suffered from caste rivalries, notably the superior organisational ability of the higher castes who opposed it, as well as the inability of the Yadavs to renounce their belief that they were natural leaders and that the Kurmi were somehow inferior.

{"title_page": "Formal power series", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''formal power series''' is a generalization of a [[polynomial]], where the number of terms is allowed to be infinite; this implies giving up the possibility of replacing the variable in the polynomial with an arbitrary number. Thus a formal power series differs from a polynomial in that it may have infinitely many terms, and differs from a [[power series]], whose variables can take on numerical values. One way to view a formal power series is as an infinite ordered sequence of numbers. In this case, the powers of the variable are used only to indicate the order of the coefficients, so that the coefficient of <math>x^5</math> is the fifth term in the sequence. In [[combinatorics]], formal power series provide representations of numerical [[sequence]]s and of [[multiset]]s, and for instance allow concise expressions for [[recursion|recursively]] defined sequences regardless of whether the recursion can be explicitly solved; this is known as the method of [[generating function]]s. More generally, formal power series can include series with any finite number of variables, and with coefficients in an arbitrary [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Formal power series can be created from [[Taylor polynomial|Taylor polynomials]] using [[formal moduli]].\n\n==Introduction==\nA formal power series can be loosely thought of as an object that is like a [[polynomial]], but with infinitely many terms. Alternatively, for those familiar with [[power series]] (or [[Taylor series]]), one may think of a formal power series as a power series in which we ignore questions of [[Convergent series|convergence]] by not assuming that the variable ''X'' denotes any numerical value (not even an unknown value). For example, consider the series\n\n:<math>A = 1 - 3X + 5X^2 - 7X^3 + 9X^4 - 11X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nIf we studied this as a power series, its properties would include, for example, that its [[radius of convergence]] is 1. However, as a formal power series, we may ignore this completely; all that is relevant is the sequence of [[coefficient]]s [1, \u22123, 5, \u22127, 9, \u221211, ...]. In other words, a formal power series is an object that just records a sequence of coefficients. It is perfectly acceptable to consider a formal power series with the [[factorial]]s [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, ... ] as coefficients, even though the corresponding power series diverges for any nonzero value of ''X''.\n\nArithmetic on formal power series is carried out by simply pretending that the series are polynomials. For example, if\n\n:<math>B = 2X + 4X^3 + 6X^5 + \\cdots,</math>\n\nthen we add ''A'' and ''B'' term by term:\n\n:<math>A + B = 1 - X + 5X^2 - 3X^3 + 9X^4 - 5X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nWe can multiply formal power series, again just by treating them as polynomials (see in particular [[Cauchy product]]):\n\n:<math>AB = 2X - 6X^2 + 14X^3 - 26X^4 + 44X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nNotice that each coefficient in the product ''AB'' only depends on a ''finite'' number of coefficients of ''A'' and ''B''. For example, the ''X''<sup>5</sup> term is given by\n\n:<math>44X^5 = (1\\times 6X^5) + (5X^2 \\times 4X^3) + (9X^4 \\times 2X).</math>\n\nFor this reason, one may multiply formal power series without worrying about the usual questions of [[absolute convergence|absolute]], [[conditional convergence|conditional]] and [[uniform convergence]] which arise in dealing with power series in the setting of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].\n\nOnce we have defined multiplication for formal power series, we can define multiplicative inverses as follows. The multiplicative inverse of a formal power series ''A'' is a formal power series ''C'' such that ''AC'' = 1, provided that such a formal power series exists. It turns out that if ''A'' has a multiplicative inverse, it is unique, and we denote it by ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>. Now we can define division of formal power series by defining ''B''/''A'' to be the product ''BA''<sup>\u22121</sup>, provided that the inverse of ''A'' exists. For example, one can use the definition of multiplication above to verify the familiar formula\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{1 + X} = 1 - X + X^2 - X^3 + X^4 - X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nAn important operation on formal power series is coefficient extraction. In its most basic form, the coefficient extraction operator <math>[X^n]</math> applied to a formal power series <math>A</math> in one variable extracts the coefficient of the <math>n</math>th power of the variable, so that <math>[X^2]A=5</math> and <math>[X^5]A=-11</math>. Other examples include\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\left[X^3\\right] (B) &= 4, \\\\ \n\\left[X^2 \\right] (X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &= 3Y^3, \\\\\n\\left[X^2Y^3 \\right] ( X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &= 3, \\\\\n\\left[X^n \\right] \\left(\\frac{1}{1+X} \\right) &= (-1)^n, \\\\ \n\\left[X^n \\right] \\left(\\frac{X}{(1-X)^2} \\right) &= n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSimilarly, many other operations that are carried out on polynomials can be extended to the formal power series setting, as explained below.\n\n==The ring of formal power series==\n{{Ring theory sidebar}}\n\nIf one considers the set of all formal power series in ''X'' with coefficients in a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', the elements of this set collectively constitute another ring which is written <math>R[[X]],</math> and called the '''ring of formal power series''' in the variable&nbsp;''X'' over ''R''.\n\n===Definition of the formal power series ring===\nOne can characterize <math>R[[X]]</math> abstractly as the [[completeness (topology)|completion]] of the [[polynomial]] ring <math>R[X]</math> equipped with a particular [[metric space|metric]]<!-- in which the powers of the ideal ''I'' of <math>R[X]</math> generated by <math>X</math> form a shrinking set of neighbourhoods of 0; a precise description would be too long to spell out here-->. This automatically gives <math>R[[X]]</math> the structure of a [[topological ring]] (and even of a complete metric space). But the general construction of a completion of a metric space is more involved than what is needed here, and would make formal power series seem more complicated than they are. \nIt is possible to describe <math>R[[X]]</math> more explicitly, and define the ring structure and topological structure separately, as follows.\n\n====Ring structure====\nAs a set, <math>R[[X]]</math> can be constructed as the set <math>R^\\N</math> of all infinite sequences of elements of <math>R</math>, indexed by the [[natural number]]s (taken to include 0). Designating a sequence whose term at index <math>n</math> is <math>a_n</math> by <math>(a_n)</math>, one defines addition of two such sequences by\n\n:<math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N} + (b_n)_{n\\in\\N} = \\left( a_n + b_n \\right)_{n\\in\\N}</math>\n\nand multiplication by\n\n:<math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N} \\times (b_n)_{n\\in\\N} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} \\right)_{n\\in\\N}.</math>\n\nThis type of product is called the [[Cauchy product]] of the two sequences of coefficients, and is a sort of discrete [[convolution]]. With these operations, <math>R^\\N</math> becomes a commutative ring with zero element <math>(0,0,0,\\ldots)</math> and multiplicative identity <math>(1,0,0,\\ldots)</math>.\n\nThe product is in fact the same one used to define the product of polynomials in one indeterminate, which suggests using a similar notation. One embeds <math>R</math> into <math>R[[X]]</math> by sending any (constant) <math>a \\in R</math> to the sequence <math>(a,0,0,\\ldots)</math> and designates the sequence <math>(0,1,0,0,\\ldots)</math> by <math>X</math>; then using the above definitions every sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms can be expressed in terms of these special elements as\n\n:<math>(a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n, 0, 0, \\ldots) = a_0 + a_1 X + \\cdots + a_n X^n = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i X^i;</math>\n\nthese are precisely the polynomials in <math>X</math>. Given this, it is quite natural and convenient to designate a general sequence <math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N}</math> by the formal expression <math>\\textstyle\\sum_{i\\in\\N}a_i X^i</math>, even though the latter ''is not'' an expression formed by the operations of addition and multiplication defined above (from which only finite sums can be constructed). This notational convention allows reformulation of the above definitions as\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right)+\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{i\\in\\N}(a_i+b_i) X^i</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{n\\in\\N} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}\\right) X^n.</math>\n\nwhich is quite convenient, but one must be aware of the distinction between formal summation (a mere convention) and actual addition.\n\n==== Topological structure ====\nHaving stipulated conventionally that\n\n:<math>(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i X^i, \\qquad (1)</math>\n\none would like to interpret the right hand side as a well-defined infinite summation. To that end, a notion of convergence in <math>R^\\N</math> is defined and a [[topology]] on <math>R^\\N</math> is constructed. There are several equivalent ways to define the desired topology.\n\n* We may give <math>R^\\N</math> the [[product topology]], where each copy of <math>R</math> is given the [[discrete topology]].\n\n* We may give <math>R^\\N</math> the [[I-adic topology]], where <math>I=(X)</math> is the ideal generated by <math>X</math>, which consists of all sequences whose first term <math>a_0</math> is zero.\n\n* The desired topology could also be derived from the following [[metric space|metric]]. The distance between distinct sequences <math>(a_n), (b_n) \\in R^{\\N},</math> is defined to be\n::<math>d((a_n), (b_n)) = 2^{-k},</math>\n:where <math>k</math> is the smallest [[natural number]] such that <math>a_k\\neq b_k</math>; the distance between two equal sequences is of course zero.\n\nInformally, two sequences <math>\\{a_n\\}</math> and <math>\\{b_n\\}</math> become closer and closer if and only if more and more of their terms agree exactly. Formally, the sequence of [[partial sum]]s of some infinite summation converges if for every fixed power of <math>X</math> the coefficient stabilizes: there is a point beyond which all further partial sums have the same coefficient. This is clearly the case for the right hand side of (1), regardless of the values <math>a_n</math>, since inclusion of the term for <math>i=n</math> gives the last (and in fact only) change to the coefficient of <math>X^n</math>. It is also obvious that the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the sequence of partial sums is equal to the left hand side.\n\nThis topological structure, together with the ring operations described above, form a topological ring. This is called the '''ring of formal power series over <math>R</math>''' and is denoted by <math>R[[X]]</math>. The topology has the useful property that an infinite summation converges if and only if the sequence of its terms converges to 0, which just means that any fixed power of <math>X</math> occurs in only finitely many terms.\n\nThe topological structure allows much more flexible usage of infinite summations. For instance the rule for multiplication can be restated simply as\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{i,j\\in\\N} a_i b_j X^{i+j},</math>\n\nsince only finitely many terms on the right affect any fixed <math>X^n</math>. Infinite products are also defined by the topological structure; it can be seen that an infinite product converges if and only if the sequence of its factors converges to 1.\n\n==== Alternative topologies ====\nThe above topology is the [[Comparison of topologies|finest topology]] for which \n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i X^i</math> \n\nalways converges as a summation to the formal power series designated by the same expression, and it often suffices to give a meaning to infinite sums and products, or other kinds of limits that one wishes to use to designate particular formal power series. It can however happen occasionally that one wishes to use a coarser topology, so that certain expressions become convergent that would otherwise diverge. This applies in particular when the base ring <math>R</math> already comes with a topology other than the discrete one, for instance if it is also a ring of formal power series.\n\nConsider the ring of formal power series: <math>\\Z[[X]][[Y]]</math>; then the topology of above construction only relates to the indeterminate <math>Y</math>, since the topology that was put on <math>\\Z[[X]]</math> has been replaced by the discrete topology when defining the topology of the whole ring. So\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\N}XY^i</math>\n\nconverges to the power series suggested, which can be written as <math>\\tfrac{X}{1-Y}</math>; however the summation\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\N}X^iY</math>\n\nwould be considered to be divergent, since every term affects the coefficient of <math>Y</math> (which coefficient is itself a power series in <math>X</math>). This asymmetry disappears if the power series ring in <math>Y</math> is given the product topology where each copy of <math>\\Z[[X]]</math> is given its topology as a ring of formal power series rather than the discrete topology. As a consequence, for convergence of a sequence of elements of <math>\\Z[[X]][[Y]]</math> it then suffices that the coefficient of each power of <math>Y</math> converges to a formal power series in <math>X</math>, a weaker condition than stabilizing entirely; for instance in the second example given here the coefficient of <math>Y</math>converges to <math>\\tfrac{1}{1-X}</math>, so the whole summation converges to <math>\\tfrac{Y}{1-X}</math>.\n\nThis way of defining the topology is in fact the standard one for repeated constructions of rings of formal power series, and gives the same topology as one would get by taking formal power series in all indeterminates at once. In the above example that would mean constructing <math>\\Z[[X,Y]],</math> and here a sequence converges if and only if the coefficient of every monomial <math>X^iY^j</math> stabilizes. This topology, which is also the <math>I</math>-adic topology, where <math>I=(X,Y)</math> is the ideal generated by <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>, still enjoys the property that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\n\nThe same principle could be used to make other divergent limits converge. For instance in <math>\\R[[X]]</math> the limit\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{X}{n}\\right)^n</math>\n\ndoes not exist, so in particular it does not converge to \n\n:<math>\\exp(X)=\\sum_{n\\in\\N}\\frac{X^n}{n!}.</math>\n\nThis is because for <math>i\\geq 2</math> the coefficient <math>\\tbinom{n}{i}/n^i</math> of <math>X^i</math> does not stabilize as <math>n\\to \\infty</math>. It does however converge in the usual topology of <math>\\R</math>, and in fact to the coefficient <math>\\tfrac{1}{i!}</math> of <math>\\exp(X)</math>. Therefore, if one would give <math>\\R[[X]]</math> the product topology of <math>\\R^\\N</math> where the topology of <math>\\R</math> is the usual topology rather than the discrete one, then the above limit would converge to <math>\\exp(X)</math>. This more permissive approach is not however the standard when considering formal power series, as it would lead to convergence considerations that are as subtle as they are in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]], while the philosophy of formal power series is on the contrary to make convergence questions as trivial as they can possibly be. With this topology it would ''not'' be the case that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\n\n===Universal property===\nThe ring <math>R[[X]]</math> may be characterized by the following [[universal property]].

In this case, <math>f^{\\alpha}</math> can be defined either by composition with the [[binomial series]] (1+''x'')<sup>\u03b1</sup>, or by composition with the exponential and the logarithmic series, <math>f^{\\alpha}=\\exp(\\alpha\\log(f)),</math> or as the solution of the differential equation <math>f( f^{\\alpha})' = \\alpha f^{\\alpha} f'</math> with constant term 1, the three definitions being equivalent. The rules of calculus <math>(f^\\alpha)^\\beta = f^{\\alpha\\beta}</math> and <math>f^\\alpha g^\\alpha = (fg)^\\alpha</math> easily follow.\n\n=== Multiplicative inverse ===\nThe series\n\n:<math>A = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n X^n \\in R[[X]]</math>\n\nis invertible in <math>R[[X]]</math> if and only if its constant coefficient <math>a_0</math> is invertible in <math>R</math>. This condition is necessary, for the following reason: if we suppose that <math>A</math> has an inverse <math>B = b_0 + b_1 x + \\cdots</math> then the [[constant term]] <math>a_0b_0</math> of <math>A \\cdot B</math> is the constant term of the identity series, i.e. it is 1. This condition is also sufficient; we may compute the coefficients of the inverse series <math>B</math> via the explicit recursive formula\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nb_0 &= \\frac{1}{a_0},\\\\\nb_n &= -\\frac{1}{a_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{n-i}, \\ \\ \\ n \\geq 1.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAn important special case is that the [[geometric series]] formula is valid in <math>K[[X]]</math>:\n\n:<math>(1 - X)^{-1} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty X^n.</math>\n\nIf <math>R=K</math> is a field, then a series is invertible if and only if the constant term is non-zero, i.e. if and only if the series is not divisible by <math>X</math>.

In other words, the series for <math>g(f(X))</math> converges in the [[Completion (ring theory)#Krull topology|topology]] of <math>R[[X]]</math>.\n\n==== Example ====\nAssume that the ring <math>R</math> has characteristic 0 and the nonzero integers are invertible in <math>R</math>. If we denote by <math>\\exp(X)</math> the formal power series\n\n:<math>\\exp(X) = 1 + X + \\frac{X^2}{2!} + \\frac{X^3}{3!} + \\frac{X^4}{4!} + \\cdots,</math>\n\nthen the expression\n\n:<math>\\exp(\\exp(X) - 1) = 1 + X + X^2 + \\frac{5X^3}6 + \\frac{5X^4}8 + \\cdots</math>\n\nmakes perfect sense as a formal power series. However, the statement\n\n:<math>\\exp(\\exp(X)) = e \\exp(\\exp(X) - 1) = e + eX + eX^2 + \\frac{5eX^3}{6} + \\cdots</math>\n\nis not a valid application of the composition operation for formal power series. Rather, it is confusing the notions of convergence in <math>R[[X]]</math> and convergence in <math>R</math>; indeed, the ring <math>R</math> may not even contain any number <math>e</math> with the appropriate properties.\n\n=== Composition inverse ===\nWhenever a formal series \n\n:<math>f(X)=\\sum_k f_k X^k \\in R[[X]]</math> \n\nhas ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0 and ''f''<sub>1</sub> being an invertible element of ''R'', there exists a series \n\n:<math>g(X)=\\sum_k g_k X^k</math> \n\nthat is the [[composition inverse]] of <math>f</math>, meaning that composing <math>f</math> with <math>g</math> gives the series representing the [[identity function]] (whose first coefficient is 1 and all other coefficients are zero). The coefficients of <math>g</math> may be found recursively by using the above formula for the coefficients of a composition, equating them with those of the composition identity ''X'' (that is 1 at degree 1 and 0 at every degree greater than 1). In the case when the coefficient ring is a field of characteristic 0, the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]] provides a powerful tool to compute the coefficients of ''g'', as well as the coefficients of the (multiplicative) powers of ''g''.\n\n=== Formal differentiation ===\nGiven a formal power series\n\n:<math>f = \\sum_{n\\geq 0} a_n X^n \\in R[[X]],</math>\n\nwe define its '''[[formal derivative]]''', denoted ''Df'' or ''f''\u2032, by\n\n:<math> Df = \\sum_{n \\geq 1} a_n n X^{n-1}.</math>\n\nThe symbol ''D'' is called the '''formal differentiation operator'''. The motivation behind this definition is that it simply mimics term-by-term differentiation of a polynomial.\n\nThis operation is ''R''-[[linear operator|linear]]:\n\n:<math>D(af + bg) = a \\cdot Df + b \\cdot Dg</math>\n\nfor any ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' and any ''f'', ''g'' in <math>R[[X]].</math> Additionally, the formal derivative has many of the properties of the usual [[derivative]] of calculus. For example, the [[product rule]] is valid:\n\n:<math>D(fg) = f \\cdot (Dg) + (Df) \\cdot g,</math>\n\nand the [[chain rule]] works as well:\n\n:<math>D(f\\circ g ) = ( Df\\circ g ) \\cdot Dg,</math>\n\nwhenever the appropriate compositions of series are defined (see above under [[#Composition of series|composition of series]]).\n\nThus, in these respects formal power series behave like [[Taylor series]]. Indeed, for the ''f'' defined above, we find that\n\n:<math>(D^k f)(0) = k! a_k, </math>\n\nwhere ''D''<sup>''k''</sup> denotes the ''k''th formal derivative (that is, the result of formally differentiating ''k'' times).\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Algebraic properties of the formal power series ring ===\n<math>R[[X]]</math> is an [[associative algebra]] over <math>R</math> which contains the ring <math>R[X]</math> of polynomials over <math>R</math>; the polynomials correspond to the sequences which end in zeros.\n\nThe [[Jacobson radical]] of <math>R[[X]]</math> is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by <math>X</math> and the Jacobson radical of <math>R</math>; this is implied by the element invertibility criterion discussed above.\n\nThe [[maximal ideal]]s of <math>R[[X]]</math> all arise from those in <math>R</math> in the following manner: an ideal <math>M</math> of <math>R[[X]]</math> is maximal if and only if <math>M\\cap R</math> is a maximal ideal of <math>R</math> and <math>M</math> is generated as an ideal by <math>X</math> and <math>M\\cap R</math>.\n\nSeveral algebraic properties of <math>R</math> are inherited by <math>R[[X]]</math>:\n\n* if <math>R</math> is a [[local ring]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>,\n\n* if <math>R</math> is [[noetherian ring|Noetherian]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>. This is a version of the [[Hilbert basis theorem]],\n\n* if <math>R</math> is an [[integral domain]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>,\n\n* if <math>K</math> is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then <math>K[[X]]</math> is a [[discrete valuation ring]].\n\n=== Topological properties of the formal power series ring ===\nThe metric space <math>(R[[X]], d)</math> is [[completeness (topology)|complete]].\n\nThe ring <math>R[[X]]</math> is [[compact space|compact]] if and only if ''R'' is [[finite set|finite]]. This follows from [[Tychonoff's theorem]] and the characterisation of the topology on <math>R[[X]]</math> as a product topology.\n\n=== Weierstrass preparation ===\n{{main article|Weierstrass preparation theorem#Formal power series in complete local rings}}\nThe ring of formal power series with coefficients in a [[complete local ring]] satisfies the [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]].\n\n==Applications==\nFormal power series can be used to solve recurrences occurring in number theory and combinatorics. For an example involving finding a closed form expression for the [[Fibonacci number]]s, see the article on [[Examples of generating functions]].\n\nOne can use formal power series to prove several relations familiar from analysis in a purely algebraic setting. Consider for instance the following elements of <math>\\Q[[X]]</math>:\n\n:<math> \\sin(X) := \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\frac{(-1)^n} {(2n+1)!} X^{2n+1} </math>\n:<math> \\cos(X) := \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\frac{(-1)^n} {(2n)!} X^{2n} </math>\n\nThen one can show that\n\n:<math>\\sin^2(X) + \\cos^2(X) = 1,</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} \\sin(X) = \\cos(X),</math>\n:<math>\\sin (X+Y) = \\sin(X) \\cos(Y) + \\cos(X) \\sin(Y).</math>\n\nThe last one being valid in the ring <math>\\Q[[X, Y]].</math>\n\nFor ''K'' a field, the ring <math>K[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]]</math> is often used as the \"standard, most general\" complete local ring over ''K'' in algebra.\n\n==Interpreting formal power series as functions==\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], every convergent [[power series]] defines a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with values in the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers. Formal power series can also be interpreted as functions, but one has to be careful with the [[function domain|domain]] and [[codomain]]. Let \n\n:<math>f = \\sum a_n X^n \\in R[[X]],</math> \n\nand suppose ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', ''I'' is an ideal in ''S'' such that the [[I-adic topology]] on ''S'' is complete, and ''x'' is an element of ''I''. Define:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\sum_{n\\ge 0} a_n x^n.</math>\n\nThis series is guaranteed to converge in ''S'' given the above assumptions on ''x''. Furthermore, we have\n\n:<math> (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> (fg)(x) = f(x) g(x).</math>\n\nUnlike in the case of bona fide functions, these formulas are not definitions but have to be proved.\n\nSince the topology on <math>R[[X]]</math> is the (''X'')-adic topology and <math>R[[X]]</math> is complete, we can in particular apply power series to other power series, provided that the arguments don't have [[constant coefficients]] (so that they belong to the ideal (''X'')): ''f''(0), ''f''(''X''<sup>2</sup>\u2212''X'') and ''f''((1\u2212''X'')<sup>\u22121</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) are all well defined for any formal power series <math>f \\in R[[X]].</math>\n\nWith this formalism, we can give an explicit formula for the multiplicative inverse of a power series ''f'' whose constant coefficient ''a'' = ''f''(0) is invertible in ''R'':\n\n:<math>f^{-1} = \\sum_{n \\ge 0} a^{-n-1} (a-f)^n.</math>\n\nIf the formal power series ''g'' with ''g''(0) = 0 is given implicitly by the equation\n\n:<math>f(g) =X</math>\n\nwhere ''f'' is a known power series with ''f''(0) = 0, then the coefficients of ''g'' can be explicitly computed using the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n=== Formal Laurent series ===\nA '''formal Laurent series''' over a ring <math>R</math> is defined in a similar way to a formal power series, except that we also allow finitely many terms of negative degree (this is different from the classical [[Laurent series]]), that is series of the form\n\n:<math>f = \\sum_{n\\in\\Z} a_n X^n</math>\n\nwhere '''<math>a_n=0</math> for all but finitely many negative indices <math>n</math>'''. Multiplication of such series can be defined. Indeed, similarly to the definition for formal power series, the coefficient of ''X<sup>k</sup>'' of two series with respective sequences of coefficients <math>\\{a_n\\}</math> and <math>\\{b_n\\}</math> is\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\Z}a_ib_{k-i},</math>\n\nwhich sum is effectively finite because of the assumed vanishing of coefficients at sufficiently negative indices, and which sum zero for sufficiently negative <math>k</math> for the same reason.\n\nFor a non-zero formal Laurent series, the minimal integer <math>n</math> such that <math> a_n\\neq 0</math> is called the order of <math>f</math>, denoted <math>\\operatorname{ord}(f).</math> (The order of the zero series is <math>+\\infty</math>.) The formal Laurent series form the '''ring of formal Laurent series''' over <math>R</math>, denoted by <math>R((X))</math>. It is equal to the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of <math>R[[X]]</math> with respect to the set of positive powers of <math>X</math>. It is a topological ring with the metric:\n\n:<math>d(f,g)=2^{-\\operatorname{ord}(f-g)}.</math>\n\nIf <math>R=K</math> is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then <math>K((X))</math> is in fact a field, which may alternatively be obtained as the [[field of fractions]] of the [[integral domain]] <math>K[[X]]</math>.\n\nOne may define formal differentiation for formal Laurent series in a natural way (term-by-term). Precisely, the formal derivative of the formal Laurent series <math>f</math> above is\n\n:<math>f' = Df = \\sum_{n\\in\\Z} na_n X^{n-1}</math>\n\nwhich is again an element of <math>K((X))</math>. Notice that if <math>f</math> is a non-constant formal Laurent series, and K is a field of characteristic 0, then one has\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{ord}(f')= \\operatorname{ord}(f)-1.</math>\n\nHowever, in general this is not the case since the factor ''n'' for the lowest order term could be equal to 0 in ''R''.\n\n====Formal residue====\nAssume that <math>K</math> is a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. Then the map\n\n:<math>D\\colon K((X))\\to K((X))</math>\n\nis a <math>K</math>-[[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] that satisfies\n\n:<math>\\ker D=K</math>\n:<math>\\operatorname{im} D= \\left \\{f\\in K((X)) : [X^{-1}]f=0 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nThe latter shows that the coefficient of <math>X^{-1}</math> in <math>f</math> is of particular interest; it is called ''formal residue of <math>f</math>'' and denoted <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f)</math>. The map\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Res} : K((X))\\to K</math>\n\nis <math>K</math>-linear, and by the above observation one has an [[exact sequence]]\n\n:<math>0 \\to K \\to K((X)) \\xrightarrow{D} K((X)) \\;\\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{Res}}\\; K \\to 0.</math>\n\n'''Some rules of calculus'''. As a quite direct consequence of the above definition, and of the rules of formal derivation, one has, for any <math>f, g\\in K((X))</math>\n:i. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f')=0;</math>\n:ii. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(fg')=-\\operatorname{Res}(f'g);</math>\n:iii. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=\\operatorname{ord}(f),\\qquad \\forall f\\neq0;</math>\n:iv. <math>\\operatorname{Res}\\left(( f\\circ g) g'\\right) = \\operatorname{ord}(g)\\operatorname{Res}(f),</math> if <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)>0;</math>\n:v. <math>[X^n]f(X)=\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^{-n-1}f(X)\\right).</math>\n\nProperty (i) is part of the exact sequence above. Property (ii) follows from (i) as applied to <math>(fg)'=f'g+fg'</math>. Property (iii): any <math>f</math> can be written in the form <math>f=X^mg</math>, with <math>m=\\operatorname{ord}(f)</math> and <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)=0</math>: then <math>f'/f = mX^{-1}+g'/g.</math> <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)=0</math> implies <math>g</math> is invertible in <math>K[[X]]\\subset \\operatorname{im}(D) = \\ker(\\operatorname{Res}),</math> whence <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=m.</math> Property (iv): Since <math>\\operatorname{im}(D) = \\ker(\\operatorname{Res}),</math> we can write <math>f=f_{-1}X^{-1}+F',</math> with <math>F \\in K((X))</math>. Consequently, <math>(f\\circ g)g'= f_{-1}g^{-1}g'+(F'\\circ g)g' = f_{-1}g'/g + (F \\circ g)'</math> and (iv) follows from (i) and (iii). Property (v) is clear from the definition.\n\n===The Lagrange inversion formula===\n{{main|Lagrange inversion theorem}}\nAs mentioned above, any formal series <math>f \\in K[[X]]</math> with ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0 and ''f''<sub>1</sub> \u2260 0 has a composition inverse <math>g \\in K[[X]].</math> The following relation between the coefficients ''g<sup>n</sup>'' and ''f''<sup>\u2212''k''</sup> holds (\"{{Visible anchor|Lagrange inversion formula}}\"):\n\n:<math>k[X^k] g^n=n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}.</math>\n\nIn particular, for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and all ''k''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1,\n\n:<math>[X^k] g=\\frac{1}{k} \\operatorname{Res}\\left( f^{-k}\\right).</math>\n\nSince the proof of the Lagrange inversion formula is a very short computation, it is worth reporting it here. Since <math>\\operatorname{ord}(f) =1 </math>, by the above rules of calculus,\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nk[X^k] g^n & =k\\operatorname{Res}\\left( g^n X^{-k-1}  \\right)\n=k\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^n f^{-k-1}f\\,'\\right)\n=-\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^n (f^{-k})^'\\right) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Res}\\left(\\left(X^n\\right)' f^{-k}\\right)\n=n\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^{n-1}f^{-k}\\right)\n=n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n'''Generalizations.''' One may observe that the above computation can be repeated plainly in more general settings than ''K''((''X'')): a generalization of the Lagrange inversion formula is already available working in the <math>\\Complex((X))</math>-modules <math>X^{\\alpha}\\Complex((X)),</math> where \u03b1 is a complex exponent. As a consequence, if ''f'' and ''g'' are as above, with <math>f_1=g_1=1</math>, we can relate the complex powers of ''f''/''X'' and ''g''/''X'': precisely, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are non-zero complex numbers with negative integer sum, <math>m=-\\alpha-\\beta\\in\\N,</math> then\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\alpha}[X^m]\\left( \\frac{f}{X} \\right)^\\alpha=-\\frac{1}{\\beta}[X^m]\\left( \\frac{g}{X} \\right)^\\beta.</math>\n\nFor instance, this way one finds the power series for [[Lambert W function#Integer and complex powers|complex powers of the Lambert function]].\n\n=== Power series in several variables ===\nFormal power series in any number of indeterminates (even infinitely many) can be defined. If ''I'' is an index set and ''X<sub>I</sub>'' is the set of indeterminates ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i''\u2208''I'', then a [[monomial]] ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> is any finite product of elements of ''X<sub>I</sub>'' (repetitions allowed); a formal power series in ''X<sub>I</sub>'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> to a corresponding coefficient ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub>, and is denoted <math>\\textstyle\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha</math>. The set of all such formal power series is denoted <math>R[[X_I]],</math> and it is given a ring structure by defining\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)+\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha \\right)= \\sum_\\alpha (c_\\alpha+d_\\alpha) X^\\alpha</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)\\times\\left(\\sum_\\beta d_\\beta X^\\beta\\right)=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} c_\\alpha d_\\beta X^{\\alpha+\\beta}</math>\n\n==== Topology ====\nThe topology on <math>R[[X_I]]</math> is such that a sequence of its elements converges only if for each monomial ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> the corresponding coefficient stabilizes. If ''I'' is finite, then this the ''J''-adic topology, where ''J'' is the ideal of <math>R[[X_I]]</math> generated by all the indeterminates in ''X<sub>I</sub>''. This does not hold if ''I'' is infinite. For example, if <math>I=\\N,</math> then the sequence <math>(f_n)_{n\\in \\N}</math> with <math>f_n = X_n + X_{n+1} + X_{n+2} + \\cdots </math> does not converge with respect to any ''J''-adic topology on ''R'', but clearly for each monomial the corresponding coefficient stabilizes.\n\nAs remarked above, the topology on a repeated formal power series ring like <math>R[[X]][[Y]]</math> is usually chosen in such a way that it becomes isomorphic as a [[topological ring]] to <math>R[[X,Y]].</math>\n\n====Operations====\nAll of the operations defined for series in one variable may be extended to the several variables case.\n\n* A series is invertible if and only if its constant term is invertible in ''R''.\n\n* The composition ''f''(''g''(''X'')) of two series ''f'' and ''g'' is defined if ''f'' is a series in a single indeterminate, and the constant term of ''g'' is zero. For a series ''f'' in several indeterminates a form of \"composition\" can similarly be defined, with as many separate series in the place of ''g'' as there are indeterminates.\n\nIn the case of the formal derivative, there are now separate [[partial derivative]] operators, which differentiate with respect to each of the indeterminates. They all commute with each other.\n\n==== Universal property ====\nIn the several variables case, the universal property characterizing <math>R[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]]</math> becomes the following. If ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', if ''I'' is an ideal of ''S'' such that the ''I''-adic topology on ''S'' is complete, and if ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>r</sub>'' are elements of ''I'', then there is a ''unique'' map <math>\\Phi: R[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]] \\to S</math> with the following properties:\n\n* \u03a6 is an ''R''-algebra homomorphism\n\n* \u03a6 is continuous\n\n* \u03a6(''X''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''r''.\n\n===Non-commuting variables===\nThe several variable case can be further generalised by taking ''non-commuting variables'' ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' \u2208 ''I'', where ''I'' is an index set and then a [[monomial]] ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> is any [[word (mathematics)|word]] in the ''X<sub>I</sub>''; a formal power series in ''X<sub>I</sub>'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> to a corresponding coefficient ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub>, and is denoted <math>\\textstyle\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha </math>. The set of all such formal power series is denoted ''R''\u00ab''X<sub>I</sub>''\u00bb, and it is given a ring structure by defining addition pointwise\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)+\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)=\\sum_\\alpha(c_\\alpha+d_\\alpha)X^\\alpha</math>\n\nand multiplication by\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)\\times\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} c_\\alpha d_\\beta X^{\\alpha} \\cdot X^{\\beta}</math>\n\nwhere \u00b7 denotes concatenation of words.

Thus a formal power series differs from a polynomial in that it may have infinitely many terms, and differs from a [[power series]], whose variables can take on numerical values. One way to view a formal power series is as an infinite ordered sequence of numbers. In this case, the powers of the variable are used only to indicate the order of the coefficients, so that the coefficient of <math>x^5</math> is the fifth term in the sequence. In [[combinatorics]], formal power series provide representations of numerical [[sequence]]s and of [[multiset]]s, and for instance allow concise expressions for [[recursion|recursively]] defined sequences regardless of whether the recursion can be explicitly solved; this is known as the method of [[generating function]]s. More generally, formal power series can include series with any finite number of variables, and with coefficients in an arbitrary [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Formal power series can be created from [[Taylor polynomial|Taylor polynomials]] using [[formal moduli]].\n\n==Introduction==\nA formal power series can be loosely thought of as an object that is like a [[polynomial]], but with infinitely many terms. Alternatively, for those familiar with [[power series]] (or [[Taylor series]]), one may think of a formal power series as a power series in which we ignore questions of [[Convergent series|convergence]] by not assuming that the variable ''X'' denotes any numerical value (not even an unknown value). For example, consider the series\n\n:<math>A = 1 - 3X + 5X^2 - 7X^3 + 9X^4 - 11X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nIf we studied this as a power series, its properties would include, for example, that its [[radius of convergence]] is 1. However, as a formal power series, we may ignore this completely; all that is relevant is the sequence of [[coefficient]]s [1, \u22123, 5, \u22127, 9, \u221211, ...]. In other words, a formal power series is an object that just records a sequence of coefficients. It is perfectly acceptable to consider a formal power series with the [[factorial]]s [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, ... ] as coefficients, even though the corresponding power series diverges for any nonzero value of ''X''.\n\nArithmetic on formal power series is carried out by simply pretending that the series are polynomials. For example, if\n\n:<math>B = 2X + 4X^3 + 6X^5 + \\cdots,</math>\n\nthen we add ''A'' and ''B'' term by term:\n\n:<math>A + B = 1 - X + 5X^2 - 3X^3 + 9X^4 - 5X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nWe can multiply formal power series, again just by treating them as polynomials (see in particular [[Cauchy product]]):\n\n:<math>AB = 2X - 6X^2 + 14X^3 - 26X^4 + 44X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nNotice that each coefficient in the product ''AB'' only depends on a ''finite'' number of coefficients of ''A'' and ''B''. For example, the ''X''<sup>5</sup> term is given by\n\n:<math>44X^5 = (1\\times 6X^5) + (5X^2 \\times 4X^3) + (9X^4 \\times 2X).</math>\n\nFor this reason, one may multiply formal power series without worrying about the usual questions of [[absolute convergence|absolute]], [[conditional convergence|conditional]] and [[uniform convergence]] which arise in dealing with power series in the setting of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].\n\nOnce we have defined multiplication for formal power series, we can define multiplicative inverses as follows. The multiplicative inverse of a formal power series ''A'' is a formal power series ''C'' such that ''AC'' = 1, provided that such a formal power series exists. It turns out that if ''A'' has a multiplicative inverse, it is unique, and we denote it by ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>. Now we can define division of formal power series by defining ''B''/''A'' to be the product ''BA''<sup>\u22121</sup>, provided that the inverse of ''A'' exists. For example, one can use the definition of multiplication above to verify the familiar formula\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{1 + X} = 1 - X + X^2 - X^3 + X^4 - X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nAn important operation on formal power series is coefficient extraction. In its most basic form, the coefficient extraction operator <math>[X^n]</math> applied to a formal power series <math>A</math> in one variable extracts the coefficient of the <math>n</math>th power of the variable, so that <math>[X^2]A=5</math> and <math>[X^5]A=-11</math>. Other examples include\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\left[X^3\\right] (B) &= 4, \\\\ \n\\left[X^2 \\right] (X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &= 3Y^3, \\\\\n\\left[X^2Y^3 \\right] ( X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &= 3, \\\\\n\\left[X^n \\right] \\left(\\frac{1}{1+X} \\right) &= (-1)^n, \\\\ \n\\left[X^n \\right] \\left(\\frac{X}{(1-X)^2} \\right) &= n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSimilarly, many other operations that are carried out on polynomials can be extended to the formal power series setting, as explained below.\n\n==The ring of formal power series==\n{{Ring theory sidebar}}\n\nIf one considers the set of all formal power series in ''X'' with coefficients in a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', the elements of this set collectively constitute another ring which is written <math>R[[X]],</math> and called the '''ring of formal power series''' in the variable&nbsp;''X'' over ''R''.\n\n===Definition of the formal power series ring===\nOne can characterize <math>R[[X]]</math> abstractly as the [[completeness (topology)|completion]] of the [[polynomial]] ring <math>R[X]</math> equipped with a particular [[metric space|metric]]<!-- in which the powers of the ideal ''I'' of <math>R[X]</math> generated by <math>X</math> form a shrinking set of neighbourhoods of 0; a precise description would be too long to spell out here-->. This automatically gives <math>R[[X]]</math> the structure of a [[topological ring]] (and even of a complete metric space). But the general construction of a completion of a metric space is more involved than what is needed here, and would make formal power series seem more complicated than they are. \nIt is possible to describe <math>R[[X]]</math> more explicitly, and define the ring structure and topological structure separately, as follows.\n\n====Ring structure====\nAs a set, <math>R[[X]]</math> can be constructed as the set <math>R^\\N</math> of all infinite sequences of elements of <math>R</math>, indexed by the [[natural number]]s (taken to include 0). Designating a sequence whose term at index <math>n</math> is <math>a_n</math> by <math>(a_n)</math>, one defines addition of two such sequences by\n\n:<math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N} + (b_n)_{n\\in\\N} = \\left( a_n + b_n \\right)_{n\\in\\N}</math>\n\nand multiplication by\n\n:<math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N} \\times (b_n)_{n\\in\\N} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} \\right)_{n\\in\\N}.</math>\n\nThis type of product is called the [[Cauchy product]] of the two sequences of coefficients, and is a sort of discrete [[convolution]]. With these operations, <math>R^\\N</math> becomes a commutative ring with zero element <math>(0,0,0,\\ldots)</math> and multiplicative identity <math>(1,0,0,\\ldots)</math>.\n\nThe product is in fact the same one used to define the product of polynomials in one indeterminate, which suggests using a similar notation. One embeds <math>R</math> into <math>R[[X]]</math> by sending any (constant) <math>a \\in R</math> to the sequence <math>(a,0,0,\\ldots)</math> and designates the sequence <math>(0,1,0,0,\\ldots)</math> by <math>X</math>; then using the above definitions every sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms can be expressed in terms of these special elements as\n\n:<math>(a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n, 0, 0, \\ldots) = a_0 + a_1 X + \\cdots + a_n X^n = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i X^i;</math>\n\nthese are precisely the polynomials in <math>X</math>. Given this, it is quite natural and convenient to designate a general sequence <math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N}</math> by the formal expression <math>\\textstyle\\sum_{i\\in\\N}a_i X^i</math>, even though the latter ''is not'' an expression formed by the operations of addition and multiplication defined above (from which only finite sums can be constructed). This notational convention allows reformulation of the above definitions as\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right)+\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{i\\in\\N}(a_i+b_i) X^i</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{n\\in\\N} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}\\right) X^n.</math>\n\nwhich is quite convenient, but one must be aware of the distinction between formal summation (a mere convention) and actual addition.\n\n==== Topological structure ====\nHaving stipulated conventionally that\n\n:<math>(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i X^i, \\qquad (1)</math>\n\none would like to interpret the right hand side as a well-defined infinite summation. To that end, a notion of convergence in <math>R^\\N</math> is defined and a [[topology]] on <math>R^\\N</math> is constructed. There are several equivalent ways to define the desired topology.\n\n* We may give <math>R^\\N</math> the [[product topology]], where each copy of <math>R</math> is given the [[discrete topology]].\n\n* We may give <math>R^\\N</math> the [[I-adic topology]], where <math>I=(X)</math> is the ideal generated by <math>X</math>, which consists of all sequences whose first term <math>a_0</math> is zero.\n\n* The desired topology could also be derived from the following [[metric space|metric]]. The distance between distinct sequences <math>(a_n), (b_n) \\in R^{\\N},</math> is defined to be\n::<math>d((a_n), (b_n)) = 2^{-k},</math>\n:where <math>k</math> is the smallest [[natural number]] such that <math>a_k\\neq b_k</math>; the distance between two equal sequences is of course zero.\n\nInformally, two sequences <math>\\{a_n\\}</math> and <math>\\{b_n\\}</math> become closer and closer if and only if more and more of their terms agree exactly. Formally, the sequence of [[partial sum]]s of some infinite summation converges if for every fixed power of <math>X</math> the coefficient stabilizes: there is a point beyond which all further partial sums have the same coefficient. This is clearly the case for the right hand side of (1), regardless of the values <math>a_n</math>, since inclusion of the term for <math>i=n</math> gives the last (and in fact only) change to the coefficient of <math>X^n</math>. It is also obvious that the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the sequence of partial sums is equal to the left hand side.\n\nThis topological structure, together with the ring operations described above, form a topological ring. This is called the '''ring of formal power series over <math>R</math>''' and is denoted by <math>R[[X]]</math>. The topology has the useful property that an infinite summation converges if and only if the sequence of its terms converges to 0, which just means that any fixed power of <math>X</math> occurs in only finitely many terms.\n\nThe topological structure allows much more flexible usage of infinite summations. For instance the rule for multiplication can be restated simply as\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{i,j\\in\\N} a_i b_j X^{i+j},</math>\n\nsince only finitely many terms on the right affect any fixed <math>X^n</math>. Infinite products are also defined by the topological structure; it can be seen that an infinite product converges if and only if the sequence of its factors converges to 1.\n\n==== Alternative topologies ====\nThe above topology is the [[Comparison of topologies|finest topology]] for which \n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i X^i</math> \n\nalways converges as a summation to the formal power series designated by the same expression, and it often suffices to give a meaning to infinite sums and products, or other kinds of limits that one wishes to use to designate particular formal power series. It can however happen occasionally that one wishes to use a coarser topology, so that certain expressions become convergent that would otherwise diverge. This applies in particular when the base ring <math>R</math> already comes with a topology other than the discrete one, for instance if it is also a ring of formal power series.\n\nConsider the ring of formal power series: <math>\\Z[[X]][[Y]]</math>; then the topology of above construction only relates to the indeterminate <math>Y</math>, since the topology that was put on <math>\\Z[[X]]</math> has been replaced by the discrete topology when defining the topology of the whole ring. So\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\N}XY^i</math>\n\nconverges to the power series suggested, which can be written as <math>\\tfrac{X}{1-Y}</math>; however the summation\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\N}X^iY</math>\n\nwould be considered to be divergent, since every term affects the coefficient of <math>Y</math> (which coefficient is itself a power series in <math>X</math>). This asymmetry disappears if the power series ring in <math>Y</math> is given the product topology where each copy of <math>\\Z[[X]]</math> is given its topology as a ring of formal power series rather than the discrete topology. As a consequence, for convergence of a sequence of elements of <math>\\Z[[X]][[Y]]</math> it then suffices that the coefficient of each power of <math>Y</math> converges to a formal power series in <math>X</math>, a weaker condition than stabilizing entirely; for instance in the second example given here the coefficient of <math>Y</math>converges to <math>\\tfrac{1}{1-X}</math>, so the whole summation converges to <math>\\tfrac{Y}{1-X}</math>.\n\nThis way of defining the topology is in fact the standard one for repeated constructions of rings of formal power series, and gives the same topology as one would get by taking formal power series in all indeterminates at once. In the above example that would mean constructing <math>\\Z[[X,Y]],</math> and here a sequence converges if and only if the coefficient of every monomial <math>X^iY^j</math> stabilizes. This topology, which is also the <math>I</math>-adic topology, where <math>I=(X,Y)</math> is the ideal generated by <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>, still enjoys the property that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\n\nThe same principle could be used to make other divergent limits converge. For instance in <math>\\R[[X]]</math> the limit\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{X}{n}\\right)^n</math>\n\ndoes not exist, so in particular it does not converge to \n\n:<math>\\exp(X)=\\sum_{n\\in\\N}\\frac{X^n}{n!}.</math>\n\nThis is because for <math>i\\geq 2</math> the coefficient <math>\\tbinom{n}{i}/n^i</math> of <math>X^i</math> does not stabilize as <math>n\\to \\infty</math>. It does however converge in the usual topology of <math>\\R</math>, and in fact to the coefficient <math>\\tfrac{1}{i!}</math> of <math>\\exp(X)</math>. Therefore, if one would give <math>\\R[[X]]</math> the product topology of <math>\\R^\\N</math> where the topology of <math>\\R</math> is the usual topology rather than the discrete one, then the above limit would converge to <math>\\exp(X)</math>. This more permissive approach is not however the standard when considering formal power series, as it would lead to convergence considerations that are as subtle as they are in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]], while the philosophy of formal power series is on the contrary to make convergence questions as trivial as they can possibly be. With this topology it would ''not'' be the case that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\n\n===Universal property===\nThe ring <math>R[[X]]</math> may be characterized by the following [[universal property]].

In this case, <math>f^{\\alpha}</math> can be defined either by composition with the [[binomial series]] (1+''x'')<sup>\u03b1</sup>, or by composition with the exponential and the logarithmic series, <math>f^{\\alpha}=\\exp(\\alpha\\log(f)),</math> or as the solution of the differential equation <math>f( f^{\\alpha})' = \\alpha f^{\\alpha} f'</math> with constant term 1, the three definitions being equivalent. The rules of calculus <math>(f^\\alpha)^\\beta = f^{\\alpha\\beta}</math> and <math>f^\\alpha g^\\alpha = (fg)^\\alpha</math> easily follow.\n\n=== Multiplicative inverse ===\nThe series\n\n:<math>A = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n X^n \\in R[[X]]</math>\n\nis invertible in <math>R[[X]]</math> if and only if its constant coefficient <math>a_0</math> is invertible in <math>R</math>. This condition is necessary, for the following reason: if we suppose that <math>A</math> has an inverse <math>B = b_0 + b_1 x + \\cdots</math> then the [[constant term]] <math>a_0b_0</math> of <math>A \\cdot B</math> is the constant term of the identity series, i.e. it is 1. This condition is also sufficient; we may compute the coefficients of the inverse series <math>B</math> via the explicit recursive formula\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nb_0 &= \\frac{1}{a_0},\\\\\nb_n &= -\\frac{1}{a_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{n-i}, \\ \\ \\ n \\geq 1.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAn important special case is that the [[geometric series]] formula is valid in <math>K[[X]]</math>:\n\n:<math>(1 - X)^{-1} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty X^n.</math>\n\nIf <math>R=K</math> is a field, then a series is invertible if and only if the constant term is non-zero, i.e. if and only if the series is not divisible by <math>X</math>.

In other words, the series for <math>g(f(X))</math> converges in the [[Completion (ring theory)#Krull topology|topology]] of <math>R[[X]]</math>.\n\n==== Example ====\nAssume that the ring <math>R</math> has characteristic 0 and the nonzero integers are invertible in <math>R</math>. If we denote by <math>\\exp(X)</math> the formal power series\n\n:<math>\\exp(X) = 1 + X + \\frac{X^2}{2!} + \\frac{X^3}{3!} + \\frac{X^4}{4!} + \\cdots,</math>\n\nthen the expression\n\n:<math>\\exp(\\exp(X) - 1) = 1 + X + X^2 + \\frac{5X^3}6 + \\frac{5X^4}8 + \\cdots</math>\n\nmakes perfect sense as a formal power series. However, the statement\n\n:<math>\\exp(\\exp(X)) = e \\exp(\\exp(X) - 1) = e + eX + eX^2 + \\frac{5eX^3}{6} + \\cdots</math>\n\nis not a valid application of the composition operation for formal power series. Rather, it is confusing the notions of convergence in <math>R[[X]]</math> and convergence in <math>R</math>; indeed, the ring <math>R</math> may not even contain any number <math>e</math> with the appropriate properties.\n\n=== Composition inverse ===\nWhenever a formal series \n\n:<math>f(X)=\\sum_k f_k X^k \\in R[[X]]</math> \n\nhas ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0 and ''f''<sub>1</sub> being an invertible element of ''R'', there exists a series \n\n:<math>g(X)=\\sum_k g_k X^k</math> \n\nthat is the [[composition inverse]] of <math>f</math>, meaning that composing <math>f</math> with <math>g</math> gives the series representing the [[identity function]] (whose first coefficient is 1 and all other coefficients are zero). The coefficients of <math>g</math> may be found recursively by using the above formula for the coefficients of a composition, equating them with those of the composition identity ''X'' (that is 1 at degree 1 and 0 at every degree greater than 1). In the case when the coefficient ring is a field of characteristic 0, the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]] provides a powerful tool to compute the coefficients of ''g'', as well as the coefficients of the (multiplicative) powers of ''g''.\n\n=== Formal differentiation ===\nGiven a formal power series\n\n:<math>f = \\sum_{n\\geq 0} a_n X^n \\in R[[X]],</math>\n\nwe define its '''[[formal derivative]]''', denoted ''Df'' or ''f''\u2032, by\n\n:<math> Df = \\sum_{n \\geq 1} a_n n X^{n-1}.</math>\n\nThe symbol ''D'' is called the '''formal differentiation operator'''. The motivation behind this definition is that it simply mimics term-by-term differentiation of a polynomial.\n\nThis operation is ''R''-[[linear operator|linear]]:\n\n:<math>D(af + bg) = a \\cdot Df + b \\cdot Dg</math>\n\nfor any ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' and any ''f'', ''g'' in <math>R[[X]].</math> Additionally, the formal derivative has many of the properties of the usual [[derivative]] of calculus. For example, the [[product rule]] is valid:\n\n:<math>D(fg) = f \\cdot (Dg) + (Df) \\cdot g,</math>\n\nand the [[chain rule]] works as well:\n\n:<math>D(f\\circ g ) = ( Df\\circ g ) \\cdot Dg,</math>\n\nwhenever the appropriate compositions of series are defined (see above under [[#Composition of series|composition of series]]).\n\nThus, in these respects formal power series behave like [[Taylor series]]. Indeed, for the ''f'' defined above, we find that\n\n:<math>(D^k f)(0) = k! a_k, </math>\n\nwhere ''D''<sup>''k''</sup> denotes the ''k''th formal derivative (that is, the result of formally differentiating ''k'' times).\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Algebraic properties of the formal power series ring ===\n<math>R[[X]]</math> is an [[associative algebra]] over <math>R</math> which contains the ring <math>R[X]</math> of polynomials over <math>R</math>; the polynomials correspond to the sequences which end in zeros.\n\nThe [[Jacobson radical]] of <math>R[[X]]</math> is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by <math>X</math> and the Jacobson radical of <math>R</math>; this is implied by the element invertibility criterion discussed above.\n\nThe [[maximal ideal]]s of <math>R[[X]]</math> all arise from those in <math>R</math> in the following manner: an ideal <math>M</math> of <math>R[[X]]</math> is maximal if and only if <math>M\\cap R</math> is a maximal ideal of <math>R</math> and <math>M</math> is generated as an ideal by <math>X</math> and <math>M\\cap R</math>.\n\nSeveral algebraic properties of <math>R</math> are inherited by <math>R[[X]]</math>:\n\n* if <math>R</math> is a [[local ring]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>,\n\n* if <math>R</math> is [[noetherian ring|Noetherian]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>. This is a version of the [[Hilbert basis theorem]],\n\n* if <math>R</math> is an [[integral domain]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>,\n\n* if <math>K</math> is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then <math>K[[X]]</math> is a [[discrete valuation ring]].\n\n=== Topological properties of the formal power series ring ===\nThe metric space <math>(R[[X]], d)</math> is [[completeness (topology)|complete]].\n\nThe ring <math>R[[X]]</math> is [[compact space|compact]] if and only if ''R'' is [[finite set|finite]]. This follows from [[Tychonoff's theorem]] and the characterisation of the topology on <math>R[[X]]</math> as a product topology.\n\n=== Weierstrass preparation ===\n{{main article|Weierstrass preparation theorem#Formal power series in complete local rings}}\nThe ring of formal power series with coefficients in a [[complete local ring]] satisfies the [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]].\n\n==Applications==\nFormal power series can be used to solve recurrences occurring in number theory and combinatorics. For an example involving finding a closed form expression for the [[Fibonacci number]]s, see the article on [[Examples of generating functions]].\n\nOne can use formal power series to prove several relations familiar from analysis in a purely algebraic setting. Consider for instance the following elements of <math>\\Q[[X]]</math>:\n\n:<math> \\sin(X) := \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\frac{(-1)^n} {(2n+1)!} X^{2n+1} </math>\n:<math> \\cos(X) := \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\frac{(-1)^n} {(2n)!} X^{2n} </math>\n\nThen one can show that\n\n:<math>\\sin^2(X) + \\cos^2(X) = 1,</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} \\sin(X) = \\cos(X),</math>\n:<math>\\sin (X+Y) = \\sin(X) \\cos(Y) + \\cos(X) \\sin(Y).</math>\n\nThe last one being valid in the ring <math>\\Q[[X, Y]].</math>\n\nFor ''K'' a field, the ring <math>K[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]]</math> is often used as the \"standard, most general\" complete local ring over ''K'' in algebra.\n\n==Interpreting formal power series as functions==\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], every convergent [[power series]] defines a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with values in the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers. Formal power series can also be interpreted as functions, but one has to be careful with the [[function domain|domain]] and [[codomain]]. Let \n\n:<math>f = \\sum a_n X^n \\in R[[X]],</math> \n\nand suppose ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', ''I'' is an ideal in ''S'' such that the [[I-adic topology]] on ''S'' is complete, and ''x'' is an element of ''I''. Define:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\sum_{n\\ge 0} a_n x^n.</math>\n\nThis series is guaranteed to converge in ''S'' given the above assumptions on ''x''. Furthermore, we have\n\n:<math> (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> (fg)(x) = f(x) g(x).</math>\n\nUnlike in the case of bona fide functions, these formulas are not definitions but have to be proved.\n\nSince the topology on <math>R[[X]]</math> is the (''X'')-adic topology and <math>R[[X]]</math> is complete, we can in particular apply power series to other power series, provided that the arguments don't have [[constant coefficients]] (so that they belong to the ideal (''X'')): ''f''(0), ''f''(''X''<sup>2</sup>\u2212''X'') and ''f''((1\u2212''X'')<sup>\u22121</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) are all well defined for any formal power series <math>f \\in R[[X]].</math>\n\nWith this formalism, we can give an explicit formula for the multiplicative inverse of a power series ''f'' whose constant coefficient ''a'' = ''f''(0) is invertible in ''R'':\n\n:<math>f^{-1} = \\sum_{n \\ge 0} a^{-n-1} (a-f)^n.</math>\n\nIf the formal power series ''g'' with ''g''(0) = 0 is given implicitly by the equation\n\n:<math>f(g) =X</math>\n\nwhere ''f'' is a known power series with ''f''(0) = 0, then the coefficients of ''g'' can be explicitly computed using the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n=== Formal Laurent series ===\nA '''formal Laurent series''' over a ring <math>R</math> is defined in a similar way to a formal power series, except that we also allow finitely many terms of negative degree (this is different from the classical [[Laurent series]]), that is series of the form\n\n:<math>f = \\sum_{n\\in\\Z} a_n X^n</math>\n\nwhere '''<math>a_n=0</math> for all but finitely many negative indices <math>n</math>'''. Multiplication of such series can be defined. Indeed, similarly to the definition for formal power series, the coefficient of ''X<sup>k</sup>'' of two series with respective sequences of coefficients <math>\\{a_n\\}</math> and <math>\\{b_n\\}</math> is\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\Z}a_ib_{k-i},</math>\n\nwhich sum is effectively finite because of the assumed vanishing of coefficients at sufficiently negative indices, and which sum zero for sufficiently negative <math>k</math> for the same reason.\n\nFor a non-zero formal Laurent series, the minimal integer <math>n</math> such that <math> a_n\\neq 0</math> is called the order of <math>f</math>, denoted <math>\\operatorname{ord}(f).</math> (The order of the zero series is <math>+\\infty</math>.) The formal Laurent series form the '''ring of formal Laurent series''' over <math>R</math>, denoted by <math>R((X))</math>. It is equal to the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of <math>R[[X]]</math> with respect to the set of positive powers of <math>X</math>. It is a topological ring with the metric:\n\n:<math>d(f,g)=2^{-\\operatorname{ord}(f-g)}.</math>\n\nIf <math>R=K</math> is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then <math>K((X))</math> is in fact a field, which may alternatively be obtained as the [[field of fractions]] of the [[integral domain]] <math>K[[X]]</math>.\n\nOne may define formal differentiation for formal Laurent series in a natural way (term-by-term). Precisely, the formal derivative of the formal Laurent series <math>f</math> above is\n\n:<math>f' = Df = \\sum_{n\\in\\Z} na_n X^{n-1}</math>\n\nwhich is again an element of <math>K((X))</math>. Notice that if <math>f</math> is a non-constant formal Laurent series, and K is a field of characteristic 0, then one has\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{ord}(f')= \\operatorname{ord}(f)-1.</math>\n\nHowever, in general this is not the case since the factor ''n'' for the lowest order term could be equal to 0 in ''R''.\n\n====Formal residue====\nAssume that <math>K</math> is a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. Then the map\n\n:<math>D\\colon K((X))\\to K((X))</math>\n\nis a <math>K</math>-[[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] that satisfies\n\n:<math>\\ker D=K</math>\n:<math>\\operatorname{im} D= \\left \\{f\\in K((X)) : [X^{-1}]f=0 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nThe latter shows that the coefficient of <math>X^{-1}</math> in <math>f</math> is of particular interest; it is called ''formal residue of <math>f</math>'' and denoted <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f)</math>. The map\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Res} : K((X))\\to K</math>\n\nis <math>K</math>-linear, and by the above observation one has an [[exact sequence]]\n\n:<math>0 \\to K \\to K((X)) \\xrightarrow{D} K((X)) \\;\\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{Res}}\\; K \\to 0.</math>\n\n'''Some rules of calculus'''. As a quite direct consequence of the above definition, and of the rules of formal derivation, one has, for any <math>f, g\\in K((X))</math>\n:i. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f')=0;</math>\n:ii. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(fg')=-\\operatorname{Res}(f'g);</math>\n:iii. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=\\operatorname{ord}(f),\\qquad \\forall f\\neq0;</math>\n:iv. <math>\\operatorname{Res}\\left(( f\\circ g) g'\\right) = \\operatorname{ord}(g)\\operatorname{Res}(f),</math> if <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)>0;</math>\n:v. <math>[X^n]f(X)=\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^{-n-1}f(X)\\right).</math>\n\nProperty (i) is part of the exact sequence above. Property (ii) follows from (i) as applied to <math>(fg)'=f'g+fg'</math>. Property (iii): any <math>f</math> can be written in the form <math>f=X^mg</math>, with <math>m=\\operatorname{ord}(f)</math> and <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)=0</math>: then <math>f'/f = mX^{-1}+g'/g.</math> <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)=0</math> implies <math>g</math> is invertible in <math>K[[X]]\\subset \\operatorname{im}(D) = \\ker(\\operatorname{Res}),</math> whence <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=m.</math> Property (iv): Since <math>\\operatorname{im}(D) = \\ker(\\operatorname{Res}),</math> we can write <math>f=f_{-1}X^{-1}+F',</math> with <math>F \\in K((X))</math>. Consequently, <math>(f\\circ g)g'= f_{-1}g^{-1}g'+(F'\\circ g)g' = f_{-1}g'/g + (F \\circ g)'</math> and (iv) follows from (i) and (iii). Property (v) is clear from the definition.\n\n===The Lagrange inversion formula===\n{{main|Lagrange inversion theorem}}\nAs mentioned above, any formal series <math>f \\in K[[X]]</math> with ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0 and ''f''<sub>1</sub> \u2260 0 has a composition inverse <math>g \\in K[[X]].</math> The following relation between the coefficients ''g<sup>n</sup>'' and ''f''<sup>\u2212''k''</sup> holds (\"{{Visible anchor|Lagrange inversion formula}}\"):\n\n:<math>k[X^k] g^n=n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}.</math>\n\nIn particular, for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and all ''k''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1,\n\n:<math>[X^k] g=\\frac{1}{k} \\operatorname{Res}\\left( f^{-k}\\right).</math>\n\nSince the proof of the Lagrange inversion formula is a very short computation, it is worth reporting it here. Since <math>\\operatorname{ord}(f) =1 </math>, by the above rules of calculus,\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nk[X^k] g^n & =k\\operatorname{Res}\\left( g^n X^{-k-1}  \\right)\n=k\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^n f^{-k-1}f\\,'\\right)\n=-\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^n (f^{-k})^'\\right) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Res}\\left(\\left(X^n\\right)' f^{-k}\\right)\n=n\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^{n-1}f^{-k}\\right)\n=n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n'''Generalizations.''' One may observe that the above computation can be repeated plainly in more general settings than ''K''((''X'')): a generalization of the Lagrange inversion formula is already available working in the <math>\\Complex((X))</math>-modules <math>X^{\\alpha}\\Complex((X)),</math> where \u03b1 is a complex exponent. As a consequence, if ''f'' and ''g'' are as above, with <math>f_1=g_1=1</math>, we can relate the complex powers of ''f''/''X'' and ''g''/''X'': precisely, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are non-zero complex numbers with negative integer sum, <math>m=-\\alpha-\\beta\\in\\N,</math> then\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\alpha}[X^m]\\left( \\frac{f}{X} \\right)^\\alpha=-\\frac{1}{\\beta}[X^m]\\left( \\frac{g}{X} \\right)^\\beta.</math>\n\nFor instance, this way one finds the power series for [[Lambert W function#Integer and complex powers|complex powers of the Lambert function]].\n\n=== Power series in several variables ===\nFormal power series in any number of indeterminates (even infinitely many) can be defined. If ''I'' is an index set and ''X<sub>I</sub>'' is the set of indeterminates ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i''\u2208''I'', then a [[monomial]] ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> is any finite product of elements of ''X<sub>I</sub>'' (repetitions allowed); a formal power series in ''X<sub>I</sub>'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> to a corresponding coefficient ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub>, and is denoted <math>\\textstyle\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha</math>. The set of all such formal power series is denoted <math>R[[X_I]],</math> and it is given a ring structure by defining\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)+\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha \\right)= \\sum_\\alpha (c_\\alpha+d_\\alpha) X^\\alpha</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)\\times\\left(\\sum_\\beta d_\\beta X^\\beta\\right)=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} c_\\alpha d_\\beta X^{\\alpha+\\beta}</math>\n\n==== Topology ====\nThe topology on <math>R[[X_I]]</math> is such that a sequence of its elements converges only if for each monomial ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> the corresponding coefficient stabilizes. If ''I'' is finite, then this the ''J''-adic topology, where ''J'' is the ideal of <math>R[[X_I]]</math> generated by all the indeterminates in ''X<sub>I</sub>''. This does not hold if ''I'' is infinite. For example, if <math>I=\\N,</math> then the sequence <math>(f_n)_{n\\in \\N}</math> with <math>f_n = X_n + X_{n+1} + X_{n+2} + \\cdots </math> does not converge with respect to any ''J''-adic topology on ''R'', but clearly for each monomial the corresponding coefficient stabilizes.\n\nAs remarked above, the topology on a repeated formal power series ring like <math>R[[X]][[Y]]</math> is usually chosen in such a way that it becomes isomorphic as a [[topological ring]] to <math>R[[X,Y]].</math>\n\n====Operations====\nAll of the operations defined for series in one variable may be extended to the several variables case.\n\n* A series is invertible if and only if its constant term is invertible in ''R''.\n\n* The composition ''f''(''g''(''X'')) of two series ''f'' and ''g'' is defined if ''f'' is a series in a single indeterminate, and the constant term of ''g'' is zero. For a series ''f'' in several indeterminates a form of \"composition\" can similarly be defined, with as many separate series in the place of ''g'' as there are indeterminates.\n\nIn the case of the formal derivative, there are now separate [[partial derivative]] operators, which differentiate with respect to each of the indeterminates. They all commute with each other.\n\n==== Universal property ====\nIn the several variables case, the universal property characterizing <math>R[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]]</math> becomes the following. If ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', if ''I'' is an ideal of ''S'' such that the ''I''-adic topology on ''S'' is complete, and if ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>r</sub>'' are elements of ''I'', then there is a ''unique'' map <math>\\Phi: R[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]] \\to S</math> with the following properties:\n\n* \u03a6 is an ''R''-algebra homomorphism\n\n* \u03a6 is continuous\n\n* \u03a6(''X''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''r''.\n\n===Non-commuting variables===\nThe several variable case can be further generalised by taking ''non-commuting variables'' ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' \u2208 ''I'', where ''I'' is an index set and then a [[monomial]] ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> is any [[word (mathematics)|word]] in the ''X<sub>I</sub>''; a formal power series in ''X<sub>I</sub>'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> to a corresponding coefficient ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub>, and is denoted <math>\\textstyle\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha </math>. The set of all such formal power series is denoted ''R''\u00ab''X<sub>I</sub>''\u00bb, and it is given a ring structure by defining addition pointwise\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)+\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)=\\sum_\\alpha(c_\\alpha+d_\\alpha)X^\\alpha</math>\n\nand multiplication by\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)\\times\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} c_\\alpha d_\\beta X^{\\alpha} \\cdot X^{\\beta}</math>\n\nwhere \u00b7 denotes concatenation of words.

A number of them died on the battlefield, most famously [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[Wilfred Owen]], and [[Charles Sorley]]. Others including [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Richard Perceval Graves, \u2018Graves, Robert von Ranke (1895\u20131985)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> [[Ivor Gurney]] and Siegfried Sassoon survived but were scarred by their experiences, and this was reflected in their poetry. Robert H. Ross describes the British \"war poets\" as [[Georgian Poetry|Georgian poets]].<ref>''The Georgian Revolt'', p. 166.</ref> Many poems by British war poets were published in newspapers and then collected in anthologies. Several of these early anthologies were published during the war and were very popular, though the tone of the poetry changed as the war progressed. One of the wartime anthologies, ''[[The Muse in Arms]]'', was published in 1917, and several were published in the years following the war.\n\n[[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]]' [[epic poem]] of World War I ''[[In Parenthesis]]'' was first published in England in 1937, and is based on Jones's own experience as an infantryman in the War. ''In Parenthesis'' narrates the experiences of English Private John Ball in a mixed English-Welsh regiment starting with their leaving England and ending seven months later with the assault on [[Mametz Wood]] during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The work employs a mixture of lyrical verse and prose, is highly allusive, and ranges in tone from formal to [[Cockney]] colloquial and military slang. The poem won the [[Hawthornden Prize]] and the admiration of writers such as [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>Dilworth, Thomas. ''Reading David Jones''.

He later recalled that when the war began, his first feelings of patriotism were towards Germany. After being briefly interned at [[Trier]] and ordered to leave the country, Sorley returned to [[Great Britain]] and enlisted in the [[Suffolk Regiment]] as a [[Lieutenant]]. He was killed by a German [[sniper]] during the [[Battle of Loos]] in 1915 and his poems and letters were published posthumously. \n\n[[Robert Graves]] described Charles Sorley in ''[[Goodbye to All That]]'' as \"one of the three poets of importance killed during the war\". (The other two being [[Isaac Rosenberg]] and [[Wilfred Owen]].) Sorley believed that Germans and British were equally blind to each other's humanity and his [[anti-war]] poetry stands in direct contrast to the jingoistic nationalism of [[Rupert Brooke]].\n\nIn 1969, [[Gairm]] posthumously published the first book of poems by [[D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh Chor\u00f9na]], a combat veteran of the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|King's Own Cameron Highlanders]] during World War I and war poet in the [[Scottish Gaelic language]]. Unlike [[Wilfred Owen]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]], D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh believed himself to be fighting a [[just war]] against a terrible enemy. His anger over the futility of the war only boiled over after he returned to his home in [[North Uist]], in the [[Outer Hebrides]], and found that none of the promises that had been made to soldiers from the Scottish [[Highlands and Islands]] were going to be kept. The rents were still high, the population was still impoverished, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] were still prosecuted as [[poaching]], and the [[omnipotence]] of the island's [[Anglo-Scottish]] landlord was exactly as it had been before the war began.\n\n[[File:Thiepval Memorial to the missing.jpg|thumb|right|Thiepval Memorial, France.]]\nD\u00f2mhnall Ruadh's poetry book proved very popular and began being used to teach the Gaelic language in the schools of the Scottish Highlands and Islands. An expanded and [[bilingual]] edition was published by the Historical Society of North Uist in 1995. In 2016, Scottish folk singer and North Uist native [[Julie Fowlis]] performed D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh's war songs in Gaelic at the [[Thiepval Memorial]] on the hundredth anniversary of the [[Battle of the Somme]].\n\n===Wales===\nAt the outbreak of World War I, [[militarism]] was seen in [[Wales]] as a very English trait. Throughout the war, voluntary enlistments remained very low and [[conscription]] was ultimately enacted to forcibly bring the [[Welsh people]] into the [[British armed forces]]. \n\n[[File:Hedd Wyn statue.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Hedd Wyn]] in his home village of [[Trawsfynydd]].]]\nThe most famous [[Welsh language]] war poet remains Private [[Ellis Humphrey Evans]] of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], who is best known under his [[bardic name]] of [[Hedd Wyn]]. Hedd Wyn was killed by [[shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] from a German shell during his battalion's assault on [[Pilckem Ridge]] during the first day of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917. Just a few weeks later, he was posthumously [[Chairing of the Bard|awarded the Chair]] at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]]. The [[Bardic Chair]] was delivered to the farmhouse of the Bard's parents draped in a black sheet.\n\n[[File:Cynan 1956 Aberdar.jpg|thumb|The Archdruid Cynan (middle) at the National Eisteddfod at Aberdare, 1956.]]\nAnother great [[Welsh language]] war poet was Rev. [[Albert Evans-Jones]], who served on the [[Macedonian Front|Salonica Front]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as a [[RAMC]] ambulance man and later as a [[military chaplain]]. After the war, he became a minister for the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]] and wrote many poems that shocked the Welsh population with their graphic descriptions of the horrors of the trenches and their savage attacks on wartime [[ultra-nationalism]]. Rev. Evans-Jones, whom [[Alan Llwyd]] considers the greatest Welsh poet of the Great War, is best known under the [[bardic name]] of [[Cynan]]. \n\nWelsh poet Alan Llwyd's English translations of many poems by both poets appear in the volume ''Out of the Fire of Hell; Welsh Experience of the Great War 1914-1918 in Prose and Verse''.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:LostBattalionMonument.JPG|thumb|right|Monument to the [[Lost Battalion (World War I)|Lost Battalion]], Argonne Forest, France.]]\nThe [[United States]] only entered the Great War in May 1917. By that time, the mass mechanized slaughter at [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], which still haunt the other combatant nations, had already taken place. \n\nBy the time large numbers of soldiers from the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] arrived in France, they faced an [[Imperial German Army]] that was starving, exhausted, and which had already been bled white by three years of war. Furthermore, the [[German people]] were being systematically starved by a [[Royal Navy]] blockade and were increasingly on the brink of [[German Revolution of 1918|Revolution]]. Although American [[Doughboys]] helped stem the [[1918 Spring Offensive]], won the [[Meuse-Argonne Campaign]], and saved the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] from having to contract a negotiated peace with the [[Central Powers]], America's losses were far fewer than those of other nations. For this reason, [[World War I]] is a forgotten war in America today. \n\nAlthough [[World War I]] in [[American literature]] is widely believed to begin and end with [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[war novel]] ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', there were also American war poets. \n\n[[File:Alan seeger foreign legion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alan Seeger]] in his [[French Foreign Legion]] uniform]]\n[[Alan Seeger]], the uncle of [[Marxist]] folk singer [[Pete Seeger]], enlisted in the [[French Foreign Legion]] while America was still neutral and became the first great American poet of the First World War.

Decades after his passing, Seeger's poem ''I Have a Rendezvous with Death'' was a great favorite of [[U.S. President]] [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]].

The collection, which is written in an experimental form unique in the history of the [[sonnet]], traces Wyeth's military service as a [[Lieutenant]] with the [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd U.S. Infantry Division]] from the time he received orders to embark for France, during the ocean voyage and through his journey into the firing line. Although the collection was very well reviewed, the [[1929 Stock Market Crash]] soon followed its publication and Wyeth's poetry was swiftly forgotten. When John Allan Wyeth died on May 11, 1981, his [[obituary]] made no mention of the fact that he had been a poet.\n\nAccording to poet and literary critic [[Dana Gioia]], who rescued Wyeth's poetry from oblivion during the early [[21st century]], Wyeth is the only American poet of the First World War who can be compared with English war poets [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], and [[Wilfred Owen]].

After being put on trial by the [[National Volunteers]] and accused of [[cowardice]] and of being Pro-German, Ledwidge enlisted in the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. He published three volumes of poetry between 1916\u201318, while he served at the [[Landing at Suvla Bay]], on the [[Macedonian Front]] and on the Western Front. Ledwidge expressed a belief in his poems and letters that he was fighting for [[Ireland]] rather than for the [[United Kingdom]]. Ultimately, Francis Ledwidge was \"blown to bits\" by a German shell while drinking tea in a shell hole on the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge|first day]] of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917.

Maj.

[[Royal Flying Corps]] records in the [[British National Archives]] state that Maj. Gregory was \"shot down in error by an Italian pilot\", a claim that has been repeated by both Yeats' and Lady Gregory's biographers. In 2017, Geoffrey O'Byrne White, a director of the [[Irish Aviation Authority]], the great-grandnephew of Lady Gregory, and a former pilot in the [[Irish Air Corps]], said he believed Major Gregory had become incapacitated at high altitude, attributing this to an [[inoculation]] that morning against [[influenza]].<ref>Ray Burke, \"Challenge to official accounts of Gregory death in WWI,\" 2 January 2018, RT\u00c9 News Now, https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2018/0101/930446-robert-gregory/</ref>\n\nIn Yeats' poem, Maj.

He comments that his countrymen are the poor [[Irish Catholics|Irish Catholic]] tenants of his mother's estate at [[Kiltartan]], [[County Galway]], that they will not mourn his death, and that his passing will have done nothing to improve their lives.

He saw combat in [[East Prussia]], the [[Macedonian Front]], and with the [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France]]. He was also decorated twice with the [[Cross of St. George]]. Gumilyov's war poems were assembled in the collection ''The Quiver'' (1916).\n\nGumilyov's wife, the poetess [[Anna Akhmatova]], began writing poems during World War I that expressed the collective suffering of the [[Russian people]] as men were called up and the women in their lives bade them goodbye. For Akhmatova, writing such poems turned into her life's work and she continued writing similar poems about the suffering of the Russian people during the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Terror]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]].\n\n===France===\nAmongst French World War I poets are the following: [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Adrien Bertrand]], [[Yvan Goll]], and [[Charles P\u00e9guy]].\n\n[[File:Louis Pergaud.jpg|thumb|left|Louis Pergaud]]\nThe French [[Symbolist]] poet [[Louis Pergaud]] considered himself a [[Pacifism|Pacifist]] and, at the outbreak of war in 1914, he tried in vain to register as a [[conscientious objector]]. Instead, he was conscripted into the [[French Army]] and sent to the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nOn 7 April 1915, Pergaud's regiment attacked the [[Imperial German Army]]'s trenches near [[Fresnes-en-Wo\u00ebvre]], during which he was wounded. Pergaud fell into [[barbed wire]], where he became trapped. Several hours later, German soldiers rescued him and other wounded French soldiers and took them to a temporary [[field hospital]] behind German lines. On the morning of April 8, 1915, Pergaud and many other [[POW]]s were killed by [[friendly fire]], when a French artillery barrage destroyed the hospital.\n\nThe [[Breton language]] poet and activist [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], a former Catholic seminarian who was best known by his [[Bardic name]] of ''Bleimor'', enlisted in the [[French Army]] on the outbreak of war in 1914. Like many others, Kalloc'h believed that France's war against Germany was a defense of civilization and [[Christianity]] and that it would lead to the resurrection of the Catholic Faith and the [[Breton language]] and [[Breton culture|culture]]. Ultimately, Kalloc'h, who wielded a sailor's axe in hand to hand combat in the trenches, was killed when a German shell landed near his dugout on April 10, 1917. His last poetry collection, ''Ar en Deulin'', was published posthumously.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Berlin, Mitte, Unter den Linden 4, Neue Wache.jpg|thumb|The [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] portal of the [[Neue Wache]] on [[Unter den Linden]] in [[Berlin]], which has been Germany's primary war memorial since 1931.]]\nGerman World War I poets include: [[Rudolf G. Binding]], [[Heinrich Mann]], and [[August Stramm]].\n\nWhen the war broke out in 1914, [[Gerrit Engelke]], a [[working class]] poet from [[Hanover]], was in neutral [[Denmark]]. He at first hesitated to return, but was ultimately forced to do so by financial pressures. He served in combat for four years, experiencing the battles of [[Langemarck]], [[Battle of St. Mihiel|St. Mihiel]], [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]], D\u00fcnaberg, and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. In 1916, he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for swimming across the flooded [[Yser River]]. Engelke was wounded in 1917 and, during his recovery, he became engaged to a war widow, but was forced to return to combat in May 1918. His friends attempted to have him transferred away from the firing line, much to Engelke's outrage, as he felt a deep loyalty to his brothers in arms. He was fatally injured in a successful British assault on October 11, 1918 and died the following day at a British [[field hospital]]. He had previously written, \"The greatest task which faces us after the war will be to forgive our enemy, who has, after all, been our neighbour on Earth since Creation.\"<ref> Tim Cross(1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 81.</ref> \n\nGerrit Engelke is best known for his [[anti-war]] poem ''An die Soldaten Des Grossen Krieges'' (\"To the Soldiers of the Great War\"), a poem in [[rhyme]]d [[dactylic hexameter]] modeled after the Neo-Classical odes of [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]. In the ode, Engelke urges the soldiers of all the combatant nations to join hands together in universal brotherhood. An English translation exists by Patrick Bridgwater.\n\n[[File:Walter Flex.jpg|thumb|left|Walter Flex]]\n[[Walter Flex]], who is best known as the author of the war poem ''[[Wild Geese (song)|Wildg\u00e4nse rauschen durch die Nacht]]'', was a native of [[Eisenach]] and attended the [[University of Erlangen]] before the outbreak of war. After service on both the Eastern and Western Fronts, Flex was [[killed in action]] at [[Saaremaa]], [[Estonia]] during [[Operation Albion]] on October 17, 1917. His poems, which were very patriotic in nature, remained very popular until the 1970s.\n\n[[File:Lajos Tihanyi Yvan Goll 1927.jpg|thumb|left|Yvan Goll in 1927.]]\n[[Yvan Goll]], a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] poet from the disputed territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], wrote bilingually in both German and French. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Goll fled to [[Switzerland]] to evade [[conscription]] into the [[Imperial German Army]]. While there, he wrote many [[anti-war]] poems, in which he sought to promote better understanding between Germany and France. His most famous poem is ''[[Requiem f\u00fcr die Todte in Europa]]'' (''[[Requiem for the Dead of Europe]]'').\n\n[[File:Stefan George 1910 Foto Jakob Hilsdorf.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan George in 1910.]]\n[[Stefan George]], a German poet who had done his literary [[apprenticeship]] with the French [[Symbolist]] poets in [[Paris]], still had many friends in [[France]] and viewed the Great War as disastrous. In his 1916 [[anti-war]] poem ''Der Krieg'' (\"The War\"), George attacked the horrors that soldiers of all nations were facing in the trenches. In the poem, George famously declared, \"The ancient god of battles is no more.\"\n\n[[File:RJSorge1.jpg|thumb|Reinhard Johannes Sorge on [[Furlough]] in [[Berlin]], 1915]]\n[[Reinhard Sorge]], the [[Kleist Prize]] winning author of the [[Expressionist]] play ''Der Bettler'', saw the coming of the war as an idealistic recent convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He wrote many poems, many of them in experimental forms, about both his Catholic Faith and what he was witnessing as a soldier with the [[Imperial German Army]] in France. Shortly before being [[mortally wounded]] by a grenade during the [[Battle of the Somme]], Sorge wrote to his wife expressing a belief that what he called, \"the Anglo-French Offensive\" was going to succeed in overrunning German defenses. Sorge died in a [[field hospital]] at [[Ablaincourt-Pressoir|Ablaincourt]] on July 20, 1916. Sorge's wife only learned of his death when a letter, in which she informed her husband that he had gotten her [[pregnant]] during his last [[furlough]], was returned to her as undeliverable.\n[[Image:Het treurende ouderpaar - K\u00e4the Kolwitz.JPG|thumb|left|The sculptures of ''The Grieving Parents'' by [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]], which date from the [[1930s]], stand vigil over the [[Vladslo German war cemetery]] in [[Belgium]].]]\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n[[File:BASA-1221K-1-48-11.jpg|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian soldiers resting in a trench]]\nThere were also war poets from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\n[[Franz Janowitz]], a Jewish poet from the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], had enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as a one year volunteer in 1913. He was wounded by machine gun fire during an assault on Monte Rombon and died of his wounds on November 4, 1917. According to Jeremy Adler, \"Franz Janowitz conflicts with the received idea of the best German war poets. Neither [[wikt:realistic|realistic]], nor ironic, nor properly [[expressionist]]ic, while he excoriated the battlefield that the whole world had become, he still preserved a Faith in nobility, innocence, and song. Forced into maturity by the war, his poetic voice never lost a certain childlike note - indeed, in some of his best poems, naivety and wisdom coexist to an almost paradoxical degree. Such poetry was fired by a vision of a transcendental realm that lay beyond conflict, but never sought to exclude death. His 25 years, the last four of which were spent in the Army, scarcely left him time to develop a wholly independent voice, but his work displays an increasing mastery of form and deepening of vision. His small ''oeuvre'' consists of ''Novellen'', essays, aphorisms, and a handful of the best German poems connected with the Great War.\"<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 109.</ref>\n\n[[File:Georg Trakl.jpg|thumb|left|Georg Trakl.]]\n[[Georg Trakl]], an [[Expressionist]] poet from [[Salzburg]], enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as a [[medical officer]] in 1914.

After the battle, Trakl was left in command of a [[field hospital]] filled with wounded soldiers and [[psychosis|mentally collapsed]] from the ensuing strain.\n\nOne evening following the battle Trakl ran outside and attempted to shoot himself in order to escape from the screams of the wounded and the dying. He was prevented from doing so and was sent to a [[mental hospital]]. On the night of November 3-4, 1914, Georg Trakl died in a military hospital in [[Cracow]] from an overdose of [[cocaine]]. Trakl's [[batman (military)|batman]], however, who was the last person to whom the poet spoke, believed that the overdose was an accident, rather than [[suicide]].<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 118.</ref>  Georg Trakl is best known for the poem ''[[Grodek]]''.\n\n[[G\u00e9za Gy\u00f3ni]], a Hungarian poet, enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in 1914.

Gy\u00f3ni was ultimately captured by the [[Imperial Russian Army]] after the [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl]] in 1915. After being held in atrocious conditions as a [[Prisoner of War]], he died in a POW camp at [[Krasnoyarsk]], in [[Siberia]] on June 25, 1917.

The monks' executioner's had then written in blood above their bodies, \"Thus strikes the [[CHEKA]].\" According to Campbell's biographer, [[Joseph Pearce]], and his daughters Anna and Tess, Campbell's subsequently pro-Nationalist stance has caused him to be unfairly labeled as a [[Fascist]] and left out of poetry anthologies and college courses.\n\nThe best [[Spanish language]] poets of the Civil War are [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] and the Machado brothers. [[Antonio  Machado]] wrote a poem to honor the [[Communist Party of Spain|Communist]] General [[Enrique L\u00edster]],<ref name=\"A L\u00edster\">''[http://www.rafaelrobles.com/webquests/pazperpetua/documentospazperpetua/alistermachado.htm A L\u00edster, jefe en los ej\u00e9rcitos del Ebro]'', Antonio Machado, June 1938.</ref> and died a [[refugee]] in [[France]] after the defeat of the Republic. Meanwhile, his brother, [[Manuel Machado y Ruiz|Manuel Machado]], dedicated a poem to the [[saber]] of the Nationalist Generalissimo [[Francisco Franco]].\n\n[[Chilean people|Chilean]] poet [[Pablo Neruda]] became intensely politicised for the first time during the Spanish Civil War. As a result of his experiences in Spain, Neruda became an ardent [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist]] and remained one for the rest of his life. The radical leftist politics of his literary friends were contributing factors, but the most important [[catalyst]] was the abduction and [[summary execution|execution without trial]] of the Republican poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] by Nationalist soldiers.<ref Name=\"Tarn16\">Tarn (1975) p. 16</ref> By means of his speeches and writings, Neruda threw his support behind the [[Second Spanish Republic]], publishing the collection ''Espa\u00f1a en el coraz\u00f3n'' (''Spain in Our Hearts'') in 1938. He lost his post as Chilean [[consul]] due to his refusal to remain politically neutral.<ref name=\"Tarn16\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n{{Category see also|World War II poets}}\n\n===England===\nBy [[World War II]] the role of \"war poet\" was so well-established in the public mind, and it was anticipated that the outbreak of war in 1939 would produce a literary response equal to that of the First World War. The [[Times Literary Supplement]] went so far as to pose the question in 1940: \"Where are the war-poets?\"<ref name=Blythe>{{cite book|last=Blythe|first=Ronald|title=Components of the Scene|year=1966|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth}}</ref> [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]] and [[Keith Douglas]] are the standard critical choices amongst British war poets of this time.<ref>[http://www.lrbshop.co.uk/collected-poems_4060.html London Review]; [[Andrew Sinclair]], ''The War Decade: An Anthology Of The 1940s''.

MacLean's time in the firing line ended when he was severely wounded at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. \n\nMacLean's most famous Gaelic war poem is ''Ruweisat Ridge'', which relates his thoughts on seeing a dead German soldier in North Africa. In the poem, MacLean ponders what role the dead man may have played in Nazi atrocities against both [[German Jews]] and members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. MacLean concludes, however, by saying that whatever the German soldier may or may not have done, he showed no pleasure in his death upon Ruweisat Ridge.\n\n===United States===\nThe horror of World War I was so deeply ingrained in the [[American people]] that [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s efforts to bring the United States into the war against [[Nazi Germany]] were very unpopular. The [[America First Committee]], of which [[Charles Lindbergh]] was the spokesman, and the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] were both organizing protests against Roosevelt's foreign policies. Opposition to entering the war vanished, however, when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. \n\nAlthough the [[Second World War]] is not usually thought of as a poet's war, there were American war poets.\n\nFuture [[U.S. Poet Laureate]] [[Richard Wilbur]] served as a [[Sergeant]] with the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th U.S. Infantry Division]] during the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], the Allied Landings in Southern France and in the final invasion of [[Nazi Germany]]. During his war service and the decades that followed, Richard Wilbur wrote many war poems. \n\nOne of Wilbur's best known war poems is ''Tywater'', about the combat death of Corporal Lloyd Tywater, a former rodeo cowboy with a talent for rope tricks, knife throwing, and shooting swallows out of the sky with a pistol. \n\nAnother famous war poem by Richard Wilbur is ''First Snow in Alsace'', which lyrically describes the horrors of a recent battlefield in [[Occupied France]] being covered up by the beautiful sight of new fallen snow.\n\nIn an interview for the documentary ''[[The Muse of Fire]]'', Wilbur commented that there was a great difference between the war poets of [[World War I]] and those of [[World War II]]. Wilbur explained that, unlike [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[Wilfred Owen]], [[World War II]] poets believed themselves to be fighting a [[just war]] and that [[Nazi Germany]], [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], and [[Imperial Japan]] were terrible enemies which needed to be confronted and destroyed. He did add that many World War II poets, including himself, felt sympathy for the plight of [[conscientious objector]]s.\n\nAmerican poet [[Dunstan Thompson]] began publishing his poems while serving as a soldier in the European Theater during World War II. Thompson's poems depict military service through the eyes of a [[homosexual]], who is engaged in casual encounters with soldiers and sailors in Blitzed London. \n\n[[Karl Shapiro]], a stylish writer with a commendable regard for his craft,<ref>Scannell, Vernon ''Not Without Glory'' Woburn Press , London 1976 {{ISBN|0713000945}}</ref>  wrote poetry in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] while he served there during World War II. His collection ''V-Letter and Other Poems'', written while Shapiro was stationed in [[New Guinea]], was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in [[1945 in literature|1945]], while Shapiro was still in the military. Shapiro was American Poet Laureate in 1946 and 1947. (At the time this title was Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress which was changed by Congress in 1985 to [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]].). \n\nAlso, while serving in the U.S. Army, the American poet [[Randall Jarrell]] published his second book of poems, ''Little Friend, Little Friend'' (1945) based on his wartime experiences. The book includes one of Jarrell's best known war poems, \"[[The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner]].\" In his follow-up book, ''Losses'' (1948), he also focused on the war. The poet [[Robert Lowell]] stated publicly that he thought Jarrell had written \"the best poetry in English about the Second World War.\"<ref>Gilroy, Harry. \"Poets Honor Memory of Jarrell at Yale.\" ''The New York Times'' 1 March 1966.</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\nDuring World War II, [[Anna Akhmatova]] witnessed the 900-day [[Siege of Leningrad]] and read her poems over the radio to encourage the city's defenders. In 1940, Akhmatova started her ''Poem without a Hero'', finishing a first draft in [[Tashkent]], but working on  \"The Poem\" for twenty years and considering it to be the major work of her life, dedicating it to \"the memory of its first audience \u2013 my friends and fellow citizens who perished in Leningrad during the siege\".<ref Name=\"Martin10\">Martin (2007) p. 10</ref> \n\nAfter the war, Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]] was stunned to see Akhmatova given a [[standing ovation]] by Russians who remembered her wartime broadcasts. Stalin gave orders to find out who organized the standing ovation and launched a campaign of [[blacklisting]] and defamation against the poetess, in which she was called, \"Half harlot, half nun.\"\n\nIn the 1974 poem ''[[Prussian Nights]]'', [[Soviet dissident]] [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]], a former [[Captain]] in the [[Red Army]] during [[World War II]], graphically describes [[Soviet war crimes]] in [[East Prussia]]. The narrator, a [[Red Army]] officer, approves of his troops' looting and rapes against German civilians as revenge for [[German war crimes]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and he hopes to take part in the atrocities himself. The poem describes the [[gang-rape]] of a [[Poles|Polish]] woman whom the [[Red Army]] soldiers had mistaken for a [[German people|German]].<ref>Davies, Norman (1982) ''God's Playground.

During the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a communist vision, joining the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and the [[French Resistance]] during World War II, and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against [[French war crimes]] in the [[Algerian War]].\n\n===Japan===\n\n[[Ryuichi Tamura]] (1923\u201398) who served in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during World War II is a major Japanese war poet. Following the war, he \"helped begin a poetry magazine, ''The Waste Land''\" and those poets who contributed to it were \u201cthe Waste Land Poets.\u201d  The work of these writers was especially influenced by T. S. Eliot, [[Stephen Spender]], [[Cecil Day-Lewis|C. Day-Lewis]] and [[W. H. Auden]]. Tamura's first book of poems, ''Four Thousand Days and Nights'' was published in 1956.<ref>Voices of Education, \"WWII Japanese Poets [http://voiceseducation.org/category/tag/wwii-japanese-poet]</ref>\n\n[[Sadako Kurihara]] was living in [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945 and it was then \"that her life was transformed from being a shopkeeper to becoming one of Japan\u2019s most controversial poets. Her first major collection of poems, ''Black Eggs'', published in 1946\", but it was heavily censored by the American Occupation Forces Censor, because of how she dealt with the horrors following the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan. Kurihara has also \"taken a stand on Japan\u2019s aggressive rule\" during the [[Japanese occupation of China|occupation of China]], \"the mistreatment of [[Koreans in Japan]], and the need for a world-wide ban on nuclear weapons\".<ref>Voices of Education, \"WWII Japanese Poets</ref>\n\n[[File:Tadamichi Kuribayashi.jpg|thumb|General Tadamichi Kuribayashi.]]\nGeneral [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]], the overall commander of the Japanese forces during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], was a poet and former diplomat who had been assigned to [[Washington, D.C.]] during the [[Interwar Period]]. Having seen America's military and industrial power first hand, Kuribayashi opposed Prime Minister [[Hideki Tojo]]'s decision to attack Pearl Harbor, saying, \"The United States is the last country in the world Japan should fight.\" It was ultimately decided to assign Kuribayashi to the [[suicide mission]] of defending [[Iwo Jima]] in order to silence his criticisms of the war.\n\nOn 17 March 1945, the General sent his farewell message to Imperial Headquarters accompanied by three traditional [[death poem]]s in ''[[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' form. Both were, according to historian Kumiko Kakehashi, \"a subtle protest against the military command that so casually sent men out to die.\"<ref>Kumiko Kakehashi, ''So Sad to Fall in Battle: An Account of War'', page ''xxv''.</ref> \n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n:Unable to complete this heavy task for our country\nArrows and bullets all spent, so sad we fall.\n\n:But unless I smite the enemy,\nMy body cannot rot in the field.\nYea, I shall be born again seven times\nAnd grasp the sword in my hand.\n\n:When ugly weeds cover this island,\nMy sole thought shall be the Imperial Land.<ref>Kumiko Kakehashi, ''So Sad to Fall in Battle: An Account of War'', page ''xxiii''.</ref>\n</poem>\n\nThe poems and the message were heavily rewritten by Japanese military censors before being published and all [[anti-war]] sentiments were removed. Instead of describing the General and his soldiers as feeling \"sad\" to fall in battle, Japanese censors rewrote the poem to say that they died in [[Banzai charge]]s, which the General had forbidden on Iwo Jima as an unnecessary waste of his men's lives. The uncensored text of both the message and the poems were only published after the [[Surrender of Japan]].\n\n===Serbia===\nAmongst Serbian poets during World War II, the most notable is [[Desanka Maksimovi\u0107]]. She is well-known for \"''Krvava bajka''\" or \"Bloody Fairy Story\". The poem is about a group of schoolchildren who fell victim to the Nazis in 1941 in [[Kragujevac massacre]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/projectgoethe/Home/desanka-maksimovic/krvava-bajka|title=Krvava bajka - Serbo-Croatian Poetry Translation|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\n==Later wars==\n\n===American poets===\nThe [[Korean War]] produced the American war poets [[Rolando Hinojosa]] and [[William Wantling]].\n<ref>W.

The book won the 1972 [[Yale Younger Poets Award]]. Other prominent Vietnam War poets include [[W. D.

In a clear cut case of \"criticism from the Right\", Wilbur compares U.S. President [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] with [[Thomas Jefferson]] and finds the former to be greatly wanting. Commenting that Jefferson \"would have wept to see small nations dread/ The imposition of our cattle brand,\" and that in Jefferson's term, \"no army's blood was shed\", Wilbur urges President Johnson to seriously consider how history will judge him and his Administration.\n\nMost recently, the Iraq War has produced war poets including [[Brian Turner (American poet)|Brian Turner]] whose d\u00e9but collection, ''Here, Bullet'', is based on his experience as an infantry team leader with the 3rd [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team]] from November 2003 until November 2004 in [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

A number of them died on the battlefield, most famously [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[Wilfred Owen]], and [[Charles Sorley]]. Others including [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Richard Perceval Graves, \u2018Graves, Robert von Ranke (1895\u20131985)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> [[Ivor Gurney]] and Siegfried Sassoon survived but were scarred by their experiences, and this was reflected in their poetry. Robert H. Ross describes the British \"war poets\" as [[Georgian Poetry|Georgian poets]].<ref>''The Georgian Revolt'', p. 166.</ref> Many poems by British war poets were published in newspapers and then collected in anthologies. Several of these early anthologies were published during the war and were very popular, though the tone of the poetry changed as the war progressed. One of the wartime anthologies, ''[[The Muse in Arms]]'', was published in 1917, and several were published in the years following the war.\n\n[[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]]' [[epic poem]] of World War I ''[[In Parenthesis]]'' was first published in England in 1937, and is based on Jones's own experience as an infantryman in the War. ''In Parenthesis'' narrates the experiences of English Private John Ball in a mixed English-Welsh regiment starting with their leaving England and ending seven months later with the assault on [[Mametz Wood]] during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The work employs a mixture of lyrical verse and prose, is highly allusive, and ranges in tone from formal to [[Cockney]] colloquial and military slang. The poem won the [[Hawthornden Prize]] and the admiration of writers such as [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>Dilworth, Thomas. ''Reading David Jones''.

He later recalled that when the war began, his first feelings of patriotism were towards Germany. After being briefly interned at [[Trier]] and ordered to leave the country, Sorley returned to [[Great Britain]] and enlisted in the [[Suffolk Regiment]] as a [[Lieutenant]]. He was killed by a German [[sniper]] during the [[Battle of Loos]] in 1915 and his poems and letters were published posthumously. \n\n[[Robert Graves]] described Charles Sorley in ''[[Goodbye to All That]]'' as \"one of the three poets of importance killed during the war\". (The other two being [[Isaac Rosenberg]] and [[Wilfred Owen]].) Sorley believed that Germans and British were equally blind to each other's humanity and his [[anti-war]] poetry stands in direct contrast to the jingoistic nationalism of [[Rupert Brooke]].\n\nIn 1969, [[Gairm]] posthumously published the first book of poems by [[D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh Chor\u00f9na]], a combat veteran of the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|King's Own Cameron Highlanders]] during World War I and war poet in the [[Scottish Gaelic language]]. Unlike [[Wilfred Owen]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]], D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh believed himself to be fighting a [[just war]] against a terrible enemy. His anger over the futility of the war only boiled over after he returned to his home in [[North Uist]], in the [[Outer Hebrides]], and found that none of the promises that had been made to soldiers from the Scottish [[Highlands and Islands]] were going to be kept. The rents were still high, the population was still impoverished, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] were still prosecuted as [[poaching]], and the [[omnipotence]] of the island's [[Anglo-Scottish]] landlord was exactly as it had been before the war began.\n\n[[File:Thiepval Memorial to the missing.jpg|thumb|right|Thiepval Memorial, France.]]\nD\u00f2mhnall Ruadh's poetry book proved very popular and began being used to teach the Gaelic language in the schools of the Scottish Highlands and Islands. An expanded and [[bilingual]] edition was published by the Historical Society of North Uist in 1995. In 2016, Scottish folk singer and North Uist native [[Julie Fowlis]] performed D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh's war songs in Gaelic at the [[Thiepval Memorial]] on the hundredth anniversary of the [[Battle of the Somme]].\n\n===Wales===\nAt the outbreak of World War I, [[militarism]] was seen in [[Wales]] as a very English trait. Throughout the war, voluntary enlistments remained very low and [[conscription]] was ultimately enacted to forcibly bring the [[Welsh people]] into the [[British armed forces]]. \n\n[[File:Hedd Wyn statue.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Hedd Wyn]] in his home village of [[Trawsfynydd]].]]\nThe most famous [[Welsh language]] war poet remains Private [[Ellis Humphrey Evans]] of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], who is best known under his [[bardic name]] of [[Hedd Wyn]]. Hedd Wyn was killed by [[shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] from a German shell during his battalion's assault on [[Pilckem Ridge]] during the first day of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917. Just a few weeks later, he was posthumously [[Chairing of the Bard|awarded the Chair]] at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]]. The [[Bardic Chair]] was delivered to the farmhouse of the Bard's parents draped in a black sheet.\n\n[[File:Cynan 1956 Aberdar.jpg|thumb|The Archdruid Cynan (middle) at the National Eisteddfod at Aberdare, 1956.]]\nAnother great [[Welsh language]] war poet was Rev. [[Albert Evans-Jones]], who served on the [[Macedonian Front|Salonica Front]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as a [[RAMC]] ambulance man and later as a [[military chaplain]]. After the war, he became a minister for the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]] and wrote many poems that shocked the Welsh population with their graphic descriptions of the horrors of the trenches and their savage attacks on wartime [[ultra-nationalism]]. Rev. Evans-Jones, whom [[Alan Llwyd]] considers the greatest Welsh poet of the Great War, is best known under the [[bardic name]] of [[Cynan]]. \n\nWelsh poet Alan Llwyd's English translations of many poems by both poets appear in the volume ''Out of the Fire of Hell; Welsh Experience of the Great War 1914-1918 in Prose and Verse''.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:LostBattalionMonument.JPG|thumb|right|Monument to the [[Lost Battalion (World War I)|Lost Battalion]], Argonne Forest, France.]]\nThe [[United States]] only entered the Great War in May 1917. By that time, the mass mechanized slaughter at [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], which still haunt the other combatant nations, had already taken place. \n\nBy the time large numbers of soldiers from the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] arrived in France, they faced an [[Imperial German Army]] that was starving, exhausted, and which had already been bled white by three years of war. Furthermore, the [[German people]] were being systematically starved by a [[Royal Navy]] blockade and were increasingly on the brink of [[German Revolution of 1918|Revolution]]. Although American [[Doughboys]] helped stem the [[1918 Spring Offensive]], won the [[Meuse-Argonne Campaign]], and saved the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] from having to contract a negotiated peace with the [[Central Powers]], America's losses were far fewer than those of other nations. For this reason, [[World War I]] is a forgotten war in America today. \n\nAlthough [[World War I]] in [[American literature]] is widely believed to begin and end with [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[war novel]] ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', there were also American war poets. \n\n[[File:Alan seeger foreign legion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alan Seeger]] in his [[French Foreign Legion]] uniform]]\n[[Alan Seeger]], the uncle of [[Marxist]] folk singer [[Pete Seeger]], enlisted in the [[French Foreign Legion]] while America was still neutral and became the first great American poet of the First World War.

Decades after his passing, Seeger's poem ''I Have a Rendezvous with Death'' was a great favorite of [[U.S. President]] [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]]. Seeger is sometimes called, \"The American [[Rupert Brooke]].\"\n\n[[File:Joyce Kilmer.jpg|thumb|Sgt. Joyce Kilmer, as a member of the Fighting 69th Infantry Regiment, United States Army, c. 1918]]\nAmerican poet and [[Roman Catholic]] convert [[Joyce Kilmer]], who was widely considered America's answer to [[G.K. Chesterton]], served in France as a [[Sergeant]] with the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|Fighting 69th]]. Sgt. Kilmer was beginning to write war poems at the time that he was killed by a German [[sniper]] during the [[Second Battle of the Marne]] on July 30, 1918. \n\n[[File:John Allen Wyeth.jpg|thumb|right|John Allen Wyeth, late 1970s.]]\nIn 1928, American poet and World War I veteran [[John Allan Wyeth (poet)|John Allan Wyeth]] published ''This Man's Army: A War in Fifty-Odd Sonnets''. The collection, which is written in an experimental form unique in the history of the [[sonnet]], traces Wyeth's military service as a [[Lieutenant]] with the [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd U.S. Infantry Division]] from the time he received orders to embark for France, during the ocean voyage and through his journey into the firing line. Although the collection was very well reviewed, the [[1929 Stock Market Crash]] soon followed its publication and Wyeth's poetry was swiftly forgotten. When John Allan Wyeth died on May 11, 1981, his [[obituary]] made no mention of the fact that he had been a poet.\n\nAccording to poet and literary critic [[Dana Gioia]], who rescued Wyeth's poetry from oblivion during the early [[21st century]], Wyeth is the only American poet of the First World War who can be compared with English war poets [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], and [[Wilfred Owen]]. Gioia also writes that every event that Wyeth relates in his sonnets, down to the way he describes the weather, can be verified by other sources as completely accurate.\n\n===Ireland===\n[[File:Memorial Garden Cross.jpg|thumb|Great Cross above the Stone of Remembrance, with wreaths of commemoration, [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]], [[Dublin]].]]\nThe involvement of [[Irish people]] in the [[British armed forces]] during World War I remains very controversial. This was because Ireland's struggle for Independence took place during the same era and Irishmen who fought for the Crown were seen as traitors. Nevertheless, there were also Irish war poets.\n\n[[File:Thomas M. Kettle memorial in St. Stephen's Green park, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Thomas M. Kettle Memorial, [[St. Stephen's Green]], [[Dublin]], Ireland.]]\nOne of them, poet [[Tom Kettle]], a former member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and [[M.P.]] for the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], was, despite his sympathy for Occupied Belgium, very critical of the war at first. Comparing the [[Anglo-Irish]] landlord class with the big estate owners who similarly dominated the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], Kettle wrote, \"England goes to fight for [[liberty]] in [[Europe]] and for [[Junker (Prussia)|Junkerdom]] in Ireland.\"<ref> Tim Cross (1988), page 42.</ref>\n\nLater, when he was serving as a [[Lieutenant]] with the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], Kettle learned of the 17 executions that followed the crushing of the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916. In response, Kettle wrote, \"These men will go down in history as heroes and martyrs and I will go down - if I go down at all - as a bloody British officer.\"<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 41.</ref> \n\nKettle's best known poem is a sonnet, \"To My Daughter Betty, the Gift of God\", written just days before he was shot in the chest during the [[Battle of Ginchy|attack on Ginchy]], during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. His body was never found. The last lines of the [[sonnet]] say that the soldiers of all nations during the Great War, \"Died not for flag, nor King, nor Emperor/But for a dream, born in a herdsman's shed/And for the secret Scripture of the poor.\"<ref>Jim Haughey, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8AbeSLHBa8C&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The First World War in Irish Poetry''], Bucknell University Press, 2002, p. 102<!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --></ref> \n\n[[File:Frontispiece, The Complete Poems of Francis Ledwidge, 1919.jpg|thumb|left|Francis Ledwidge in uniform.]]\nWhen [[Francis Ledwidge]], who was a member of the [[Irish Volunteers]], learned of the outbreak of the war, he decided against enlisting in the [[British Army]]. After being put on trial by the [[National Volunteers]] and accused of [[cowardice]] and of being Pro-German, Ledwidge enlisted in the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. He published three volumes of poetry between 1916\u201318, while he served at the [[Landing at Suvla Bay]], on the [[Macedonian Front]] and on the Western Front. Ledwidge expressed a belief in his poems and letters that he was fighting for [[Ireland]] rather than for the [[United Kingdom]]. Ultimately, Francis Ledwidge was \"blown to bits\" by a German shell while drinking tea in a shell hole on the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge|first day]] of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917. A monument to him, topped by the [[Irish tricolour]], now stands on the site of his death.

The poem is a [[soliloquy]] given by [[Major]] [[Robert Gregory (RFC officer)|Robert Gregory]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[flying ace]], in which the narrator predicts his imminent death in an aerial [[dogfight]]. Maj. Gregory, who died when his [[Sopwith Camel]] crashed near [[Padua]], [[Italy]] on January 23, 1918, was an [[Irish nationalist]], a friend of Yeats, and the son of his patroness Lady [[Augusta Gregory]]. [[Royal Flying Corps]] records in the [[British National Archives]] state that Maj. Gregory was \"shot down in error by an Italian pilot\", a claim that has been repeated by both Yeats' and Lady Gregory's biographers. In 2017, Geoffrey O'Byrne White, a director of the [[Irish Aviation Authority]], the great-grandnephew of Lady Gregory, and a former pilot in the [[Irish Air Corps]], said he believed Major Gregory had become incapacitated at high altitude, attributing this to an [[inoculation]] that morning against [[influenza]].<ref>Ray Burke, \"Challenge to official accounts of Gregory death in WWI,\" 2 January 2018, RT\u00c9 News Now, https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2018/0101/930446-robert-gregory/</ref>\n\nIn Yeats' poem, Maj. Gregory declares that he does not hate the German and Austro-Hungarian pilots he fights against or love the [[British Empire]], which he defends. He comments that his countrymen are the poor [[Irish Catholics|Irish Catholic]] tenants of his mother's estate at [[Kiltartan]], [[County Galway]], that they will not mourn his death, and that his passing will have done nothing to improve their lives. He comments that he signed up to fight not for law, duty, the speeches of politicians, or the cheering crowds, but for, \"a lonely impulse of delight.\"\n\n[[File:Yeats1923.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William Butler Yeats]] as photographed in 1923.]]\nWishing to show restraint from publishing a political poem during the height of the Great War, Yeats withheld publication of ''An Irish Airman Forsees His Death'' until after the 1918 [[Armistice]].<ref name=Foster>Foster 2001 pp. 68\u201369</ref> \n\n\"[[The Second Coming]]\" is a poem written by Irish poet W.

He saw combat in [[East Prussia]], the [[Macedonian Front]], and with the [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France]]. He was also decorated twice with the [[Cross of St. George]]. Gumilyov's war poems were assembled in the collection ''The Quiver'' (1916).\n\nGumilyov's wife, the poetess [[Anna Akhmatova]], began writing poems during World War I that expressed the collective suffering of the [[Russian people]] as men were called up and the women in their lives bade them goodbye. For Akhmatova, writing such poems turned into her life's work and she continued writing similar poems about the suffering of the Russian people during the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Terror]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]].\n\n===France===\nAmongst French World War I poets are the following: [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Adrien Bertrand]], [[Yvan Goll]], and [[Charles P\u00e9guy]].\n\n[[File:Louis Pergaud.jpg|thumb|left|Louis Pergaud]]\nThe French [[Symbolist]] poet [[Louis Pergaud]] considered himself a [[Pacifism|Pacifist]] and, at the outbreak of war in 1914, he tried in vain to register as a [[conscientious objector]]. Instead, he was conscripted into the [[French Army]] and sent to the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nOn 7 April 1915, Pergaud's regiment attacked the [[Imperial German Army]]'s trenches near [[Fresnes-en-Wo\u00ebvre]], during which he was wounded. Pergaud fell into [[barbed wire]], where he became trapped. Several hours later, German soldiers rescued him and other wounded French soldiers and took them to a temporary [[field hospital]] behind German lines. On the morning of April 8, 1915, Pergaud and many other [[POW]]s were killed by [[friendly fire]], when a French artillery barrage destroyed the hospital.\n\nThe [[Breton language]] poet and activist [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], a former Catholic seminarian who was best known by his [[Bardic name]] of ''Bleimor'', enlisted in the [[French Army]] on the outbreak of war in 1914. Like many others, Kalloc'h believed that France's war against Germany was a defense of civilization and [[Christianity]] and that it would lead to the resurrection of the Catholic Faith and the [[Breton language]] and [[Breton culture|culture]]. Ultimately, Kalloc'h, who wielded a sailor's axe in hand to hand combat in the trenches, was killed when a German shell landed near his dugout on April 10, 1917. His last poetry collection, ''Ar en Deulin'', was published posthumously.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Berlin, Mitte, Unter den Linden 4, Neue Wache.jpg|thumb|The [[Neo-Classical]] portal of the [[Neue Wache]] on [[Unter den Linden]] in [[Berlin]], which has been Germany's primary war memorial since 1931.]]\nGerman World War I poets include: [[Rudolf G.

He served in combat for four years, experiencing the battles of [[Langemarck]], [[Battle of St. Mihiel|St. Mihiel]], [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]], D\u00fcnaberg, and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. In 1916, he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for swimming across the flooded [[Yser River]]. Engelke was wounded in 1917 and, during his recovery, he became engaged to a war widow, but was forced to return to combat in May 1918. His friends attempted to have him transferred away from the firing line, much to Engelke's outrage, as he felt a deep loyalty to his brothers in arms. He was fatally injured in a successful British assault on October 11, 1918 and died the following day at a British [[field hospital]]. He had previously written, \"The greatest task which faces us after the war will be to forgive our enemy, who has, after all, been our neighbour on Earth since Creation.\"<ref> Tim Cross(1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 81.</ref> \n\nGerrit Engelke is best known for his [[anti-war]] poem ''An die Soldaten Des Grossen Krieges'' (\"To the Soldiers of the Great War\"), a poem in [[rhyme]]d [[dactylic hexameter]] modeled after the Neo-Classical odes of [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]. In the ode, Engelke urges the soldiers of all the combatant nations to join hands together in universal brotherhood. An English translation exists by Patrick Bridgwater.\n\n[[File:Walter Flex.jpg|thumb|left|Walter Flex]]\n[[Walter Flex]], who is best known as the author of the war poem ''[[Wild Geese (song)|Wildg\u00e4nse rauschen durch die Nacht]]'', was a native of [[Eisenach]] and attended the [[University of Erlangen]] before the outbreak of war. After service on both the Eastern and Western Fronts, Flex was [[killed in action]] at [[Saaremaa]], [[Estonia]] during [[Operation Albion]] on October 17, 1917. His poems, which were very patriotic in nature, remained very popular until the 1970s.\n\n[[File:Lajos Tihanyi Yvan Goll 1927.jpg|thumb|left|Yvan Goll in 1927.]]\n[[Yvan Goll]], a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] poet from the disputed territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], wrote bilingually in both German and French. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Goll fled to [[Switzerland]] to evade [[conscription]] into the [[Imperial German Army]]. While there, he wrote many [[anti-war]] poems, in which he sought to promote better understanding between Germany and France. His most famous poem is ''[[Requiem f\u00fcr die Todte in Europa]]'' (''[[Requiem for the Dead of Europe]]'').\n\n[[File:Stefan George 1910 Foto Jakob Hilsdorf.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan George in 1910.]]\n[[Stefan George]], a German poet who had done his literary [[apprenticeship]] with the French [[Symbolist]] poets in [[Paris]], still had many friends in [[France]] and viewed the Great War as disastrous. In his 1916 [[anti-war]] poem ''Der Krieg'' (\"The War\"), George attacked the horrors that soldiers of all nations were facing in the trenches. In the poem, George famously declared, \"The ancient god of battles is no more.\"\n\n[[File:RJSorge1.jpg|thumb|Reinhard Johannes Sorge on [[Furlough]] in [[Berlin]], 1915]]\n[[Reinhard Sorge]], the [[Kleist Prize]] winning author of the [[Expressionist]] play ''Der Bettler'', saw the coming of the war as an idealistic recent convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He wrote many poems, many of them in experimental forms, about both his Catholic Faith and what he was witnessing as a soldier with the [[Imperial German Army]] in France. Shortly before being [[mortally wounded]] by a grenade during the [[Battle of the Somme]], Sorge wrote to his wife expressing a belief that what he called, \"the Anglo-French Offensive\" was going to succeed in overrunning German defenses. Sorge died in a [[field hospital]] at [[Ablaincourt-Pressoir|Ablaincourt]] on July 20, 1916. Sorge's wife only learned of his death when a letter, in which she informed her husband that he had gotten her [[pregnant]] during his last [[furlough]], was returned to her as undeliverable.\n[[Image:Het treurende ouderpaar - K\u00e4the Kolwitz.JPG|thumb|left|The sculptures of ''The Grieving Parents'' by [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]], which date from the [[1930s]], stand vigil over the [[Vladslo German war cemetery]] in [[Belgium]].]]\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n[[File:BASA-1221K-1-48-11.jpg|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian soldiers resting in a trench]]\nThere were also war poets from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\n[[Franz Janowitz]], a Jewish poet from the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], had enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as a one year volunteer in 1913. He was wounded by machine gun fire during an assault on Monte Rombon and died of his wounds on November 4, 1917. According to Jeremy Adler, \"Franz Janowitz conflicts with the received idea of the best German war poets. Neither [[wikt:realistic|realistic]], nor ironic, nor properly [[expressionist]]ic, while he excoriated the battlefield that the whole world had become, he still preserved a Faith in nobility, innocence, and song. Forced into maturity by the war, his poetic voice never lost a certain childlike note - indeed, in some of his best poems, naivety and wisdom coexist to an almost paradoxical degree. Such poetry was fired by a vision of a transcendental realm that lay beyond conflict, but never sought to exclude death. His 25 years, the last four of which were spent in the Army, scarcely left him time to develop a wholly independent voice, but his work displays an increasing mastery of form and deepening of vision. His small ''oeuvre'' consists of ''Novellen'', essays, aphorisms, and a handful of the best German poems connected with the Great War.\"<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 109.</ref>\n\n[[File:Georg Trakl.jpg|thumb|left|Georg Trakl.]]\n[[Georg Trakl]], an [[Expressionist]] poet from [[Salzburg]], enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as a [[medical officer]] in 1914.

After the battle, Trakl was left in command of a [[field hospital]] filled with wounded soldiers and [[psychosis|mentally collapsed]] from the ensuing strain.\n\nOne evening following the battle Trakl ran outside and attempted to shoot himself in order to escape from the screams of the wounded and the dying. He was prevented from doing so and was sent to a [[mental hospital]]. On the night of November 3-4, 1914, Georg Trakl died in a military hospital in [[Cracow]] from an overdose of [[cocaine]]. Trakl's [[batman (military)|batman]], however, who was the last person to whom the poet spoke, believed that the overdose was an accident, rather than [[suicide]].<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 118.</ref>  Georg Trakl is best known for the poem ''[[Grodek]]''.\n\n[[G\u00e9za Gy\u00f3ni]], a Hungarian poet, enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in 1914. The poems he wrote as a soldier began with optimism, but grew increasingly pessimistic as the war went on. Gy\u00f3ni was ultimately captured by the [[Imperial Russian Army]] after the [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl]] in 1915. After being held in atrocious conditions as a [[Prisoner of War]], he died in a POW camp at [[Krasnoyarsk]], in [[Siberia]] on June 25, 1917.

Campbell was living in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] with his family when hostilities started. As a recent convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], Campbell was horrified to witness the systematic [[religious persecution]] and [[Red Terror (Spain)|mass murder of Catholics]] by the Republican forces. A particularly chilling moment for Campbell was when he came across the bodies of Toledo's Carmelite monks, whom he had befriended, after Republican forces had subjected them to [[summary execution|execution without trial]]. The monks' executioner's had then written in blood above their bodies, \"Thus strikes the [[CHEKA]].\" According to Campbell's biographer, [[Joseph Pearce]], and his daughters Anna and Tess, Campbell's subsequently pro-Nationalist stance has caused him to be unfairly labeled as a [[Fascist]] and left out of poetry anthologies and college courses.\n\nThe best [[Spanish language]] poets of the Civil War are [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] and the Machado brothers.

Meanwhile, his brother, [[Manuel Machado y Ruiz|Manuel Machado]], dedicated a poem to the [[saber]] of the Nationalist Generalissimo [[Francisco Franco]].\n\n[[Chilean people|Chilean]] poet [[Pablo Neruda]] became intensely politicised for the first time during the Spanish Civil War. As a result of his experiences in Spain, Neruda became an ardent [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist]] and remained one for the rest of his life.

MacLean's time in the firing line ended when he was severely wounded at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. \n\nMacLean's most famous Gaelic war poem is ''Ruweisat Ridge'', which relates his thoughts on seeing a dead German soldier in North Africa. In the poem, MacLean ponders what role the dead man may have played in Nazi atrocities against both [[German Jews]] and members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. MacLean concludes, however, by saying that whatever the German soldier may or may not have done, he showed no pleasure in his death upon Ruweisat Ridge.\n\n===United States===\nThe horror of World War I was so deeply ingrained in the [[American people]] that [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s efforts to bring the United States into the war against [[Nazi Germany]] were very unpopular. The [[America First Committee]], of which [[Charles Lindbergh]] was the spokesman, and the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] were both organizing protests against Roosevelt's foreign policies. Opposition to entering the war vanished, however, when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. \n\nAlthough the [[Second World War]] is not usually thought of as a poet's war, there were American war poets.\n\nFuture [[U.S. Poet Laureate]] [[Richard Wilbur]] served as a [[Sergeant]] with the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th U.S. Infantry Division]] during the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], the Allied Landings in Southern France and in the final invasion of [[Nazi Germany]]. During his war service and the decades that followed, Richard Wilbur wrote many war poems. \n\nOne of Wilbur's best known war poems is ''Tywater'', about the combat death of Corporal Lloyd Tywater, a former rodeo cowboy with a talent for rope tricks, knife throwing, and shooting swallows out of the sky with a pistol. \n\nAnother famous war poem by Richard Wilbur is ''First Snow in Alsace'', which lyrically describes the horrors of a recent battlefield in [[Occupied France]] being covered up by the beautiful sight of new fallen snow.\n\nIn an interview for the documentary ''[[The Muse of Fire]]'', Wilbur commented that there was a great difference between the war poets of [[World War I]] and those of [[World War II]]. Wilbur explained that, unlike [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[Wilfred Owen]], [[World War II]] poets believed themselves to be fighting a [[just war]] and that [[Nazi Germany]], [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], and [[Imperial Japan]] were terrible enemies which needed to be confronted and destroyed. He did add that many World War II poets, including himself, felt sympathy for the plight of [[conscientious objector]]s.\n\nAmerican poet [[Dunstan Thompson]] began publishing his poems while serving as a soldier in the European Theater during World War II. Thompson's poems depict military service through the eyes of a [[homosexual]], who is engaged in casual encounters with soldiers and sailors in Blitzed London. \n\n[[Karl Shapiro]], a stylish writer with a commendable regard for his craft,<ref>Scannell, Vernon ''Not Without Glory'' Woburn Press , London 1976 {{ISBN|0713000945}}</ref>  wrote poetry in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] while he served there during World War II. His collection ''V-Letter and Other Poems'', written while Shapiro was stationed in [[New Guinea]], was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in [[1945 in literature|1945]], while Shapiro was still in the military. Shapiro was American Poet Laureate in 1946 and 1947. (At the time this title was Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress which was changed by Congress in 1985 to [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]].). \n\nAlso, while serving in the U.S. Army, the American poet [[Randall Jarrell]] published his second book of poems, ''Little Friend, Little Friend'' (1945) based on his wartime experiences. The book includes one of Jarrell's best known war poems, \"[[The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner]].\" In his follow-up book, ''Losses'' (1948), he also focused on the war. The poet [[Robert Lowell]] stated publicly that he thought Jarrell had written \"the best poetry in English about the Second World War.\"<ref>Gilroy, Harry. \"Poets Honor Memory of Jarrell at Yale.\" ''The New York Times'' 1 March 1966.</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\nDuring World War II, [[Anna Akhmatova]] witnessed the 900-day [[Siege of Leningrad]] and read her poems over the radio to encourage the city's defenders. In 1940, Akhmatova started her ''Poem without a Hero'', finishing a first draft in [[Tashkent]], but working on  \"The Poem\" for twenty years and considering it to be the major work of her life, dedicating it to \"the memory of its first audience \u2013 my friends and fellow citizens who perished in Leningrad during the siege\".<ref Name=\"Martin10\">Martin (2007) p. 10</ref> \n\nAfter the war, Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]] was stunned to see Akhmatova given a [[standing ovation]] by Russians who remembered her wartime broadcasts. Stalin gave orders to find out who organized the standing ovation and launched a campaign of [[blacklisting]] and defamation against the poetess, in which she was called, \"Half harlot, half nun.\"\n\nIn the 1974 poem ''[[Prussian Nights]]'', [[Soviet dissident]] [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]], a former [[Captain]] in the [[Red Army]] during [[World War II]], graphically describes [[Soviet war crimes]] in [[East Prussia]]. The narrator, a [[Red Army]] officer, approves of his troops' looting and rapes against German civilians as revenge for [[German war crimes]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and he hopes to take part in the atrocities himself. The poem describes the [[gang-rape]] of a [[Poles|Polish]] woman whom the [[Red Army]] soldiers had mistaken for a [[German people|German]].<ref>Davies, Norman (1982) ''God's Playground.

During the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a communist vision, joining the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and the [[French Resistance]] during World War II, and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against [[French war crimes]] in the [[Algerian War]].\n\n===Japan===\n\n[[Ryuichi Tamura]] (1923\u201398) who served in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during World War II is a major Japanese war poet. Following the war, he \"helped begin a poetry magazine, ''The Waste Land''\" and those poets who contributed to it were \u201cthe Waste Land Poets.\u201d  The work of these writers was especially influenced by T. S. Eliot, [[Stephen Spender]], [[Cecil Day-Lewis|C. Day-Lewis]] and [[W. H. Auden]].

Having seen America's military and industrial power first hand, Kuribayashi opposed Prime Minister [[Hideki Tojo]]'s decision to attack Pearl Harbor, saying, \"The United States is the last country in the world Japan should fight.\" It was ultimately decided to assign Kuribayashi to the [[suicide mission]] of defending [[Iwo Jima]] in order to silence his criticisms of the war.\n\nOn 17 March 1945, the General sent his farewell message to Imperial Headquarters accompanied by three traditional [[death poem]]s in ''[[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' form. Both were, according to historian Kumiko Kakehashi, \"a subtle protest against the military command that so casually sent men out to die.\"<ref>Kumiko Kakehashi, ''So Sad to Fall in Battle: An Account of War'', page ''xxv''.</ref> \n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n:Unable to complete this heavy task for our country\nArrows and bullets all spent, so sad we fall.\n\n:But unless I smite the enemy,\nMy body cannot rot in the field.\nYea, I shall be born again seven times\nAnd grasp the sword in my hand.\n\n:When ugly weeds cover this island,\nMy sole thought shall be the Imperial Land.<ref>Kumiko Kakehashi, ''So Sad to Fall in Battle: An Account of War'', page ''xxiii''.</ref>\n</poem>\n\nThe poems and the message were heavily rewritten by Japanese military censors before being published and all [[anti-war]] sentiments were removed. Instead of describing the General and his soldiers as feeling \"sad\" to fall in battle, Japanese censors rewrote the poem to say that they died in [[Banzai charge]]s, which the General had forbidden on Iwo Jima as an unnecessary waste of his men's lives. The uncensored text of both the message and the poems were only published after the [[Surrender of Japan]].\n\n===Serbia===\nAmongst Serbian poets during World War II, the most notable is [[Desanka Maksimovi\u0107]].

In a clear cut case of \"criticism from the Right\", Wilbur compares U.S. President [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] with [[Thomas Jefferson]] and finds the former to be greatly wanting. Commenting that Jefferson \"would have wept to see small nations dread/ The imposition of our cattle brand,\" and that in Jefferson's term, \"no army's blood was shed\", Wilbur urges President Johnson to seriously consider how history will judge him and his Administration.\n\nMost recently, the Iraq War has produced war poets including [[Brian Turner (American poet)|Brian Turner]] whose d\u00e9but collection, ''Here, Bullet'', is based on his experience as an infantry team leader with the 3rd [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team]] from November 2003 until November 2004 in [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. The book won numerous awards including the 2005 [[Beatrice Hawley Award]], the 2006 Maine Literary Award in Poetry, and the 2006 Northern California Book Award in Poetry.<ref>Lorraine Ash, [http://www.strykernews.com/archives/2006/09/17/a_poet_goes_to_war.html A Poet Goes to War], September 17, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.alicejamesbooks.org/pages/book_page.php?bookID=43 Book Publisher's Site Info on Book]</ref> The book also was an Editor's Choice in ''The New York Times'' and received significant attention from the press including reviews and notices on NPR and in ''The New Yorker'', ''The Global and Mail'', and the ''Library Journal''.

The population was 1,009 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S.Decennial Census]].\n\n==History==\nCape Charles, located close to the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], on [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Virginia's Eastern Shore]], was founded in 1884 as a planned community by railroad and ferry interests. In 1883, [[William Lawrence Scott]] became president of the [[New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad|New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad Company]] (NYP&N), and purchased three plantations comprising approximately 2,509 acres from the heirs of former [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Littleton Waller Tazewell]]. Of this land, 40 acres were ceded to the NYP&N, and 136 acres went to create the Town of Cape Charles (technically known as the \"Municipal Corporation of Cape Charles\"). Some of this land, named [[Cape Charles (headland)|Cape Charles]] for the geographical cape found on the Point and headland to the south, Scott sold to the Railroad Company to serve as the southern terminus of the line on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] from the Northeast states. In that same year, construction of the railroad began. In Cape Charles, the Railroad Company built a harbor port to handle steamships and freighters from Cape Charles to Norfolk.\n\nThe original Town was surveyed, platted, and laid out with approximately 136 acres divided into 644 equal lots. Seven wider avenues which run from east to west were named for Virginia statesmen and political leaders; the streets which run north and south were named for fruits. The original layout of the Town is still very visible today.<ref name=northampton>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.northampton.va.us/departments/comp_plan/Appendix%2002%20CapeCharlesCompPlan.pdf|title=Cape Charles, Virginia Comprehensive Plan|year=2002|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHistorian William G. Thomas writes, \"At a cost of nearly $300,000, the [[New York, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk Railroad]] (N.Y.P. & N. R.R.) was dredging a new harbor out of a large fresh-water lagoon between King's and Old Plantation creeks in lower Northampton County, and Scott planned to develop a new town around it called Cape Charles City. The appellation \"City\" for any place on the Eastern Shore was romantic, a vision of the future that the railroad might make possible....In 1890,  the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] dredged the harbor basin, its entrance, and a channel through Cherrystone Inlet and built stone jetties protecting the harbor outlet. By 1912 the Engineer Corps estimated that Cape Charles harbor handled 2,500,000 tons of freight a year.\"\n[[File:IndustryCapeCharles.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Industrial landscape in Cape Charles]]\n\nCape Charles was, for many years, the terminal for the [[Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry]], providing passenger and car ferry service across the mouth of the Bay to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia Beach]] and [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] on the SouthSide / Tidewater and across [[Hampton Roads]] harbor to [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] - [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] on the northern [[Virginia Peninsula]]. The last ferry left Cape Charles in 1963. Cape Charles served as a terminal for railway freight barges that carried rail cars from the former [[Eastern Shore Railroad]] which later became [[Bay Coast Railroad]] across the mouth of the Bay to Norfolk. The Bay Coast Railroad ceased operations in 2018. There is also a cement factory nearby.\n\nThe town hosted the Northampton Red Sox in the old [[Eastern Shore Baseball League]].\n\nThe [[Cape Charles Historic District]] and [[Stratton Manor]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 1040\n|1910= 1948\n|1920= 2517\n|1930= 2527\n|1940= 2299\n|1950= 2427\n|1960= 2041\n|1970= 1689\n|1980= 1512\n|1990= 1398\n|2000= 1134\n|2010= 1009\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1003\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\"/> of 2000, there were 1,134 people, 536 households, and 278 families residing in the town.

Virginia]], United States. The population was 1,009 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S.Decennial Census]].\n\n==History==\nCape Charles, located close to the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], on [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Virginia's Eastern Shore]], was founded in 1884 as a planned community by railroad and ferry interests. In 1883, [[William Lawrence Scott]] became president of the [[New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad|New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad Company]] (NYP&N), and purchased three plantations comprising approximately 2,509 acres from the heirs of former [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Littleton Waller Tazewell]]. Of this land, 40 acres were ceded to the NYP&N, and 136 acres went to create the Town of Cape Charles (technically known as the \"Municipal Corporation of Cape Charles\"). Some of this land, named [[Cape Charles (headland)|Cape Charles]] for the geographical cape found on the Point and headland to the south, Scott sold to the Railroad Company to serve as the southern terminus of the line on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] from the Northeast states. In that same year, construction of the railroad began. In Cape Charles, the Railroad Company built a harbor port to handle steamships and freighters from Cape Charles to Norfolk.\n\nThe original Town was surveyed, platted, and laid out with approximately 136 acres divided into 644 equal lots. Seven wider avenues which run from east to west were named for Virginia statesmen and political leaders; the streets which run north and south were named for fruits. The original layout of the Town is still very visible today.<ref name=northampton>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.northampton.va.us/departments/comp_plan/Appendix%2002%20CapeCharlesCompPlan.pdf|title=Cape Charles, Virginia Comprehensive Plan|year=2002|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHistorian William G. Thomas writes, \"At a cost of nearly $300,000, the [[New York, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk Railroad]] (N.Y.P. & N. R.R.) was dredging a new harbor out of a large fresh-water lagoon between King's and Old Plantation creeks in lower Northampton County, and Scott planned to develop a new town around it called Cape Charles City. The appellation \"City\" for any place on the Eastern Shore was romantic, a vision of the future that the railroad might make possible....In 1890,  the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] dredged the harbor basin, its entrance, and a channel through Cherrystone Inlet and built stone jetties protecting the harbor outlet. By 1912 the Engineer Corps estimated that Cape Charles harbor handled 2,500,000 tons of freight a year.\"\n[[File:IndustryCapeCharles.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Industrial landscape in Cape Charles]]\n\nCape Charles was, for many years, the terminal for the [[Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry]], providing passenger and car ferry service across the mouth of the Bay to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia Beach]] and [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] on the SouthSide / Tidewater and across [[Hampton Roads]] harbor to [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] - [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] on the northern [[Virginia Peninsula]]. The last ferry left Cape Charles in 1963. Cape Charles served as a terminal for railway freight barges that carried rail cars from the former [[Eastern Shore Railroad]] which later became [[Bay Coast Railroad]] across the mouth of the Bay to Norfolk. The Bay Coast Railroad ceased operations in 2018. There is also a cement factory nearby.\n\nThe town hosted the Northampton Red Sox in the old [[Eastern Shore Baseball League]].\n\nThe [[Cape Charles Historic District]] and [[Stratton Manor]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 1040\n|1910= 1948\n|1920= 2517\n|1930= 2527\n|1940= 2299\n|1950= 2427\n|1960= 2041\n|1970= 1689\n|1980= 1512\n|1990= 1398\n|2000= 1134\n|2010= 1009\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1003\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\"/> of 2000, there were 1,134 people, 536 households, and 278 families residing in the town.

{"title_page": "Legal status of Germany", "text_new": "{{Lead too short|date=December 2016}}\nThe '''legal status of Germany''' concerns the question of the extinction, or otherwise continuation, of the [[Germany|German]] [[nation state]] (i.e., the [[German Reich]] created in the 1871 [[Unification of Germany|unification]]) following the rise and downfall of [[Nazi Germany]], and constitutional hiatus of the military [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation]] of Germany by the four [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] powers from 1945 to 1949. It became current once again when the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) [[German reunification|joined]] the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (West Germany) in 1990.\n\n==Overview==\nAfter [[World War II]], determination of legal status was relevant, for instance, to resolve the issue of whether the post-1949 Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) would be the [[succession of states|successor state]] of the pre-1945 German Reich\u2014with all at the time uncodified implications of state succession, such as the continuation of [[treaty|treaties]]\u2014or if, according to [[international law]], it would be identical with the German Reich. Further, determination of authority, for instance to assert or deny territorial claims, especially with respect to the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]], was dependent upon this determination of legal status. The 1945 [[Potsdam Agreement]] had specified that a full peace treaty concluding World War II, including the exact delimitation of Germany's postwar boundaries, required to be \"accepted by the Government of Germany when a government adequate for the purpose is established.\" The Federal Republic always maintained that no such government could be said to have been established until the peoples of East and West Germany had been reunited within a free democratic state; but a range of opinions continued within West Germany over whether a unified state consisting of the populations of West Germany, East Germany and Berlin alone could be said to represent the whole German people for this purpose. The key question being whether a Germany that remained bounded to the east by the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] could act as a 'united Germany' in signing a peace treaty, without qualification.<ref>{{citation|first=Jan |last=Bacz|title='The legal basis of Poland's relationship with United Germany' in 'Poland-Germany 1945-2007; from Confrontation to Cooperation and Partnership in Europe' Witold M Grolski ed. |date=2007 |publisher=Polish Institute for International Affairs|pages= 129}}</ref>\n\nA related question arose from the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Grundgesetz''). As adopted by West Germany in 1949 as an interim constitution, the preamble looked forward explicitly to a future free and united German state; \"The entire German people is called upon to accomplish, by free self-determination, the unity and freedom of Germany.\" The Basic Law potentially provided two routes for the establishment of a reborn and unified German state; either under Article 23 whereby 'other parts of Germany' over and above the named [[States of Germany|States of the Federal Republic]] (''Bundesland'') could subsequently apply for admission; or under Article 146 where [[constituent assembly|constituent power]] (''pouvoir constituant'') could be exercised by elected representatives of the entirety of the [[Germans|German people]] in creating a new permanent constitution that would replace the Basic Law. Adoption of a constitution under Article 146 would have implied that the legal validity of a unified German State would rest on \"a free decision by the German people\" as a whole.<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 12}}</ref>\n\nNo effective national government existed in Germany following the surrender of the German High Command in May 1945; all national military and civil authority and powers were therefore exercised by the four [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]. The Allies then maintained that as the former German Reich no longer existed in fact; so, as the 'highest authority' for Germany, they were entitled to assume all sovereign powers without limitation of scope or duration and could legitimately impose whatever measures on the German people within German national territory as any government could legally do on its own people\u2014including validly ceding parts of that territory and people to another country. They argued furthermore that international conventions constraining occupying powers in wartime from enforcing fundamental changes of governmental system, economic system or social institutions within the territory under their control\u2014the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Regulations of Land Warfare]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]]\u2014did not apply; and could not apply, as the termination of [[Nazi Germany]] and the total [[Denazification]] of German institutions and legal structures had been agreed by the Allied Powers as absolute moral imperatives.<ref>Breven C. Parsons, (2009), [http://www.jag.navy.mil/documents/navylawreview/NLRVolume57.pdf Moving the law of occupation into the twenty-first century], ''Naval Law Review'', published by U.S. Naval Justice School, the pp. 21, 28-30 (PDF page numbers 28-30)</ref> Consequently, the [[Potsdam Agreement]] envisaged that an eventual self-governing state would emerge from the wreckage of WWII covering 'Germany as a whole', reuniting Berlin and the four Allied control zones; but that this state would derive its sovereignty solely from that then being assumed by the Allied Powers, and its constitution would require the approval of all the Allies through the [[Council of Foreign Ministers]]. From the 1950s onwards however, a school of German legal scholars developed the alternative view that the Allies had only taken custody of German sovereignty while the former German state had been rendered powerless to act; and that consequently, once a freely constituted German government had come into being in the form of the Federal Republic, it would resume the identity and legal status of the former German Reich without requiring any formal devolution of sovereignty from the institutions of the Allied Control Council (which were by then, moribund).<ref name=\"Eckert2004\">Eckert, Astrid M, trans Seyer D,''The Struggle for the Files; The Western Allies and the Returning of German Archives after the Second World War'', CUP , 2012, pp219ff</ref>\n\n==Germany as 'national people'; versus Germany as 'state territory'==\nAt the 1871 Unification of Germany, the Reich was established constitutionally as a federation of monarchies, each having entered the federation with a defined territory; and consequently the unitary nationalism of the 'German Reich' was initially specified (at Article 1 of the 1871 constitution) in territorial terms, as the lands within the former boundaries of this particular subset of German monarchies.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 14}}</ref> This geographical understanding of the German state became steadily superseded in the period up to the first World War by an understanding of Germany as a unitary nation state identified with the German national people according to the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', and drawing on the rhetoric of \"the sovereignty of the nation\" in the [[Frankfurt Constitution]];<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 16}}</ref> albeit that many ethnic '[[Germans]]' (as with the German-speaking peoples of Austria) remained outside the national people constituting the German Empire of 1871; and also that the Empire of 1871 included extensive territories (such as [[Province of Posen|Posen]]) with predominantly non-German populations. This transition became formalised in the [[Weimar Constitution|constitution of the Weimar Republic]],<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 17}}</ref> where Article 1 identifies the Reich as deriving its authority from the German national people; while Article 2 identifies the state territory under the Reich as the lands which, at the time of the constitution's adoption, were within the authority of the German state. The identity of the German state and German people ran both ways; not only did the institutions of the German state derive their legitimacy from the German people; so, too, the German people derived their inherent identity and patriotic duties from their being collectively constituted as an organ and institution of the German Reich.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 88}}</ref> Subsequently, the term 'German Reich' continued to be applied both as identifying with the national people, and also as denoting German state territory; but increasingly the application of the term to the German national people came to be seen as primary.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 33}}</ref> Following the Second World War, the term 'German Reich' fell out of use in constitutional formulations, being replaced by the term 'nation as a whole', as applied to denote the state as a totality of the German national people; and the term 'Germany as a whole', as applied to denote the state as a totality of German national territory. Nevertheless, it remains fundamental to German constitutional understanding that the legal status of Germany is a function of the unified German people, and is not constrained by the boundaries of territories falling under the jurisdiction of the German state at any one time.\n\n==Surrender of the Wehrmacht==\n[[File:Field Marshall Keitel signs German surrender terms in Berlin 8 May 1945 - Restoration.jpg|right|270px|thumb|''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Wilhelm Keitel]] signing the Instrument of Surrender in Berlin]]\nAfter the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933, state power had been personified more and more within Reich [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] (''Reichskanzler'') [[Adolf Hitler]], who upon the death of [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reich President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] on 2 August 1934 simultaneously served as [[head of government]] and as [[head of state]] (styled ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' and ''Reichskanzler'').<ref name=\"GSdDR\">[http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/stobrhpt.html Gesetz \u00fcber das Staatsoberhaupt des Deutschen Reichs vom 1.

However, as the military capitulation of the German High Command was taken as constituting the extinction of the German state and the assumption of all state authority by the Allied Powers, all embassies remaining in neutral countries were immediately ordered by the Western Allies to be closed down, their diplomatic staff recalled and their records taken over into one or another Allied embassy.<ref name=\"Eckert2004\" /> Those neutral countries that had been nominated as [[protecting powers]] in respect of Germany and the Allies under the [[Geneva Conventions]] were notified that this function had now been terminated, and were requested by the State Department to hand all embassy records and German state property in their trust over to the western Allies. All the protecting powers complied fully with the Allied demands, formally breaking off diplomatic relations; consequently the German state ceased as a diplomatic entity on 8 May 1945.\n\nOn May 23, the Allies closed down the Flensburg administration and arrested its members. This formalised a legal vacuum that was only filled on June 5, when the commanders-in-chief of the four Allied Powers announced, in the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]], the assumption of \"supreme authority\" in Germany: the Allied forces not only took control of government, but also now assumed all the powers and legal authority of the German state as a whole. It was explicitly stated that this would not effect the [[annexation]] of Germany, although the four Powers asserted their authority, as the sole repository of German state power, to determine the future boundaries of German territory:\n<blockquote>\n\"There is no central Government or authority in Germany capable of accepting responsibility for the maintenance of order, the administration of the country and compliance with the requirements of the victorious Powers. The unconditional surrender of Germany has thereby been effected, and Germany has become subject to such requirements as may now or hereafter be imposed upon her.\" </blockquote>\n:[...]\n<blockquote>\n\"The Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, hereby assume supreme authority with respect to Germany, including all the powers possessed by the German Government, the High Command and any state, municipal, or local government or authority.

All pre-war international treaties to which the German Reich had been a party were renounced in respect Germany from 1945 (subject to specific continuation agreements negotiated through the ACC). International [[legitimation]] resulted from Allied occupational supremacy, and neutral countries were invited to recognise the Allied Control Council as the sole sovereign authority in Germany. Nevertheless, German nationality continued to be recognised, and a German national territory was considered still to exist. By virtue of the legitimacy asserted in the Berlin Declaration, the Allied Powers at the [[Potsdam Conference]] assigned the eastern territories of the former German Reich to [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] administration; pending a final peace settlement. The remaining German territory was divided into four occupational zones, which along with the joint occupational zone of the capital [[Berlin]] would together constitute post-war 'Germany as a whole', and were subject to the administration of an Allied Command ''([[:de:Alliierte Kommandantur|Alliierte Kommandantur]])'', which in turn was subordinate to the Allied Control Council. The western boundary of Poland, pending exact delimitation at an eventual Peace conference, was set at the Oder-Neisse line; all territories east of this being excluded from the Soviet zone of occupation, and hence from 'Germany as a whole'.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"For occupational purposes, Germany will be divided into three zones, within her borders of December 31st 1937, to each of which one of the three powers will be assigned, as well as a special zone for Berlin, which is governed by the joint occupation of the three powers\" ([[London Protocol (1944)|London Protocol]] of December 12th, 1944; extension to France did not take place until the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945.)</blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, grassroots reconstruction of German [[public administration]] commenced. [[municipalities of Germany|Municipal]] administrations (''[[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]]n'') had continued operating almost uninterrupted, and by 1946 local elections took place in all occupational zones. Germany's federal states located within the occupational zones of the [[Allies of World War II|western allies]] were once again assigned state governments between May 1945 and July 1947. In addition, state assemblies bearing constitutional authority were elected, and from 1946 onward, state constitutions became effective, in most cases following [[referendum]]s.<ref name=\"StaatsR4\">Schweitzer: ''Staatsrecht III'', 8.

In the interim, it was intended that the [[Allied Control Council]] would act exercise all sovereign authority within Germany; while the [[Council of Foreign Ministers]] would oversee the development of new German State institutions. France was invited to membership of both bodies (although [[De Gaulle]] had not been invited to Potsdam, and refused to be bound by any agreements made there); but France from the first pursued a policy of obstructing any joint Allied actions that might lead to the re-emergence of Germany as a single unified state. Consequently, any establishment of formal institutions or agencies that might eventually restore unified German sovereignty was initially stalled by French objections. Subsequently, as [[Cold War]] antagonisms grew, the same institutions came to be largely nullified by disputes between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The United States and the United Kingdom therefore came round to the French view that a unified German state partially subject to Soviet authority could not be allowed to emerge while the [[Soviet Bloc]] remained in eastern Europe, and so the three Western Allies resolved upon the foundation of a West German [[federation]] consisting of the territories in their three zones of occupation. This was established on 23 May 1949 with the promulgation of the Basic Law as it had been adopted by the [[Parlamentarischer Rat|Parliamentary Council]] and approved by the Western occupation forces. The Federal Republic created by the Basic Law was empowered to act upon the [[West German federal election, 1949|federal election]] held on August 14, the constitutive meeting of the [[Bundestag]] parliament on September 7, the investiture of the first [[President of Germany|Federal President]], [[Theodor Heuss]] on September 13, the appointment of [[Konrad Adenauer]] as the first [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]] on September 15 and the accession of the [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Cabinet]] on September 20, 1949. In turn the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet Military Administration]] on October 7 implemented the [[People's Chamber]] (''Volkskammer'') parliament in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] and [[East Berlin]], which passed the [[Constitution of East Germany]], officially named \"German Democratic Republic\" (GDR). The [[Council of Ministers of the GDR]] assumed office on October 12, 1949.\n\nOn April 10, 1949, the Western Allies had drawn up the [[occupation statute]] and had it conveyed to the Parliamentary Council. Officially announced on May 12, it reserved a number of sovereign rights, such as [[foreign policy]] and external trade, to the three western Allied authorities. Any amendment to the West German Constitution was subject to (western) Allied permission, specific laws could be rejected, and the military governors could take over all governmental power in times of crisis. Those reservations were to be executed by the [[Allied High Commission]] of the three western allies, established on June 20 and claiming to exercise supreme state power within the former western zones of occupation. On November 22, 1949, Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] signed the [[Petersberg Agreement]], under which it was recognized that the [[sovereignty]] of West Germany remained limited. The Agreement, however, extended the rights of the German Government vis-\u00e0-vis the powers provided for in the original version of the Occupation Statute. By the [[General Treaty]] of 1955, the western allies recognized the full sovereignty of West Germany. However, in so far as the Allied High Commission was acting outside the authority of the dormant Allied Control Council, it was highly uncertain what, if any, sovereign authority it could claim over western Germany; or whether it could validly convey any sovereign authority to the new West German government.\n\nFrom the 1950s, the claim that there was a single continuing German Reich whose legal status was wholly untouched by the institutions established by the Allied Powers, and that the Federal Republic was the sole legal successor of that Reich, was adopted both by the Federal Government itself and by the [[Federal Constitutional Court]]. On this basis, the Federal Republic claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for the entire postwar territory of Germany. Initially, the 1949 constitution of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] adopted a mirror image version of this claim; in being framed in anticipation of a future all-German constitution on its own political terms; but all references to a wider national German nation were removed in constitutional amendments in 1968 and 1974, and from that date the GDR maintained that from 1949 there had existed two entirely separate sovereign German states. The Federal Republic's [[Western Bloc|Cold-war Allies]] supported its claims in part, as they acknowledged the Federal Republic as the sole legitimate democratically organised state within former German territory (the GDR being held to be an illegally constituted Soviet [[puppet state]]); but they did not accept the associated arguments for the pre-1945 Reich's continuing 'metaphysical' existence ''de jure'' within the organs of the Federal Republic.<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 13]}}</ref> \n\nSubsequently, under the ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', the Federal Republic in the early 1970s sought to end hostile relations with the countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]], in the course of which it negotiated in 1972 a [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] with the GDR, recognising it as one of two German states within one German nation, and relinquishing any claim to ''de jure'' sovereign jurisdiction over those parts of Germany within the GDR. The Treaty was challenged in the Federal Constitutional Court, as apparently contradicting the overriding aspirations of the Basic Law for a unified German state; but the Treaty's legality was upheld by the court, heavily qualified by a reassertion of the claim that the German Reich continued to exist as an 'overall state' such that the duty to strive for future German unity could not be abandoned, albeit that without any institutional organs of itself the Reich was currently not capable of action.<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 14]}}</ref> The Federal Republic was indeed identical with the German Reich; but this was a 'partial identity' that stopped at the boundaries of the Federal Republic and did not extend retrospectively to the period 1945-1949 before the Federal Republic had come into being. The Western Allies took this as their cue to repudiate any support for the former claims of the Federal Republic to an [[exclusive mandate]] for Germany, all thereon recognising the GDR as a separate sovereign state and supporting the admission of both German states as equivalent members of the United Nations.<ref name=\"Kommers 2012 309\">{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> In 1975 both German states participated in the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]] under which the existing post-war boundaries of Europe, including the separation of East and West Germany and the border between East Germany and Poland, were confirmed as legitimate in international law.\n\n==Claimed continuity of the institutions of the German state; the 'Civil Servant' case==\nAlthough the Federal Constitutional Court maintained that the pre-war German Reich was continuing within the organs and institutions of the Federal Republic post-1949, it differed strongly from both German academic constitutional lawyers and other Federal courts in its interpretation of that principle. This conflict came to a head over the claim from members of the Nazi-era judiciary, civil service and academic professorships for a right to reinstatement into their former jobs in the new Federal Republic. Under Article 131 of the Basic Law, the re-employment of these public servants, or otherwise their entitlement to severance payments or pensions, had been specified to be subject to federal law; but when such a law was enacted in 1951, providing limited redress in employment and partial back-payment of pension entitlements, it was challenged by many former public servants; whose cases were strongly supported by the [[Federal Court of Justice]]. The substance of the FCJ support for these cases rested on the proposition that the employment rights of public officials had been protected from political interference as a fundamental principle of the German state, albeit that this principle had been grossly violated in the Nazi period; and hence since the German state, now freed from Nazism, had continued to exist after 1945, so too had the employment of its public officials - notwithstanding the actions of the Occupying Powers in temporarily removing them. Furthermore, the FCJ noted that in the formal surrender of the German military in 1945 there had been no counterpart surrender of the German civil state; and so that state and its institutions might legally be considered to have been awaiting reactivation under the Federal Republic. For public officials to be denied reinstatement, without judicial process establishing individual complicity in the illegal actions of the Nazi regime, amounted to collective punishment; and hence was unconstitutional.\n\nIn a judgement of 1953, the Federal Constitutional Court rejected all these arguments absolutely. All civil services commissions had been extinguished on 8 May 1945; because at that date, and for many years previously, there had been no Reich civil service in which to be employed. The same applied to the judiciary and university professors. In particular the FCC noted that all public servants, judicial officers and university professors had been required to swear the [[Hitler oath]] in replacement of the former oath to uphold the constitution, as a strict condition of remaining in employment. Those that swore the oath (even under duress) were tacitly complicit in the dismissal of those who refused the oath. The entire body of German civil state organs and institutions without exception had, under the Nazi regime, been corrupted into \"a power apparatus in the service of the Nazi Party\"; and when the Nazi Party was extinguished, so too were all jobs in the Nazi civil state. No aspect of the [[Rechtsstaat]], or civil state under the rule of law, would have been capable of continuity of function under the conditions of Nazi power; and none had done so. Consequently, any relief offered to former civil servants by federal law post-1949 was a matter of parliamentary grace, not of fundamental right. Although the legal personality of the German Reich was considered to have survived into that of the Federal Republic, all of the organs and institutions of the Reich had long since been extinguished by the actions of the Nazi Regime, and their post-1949 successor state institutions were in no sense their continuators. The entire German federal state apparatus had been newborn, \"rebuilt from the ground up\" since 1949.  It followed that the Nazi civil state should be considered to have been a 'criminal state' (''Verbrecherstaat''), a criminal enterprise masquerading as a state; its judges were not judges, its professors were not professors, and its civil servants were not civil servants. In this, the Federal Constitutional Court maintained an absolute distinction between civil and military authority under the Nazi regime; as, notwithstanding that all members of the armed services had also been required to swear their own version of the Hitler oath, their valid legal status as soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Reich had remained right up to 8 May 1945.\n\n==German Reunification==\nWith the collapse of the German Democratic Republic in 1989, a reunification of Germany became inescapable; but this raised the question of how far the former actions and laws of the pre-1989 GDR should be accepted as actions of a legitimate German sovereign state. Some scholars argued for a revival of the theory that the sovereignty of the pre-1945 Reich had continued in existence; with the post-1949 Federal Republic as its sole interim representative (albeit only within the FRG boundaries). In turn, this was taken to imply the need for a new all-German constitution voted into effect by a unified nation under the terms of Article 146 of the Basic Law as the successor to the Federal Republic; with the further implication the actions of the former GDR might be nullified. In the event the unification of 1990 was initiated under the quicker process of Article 23, by which existing German states could declare their accession to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic, through the decision of free representative democratic institutions. This process implicitly confirmed both the continuing sovereign status of the Federal Republic under the Basic Law, and also the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' legal capabilities of the political institutions of the former East Germany, both in declaring accession to the Basic Law and in having previously exercised government over its population and represented them in international law; subject to extensive qualification post-1990 in categorising the former GDR as an 'injustice state' whose population could claim redress (and be subject to penalties) in respect of actions before 1990 that had been inconsistent with the principles of Human Rights, as these had been incorporated into East German public law.<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 196,197]}}</ref> \n\nAn Article 146 unification would have entailed protracted negotiations that would have opened up festering issues in West Germany. Even without that to consider, East Germany was in a state of near-total economic and political collapse. By comparison, an Article 23 reunification could be completed in as little as six months. For this reason, when the two Germanies agreed to an emergency merger of their economies in May 1990, they also agreed to pursue reunification via the quicker Article 23 route. \n\nHence, on 23 August 1990, the Volkskammer of the GDR declared the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law; and so initiated the process of reunification, to come into effect on 3 October 1990. Nevertheless, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including the fundamental amendments to the Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref name=\"Kommers 2012 309\"/> This treaty was then voted into effect on 20 September 1990 by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. \n\nUnder these terms, the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist as of midnight [[Central European Time]] on 3 October, and five recently reconstituted states on its territory joined the Federal Republic. East and West Berlin [[Berlin|reunited]] as a single city-state, which became the capital of the enlarged Federal Republic. The process did not create a third state out of the two. Rather, West Germany effectively absorbed East Germany, and the area in which the Basic Law was in force was extended to cover the former territory of the GDR. Thus, the enlarged Federal Republic continued under the same legal personality of the old West Germany.\n\nAlthough the GDR had nominally declared its accession the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law, this did not imply its acceptance of the Basic Law as it then stood; but rather of the Basic Law as subsequently amended in line with the Unification Treaty and the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Treaty of Final Settlement]]. These amendments had the effect of removing all those clauses by which the Federal Constitutional Court had formerly maintained the identity of the Federal Republic with the historic German Reich as an 'overall state', specifically including the very Article 23 that had provided the basis for the Volkskammer's ongoing declaration of accession.\n\nUnder the \"Two Plus Four Treaty\" both the Federal Republic and the GDR committed themselves and their unified continuation to the principle that their joint pre-1990 boundaries constituted the entire territory that could be claimed by a Government of Germany, and hence that there were no further lands outside those boundaries that were parts of Germany as a whole. The 1990 Basic Law amendments required for [[German reunification]] also explicitly excluded providing redress or restitution for actions undertaken under the authority of the Soviet Occupation 1945-1949 prior to the founding of the Federal Republic and the GDR. This raised a further complex of constitutional issues, as a number of private individuals challenged the constitutionality of the reunification treaties; specifically in respect of the levels of compensation and restitution offered to persons whose property had been expropriated between 1945 and 1949 under Soviet authority. These plaintiffs argued that, as the Federal Republic had historically claimed its sovereignty to be a continuation of that of the former governments of the German Reich, so post-1990, it should provide restitution in favour of expropriated property owners (or their heirs) for actions in the period when German sovereign power had been dormant. The cases were eventually heard before the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2005; who found consistently in favour of the post-1990 actions of the Federal Republic - hence rejecting arguments that claimed that the sovereignty of the Federal Republic maintained that of a continuing but dormant post-war German Reich; declaring that the four Allied Powers had, in the years 1945 to 1949, exercised \"an occupation sui generis following a war and unconditional capitulation, which conferred powers of 'sovereignty' on the occupying forces.\"<ref>{{citation|first=Eyal |last=Benvenisti|title=The International Law of Occupation |date=2012 |publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958889-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JKgeX_sdQG0C&pg=PA161 162]}}</ref>\n\nIn the process of reunion, Article 23 of the Basic Law had been repealed, closing off the possibility that any further former parts of Germany might subsequently declare their accession to the Federal Republic; while Article 146 was amended to state explicitly that the territory of the newly unified republic then comprised the entirety of Germany as a whole; \"This Basic Law, which since the achievement of the unity and freedom of Germany applies to the entire German people, shall cease to apply on the day on which a constitution freely adopted by the German people takes effect.\" This was confirmed in the 1990 rewording of the preamble; \"Germans..have achieved the unity and freedom of Germany in free self-determination. This Basic Law thus applies to the entire German people.\"\n\nFrom 1990 therefore, there could be no constitutional basis for maintaining any future legal identity for Germany and the German people, other than in the unified territories and populations of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin.\n\n==See also==\n* [[German Question]]\n* [[Debellatio]]\n* [[Occupation statute]] (1949)\n* [[Petersberg Agreement]] (1949)\n* [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]] (1952, came into force in 1955)\n* [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (1971)\n* [[Basic Treaty (1972)]]\n* [[Two Plus Four Agreement]] (Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070210184824/http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/dfr/bv036001.html BVerfGE 36, 1 &ndash; East-West Basic Treaty], Judgement of the Second Senate at 31.

It became current once again when the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) [[German reunification|joined]] the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (West Germany) in 1990.\n\n==Overview==\nAfter [[World War II]], determination of legal status was relevant, for instance, to resolve the issue of whether the post-1949 Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) would be the [[succession of states|successor state]] of the pre-1945 German Reich\u2014with all at the time uncodified implications of state succession, such as the continuation of [[treaty|treaties]]\u2014or if, according to [[international law]], it would be identical with the German Reich. Further, determination of authority, for instance to assert or deny territorial claims, especially with respect to the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]], was dependent upon this determination of legal status. The 1945 [[Potsdam Agreement]] had specified that a full peace treaty concluding World War II, including the exact delimitation of Germany's postwar boundaries, required to be \"accepted by the Government of Germany when a government adequate for the purpose is established.\" The Federal Republic always maintained that no such government could be said to have been established until the peoples of East and West Germany had been reunited within a free democratic state; but a range of opinions continued within West Germany over whether a unified state consisting of the populations of West Germany, East Germany and Berlin alone could be said to represent the whole German people for this purpose. The key question being whether a Germany that remained bounded to the east by the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] could act as a 'united Germany' in signing a peace treaty, without qualification.<ref>{{citation|first=Jan |last=Bacz|title='The legal basis of Poland's relationship with United Germany' in 'Poland-Germany 1945-2007; from Confrontation to Cooperation and Partnership in Europe' Witold M Grolski ed. |date=2007 |publisher=Polish Institute for International Affairs|pages= 129}}</ref>\n\nA related question arose from the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Grundgesetz''). As adopted by West Germany in 1949 as an interim constitution, the preamble looked forward explicitly to a future free and united German state; \"The entire German people is called upon to accomplish, by free self-determination, the unity and freedom of Germany.\" The Basic Law potentially provided two routes for the establishment of a reborn and unified German state; either under Article 23 whereby 'other parts of Germany' over and above the named [[States of Germany|States of the Federal Republic]] (''Bundesland'') could subsequently apply for admission; or under Article 146 where [[constituent assembly|constituent power]] (''pouvoir constituant'') could be exercised by elected representatives of the entirety of the [[Germans|German people]] in creating a new permanent constitution that would replace the Basic Law. Adoption of a constitution under Article 146 would have implied that the legal validity of a unified German State would rest on \"a free decision by the German people\" as a whole.<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 12}}</ref>\n\nNo effective national government existed in Germany following the surrender of the German High Command in May 1945; all national military and civil authority and powers were therefore exercised by the four [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]. The Allies then maintained that as the former German Reich no longer existed in fact; so, as the 'highest authority' for Germany, they were entitled to assume all sovereign powers without limitation of scope or duration and could legitimately impose whatever measures on the German people within German national territory as any government could legally do on its own people\u2014including validly ceding parts of that territory and people to another country. They argued furthermore that international conventions constraining occupying powers in wartime from enforcing fundamental changes of governmental system, economic system or social institutions within the territory under their control\u2014the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Regulations of Land Warfare]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]]\u2014did not apply; and could not apply, as the termination of [[Nazi Germany]] and the total [[Denazification]] of German institutions and legal structures had been agreed by the Allied Powers as absolute moral imperatives.<ref>Breven C.

From the 1950s onwards however, a school of German legal scholars developed the alternative view that the Allies had only taken custody of German sovereignty while the former German state had been rendered powerless to act; and that consequently, once a freely constituted German government had come into being in the form of the Federal Republic, it would resume the identity and legal status of the former German Reich without requiring any formal devolution of sovereignty from the institutions of the Allied Control Council (which were by then, moribund).<ref name=\"Eckert2004\">Eckert, Astrid M, trans Seyer D,''The Struggle for the Files; The Western Allies and the Returning of German Archives after the Second World War'', CUP , 2012, pp219ff</ref>\n\n==Germany as 'national people'; versus Germany as 'state territory'==\nAt the 1871 Unification of Germany, the Reich was established constitutionally as a federation of monarchies, each having entered the federation with a defined territory; and consequently the unitary nationalism of the 'German Reich' was initially specified (at Article 1 of the 1871 constitution) in territorial terms, as the lands within the former boundaries of this particular subset of German monarchies.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 14}}</ref> This geographical understanding of the German state became steadily superseded in the period up to the first World War by an understanding of Germany as a unitary nation state identified with the German national people according to the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', and drawing on the rhetoric of \"the sovereignty of the nation\" in the [[Frankfurt Constitution]];<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 16}}</ref> albeit that many ethnic '[[Germans]]' (as with the German-speaking peoples of Austria) remained outside the national people constituting the German Empire of 1871; and also that the Empire of 1871 included extensive territories (such as [[Province of Posen|Posen]]) with predominantly non-German populations. This transition became formalised in the [[Weimar Constitution|constitution of the Weimar Republic]],<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 17}}</ref> where Article 1 identifies the Reich as deriving its authority from the German national people; while Article 2 identifies the state territory under the Reich as the lands which, at the time of the constitution's adoption, were within the authority of the German state. The identity of the German state and German people ran both ways; not only did the institutions of the German state derive their legitimacy from the German people; so, too, the German people derived their inherent identity and patriotic duties from their being collectively constituted as an organ and institution of the German Reich.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 88}}</ref> Subsequently, the term 'German Reich' continued to be applied both as identifying with the national people, and also as denoting German state territory; but increasingly the application of the term to the German national people came to be seen as primary.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 33}}</ref> Following the Second World War, the term 'German Reich' fell out of use in constitutional formulations, being replaced by the term 'nation as a whole', as applied to denote the state as a totality of the German national people; and the term 'Germany as a whole', as applied to denote the state as a totality of German national territory. Nevertheless, it remains fundamental to German constitutional understanding that the legal status of Germany is a function of the unified German people, and is not constrained by the boundaries of territories falling under the jurisdiction of the German state at any one time.\n\n==Surrender of the Wehrmacht==\n[[File:Field Marshall Keitel signs German surrender terms in Berlin 8 May 1945 - Restoration.jpg|right|270px|thumb|''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Wilhelm Keitel]] signing the instrument of Surrender in Berlin]]\nAfter the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933, state power had been personified more and more within Reich [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] (''Reichskanzler'') [[Adolf Hitler]], who upon the death of [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reich President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] on 2 August 1934 simultaneously served as [[head of government]] and as [[head of state]] (styled ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' and ''Reichskanzler'').<ref name=\"GSdDR\">[http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/stobrhpt.html Gesetz \u00fcber das Staatsoberhaupt des Deutschen Reichs vom 1.

However, as the military capitulation of the German High Command was taken as constituting the extinction of the German state and the assumption of all state authority by the Allied Powers, all embassies remaining in neutral countries were immediately ordered by the Western Allies to be closed down, their diplomatic staff recalled and their records taken over into one or another Allied embassy.<ref name=\"Eckert2004\" /> Those neutral countries that had been nominated as [[protecting powers]] in respect of Germany and the Allies under the [[Geneva Conventions]] were notified that this function had now been terminated, and were requested by the State Department to hand all embassy records and German state property in their trust over to the western Allies. All the protecting powers complied fully with the Allied demands, formally breaking off diplomatic relations; consequently the German state ceased as a diplomatic entity on 8 May 1945.\n\nOn May 23, the Allies closed down the Flensburg administration and arrested its members. This formalised a legal vacuum that was only filled on June 5, when the commanders-in-chief of the four Allied Powers announced, in the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]], the assumption of \"supreme authority\" in Germany: the Allied forces not only took control of government, but also now assumed all the powers and legal authority of the German state as a whole. It was explicitly stated that this would not effect the [[annexation]] of Germany, although the four Powers asserted their authority, as the sole repository of German state power, to determine the future boundaries of German territory:\n<blockquote>\n\"There is no central Government or authority in Germany capable of accepting responsibility for the maintenance of order, the administration of the country and compliance with the requirements of the victorious Powers.

All pre-war international treaties to which the German Reich had been a party were renounced in respect Germany from 1945 (subject to specific continuation agreements negotiated through the ACC). International [[legitimation]] resulted from Allied occupational supremacy, and neutral countries were invited to recognise the Allied Control Council as the sole sovereign authority in Germany. Nevertheless, German nationality continued to be recognised, and a German national territory was considered still to exist. By virtue of the legitimacy asserted in the Berlin Declaration, the Allied Powers at the [[Potsdam Conference]] assigned the eastern territories of the former German Reich to [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] administration; pending a final peace settlement. The remaining German territory was divided into four occupational zones, which along with the joint occupational zone of the capital [[Berlin]] would together constitute post-war 'Germany as a whole', and were subject to the administration of an Allied Command ''([[:de:Alliierte Kommandantur|Alliierte Kommandantur]])'', which in turn was subordinate to the Allied Control Council. The western boundary of Poland, pending exact delimitation at an eventual Peace conference, was set at the Oder-Neisse line; all territories east of this being excluded from the Soviet zone of occupation, and hence from 'Germany as a whole'.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"For occupational purposes, Germany will be divided into three zones, within her borders of December 31st 1937, to each of which one of the three powers will be assigned, as well as a special zone for Berlin, which is governed by the joint occupation of the three powers\" ([[London Protocol (1944)|London Protocol]] of December 12th, 1944; extension to France did not take place until the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945.)</blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, grassroots reconstruction of German [[public administration]] commenced. [[municipalities of Germany|Municipal]] administrations (''[[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]]n'') had continued operating almost uninterrupted, and by 1946 local elections took place in all occupational zones. Germany's federal states located within the occupational zones of the [[Allies of World War II|western allies]] were once again assigned state governments between May 1945 and July 1947. In addition, state assemblies bearing constitutional authority were elected, and from 1946 onward, state constitutions became effective, in most cases following [[referendum]]s.<ref name=\"StaatsR4\">Schweitzer: ''Staatsrecht III'', 8.

In the interim, it was intended that the [[Allied Control Council]] would act exercise all sovereign authority within Germany; while the [[Council of Foreign Ministers]] would oversee the development of new German State institutions. France was invited to membership of both bodies (although [[De Gaulle]] had not been invited to Potsdam, and refused to be bound by any agreements made there); but France from the first pursued a policy of obstructing any joint Allied actions that might lead to the re-emergence of Germany as a single unified state. Consequently, any establishment of formal institutions or agencies that might eventually restore unified German sovereignty was initially stalled by French objections. Subsequently, as [[Cold War]] antagonisms grew, the same institutions came to be largely nullified by disputes between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The United States and the United Kingdom therefore came round to the French view that a unified German state partially subject to Soviet authority could not be allowed to emerge while the [[Soviet Bloc]] remained in eastern Europe, and so the three Western Allies resolved upon the foundation of a West German [[federation]] consisting of the territories in their three zones of occupation. This was established on 23 May 1949 with the promulgation of the Basic Law as it had been adopted by the [[Parlamentarischer Rat|Parliamentary Council]] and approved by the Western occupation forces. The Federal Republic created by the Basic Law was empowered to act upon the [[West German federal election, 1949|federal election]] held on August 14, the constitutive meeting of the [[Bundestag]] parliament on September 7, the investiture of the first [[President of Germany|Federal President]], [[Theodor Heuss]] on September 13, the appointment of [[Konrad Adenauer]] as the first [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]] on September 15 and the accession of the [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Cabinet]] on September 20, 1949. In turn the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet Military Administration]] on October 7 implemented the [[People's Chamber]] (''Volkskammer'') parliament in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] and [[East Berlin]], which passed the [[Constitution of East Germany]], officially named \"German Democratic Republic\" (GDR). The [[Council of Ministers of the GDR]] assumed office on October 12, 1949.\n\nOn April 10, 1949, the Western Allies had drawn up the [[occupation statute]] and had it conveyed to the Parliamentary Council. Officially announced on May 12, it reserved a number of sovereign rights, such as [[foreign policy]] and external trade, to the three western Allied authorities. Any amendment to the West German Constitution was subject to (western) Allied permission, specific laws could be rejected, and the military governors could take over all governmental power in times of crisis. Those reservations were to be executed by the [[Allied High Commission]] of the three western allies, established on June 20 and claiming to exercise supreme state power within the former western zones of occupation. On November 22, 1949, Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] signed the [[Petersberg Agreement]], under which it was recognized that the [[sovereignty]] of West Germany remained limited. The Agreement, however, extended the rights of the German Government vis-\u00e0-vis the powers provided for in the original version of the Occupation Statute. By the [[General Treaty]] of 1955, the western allies recognized the full sovereignty of West Germany. However, in so far as the Allied High Commission was acting outside the authority of the dormant Allied Control Council, it was highly uncertain what, if any, sovereign authority it could claim over western Germany; or whether it could validly convey any sovereign authority to the new West German government.\n\nFrom the 1950s, the claim that there was a single continuing German Reich whose legal status was wholly untouched by the institutions established by the Allied Powers, and that the Federal Republic was the sole legal successor of that Reich, was adopted both by the Federal Government itself and by the [[Federal Constitutional Court]]. On this basis, the Federal Republic claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for the entire postwar territory of Germany. Initially, the 1949 constitution of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] adopted a mirror image version of this claim; in being framed in anticipation of a future all-German constitution on its own political terms; but all references to a wider national German nation were removed in constitutional amendments in 1968 and 1974, and from that date the GDR maintained that from 1949 there had existed two entirely separate sovereign German states. The Federal Republic's [[Western Bloc|Cold-war Allies]] supported its claims in part, as they acknowledged the Federal Republic as the sole legitimate democratically organised state within former German territory (the GDR being held to be an illegally constituted Soviet [[puppet state]]); but they did not accept the associated arguments for the pre-1945 Reich's continuing 'metaphysical' existence ''de jure'' within the organs of the Federal Republic.<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 13]}}</ref> \n\nSubsequently, under the ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', the Federal Republic in the early 1970s sought to end hostile relations with the countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]], in the course of which it negotiated in 1972 a [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] with the GDR, recognising it as one of two German states within one German nation, and relinquishing any claim to ''de jure'' sovereign jurisdiction over those parts of Germany within the GDR. The Treaty was challenged in the Federal Constitutional Court, as apparently contradicting the overriding aspirations of the Basic Law for a unified German state; but the Treaty's legality was upheld by the court, heavily qualified by a reassertion of the claim that the German Reich continued to exist as an 'overall state' such that the duty to strive for future German unity could not be abandoned, albeit that without any institutional organs of itself the Reich was currently not capable of action.<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 14]}}</ref> The Federal Republic was indeed identical with the German Reich; but this was a 'partial identity' that stopped at the boundaries of the Federal Republic and did not extend retrospectively to the period 1945-1949 before the Federal Republic had come into being. The Western Allies took this as their cue to repudiate any support for the former claims of the Federal Republic to an [[exclusive mandate]] for Germany, all thereon recognising the GDR as a separate sovereign state and supporting the admission of both German states as equivalent members of the United Nations.<ref name=\"Kommers 2012 309\">{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> In 1975 both German states participated in the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]] under which the existing post-war boundaries of Europe, including the separation of East and West Germany and the border between East Germany and Poland, were confirmed as legitimate in international law.\n\n==Claimed continuity of the institutions of the German state; the 'Civil Servant' case==\nAlthough the Federal Constitutional Court maintained that the pre-war German Reich was continuing within the organs and institutions of the Federal Republic post-1949, it differed strongly from both German academic constitutional lawyers and other Federal courts in its interpretation of that principle. This conflict came to a head over the claim from members of the Nazi-era judiciary, civil service and academic professorships for a right to reinstatement into their former jobs in the new Federal Republic. Under Article 131 of the Basic Law, the re-employment of these public servants, or otherwise their entitlement to severance payments or pensions, had been specified to be subject to federal law; but when such a law was enacted in 1951, providing limited redress in employment and partial back-payment of pension entitlements, it was challenged by many former public servants; whose cases were strongly supported by the [[Federal Court of Justice]]. The substance of the FCJ support for these cases rested on the proposition that the employment rights of public officials had been protected from political interference as a fundamental principle of the German state, albeit that this principle had been grossly violated in the Nazi period; and hence since the German state, now freed from Nazism, had continued to exist after 1945, so too had the employment of its public officials - notwithstanding the actions of the Occupying Powers in temporarily removing them. Furthermore, the FCJ noted that in the formal surrender of the German military in 1945 there had been no counterpart surrender of the German civil state; and so that state and its institutions might legally be considered to have been awaiting reactivation under the Federal Republic. For public officials to be denied reinstatement, without judicial process establishing individual complicity in the illegal actions of the Nazi regime, amounted to collective punishment; and hence was unconstitutional.\n\nIn a judgement of 1953, the Federal Constitutional Court rejected all these arguments absolutely. All civil services commissions had been extinguished on 8 May 1945; because at that date, and for many years previously, there had been no Reich civil service in which to be employed. The same applied to the judiciary and university professors. In particular the FCC noted that all public servants, judicial officers and university professors had been required to swear the [[Hitler oath]] in replacement of the former oath to uphold the constitution, as a strict condition of remaining in employment. Those that swore the oath (even under duress) were tacitly complicit in the dismissal of those who refused the oath. The entire body of German civil state organs and institutions without exception had, under the Nazi regime, been corrupted into \"a power apparatus in the service of the Nazi Party\"; and when the Nazi Party was extinguished, so too were all jobs in the Nazi civil state. No aspect of the [[Rechtsstaat]], or civil state under the rule of law, would have been capable of continuity of function under the conditions of Nazi power; and none had done so. Consequently, any relief offered to former civil servants by federal law post-1949 was a matter of parliamentary grace, not of fundamental right. Although the legal personality of the German Reich was considered to have survived into that of the Federal Republic, all of the organs and institutions of the Reich had long since been extinguished by the actions of the Nazi Regime, and their post-1949 successor state institutions were in no sense their continuators. The entire German federal state apparatus had been newborn, \"rebuilt from the ground up\" since 1949.  It followed that the Nazi civil state should be considered to have been a 'criminal state' (''Verbrecherstaat''), a criminal enterprise masquerading as a state; its judges were not judges, its professors were not professors, and its civil servants were not civil servants. In this, the Federal Constitutional Court maintained an absolute distinction between civil and military authority under the Nazi regime; as, notwithstanding that all members of the armed services had also been required to swear their own version of the Hitler oath, their valid legal status as soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Reich had remained right up to 8 May 1945.\n\n==German Reunification==\nWith the collapse of the German Democratic Republic in 1989, a reunification of Germany became inescapable; but this raised the question of how far the former actions and laws of the pre-1989 GDR should be accepted as actions of a legitimate German sovereign state. Some scholars argued for a revival of the theory that the sovereignty of the pre-1945 Reich had continued in existence; with the post-1949 Federal Republic as its sole interim representative (albeit only within the FRG boundaries). In turn, this was taken to imply the need for a new all-German constitution voted into effect by a unified nation under the terms of Article 146 of the Basic Law as the successor to the Federal Republic; with the further implication the actions of the former GDR might be nullified. In the event the unification of 1990 was initiated under the quicker process of Article 23, by which existing German states could declare their accession to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic, through the decision of free representative democratic institutions. This process implicitly confirmed both the continuing sovereign status of the Federal Republic under the Basic Law, and also the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' legal capabilities of the political institutions of the former East Germany, both in declaring accession to the Basic Law and in having previously exercised government over its population and represented them in international law; subject to extensive qualification post-1990 in categorising the former GDR as an 'injustice state' whose population could claim redress (and be subject to penalties) in respect of actions before 1990 that had been inconsistent with the principles of Human Rights, as these had been incorporated into East German public law.<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 196,197]}}</ref> \n\nAn Article 146 unification would have entailed protracted negotiations that would have opened up festering issues in West Germany. Even without that to consider, East Germany was in a state of near-total economic and political collapse. By comparison, an Article 23 reunification could be completed in as little as six months. For this reason, when the two Germanies agreed to an emergency merger of their economies in May 1990, they also agreed to pursue reunification via the quicker Article 23 route. \n\nHence, on 23 August 1990, the Volkskammer of the GDR declared the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law; and so initiated the process of reunification, to come into effect on 3 October 1990. Nevertheless, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including the fundamental amendments to the Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref name=\"Kommers 2012 309\"/> This treaty was then voted into effect on 20 September 1990 by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. \n\nUnder these terms, the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist as of midnight [[Central European Time]] on 3 October, and five recently reconstituted states on its territory joined the Federal Republic. East and West Berlin [[Berlin|reunited]] as a single city-state, which became the capital of the enlarged Federal Republic. The process did not create a third state out of the two. Rather, West Germany effectively absorbed East Germany, and the area in which the Basic Law was in force was extended to cover the former territory of the GDR. Thus, the enlarged Federal Republic continued under the same legal personality of the old West Germany.\n\nAlthough the GDR had nominally declared its accession the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law, this did not imply its acceptance of the Basic Law as it then stood; but rather of the Basic Law as subsequently amended in line with the Unification Treaty and the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Treaty of Final Settlement]]. These amendments had the effect of removing all those clauses by which the Federal Constitutional Court had formerly maintained the identity of the Federal Republic with the historic German Reich as an 'overall state', specifically including the very Article 23 that had provided the basis for the Volkskammer's ongoing declaration of accession.\n\nUnder the \"Two Plus Four Treaty\" both the Federal Republic and the GDR committed themselves and their unified continuation to the principle that their joint pre-1990 boundaries constituted the entire territory that could be claimed by a Government of Germany, and hence that there were no further lands outside those boundaries that were parts of Germany as a whole. The 1990 Basic Law amendments required for [[German reunification]] also explicitly excluded providing redress or restitution for actions undertaken under the authority of the Soviet Occupation 1945-1949 prior to the founding of the Federal Republic and the GDR. This raised a further complex of constitutional issues, as a number of private individuals challenged the constitutionality of the reunification treaties; specifically in respect of the levels of compensation and restitution offered to persons whose property had been expropriated between 1945 and 1949 under Soviet authority. These plaintiffs argued that, as the Federal Republic had historically claimed its sovereignty to be a continuation of that of the former governments of the German Reich, so post-1990, it should provide restitution in favour of expropriated property owners (or their heirs) for actions in the period when German sovereign power had been dormant. The cases were eventually heard before the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2005; who found consistently in favour of the post-1990 actions of the Federal Republic - hence rejecting arguments that claimed that the sovereignty of the Federal Republic maintained that of a continuing but dormant post-war German Reich; declaring that the four Allied Powers had, in the years 1945 to 1949, exercised \"an occupation sui generis following a war and unconditional capitulation, which conferred powers of 'sovereignty' on the occupying forces.\"<ref>{{citation|first=Eyal |last=Benvenisti|title=The International Law of Occupation |date=2012 |publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958889-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JKgeX_sdQG0C&pg=PA161 162]}}</ref>\n\nIn the process of reunion, Article 23 of the Basic Law had been repealed, closing off the possibility that any further former parts of Germany might subsequently declare their accession to the Federal Republic; while Article 146 was amended to state explicitly that the territory of the newly unified republic then comprised the entirety of Germany as a whole; \"This Basic Law, which since the achievement of the unity and freedom of Germany applies to the entire German people, shall cease to apply on the day on which a constitution freely adopted by the German people takes effect.\" This was confirmed in the 1990 rewording of the preamble; \"Germans..have achieved the unity and freedom of Germany in free self-determination. This Basic Law thus applies to the entire German people.\"\n\nFrom 1990 therefore, there could be no constitutional basis for maintaining any future legal identity for Germany and the German people, other than in the unified territories and populations of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin.\n\n==See also==\n* [[German Question]]\n* [[Debellatio]]\n* [[Occupation statute]] (1949)\n* [[Petersberg Agreement]] (1949)\n* [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]] (1952, came into force in 1955)\n* [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (1971)\n* [[Basic Treaty (1972)]]\n* [[Two Plus Four Agreement]] (Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070210184824/http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/dfr/bv036001.html BVerfGE 36, 1 &ndash; East-West Basic Treaty], Judgement of the Second Senate at 31.
