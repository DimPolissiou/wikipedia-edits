His reading and writing focused on poetry for some 20 more years; he was 17 before he read his first novel cover to cover. He published several poetry collections before publishing his first novel in 2014, ''When I Was The Greatest'', which won the Coretta Scott King/[[John Steptoe Award for New Talent]]. \n\nIn the next four years, Reynolds wrote eight more novels, most notably the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best-selling]] Track series\u2014''Ghost'' (2016), ''Patina'' (2017), ''Sunny'' (2018), ''Lu'' (2018),\u2014and ''As Brave As You'' (2016), winner of the 2016 Kirkus Prize, the 2017 [[NAACP Image Awards|NAACP Image Award]] for Outstanding Literary Work for Youth/Teen, and the 2017 [[Schneider Family Book Award]]. He also wrote a [[Marvel Comics]] graphic novel called ''[[Miles Morales]]: Spider-Man'' (2017).\n\nIn 2017, Reynolds returned to poetry with ''Long Way Down'', a novel in verse that was named a [[Newbery Honor]] book, a [[Printz Honor Award|Printz]] Honor Book, and best young adult work by the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[Edgar Award]]s.\n\n== Early life, education and influences

The book is written in two voices, with Reynolds writing from the point of view of the teenaged victim, Rashad Butler, in a hospital bed, while Kiely wrote the character Quinn Collins, a white teenager and family friend of the police officer, who witnessed the violent attack.<ref name=\":10\" /> In a review for ''The New York Times'', Kelka Magoon found both main characters \"successfully drawn\" and called the novel \"a book to be grappled with, challenged by, and discussed. 'All American Boys' represents one voice \u2014 even better, two voices \u2014 in a national conversation that must continue beyond its pages.\"<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThe book arose from personal conversations between Reynolds, who is black, and Kiely, who is white.

By the early 20th century, southerners began to use kudzu for purposes other than ornamentation and so kudzu began to come closer in contact with the land which, in turn, encouraged its spread throughout the southeast.<ref name=Blaustein>Blaustein, R.J.

Of these states, three in the southeast have the heaviest infestations: Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.<ref name=Blaustein />\n\n===Ecological relationships===\nKudzu kills or damages other plants by smothering them under a blanket of leaves, encompassing tree trunks, breaking branches, or even uprooting entire trees. Kudzu's ability to grow quickly, survive in areas of low nitrogen availability, and acquire resources quickly allows it to out-compete native species. Of the plants that can successfully compete  with kudzu, many are other invasive species such as the [[Ligustrum sinense|Chinese privet]] and the [[Lonicera japonica|Japanese honeysuckle]].<ref name=Blaustein /> In the southeast, the spread of kudzu is especially troublesome because of the high level of [[biodiversity]] in this region that is not found in other regions of the United States. Kudzu and other invasive weeds pose a significant threat to the biodiversity in the southeast. They reduce the environment to impoverished \"vine barrens\".<ref name=Blaustein /> The fast growth and high competitive ability is achieved through several key features of kudzu that are detailed below.\n\nKudzu is a very stress-tolerant plant. Kudzu is [[Drought tolerance|drought tolerant]] and only the above ground portions of the plant are damaged by frost.  Kudzu also forms [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with [[Diazotroph|nitrogen-fixing bacteria]] to convert [[Nitrogen|atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)]] into [[ammonium]] which can be used by surrounding plants.  Now the dominant nitrogen-fixing plant in the eastern United States, kudzu fixes an estimated 235&nbsp;kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, which is an order of magnitude higher than the rates of native species.<ref name=Hickman />   This ability allows it to flourish in nitrogen-poor sites where other plants are unable to grow.  In the absence of other plants, nitrogen then builds up in the soil, allowing the maintenance of large leaf areas and high [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic rates]].<ref name=Forseth />\n\nWhile little research has been conducted on the impacts of plant invasion on atmospheric conditions, a study conducted at [[Stony Brook University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] shows that kudzu has increased the concentration of atmospheric [[NOx]] in the eastern United States, which causes a 2 [[Parts-per notation|ppb]] increase in [[tropospheric ozone]] during high temperature events in addition to [[soil acidification]], [[Podzol|aluminum mobilization]], and leaching of [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) into aquatic [[ecosystem]]s.<ref name=Hickman />\n\nOnce established in a habitat, kudzu is able to grow very quickly. The vine has a growth rate of 0.3 m (1 foot) every day. The maximum length the vine can reach is 30 m (98 feet).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Amstutz|first=Lisa J|title=Invasive Species|publisher=Abdo Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781532110245|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=46 - 48}}</ref> Kudzu is also able to allocate large portions of [[carbon]] to root growth, allowing it to acquire sufficient nutrients for rapid growth and to spread [[Clonal colony|clonally]].  Primary kudzu roots can weigh over 180&nbsp;kg, grow to 18&nbsp;cm in diameter, and penetrate soil at a rate of 3&nbsp;cm in depth per day.  Kudzu can also root wherever stems make contact with soil, allowing vines to grow in all directions.  Once rooted, most stems lose connection with each other within one year, allowing each stem to become a physiologically independent individual, and requiring that all stems be treated or removed in order to eliminate a population.<ref name=Forseth />\n\nIn addition to its abilities to obtain nutrients and spread quickly, kudzu leaves have [[Heliotropism|paraheliotropic]] movements, meaning that they move in response to the movement of the sun in order to maximize [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic productivity]].<ref name=Forseth />  Kudzu is also a \"structural [[Parasitism|parasite]]\", meaning that, rather than supporting itself, it grows on top of other plants and buildings to reach light.  Its ability to reproduce and spread quickly allows it to quickly cover shrubs, trees, and forests, where it blocks the sun's rays from the plants below it, decreasing or completely eliminating their photosynthetic productivity.<ref name=Forseth />\n\n===Economic and cultural impact===\nThe [[Invasive species#Economic|economic impact]] of kudzu in the United States is estimated at $100 million to $500 million lost per year in [[Primary production|forest productivity]].<ref name=Forseth />  In addition, it takes about $5,000 per hectare (2.5 acres) per year to control kudzu.<ref name=Forseth />  Power companies must spend about $1.5 million per year to repair damage to power lines.<ref name=Forseth />\n\nKudzu management is of great concern in the management of [[National Park Service|national parks]] in the southeast such as [[Vicksburg National Military Park]], [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]], and [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. In Vicksburg, kudzu has invaded 190 of the 2,000 total acres of the park and threatens to diminish the historical value of the park.<ref name=Blaustein />\n\n==Control and removal methods==\nThere are several methods for controlling kudzu growth that are used in the [[Southeastern United States]].  These include mechanical, chemical, and biological methods. Control of the vine is difficult because kudzu propagates through runners, rhizomes, nodes on vines, and seeds. Leftover root fragments from lawnmowers can also take root and become established. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Mechanical===\nMost mechanical means of kudzu removal practiced in the southeastern United States involve mowing the vine or cutting it back. These methods, though more effective than [[herbicide]]s, are more time-consuming.<ref name=McGroarty /> Vines must be mowed down just above ground level every month or two during the growing season in order to prevent them from growing back. When using this method of kudzu control, all of the plant material must be removed and/or destroyed (burned or fed to cattle) to prevent the vines from taking root and re-growing.<ref name=McGroarty /> Another method of mechanical removal is to [[Kudzu#Control|remove the crown]] of the plant. This part must also be destroyed to prevent re-implantation.<ref name=MDC />\n\n===Chemical===\nA different and less time-consuming option for the control of kudzu is treatment with herbicides. Some common herbicides used are [[picloram]] and [[triclopyr]]; the most effective are picloram and [[tebuthiuron]].<ref name=Harrington /> However, chemical treatments are expensive, and killing off the plant completely requires large amounts of herbicides (40-80 gallons per acre).<ref name=MDC /> Herbicides are found to be most effective when they are used during the typical growing season, June\u2013October, and when used for successive years. One case study saw a significant decrease in the growth of kudzu after just two years, whereas another study required the use of the herbicide for up to ten years.<ref name=Forseth /><ref name=Miller>Miller, James H., and Ronald E. True.\"Herbicide Tests for Kudzu Eradication.\" ''Georgia Forestry Commission'', Vol. 65, 1986.</ref>\n\nAnother form of chemical removal other than herbicides is [[soil solarization]]. Soil solarization is a thermal (heat) method that utilizes [[solar energy|solar-enhanced]] heating of the soil to kill the root system of the plant, thereby avoiding the use of [[pesticide]]s and other more dangerous (fire-based) means to control the plant.<ref name=Adams>Adams, Nicole E., et al. \"Effects of Kudzu (''Pueraria Montanta'') Solarization on the Chemistry of an Upper Piedmont South Carolina Soil\" ''Soil Science'', Vol. 175, 61-71. 2010.</ref>  Soil solarization affects the [[micronutrient]]s and [[Nutrient|macronutrients]] in the soil. The most prominent effect of this method of control is the increase in [[potassium]]. The higher level of potassium in all soils undergoing solarization demonstrates the successful release of K from decomposing kudzu plant tissues. Such a rise in potassium levels by solarization is important for soils in the Southeastern United States that tend to be highly weathered and generally have low potassium contents.<ref name=Adams />\n\n===Biological===\nAs chemical treatments are often ineffective for long term control and mechanical removal is likewise difficult and costly for long-term control, kudzu makes a good candidate for [[biological pest control]].<ref name=Frye /> There are several biological means that are already in place and more that may be implemented to control the growth of kudzu. [[Blight|Bacterial blights]], insect [[Herbivore|herbivory]], and insect seed [[predation]] occur in high levels in field populations of kudzu.<ref name=Forseth />  Seed predation is quite prevalent, with up to 81% of seeds incurring damage in populations studied in North Carolina. A different survey found twenty-five different species of insect feeding on the kudzu.<ref name=Forseth /> From this survey, several leaf-feeding beetles and sawflies that have no other known hosts were identified.<ref name=Forseth />  A separate study also found two weevils that attacked the stems of kudzu and eight beetles that complete larval development in the kudzu roots.<ref name=Forseth /> When evaluations of potential control agents are made, the range of the control agents must be taken into account. Organisms that feed on kudzu will often feed on similar non-target species that are important in agriculture, such as soybeans and [[Amphicarpaea bracteata|hog-peanuts]]. Potential control agents have to be rejected if they are shown in laboratory and field tests to feed on these non-target plants.<ref name=Frye />\n\nOf the diseases that have been identified as potential biological control agents, the fungal pathogen ''[[Myrothecium verrucaria]]'' has been shown to be very promising. Disease development is very high at around 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, which matches field conditions. In addition, the fungus does not spread outside of areas where it is applied. However, one major drawback of this biological control agent is that it is highly toxic to mammals, so extreme care would have to be taken in handling this organism.<ref name=Forseth /> Other pathogens have been tested as potential biological control agents, but have proven to be ineffective.<ref name=Forseth />\n\n=== Animals ===\nCurrently, grazing by goats and pigs is the best method for control of the vine. <ref name=\":0\" /> Another way to control kudzu is goats and sheep. A small herd can reduce an acre (0.4 ha) of kudzu every day.{{Citation needed|reason=use of \"most efficient\" implies that there is data to support this; also - need data to support the acre per day claim|date=June 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Environmental issues in the United States]]\n*[[Invasive species in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/profile/kudzu Kudzu] at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] National Invasive Species Information Center\n\n[[Category:Invasive plant species in the United States]]\n[[Category:Pueraria]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Kudzu on trees in Atlanta, Georgia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Kudzu smothering trees in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].]]\n[[File:Kudzu graveyard (40580p).jpg|thumb|300px|An woodland area of Queens, New York, blanketed by kudzu]]\n[[Kudzu]] is an [[Invasive species|invasive plant species]] in the [[United States]].

By the early 20th century, southerners began to use kudzu for purposes other than ornamentation and so kudzu began to come closer in contact with the land which, in turn, encouraged its spread throughout the southeast.<ref name=Blaustein>Blaustein, R.J.

Of these states, three in the southeast have the heaviest infestations: Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.<ref name=Blaustein />\n\n===Ecological relationships===\nKudzu kills or damages other plants by smothering them under a blanket of leaves, encompassing tree trunks, breaking branches, or even uprooting entire trees. Kudzu's ability to grow quickly, survive in areas of low nitrogen availability, and acquire resources quickly allows it to out-compete native species. Of the plants that can successfully compete  with kudzu, many are other invasive species such as the [[Ligustrum sinense|Chinese privet]] and the [[Lonicera japonica|Japanese honeysuckle]].<ref name=Blaustein /> In the southeast, the spread of kudzu is especially troublesome because of the high level of [[biodiversity]] in this region that is not found in other regions of the United States. Kudzu and other invasive weeds pose a significant threat to the biodiversity in the southeast. They reduce the environment to impoverished \"vine barrens\".<ref name=Blaustein /> The fast growth and high competitive ability is achieved through several key features of kudzu that are detailed below.\n\nKudzu is a very stress-tolerant plant. Kudzu is [[Drought tolerance|drought tolerant]] and only the above ground portions of the plant are damaged by frost.  Kudzu also forms [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with [[Diazotroph|nitrogen-fixing bacteria]] to convert [[Nitrogen|atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)]] into [[ammonium]] which can be used by surrounding plants.  Now the dominant nitrogen-fixing plant in the eastern United States, kudzu fixes an estimated 235&nbsp;kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, which is an order of magnitude higher than the rates of native species.<ref name=Hickman />   This ability allows it to flourish in nitrogen-poor sites where other plants are unable to grow.  In the absence of other plants, nitrogen then builds up in the soil, allowing the maintenance of large leaf areas and high [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic rates]].<ref name=Forseth />\n\nWhile little research has been conducted on the impacts of plant invasion on atmospheric conditions, a study conducted at [[Stony Brook University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] shows that kudzu has increased the concentration of atmospheric [[NOx]] in the eastern United States, which causes a 2 [[Parts-per notation|ppb]] increase in [[tropospheric ozone]] during high temperature events in addition to [[soil acidification]], [[Podzol|aluminum mobilization]], and leaching of [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) into aquatic [[ecosystem]]s.<ref name=Hickman />\n\nOnce established in a habitat, kudzu is able to grow very quickly. The vine has a growth rate of 0.3 m (1 foot) every day. The maximum length the vine can reach is 30 m (98 feet).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Amstutz|first=Lisa J|title=Invasive Species|publisher=Abdo Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781532110245|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=46 - 48}}</ref> Kudzu is also able to allocate large portions of [[carbon]] to root growth, allowing it to acquire sufficient nutrients for rapid growth and to spread [[Clonal colony|clonally]].  Primary kudzu roots can weigh over 180&nbsp;kg, grow to 18&nbsp;cm in diameter, and penetrate soil at a rate of 3&nbsp;cm in depth per day.  Kudzu can also root wherever stems make contact with soil, allowing vines to grow in all directions.  Once rooted, most stems lose connection with each other within one year, allowing each stem to become a physiologically independent individual, and requiring that all stems be treated or removed in order to eliminate a population.<ref name=Forseth />\n\nIn addition to its abilities to obtain nutrients and spread quickly, kudzu leaves have [[Heliotropism|paraheliotropic]] movements, meaning that they move in response to the movement of the sun in order to maximize [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic productivity]].<ref name=Forseth />  Kudzu is also a \"structural [[Parasitism|parasite]]\", meaning that, rather than supporting itself, it grows on top of other plants and buildings to reach light.  Its ability to reproduce and spread quickly allows it to quickly cover shrubs, trees, and forests, where it blocks the sun's rays from the plants below it, decreasing or completely eliminating their photosynthetic productivity.<ref name=Forseth />\n\n===Economic and cultural impact===\nThe [[Invasive species#Economic|economic impact]] of kudzu in the United States is estimated at $100 million to $500 million lost per year in [[Primary production|forest productivity]].<ref name=Forseth />  In addition, it takes about $5,000 per hectare (2.5 acres) per year to control kudzu.<ref name=Forseth />  Power companies must spend about $1.5 million per year to repair damage to power lines.<ref name=Forseth />\n\nKudzu management is of great concern in the management of [[National Park Service|national parks]] in the southeast such as [[Vicksburg National Military Park]], [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]], and [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. In Vicksburg, kudzu has invaded 190 of the 2,000 total acres of the park and threatens to diminish the historical value of the park.<ref name=Blaustein />\n\n==Control and removal methods==\nThere are several methods for controlling kudzu growth that are used in the [[Southeastern United States]].  These include mechanical, chemical, and biological methods. Control of the vine is difficult because kudzu propagates through runners, rhizomes, nodes on vines, and seeds. Leftover root fragments from lawnmowers can also take root and become established. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Mechanical===\nMost mechanical means of kudzu removal practiced in the southeastern United States involve mowing the vine or cutting it back. These methods, though more effective than [[herbicide]]s, are more time-consuming.<ref name=McGroarty /> Vines must be mowed down just above ground level every month or two during the growing season in order to prevent them from growing back. When using this method of kudzu control, all of the plant material must be removed and/or destroyed (burned or fed to cattle) to prevent the vines from taking root and re-growing.<ref name=McGroarty /> Another method of mechanical removal is to [[Kudzu#Control|remove the crown]] of the plant. This part must also be destroyed to prevent re-implantation.<ref name=MDC />\n\n===Chemical===\nA different and less time-consuming option for the control of kudzu is treatment with herbicides. Some common herbicides used are [[picloram]] and [[triclopyr]]; the most effective are picloram and [[tebuthiuron]].<ref name=Harrington /> However, chemical treatments are expensive, and killing off the plant completely requires large amounts of herbicides (40-80 gallons per acre).<ref name=MDC /> Herbicides are found to be most effective when they are used during the typical growing season, June\u2013October, and when used for successive years. One case study saw a significant decrease in the growth of kudzu after just two years, whereas another study required the use of the herbicide for up to ten years.<ref name=Forseth /><ref name=Miller>Miller, James H., and Ronald E. True.\"Herbicide Tests for Kudzu Eradication.\" ''Georgia Forestry Commission'', Vol. 65, 1986.</ref>\n\nAnother form of chemical removal other than herbicides is [[soil solarization]]. Soil solarization is a thermal (heat) method that utilizes [[solar energy|solar-enhanced]] heating of the soil to kill the root system of the plant, thereby avoiding the use of [[pesticide]]s and other more dangerous (fire-based) means to control the plant.<ref name=Adams>Adams, Nicole E., et al. \"Effects of Kudzu (''Pueraria Montanta'') Solarization on the Chemistry of an Upper Piedmont South Carolina Soil\" ''Soil Science'', Vol. 175, 61-71. 2010.</ref>  Soil solarization affects the [[micronutrient]]s and [[Nutrient|macronutrients]] in the soil. The most prominent effect of this method of control is the increase in [[potassium]]. The higher level of potassium in all soils undergoing solarization demonstrates the successful release of K from decomposing kudzu plant tissues. Such a rise in potassium levels by solarization is important for soils in the Southeastern United States that tend to be highly weathered and generally have low potassium contents.<ref name=Adams />\n\n===Biological===\nAs chemical treatments are often ineffective for long term control and mechanical removal is likewise difficult and costly for long-term control, kudzu makes a good candidate for [[biological pest control]].<ref name=Frye /> There are several biological means that are already in place and more that may be implemented to control the growth of kudzu. [[Blight|Bacterial blights]], insect [[Herbivore|herbivory]], and insect seed [[predation]] occur in high levels in field populations of kudzu.<ref name=Forseth />  Seed predation is quite prevalent, with up to 81% of seeds incurring damage in populations studied in North Carolina. A different survey found twenty-five different species of insect feeding on the kudzu.<ref name=Forseth /> From this survey, several leaf-feeding beetles and sawflies that have no other known hosts were identified.<ref name=Forseth />  A separate study also found two weevils that attacked the stems of kudzu and eight beetles that complete larval development in the kudzu roots.<ref name=Forseth /> When evaluations of potential control agents are made, the range of the control agents must be taken into account. Organisms that feed on kudzu will often feed on similar non-target species that are important in agriculture, such as soybeans and [[Amphicarpaea bracteata|hog-peanuts]]. Potential control agents have to be rejected if they are shown in laboratory and field tests to feed on these non-target plants.<ref name=Frye />\n\nOf the diseases that have been identified as potential biological control agents, the fungal pathogen ''[[Myrothecium verrucaria]]'' has been shown to be very promising. Disease development is very high at around 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, which matches field conditions. In addition, the fungus does not spread outside of areas where it is applied. However, one major drawback of this biological control agent is that it is highly toxic to mammals, so extreme care would have to be taken in handling this organism.<ref name=Forseth /> Other pathogens have been tested as potential biological control agents, but have proven to be ineffective.<ref name=Forseth />\n\n=== Animals ===\nCurrently, grazing by goats and pigs is the best method for control of the vine. <ref name=\":0\" /> Another way to control kudzu is goats and sheep. A small herd can reduce an acre (0.4 ha) of kudzu every day.{{Citation needed|reason=use of \"most efficient\" implies that there is data to support this; also - need data to support the acre per day claim|date=June 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Environmental issues in the United States]]\n*[[Invasive species in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/profile/kudzu Kudzu] at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] National Invasive Species Information Center\n\n[[Category:Invasive plant species in the United States]]\n[[Category:Pueraria]]\n", "name_user": "2605:6000:1805:d0ab:31aa:4db4:effe:5f10", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory and biology)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu_in_the_United_States"}

He followed his subpar 1965 season with what could arguably be his best season, leading the league in hits (167), doubles (31), total bases (272), OBP (.434), slugging (.571), and average (.351). He took home the Best Nine and was an All-Star for the 11th time, but the MVP award went to [[Katsuya Nomura]]. 1967 marked the last time he would lead in any major category, with 83 walks. 1968 would be the last time he would be an All-Star (his 12th time) or a Best Nine selection (his 9th, a record).

He followed his subpar 1965 season with what could arguably be his best season, leading the league in hits (167), doubles (31), total bases (272), OBP (.434), slugging (.571), and average (.351). He took home the Best Nine and was an All-Star for the 11th time, but the MVP award went to [[Katsuya Nomura]]. 1967 marked the last time he would lead in any major category, with 83 walks. 1968 would be the last time he would be an All-Star (his 12th time) or a Best Nine selection (his 9th, a record). On July 21, 1968, Enomoto would get his 2,000th hit, doubling off of Hall of Famer [[Keishi Suzuki]]. Aged 31 years and 7 months, he was the youngest player ever to reach the mark and the 3rd all-time.<ref name=\"jallen\"/> He set more records, including setting a streak of 1,516 error-free chances from 1967-1968, and a .999 fielding percentage at first in 1968.<ref name=\"brbullpen\"/> In 1969, he hit .273, which would increase to .284 in 1970. His last year as an Orion, 1971, saw him bat .244 in just 45 games. The Orions lost the Japan Series to the [[Yomiuri Giants]], leaving Enomoto without a Japan Series title.\n=== Nishitestu Lions ===\nEnomoto played his last professional season in 1972, with the [[Nishitetsu Lions]], where he would hit .233 in 61 games. He finished his career with a .298 average, 2,222 games played, 1,169 runs, 2,314 hits, 409 doubles, 246 home runs, 979 RBI, 153 steals in 237 tries and 1,062 walks to 645 strikeouts in 7,763 AB and 9,002 plate appearances.<ref name=\"brbullpen\"/>\n== Post-baseball ==\nDespite qualifying for the [[Meikyukai]], Enomoto never participated in their activities and is not deemed a member. [[Hiromitsu Ochiai]] is the only other player to turn down membership. He worked for a parking garage management company, where he wrote about baseball. he died of [[colon cancer]] in 2012.

The most common diminutive suffixes are  ''-ie'', ''-ock'', ''-ockie'' (double diminutive) or the Caithness ''\u2013ag'' (the latter from [[Scottish Gaelic]], and perhaps reinforcing the other two before it). ''-ie'' is by far the most common suffix used. Others are ''-le'' or ''-er'' for frequentative or diminutive emphasis. Less frequent diminutives are ''kin'' (often after the diminutive ''-ie'') and ''-lin''.\n\nExamples include\n*-{{Not a typo|ie}}: burnie (small [[burn (stream)|burn]]), feardie or feartie (frightened person, coward), gamie (gamekeeper), kiltie ([[kilt]]ed soldier), mannie (man), Nessie ([[Loch Ness Monster]]), postie (postman), wifie (woman)\n*-ock: bittock (wee bit, little bit), playock (toy), sourock ([[sorrel]]),\n*-ag: Cheordag ([[Geordie]]), bairnag (small child)\n*-ockie: hooseockie (little house), wifockie (little woman)\n*-le: crummle (a bread-crumb), snirtle (snigger, snort)\n*-er: plowter (dabble), stoiter (stumble)\n*-kin: cuitikins ([[Spats (footwear)|spatterdashes]]), flindrikin (light, flimsy), joskin ([[yokel]])\n*-lin: hauflin (half-grown boy), gorblin (unfledged bird)\n\n====Dutch====\nIn [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the diminutive is used extensively, have different meanings than size alone and is not merely restricted to nouns. It is the nuances of meaning expressed by the diminutive which make it peculiarly unique Dutch but also difficult to master for non-native speakers. It is a very productive,<ref>Bruce Donaldson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aFN9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA61#v=onepage&q&f=false Dutch: A Comprehensive Grammar]'', Routledge, 2008. {{ISBN|1134082363}}, 9781134082360, p.61</ref> can change the function of a word and are formed by adding one of the [[affix|suffixes]] '''-je''', '''-pje''', '''-kje''', '''-{{Not a typo|tje}}''', '''-etje''' to the word in question, depending on the latter's phonology:\n* '''-je''' for words ending in -b, -c, -d, -t, -f, -g, -ch, -k, -p, -v, -x, -z or -s: neef \u2192 neef'''je''' (''male cousin'', ''nephew''), lach \u2192 lach'''je''' (''laugh''), schaap \u2192 schaap'''je''' (''sheep'')\n* '''-pje''' for words ending in -m: boom (''tree'') \u2192 boom'''pje''' (but bloem'''etje''' if the meaning is ''bouquet of flowers''; see below)\n* '''-kje''' for words ending in -ing: koning (''king'') \u2192 konin'''kje''' (the 'ng'-sound transforms into 'nk'), but vondeling \u2192 vondeling'''etje''' (''foundling'')\n* '''-{{Not a typo|tje}}''' for words ending in -h, -j, -l, -n, -r, -w, or a vowel other than -y: zoen \u2192 zoen'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''kiss''), boei \u2192 boei'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''buoy''), appel \u2192 appel'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''apple''), ei \u2192 ei'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''egg''), keu \u2192 keu'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''billiard cue''). In case of a single open vowel, when adding \"-tje\" would change the pronunciation, this vowel is doubled: aut'''o''' \u2192 aut'''oo'''tje (''car''), caf'''\u00e9''' \u2192 caf'''ee'''tje (''pub'') (note the accent is lost because the 'ee' preserves the right pronunciation). The word jongen (''boy'') has an irregular diminutive, losing its ending '''-en''': jong'''en''' \u2192 jong'''etje'''\n*'''-\u2032{{Not a typo|tje}}''' for words ending in -y and for abbreviations: baby \u2192 baby'{{Not a typo|tje}}, cd \u2192 cd'tje, [[A4 paper|A4]] \u2192 A4'tje\n* '''-etje''' for words ending in -b, -l, -n, -ng or -r preceded by a \"short\" (lax) vowel: bal \u2192 ball'''etje''' (''ball''), kam \u2192 kamm'''etje''' (''comb''),  ding \u2192 ding'''etje''' (''thing''), kar \u2192 karr'''etje''' (''cart''). Note that except for the ending -ng the final consonant is doubled to preserve the vowel's shortness.\nA few words have several diminutives: kip \u2192 kipp'''etje''' or kip'''je''' (''chicken''), rib \u2192 ribb'''etje''' or rib'''je''' (''rib''). One word has even three possible diminutives: rad \u2192 rad'''je''', ra'''a'''d'''je''' or rad'''ertje''' (''cog''). A few words have more than one diminutive, of which one is formed by lengthening of the vowel sound with a different meaning. Examples: gat-gaatje/gatje, glas-glaasje/glasje, lot-lootje/lotje, pad-paadje/padje\n\nThe diminutive suffixes '''-ke(n)''' (from which the Western Dutch and later Standard Dutch form '''-tje''' has derived by [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]), '''-eke(n)''', '''-ske(n)''', '''-{{Not a typo|ie}}''', '''-kie''', and '''-pie''' are (still) regularly used in different dialects instead of the former mentioned. Some of these form part of expressions that became standard language:\n* Slapie: a buddy who one shares sleeping quarters with\n* Jonkie: a young one\n* Koppiekoppie: smart thinking\n* Koek en zopie: small food and drinks stall for ice skaters that springs up along frozen canals during winter\n* Makkie: easy job, piece of cake (From ge'''mak''' = ease.)\n* Manneke(n): little man, little fellow (from which the word [[mannequin]] was derived)\n* Bakkie: cup (of coffee), rig (radio transmitter), trailer\n\nThe form -ke(n) is nowadays still present in many women's names: Janneke (< Jan < Johannes, Dutch equivalent of John); Renske (< Rens, men's name); Marieke, Marijke, Mieke, Meike (all from Maria); Anneke (< Anna, Anne); Tineke (< Martine); Joke, Hanneke (< Johanna); and many others like Lieneke (<< Catharina, compare Caitlin), Lonneke, Wieteke, Dineke, Nelleke, etc. Similar women\u2019s names, such as Femke and Sjouke, exist in [[West Frisian language|Frisian]].<ref>http://www.friesenamen.nl/meisjesnamen</ref> Until the early twentieth century the diminutive was a normal way (in the Netherlands, not in Belgium) of forming men's names into women's names: Dirk \u2192 Dirkje, Pieter \u2192 Pietertje.\n\nIn Dutch, the diminutive is not merely restricted to nouns, but the diminutive form is a noun in some cases. Note that adverbs get an extra s appended to the diminutive:\n* adjectives: groen (''green'') \u2192 groen'''tje''' (lit. \"little green\" meaning ''rookie'') adjective \u2192 noun\n* adverbs: even (''just'') \u2192 even'''tjes''' (\"just a minute\"); net (''neat'') \u2192 net'''jes''' (''properly''); zacht (''soft'') \u2192 zacht'''jes''' (''gently'', ''slowly'')\n* numerals: een-twee'''tje''' (numeral ''one-two'' \u2192 with diminutive ''one-two pass'') numeral \u2192 noun; wij drie'''tjes''' (numeral ''three'' \u2192 with diminutive ''the three of us'')\n* personal pronouns: onderons'''je''' (pronoun ''us'' \u2192 with diminutive ''t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate'')\n* prepositions: omm'''etje''' (preposition ''around'' \u2192 with diminutive ''around the block'') preposition \u2192 noun; uit'''je''' (preposition ''out'' \u2192 with diminutive ''field trip'', ''picnic'') preposition \u2192 noun\n* verbs: moet'''je''' (verb ''to must'', ''to need'' \u2192 with diminutive ''shotgun marriage'') verb \u2192 noun\n\nSome nouns have two different diminutives, each with a different meaning:\n* bloem (''flower'') \u2192 bloem'''pje''' (lit. \"small flower\") This is the regularly formed diminutive.\n* bloem (''flower'') \u2192 bloem'''etje''' (lit. also \"small flower\", but meaning ''[[flower bouquet|bouquet]]''), as it did in the song 'Dat verdient een bloemetje' that came up with this wrongful diminutive because it fitted the music better.{{citation needed|date=August 2015|reason=According to my Dutch informants the word 'bloemetje' and its variant 'blommetje' were in common use long before the eighties campaign on whose slogan that song was based, also in compounds like 'bloemetjesjurk', 'bloemetjesbehang' and the expression 'de bloemetjes buiten zetten'}}\n* popje (''doll'') \u2192 pop'''je''' (lit. \"small doll\", but it is also a term of endearment).\n* poppetje (''doll'') \u2192 popp'''etje''' (lit. also \"small doll\" but it means also  \"human figure\" or a \"fragile girl\")\n\nA few words exist solely in a diminutive form, e.g. zeepaardje (''[[seahorse]]'') and sneeuwklokje (''[[Galanthus|Snowdrop]]''), while others, e.g. meisje (''girl''), originally a diminutive of meid (''maid''), have acquired a meaning independent of their non-diminutive forms. [[:nl:wikt:Categorie:Zelfstandig verkleinwoord|See other examples.]]\n\nA diminutive can also sometimes be added to an uncountable noun to refer to a single portion: ijs (''ice'', ''ice cream'') \u2192 ijsje (''ice cream treat'', ''cone of ice cream''), bier (''beer'') \u2192 biertje, cola \u2192 colaatje.\n\nWhen used, the diminutive has mostly a neutral or positive connotation:\n*Na een uur'''tje''' gekletst te hebben met haar vriend ging het meisje naar huis.\n:''After chatting with her boyfriend for a \"little\" hour, the girl went home.''\n\nThe diminutive can, however, also be used pejoratively.\n*Hij was vanavond weer echt het \"'mannetje'\".\n:\"He acted as if he was the \"little\" man of the evening.\"\n\nBesides the above, Dutch also has the now no longer productive diminutive ''-lijn'' (similar to the German diminutive ''-lein''), which is preserved in several words like for example ''vendelijn'' \"small flag\", ''Duimelijn'' \"Little Thumbling\", ''vogelijn'' \"little bird\" and ''lievelijn'' \"sweetie\".\n\nThe [[grammatical gender]] of words in the diminutive is always neuter, regardless of the original gender of the words.\n\n====Afrikaans====\nIn [[Afrikaans]], the diminutive is formed by adding one of the [[affix|suffixes]] '''-{{Not a typo|ie}}., -pie, -kie, -'tjie, -tjie, -jie, -etjie''' to the word, depending on the latter's phonology (some exceptions exist to these rules):\n* '''-{{Not a typo|ie}}''' for words ending in -f, -g, -k, -p or -s: [[:af:Neef|neef]] \u2192 nef'''ie''' (''male cousin''), lag \u2192 lagg'''ie''' (''laugh''), skaap \u2192 skap'''ie''' (''sheep'')\n* '''-pie''' for words ending in -m: [[:af:Boom|boom]] (''tree'') \u2192 boom'''pie''' (little tree)\n* '''-kie''' for words ending in -ing: [[:af:Koning|koning]] (''king'') \u2192 konin'''kie''' (little king)\n*'''-\u2032tjie''' for words ending in -i, -o, or -u (usually borrowed from other languages): [[:af:Impi|impi]] \u2192 impi'''\u2032tjie'''\n* '''-jie''' for words ending in -d or -t: [[:af:Hoed|hoed]] (hat) \u2192 hoed'''jie''' (little hat)\n* '''-etjie''' for [[Syllable#Components|CVC]] words ending in -b, -l, -m, -n or -r, and requires the last consonant to be doubled if it follows a short vowel: [[:af:Rob|rob]] (seal) \u2192 robb'''etjie''', bal (ball) \u2192 bal'''letjie''', kam (comb) \u2192 kamm'''etjie''', kar (car) \u2192 karr'''etjie'''\n* '''-tjie''' for other words ending in -l, -n, -r or a vowel: soen \u2192 soen'''tjie''' (kiss), [[:af:Bees|koei]] (cow) \u2192 koei'''tjie''', [[:af:Appel|appel]] (apple) \u2192 appel'''tjie''', beker (cup) \u2192 beker'''tjie''', baba (baby) \u2192 baba'''tjie'''\n\nDiminutives of words that are themselves diminutives are used, for example [[:af:Baadjie|baadjie]] (jacket) \u2192 ''baadjie'''tjie''''' (little jacket). Such constructions do not appear in Dutch.\n\nAfrikaans has almost identical usage and grammar for diminutive words as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the language Afrikaans was derived from (detailed above). There are differences in Dutch as compared to Afrikaans. One is that suffixes end with -je (e.g. beet'''je''', a [little] bit, mand'''je''', basket) as compared, i.e. in Afrikaans (e.g. bietj'''ie''', mandj'''ie'''\u2014same meanings respectively). This reflects the usage, i.e. in the dialects of the province of Holland that most of Dutch settlers came from. An other difference is that in the Dutch language also adjectives and adverbs can be conjugated as diminutives as if they were nouns. Diminutives are widely used in both languages, but possibly more so in the Afrikaans language.\n\nIn some cases the diminutive in Afrikaans is the most commonly used, or even only form of the word: bietjie (few/little), mandjie (basket), baadjie (jacket) and boontjie (bean). In other cases the diminutive may be used figuratively rather than literally to imply affection, camaraderie, [[euphemism]], sarcasm, or disdain, depending on context.\n\n\n====(High) German====\n[[German language|German]] features words such as \"H\u00e4uschen\" for \"small house\", \"W\u00fcrstchen\" for \"small sausage\" and \"H\u00fcndchen\" for \"small dog\".  Diminutives are more frequently used than in English. Some words only exist in the diminutive form, e.g. \"Kaninchen\" (\"rabbit\") derived from Old French word ''conin'', which in turn is from the Latin diminutive ''cuniculus''.  The use of diminutives is quite different between the dialects. The Alemannic dialects for example use the diminutive very often.\n\nThere are two suffixes that can be systematically applied in German:\n* ''-chen'', e.g. \"Br\u00f6tchen\" for bread roll (\"little bread\"; corresponding with English ''-kin'' as seen in \"napkin\", [[Low German]] (Low Saxon) ''-je'', ''-tje'', ''-ke'', ''-ken'' and other forms depending on the dialect area)\n* ''-lein'' e.g. \"M\u00e4nnlein\" for little man (corresponding with English ''-let'' and ''-ling'', Alemannic/Swabian/Swiss ''-l\u00e9'' (Spaetz''l\u00e9''), ''-li'' (H\u00f6rn''li''), [[Austrian Dialect|Bavarian and Austrian]] ''-l'', and [[Latin]] ''-culus'/''-cula'').\n\nThe contemporary colloquial diminutives -chen and -lein are always neuter in their [[grammatical gender]], regardless of the original word. For example, the common German word for ''girl'' is ''das M\u00e4dchen'', which is neuter because it is a diminutive of ''die Magd'' (feminine) \u2013 ''the maiden'' (Handmaid, maidservant, not: virgin).<ref>[[Elmar Seebold|Seebold, Elmar]]. 1999. ''Kluge Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache'', 23rd edition. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 530.</ref> While ''M\u00e4dchen'' is an everyday word, ''Magd'' is not common in modern use\u2014and in any meaning other than \"female farm employee\" it is associated with medieval language (as in fables, novels, etc.). However, ''-ling'' has a masculine gender. In the cases of \"Z\u00f6gling\", \"Setzling\", this form nominalizes a verb, as in, \"ziehen\" - \"Z\u00f6gling\", \"setzen\" - \"Setzling\".\nUse of these diminutive suffixes on a finally stressed [[word stem]] causes [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] of the stressed vowel.\n\n=====Austro-Bavarian=====\nIn [[Austro-Bavarian|Bavarian and Austrian German]], the ''-l'' or ''-erl'' suffix can replace almost any usual German diminutive. For example, the standard word for 'girl' in German is ''M\u00e4dchen'' and, while ''M\u00e4dchen'' is still used frequently in Austrian German, a more colloquial \"cute\" usage would be ''M\u00e4dl'', ''Madl'' or ''M\u00e4derl''. It is regular for Austrians to replace the normal ''Bisschen'' ('a little' as in \"Can I have a little more?\") with ''Bissel''. This has become a very [[distinctive feature]] of Austrian German. Contrary to the previous section, [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] are not used that frequently (Gurke - G\u00fcrkchen vs. Gurkerl).\n\nA familiar example of the ''-erl'' diminutive is ''Nannerl'', the childhood name of [[Maria Anna Mozart]], the sister of the celebrated composer. Historically, some common Austro-Bavarian surnames were also derived from (clipped) first names using the ''-l'' suffix; for example, ''(Jo)hann'' > ''H\u00e4ndl'', ''Man(fred)'' > ''M\u00e4ndl'' (both with [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''d'' and [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]), ''(Gott)fried'' > ''Friedl'', and so on.<ref>Schiffmann, Konrad. 1922. ''Das Land ob der Enns: eine altbaierische Landschaft in den Namen ihrer Siedlungen; Berg, Fl\u00fcsse und Seen.'' Munich: Oldenbourg, p. 133.</ref><ref>Schmeller, Johann Andreas. 1872\u20131877. ''Bayerisches W\u00f6rterbuch.'' Munich: Oldenbourg, p. 1738.</ref>\n\n=====Swabian=====\nIn [[Swabian German]] this is done by adding a -le suffix (the e being distinctly pronounced, but not stressed). For example, a small house would be a \"H\u00e4usle\" or a little girl a \"M\u00e4dle\".  A unique feature of Swabian is that words other than nouns may be suffixed with -le, which is not the case with other [[German dialects]] (except Bernese Swiss German), High German, or other languages: ''wasele'' (diminutive of ''was'', ''what'') or ''jetzetle'' (diminutive of ''jetzt'', ''now'') or ''kommele'' (diminutive of ''kommen'', ''come''). (In both Spanish and Italian, these may be formed similarly, e.g. ''igualito'' \u2013 diminutive of ''igual'', ''same'' and ''pochino'' or ''pochettino'' - diminutive of ''poco'', a little/a few). Many variants of Swabian also have a plural diminutive suffix: -la. E.g.: \"oi M\u00e4dle, zwoi M\u00e4dla.\"\n\n=====High Alemannic=====\nIn [[High Alemannic]] the standard suffix -li is added to the root word. A little would be ''\u00e4s bitzli'' (literally a little bite) as to \"ein bisschen\" in Standard German. The diminutive form of ''bitzli'' is ''birebitzli''.\n\nVowels of proper names often turn into an umlaut in Highest Alemannic, whereas in High Alemannic it remains the same.\nProper names: Christian becomes Chrigi, in Highest Alemannic: Chrigu. Sebastien becomes Sebi resp. Sebu. Sabrina becomes Sabsi resp. Sab\u00e4. Corinne becomes Cogi resp. Cor\u00e4. Barbara becomes Babsi resp. Babs\u00e4, Robert becomes R\u00f6bi resp. R\u00f6bu. Jakob becomes K\u00f6bi resp. K\u00f6bu. Gabriel becomes G\u00e4bu in Highest Alemannic.\n\n====Low German====\nIn varieties of [[West Low German]], spoken in the east of the Netherlands, diminutives occasionally use the [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] in combination with the suffixes -gie(n):\n* man \u2192 m\u0101nnegie ([[English language|EN]]: man \u2192 little man)\n* kom \u2192 k\u014dmmegie (EN: bowl \u2192 little bowl)\n\nIn [[East Frisian Low Saxon]], -je, -tje, and -pje are used as a diminutive suffix (e.g. ''huis'' becomes ''huisje'' (little house); ''boom'' becomes ''boompje'' (little tree)). Compare this with the [[German language|High German]] suffix -chen (see above). Some words have a slightly different suffix, even though the diminutive always ends with -je. For example, ''man'' becomes ''mannetje'' (little man). All these suffixes East Frisian Low Saxon shares with Dutch.\n\nIn [[Northern Low Saxon]], the -''je'' diminutive is rarely used, except maybe [[Gronings]], such as in  ''Buscherumpje'', a fisherman's shirt. It is usually substituted with ''l\u00fctte'', meaning \"little\", as in ''dat l\u00fctte Huus''- the small house. The same goes for the [[North Germanic languages]].\n\nHistorically, some common Low German surnames were derived from (clipped) first names using the ''-ke(n)'' suffix; for example, ''Ludwig'' > ''L\u00fcdeke'', ''Wilhelm'' > ''Wilke(n)'', ''Wernher'' >  ''Werneke'', and so on.<ref>Hirt, Herman. 1968. ''Etymologie der neuhochdeutschen Sprache''. Munich: C. H. Beck, p. 365.</ref> Some of these name bases are difficult to recognize in comparison to standard German; for example, ''Dumke, Domke'' < ''D\u00f6m'' 'Thomas',<ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=domke \"Domke,\" in Hanks, Patrick, ed. 2003. ''Dictionary of American Family Names''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=dumke \"Domke,\" in Hanks, Patrick, ed. 2003. ''Dictionary of American Family Names''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.]</ref> ''Klitzke'' < ''Klitz'' 'Clement',<ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=klitz \"Klitz,\" in Hanks, Patrick, ed. 2003. ''Dictionary of American Family Names''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=klitzke \"Klitzke,\" in Hanks, Patrick, ed. 2003. ''Dictionary of American Family Names''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.]</ref> etc. Some of these names may also have Slavic or mixed Slavic-Germanic origins.<ref>Gahlow, Hans. 1982. ''Pommersche Familiennamen: ihr Geschichts- und Heimatwert''. Neustadt/Aisch: Degener, pp. 33, 34, 52.</ref><!--This seems to be wrong information, since \"Domke\" is a Silesian name derived from early Slavic origins.  The \"ke\" ending is a Slavic variation of \"ski,\" as in Polish/Russian \"Tomsky\", English \"Thomson.\"  A comparable Pomeranian ending is \"eke.\"-->\n\n====Yiddish====\n[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] frequently uses diminutives. In Yiddish the primary diminutive is ''-l'' or ''-ele'' in singular, and ''-lekh'' or ''-elekh'' in plural, sometimes involving a vowel trade in the root. Thus Volf becomes Velvl, Khaim: Khaiml, mame (mother): mamele, Khane: Khanele, Moyshe: Moyshele, kind (child): kindl or kindele, Bobe (grandmother): Bobele, teyl (deal): teylekhl (mote), regn (rain): regndl, hant (hand): hentl, fus (foot): fisl. The longer version of the suffix (''-ele'' instead of ''-l'') sounds generally more affectionate and usually used with proper names. Sometimes a few variations of the plural diminutive forms are possible: balebos (owner, boss): balebeslekh (newly-wed young men): balebatimlekh (petty bourgeois men).\n\nMany other diminutives of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin are commonly used, mostly with proper names:\n*-ke: Khaim/Khaimke ,Mordkhe/Motke, Sore/Sorke, Khaye/Khayke, Avrom/Avromke, bruder/bruderke (brother). These forms are usually considered nicknames and are only used with very close friends and relatives.\n*-[e]nyu: kale/kalenyu (dear bride), harts/hartsenyu (sweetheart), zeyde/zeydenyu (dear grandpa). Often used as an affectionate quasi-[[vocative]].\n*-tshik: Avrom/Avromtshik, yungerman/yungermantshik (young man).\n*-inke: tate/tatinke (dear daddy), baleboste/balebostinke (dear hostess).\n*-ik: Shmuel/Shmulik, Yisroel/Srolik.\n*-tse or -tshe: Sore/Sortshe, Avrom/Avromtshe, Itsik/Itshe.\n*-(e)shi: bobe/bobeshi (dear grandma), zun/zuneshi (dear son), tate/tateshi (dear daddy).\n*-lebn: tate-lebn, Malke-lebn. This particle might be considered a distinct [[compound (linguistics)|compound word]], and not a suffix.\n\nThese suffixes can also be combined: Khaim/Khaimkele, Avrom/Avromtshikl, Itsik/Itshenyu.\n\nSome Yiddish proper names have common non-trivial diminutive forms, somewhat similar to English names such as Bob or Wendy: Akive/Kive, Yishaye/Shaye, Rivke/Rivele.\n\nYiddish also has diminutive forms of adjectives (all the following examples are given in masculine single form):\n*-lekh (-like): roytlekher (reddish), gelblekher (yellowish), zislekher (sweetish).\n*-ink (-ling): roytinker (cute red), gelinker (cute yellow), zisinker (so-sweet).\n*-tshik or -itshk: kleynitshker (teeny-tiney), altitshker (dear old).\n\nSome Yiddish diminutives have been incorporated into modern [[Israel]]i [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: Imma (mother) to Immaleh and Abba (father) to Abbaleh.\n\n====Icelandic====\nA common diminutive suffix in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] is ''-lingur'':\n\nExamples:\n* gr\u00eds (pig) \u2192 gr\u00eds'''lingur''' (piglet)\n* b\u00f3k (book) \u2192 b\u00e6k'''lingur''' (pamphlet/booklet)\n* jeppi (jeep) \u2192 jepp'''lingur''' (SUV)\n\n====Swedish====\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] use of diminutive is heavily dominated by prefixes such as \"mini-\", \"lill-\", \"sm\u00e5-\" and \"pytte-\" and all of these prefixes can be put in front of almost all nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs:\n:'''sm\u00e5'''sur (a bit angry)\n:'''pytte'''liten (tiny)\n:'''lill'''gammal (young-old, about young people who act as adults)\n:'''mini'''lektion (short lession)\n:'''sm\u00e5'''jogga (jog nonchalantly or slowly)\n:'''mini'''gitarr (small guitar)\n\nThe suffixes \"-ling\" and \"-ing\" are also used to some extent:\n\n:and (duck) -> \u00e4l'''ling''' (duckling)\n:kid (fawn) -> kil'''ling''' (goat kid)\n:g\u00e5s (goose) -> g\u00e4ss'''ling''' (gosling)\n:myndig (of age) -> mynd'''ling''' (person that is not of age, i.e. under 18)\n:halv (half) + v\u00e4xa (grow) -> halvv\u00e4x'''ing''' (semi-grown up boy)\n\nThe suffix \"-is\" can be used as a diminutive suffix to some extent but is often used as a slang prefix which is very colloquial.\n\n===Latin and Romance languages===\n\n====Latin====\nIn the [[Latin|Latin language]] the diminutive is formed also by suffixes of each gender affixed to the [[word stem]].  Each variant ending matches with a blend of the variant secondary demonstrative pronouns: In [[Old Latin]], ''ollus'', ''olla'', ''ollum''; later [[wikt\n*'''-ulus''', '''-ula''', '''-ulum''', e.g. ''glob'''ulus''''' (globule) from ''globus'' ([[globe]]).\n*'''-culus''', '''-cula''', '''-culum''', e.g. [[homunculus|''homun'''culus''''']] (so-small man) from ''homo'' (man)\n*'''-olus''', '''-ola''', '''-olum''', e.g. ''malle'''olus''''' (small hammer) from ''malleus'' (hammer)\n*'''-ellus''', '''-ella''', '''-ellum''', e.g. ''lib'''ellus'''''(little book) smaller than ''libr'''ulus''''' (small book) from ''liber'' (book)\n*'''-ittus''', '''-itta''', '''-ittum''' ([[hypocoristic]], a [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublet]] of ''-itus'')\n\nSimilarly, the diminutive of ''[[gladius]]'' ([[sword]]) is [[gladiolus|''gladi'''olus''''']], a [[plant]] whose [[leaves]] look like small swords.\n\n[[Adjectives]] as well as [[nouns]] can be diminished, including ''paul'''ulus''''' (very small) from ''paulus'' (small).\n\nThe diminutive ending for verbs is '''-ill-''', placed after the stem and before the endings. The diminutive verb changes to the [[Amo, amas, amat|first conjugation]], no matter what the original conjugation. ''Conscribere'' \"write onto\" is [[Latin conjugation#Third conjugation|third-conjugation]], but the diminutive ''conscrib'''ill'''are'' \"scribble over\" is first-conjugation.\n\nThe Anglicisation of Latin diminutives is relatively common, especially in [[medical terminology]]. In nouns, the most common conversion is removal of the ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' endings and trading them for a mum ''e''. Hence some examples are [[wikt:vacuole|vacuole]] from ''vacu'''olum''''', [[wikt:particle|particle]] from ''particula'', and [[wikt:globule|globule]] from ''glob'''ulus'''''.\n\n====French====\n[[French language|French]] diminutives can be formed with a wide range of endings. Often, a consonant or phoneme is placed between the [[root (linguistics)|root word]] and the diminutive ending for phonetic purposes:\n''porcelet'' < pourceau, from lat. porcellus.\n\n'''Feminine nouns or names''' are typically made diminutive by adding the ending '''-ette''': ''fillette'' (little girl or little daughter [affectionate], from ''fille'', girl or daughter); ''[[courgette]]'' (small squash or marrow, i.e., zucchini, from ''courge'', squash); Jeannette (from Jeanne); ''pommettes'' (cheekbones), from ''pomme'' (apple); ''cannette'' (female duckling), from ''cane'' (female duck). This ending has crossed over into English as well (e.g. kitchenette, Corvette, farmette). Feminine nouns may also end in '''-elle''' (''mademoiselle'', from ''madame'').\n\n'''Masculine names or nouns''' may be turned into diminutives with the ending '''-ot''', '''-on''', or '''-ou''' (MF '''-eau'''), but sometimes, for phonetic reasons, an additional consonant is added (e.g. ''-on'' becomes ''-ton'', ''-ou'' becomes ''-nou'', etc.): ''Jeannot'' (Jonny), from ''Jean'' (John); ''Pierrot'' (Petey) from ''Pierre'' (Peter); ''chiot'' (puppy), from ''chien'' (dog); ''fiston'' (sonny or sonny-boy), from ''fils'' (son); ''caneton'' (he-duckling), from ''canard'' (duck or he-duck); ''chaton'' (kitten), from ''chat'' (cat); ''minou'' (kitty, presumably from the root for ''miauler'', to meow); Didou (Didier); Philou or Filou (Philippe).\n\nSome masculine diminutives are formed with the masculine version of -ette: '''-et'''. For example: ''porcelet'', piglet, from ''porc''; ''oiselet'', fledgling, from ''oiseau'', bird. However, in many cases the names for baby animals are not diminutives\u2014that is, unlike ''chaton/chat'' or ''chiot/chien'', they are [[suppletion|not derived]] from the word for the adult animal: ''poulain'', foal (an adult horse is a ''cheval''); ''agneau'', lamb (an adult sheep is ''un mouton'' or either ''une brebis'', a female sheep, or ''un b\u00e9lier'', a male sheep). French is not unique in this, but it is indicated here to clarify that not all names of animals can be turned into diminutives by the addition of diminutive endings.\n\nIn [[Old French]], '''-et/-ette''', '''-in/-ine''', '''-el/-elle''' were often used, as ''Adeline'' for Adele, ''Maillet'' for Maill, and so on.  As well, the ending ''-on'' was used for both genders, as ''Alison'' and ''Guion'' from Alice and Guy respectively.  The Germanic side of [[Vulgar Latin]] bore proper diminutives [[wikt:-oc|'''-oc''']] and '''-uc''', which went into words such as the Latin ''pocca'' and ''pucca'', to become French ''poche'' (pouch); '''-oche''' is in regular use to shorten words: ''cin\u00e9ma'' \u2192 ''cinoche''.\n\n====Italian====\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the diminutive is expressed by several derivational [[suffix]]es, applied to nouns or adjectives to create new nouns or adjectives with variable meanings. The new word is then pluralized as a word in its own right. Such derived words often have no equivalent in other languages.\n*''-ello'', ''-ella'': ''finestra'' \u2192 ''finestrella'' (window \u2192 little window), ''campana'' \u2192 ''campanello'' (bell\u2192 little bell, also meaning [[handbell]], [[doorbell]] and [[bike bell]]) or \u2192 ''campanella'' (bell\u2192 little bell, also meaning [[school bell]]);\n*''-etto'', ''-etta'', the most used one along with ''-ino'': ''casa'' \u2192 ''casetta'' (house \u2192 little house), ''povero'' \u2192 ''poveretto'' (poor / unfortunate person \u2192poor little guy), ''cane'' \u2192 ''cagnetto'' (dog \u2192 little dog); may also be applied affectionately to names, usually female names: ''[[Laura (given name)|Laura]]'' \u2192 ''Lauretta'', ''Paola''\u2192 ''Paoletta'' \n*''-ino'', ''-ina'', the most used one along with ''-etto'': ''paese'' \u2192 ''paesino'' (village \u2192 little village); also in baby talk and after other suffixes: ''bello'' \u2192 ''bellino'' (pretty), ''gatto'' \u2192 ''gattino'' (kitten);\n*''-uccio'', ''-uccia'', similar to ''-ello/-ella'', ''-etto/-etta'' and ''-ino/-ino'', it is generally a loving, benign, cutesy, or affectionate diminutive suffix: ''tesoro''\u2192''tesoruccio'' (literally \"treasure,\" but used as an Italian [[term of endearment]] \u2192 little treasure), ''amore'' \u2192 ''amoruccio'' (''Amore'' literally means \"[[love]]\", but it is often used to affectionately address someone in same sense as [[Term of endearment|darling]] or other similar terms of endearment, just as \"love\" can be used as a term of endearment in English \u2192 little darling / little love); may also be applied affectionately to names: ''[[Michele]]''\u2192''Micheluccio'', ''[[Guido]]''\u2192 ''Guiduccio''. Like many diminutives, it may also be patronizing or pejorative if used in a certain context: ''medico''\u2192 ''medicuccio'' (medical doctor \u2192 literally, \"little doctor,\" used to call someone a [[quackery|quack]]), ''femmina'' \u2192 ''femminuccia'' ([[female]]\u2192literally, a \"little girl\", but colloquially refers to a weak, effeminate, effete, or cowardly male person). In [[Southern Italy]], especially [[Sicily]], this diminutive becomes ''-uzzo'' or ''-uzza''.\n*''-iccio'', ''-iccia''\n*''-icchio'', ''-icchia'', mainly of regional use, often pejorative: ''sole'' \u2192 ''solicchio'' (sun \u2192 weak sun);\n*''-otto'', ''-otta'', often attenuating: ''aquila'' \u2192 ''aquilotto'' (eagle \u2192 baby eagle), ''stupido'' \u2192 ''stupidotto'' (stupid  \u2192 rather stupid);\nDouble diminutives, with two diminutive suffixes rather than one, are also possible: ''casa'' \u2192 ''casetta'' \u2192 ''casettina'' (house \u2192 small house \u2192 very small house), ''giovane'' \u2192 ''giovanotto'' \u2192 ''giovanottino'' (something like a young man, a lad, a youngster, etc.).\n\nSuffixes ''-accio'', ''-accia'' (rarely ''-azzo'', ''-azza''), ''-astro'', ''-astra''<ref>Corresponding etymologically to the suffix ''-aster'', also sometimes used in English.</ref> and ''-ucolo'', ''-ucola'', also exist, but they are used to form [[pejorative]] words, with no diminutive meaning: ''tempo'' \u2192 ''tempaccio'' (weather \u2192 bad or foul weather), ''popolo''\u2192''popolaccio'' (people\u2192bad people, riffraff, dregs of society), ''amore''\u2192''amorazzo'' (love\u2192frivolous, short-term love story), ''giallo'' \u2192 ''giallastro'' (yellow \u2192 yellowish, sallow), ''poeta'' \u2192 ''poetucolo'' or ''poetastro'' (poet \u2192 rhymester, poetaster)\n\nSuch suffixes are of Latin origin, except ''-etto'' and ''-otto'', which are of unclear origin.<ref>Luca Serianni, ''Grammatica italiana'', UTET, 1989. XV.70-75.</ref>\n\nMoreover, some additional [[Hypocorism|hypocoristic]] suffixes are used to create new adjectives from other adjectives (or, sometimes, from nouns): ''-iccio'', ''-icciolo'', ''-igno'', ''-ognolo'', ''-''-occio'' (of Latin origin, except the last one, whose origin is unclear).<ref>Luca Serianni, ''Grammatica italiana'', UTET, 1989. XV.54.</ref>\n\n=====Italian loanwords=====\n\nExamples that made it into English are mostly [[culinary]], like [[spaghetti]] (plural diminutive of \"spago\", meaning \"thin string\" or \"twine\"), [[linguine]] (named for its resemblance to little [[tongue]]s (\"lingue\", in Italian)),  and [[bruschetta]].  The diminution is often figurative: an [[operetta]] is similar to an [[opera]], but dealing with less serious topics.  \"Signorina\" means \"[[Miss]]\"; with \"signorino\" ([[Master (form of address)|Master]]) they have the same meanings as ''se\u00f1orita'' and ''se\u00f1orito'' in Spanish.\n\n====Portuguese====\nIn [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], diminutives can be formed with a wide range of endings but the [[Inho|most common diminutives]] are formed with the suffixes ''-(z)inho'', ''-(z)inha'', replacing the masculine and feminine endings ''-o'' and ''-a'', respectively.  The variants ''-(z)ito'' and ''-(z)ita'', direct analogues of Spanish ''-(c)ito'' and ''-(c)ita'', are also common in some regions. The forms with a ''z'' are normally added to words that end in stressed vowels, such as ''caf\u00e9'' \u2192 ''cafezinho''. Some nouns have slightly irregular diminutives.\n\nNoun diminutives are widely used in the vernacular. Occasionally, this process is extended to [[pronoun]]s (''[[wikt:pouco|pouco]]'', a little \u2192 ''pouquinho'' or ''poucochinho'', a very small amount), [[adjective]]s (e.g. ''bobo'' \u2192 ''bobinho'', meaning respectively \"silly\" and \"a bit silly\"; ''s\u00f3'' \u2192 ''sozinho'', both meaning \"alone\" or \"lonely\"), [[adverb]]s (''depressa'' \u2192 ''depressinha'', mean \"quickly\") and even [[verb]]s.\n\n====Galician====\nIn Galician, the suffix -i\u00f1o(a) is added to nouns and adjectives. It is occasionally added to [[adverbs]], in contrast with other Romance languages: ''amodi\u00f1o'', ''devagari\u00f1o'', ''engordi\u00f1o'' or the fossilized ''paseni\u00f1o'', all meaning \"slowly\".\n\n====Romanian====\n[[Romanian language|Romanian]] uses suffixes to create diminutives, most of these suffixes being of [[Latin]] origin.\nNot only names, but adjectives, adverbs and pronouns can have diminutives as well, as in Portuguese, Polish and Russian.\n\n'''Feminine suffixes'''\n*-ea (ramur\u0103 / r\u0103murea = tree branch)\n*-ic\u0103 (bucat\u0103 / buc\u0103\u021bic\u0103 = piece)\n*-ioar\u0103 (inim\u0103 / inimioar\u0103 = heart)\n*-i\u0219oar\u0103 (\u021bar\u0103 / \u021b\u0103ri\u0219oar\u0103 = country)\n*-i\u021b\u0103 (fat\u0103 / feti\u021b\u0103 = girl)\n*-u\u0219c\u0103 (ra\u021b\u0103 / r\u0103\u021bu\u0219c\u0103 = duck)\n*-u\u021b\u0103 (bunic\u0103 / bunicu\u021b\u0103 = grandmother)\n\n'''Masculine suffixes'''\n*-a\u0219 (iepure / iepura\u0219 = rabbit)\n*-el (b\u0103iat / b\u0103ie\u021bel = boy)\n*-ic (tat\u0103 / t\u0103tic = father)\n*-ior (dulap / dul\u0103pior = locker)\n*-i\u0219or (pui / pui\u0219or = chicken)\n*-ule\u021b (urs / ursule\u021b = bear)\n*-u\u0219 (c\u0103\u021bel / c\u0103\u021belu\u0219 = dog)\n*-u\u021b (pat / p\u0103tu\u021b = bed)\n\n'''Adjectives'''\n*frumos > frumu\u0219el (beautiful ;

In addition to denoting small size and/or endearment, they may also function as amplificatives (augmentatives), pejoratives (deterioratives), and to give special meanings, depending on context.<ref>[http://www.lituanus.org/1974/74_3_05.htm Studies on word-formation in Lithuanian (1944-1974), Antanas Klimas, [[University of Rochester]]]</ref>  Lithuanian diminutives are especially prevalent in poetic language, such as [[Folk music|folk songs]].

The first suffix that can be added is '''-\u0447\u0435''', (-che). At this points the noun has become neuter, because of the -e ending. The '''-\u043d\u0446\u0435''', (-ntse) suffix can further extend the diminutive (It is still neuter, again due to the -e ending). A few examples:\n* kufar (suitcase) \u2192 kufarche \u2192 kufarchentse\n* nozh (knife) \u2192 nozhche \u2192 nozhchentse\n* stol (chair) \u2192 stolche \u2192 stolchentse\n\nFeminine nouns can have up to three different, independent forms (though some of them are used only in [[Colloquialism|colloquial speech]]):\n* zhena (woman) \u2192 zhenica \u2192 zhenichka\n* riba (fish) \u2192 ribka \u2192 ribchitsa\n* saksiya (flowerpot) \u2192 saksiyka \u2192 saksiychitsa\n* glava (head) \u2192 gl\u0430vitsa \u2192 glavichka\n\nNote, that the suffixes can be any of '''-\u043a\u0430''' (-ka), '''-\u0447\u043a\u0430''' (-chka), and '''-\u0446\u0430''' (-tsa).\n\nNeuter nouns usually have one diminutive variant, formed by adding variations of '''-\u0446\u0435''' (-tse):\n* dete (child) \u2192 detentse\n* zhito (wheat grain) \u2192 zhittse\n* sluntse (sun) \u2192 slunchitse\n\nAdjectives have forms for each grammatical gender and these forms have their corresponding diminutive variant. The used suffixes are '''-\u044a\u043a''' (-uk) for masculine, '''-\u043a\u0430''' (-ka) for feminine and '''-\u043a\u043e''' (-ko) for neuter:\n* maluk (small) \u2192 munichuk, malka \u2192 munichka, malko \u2192 munichko\n* golyam (big) \u2192 golemichuk, golyam\u0430 \u2192 golemichka, golyamo \u2192 golemichko\n\n====Czech====\nIn [[Czech language|Czech]] diminutives are formed by suffixes, as in other [[Slavic languages]]. Common endings include -'''ka, -ko, -ek, -\u00edk, -inka, -enka, -e\u010dka, -i\u010dka, -ul-, -unka, -\u00ed\u010dek, -\u00ednek''' etc. The choice of suffix may depend on the noun's gender as well as the degree of smallness/affection that the speaker wishes to convey.\n\nCzech diminutives can express smallness, affection, and familiarity. Hence, \"Pet\u0159\u00edk\" may well mean \"our\", \"cute\", \"little\" or \"beloved\" Peter. Some suffixes generally express stronger familiarity (or greater smallness) than others. The most common examples are the pairs '''-ek''' and '''-e\u010dek''' (\"domek\" \u2013 small house, \"dome\u010dek\" \u2013 very small house), and '''-\u00edk''' and '''-\u00ed\u010dek''' (\"Pet\u0159\u00edk\" \u2013 small or beloved Peter, \"Pet\u0159\u00ed\u010dek\" \u2013 very small or cute Peter), '''-ko''' and '''-e\u010dko''' (\"p\u00edrko\" \u2013 small feather, \"p\u00edre\u010dko\" \u2013 very small feather), and '''-ka''' and '''-i\u010dka'''/'''-e\u010dka''' (\"tlapka\" \u2013 small paw, \"tlapi\u010dka\" \u2013 very small paw; \"pe\u0159inka\" \u2013 small duvet, \"pe\u0159ine\u010dka\" \u2013 very small duvet). However, some words already have the same ending as if they were diminutives, but they aren't. In such cases, only one diminutive form is possible, e.g. \"ko\u010dka\" (notice the -ka ending) means \"cat\" (of normal size), \"ko\u010di\u010dka\" means \"small cat\".\n\nEvery noun has a grammatically-correct diminutive form, regardless of the sense it makes. This is sometimes used for comic effect, for example diminuting the word \"obr\" (giant) to \"ob\u0159\u00edk\" (little giant). Speakers also tend to use longer endings, which are not grammatically correct, to express even stronger form of familiarity or cuteness, for example \"mimine\u010d\u00ed\u010dko\" (very small and cute baby), instead of correct \"miminko\" and \"mimine\u010dko\". Such expressions are generally understood, but are used almost exclusively in emotive situations in spoken language and are only rarely written.\n\nSome examples. Note the various stem mutations due to palatalisation, vowel shortening or vowel lengthening:\n\n/'''-ka'''/ (mainly feminine noun forms)\n* t\u00e1ta (dad) \u2192 ta\u0165ka (daddy), Anna \u2192 Anka, Ivana \u2192 Ivanka, hora (mountain) \u2192 h\u016frka (a very small mountain or big hill), noha (leg, foot) \u2192 no\u017eka (a little leg, such as on a small animal)\n\n/'''-ko'''/ (neuter noun forms)\n* r\u00e1dio \u2192 r\u00e1dijko, v\u00edno (wine) \u2192 v\u00ednko, triko (T-shirt) \u2192 tri\u010dko, pero (feather) \u2192 p\u00edrko, oko (eye) \u2192 o\u010dko\n\n/'''-ek'''/ (masculine noun forms)\n* d\u016fm (house) \u2192 domek, st\u016fl (table) \u2192 stolek, schod (stair/step) \u2192 sch\u016fdek, prostor (space) \u2192 prost\u016frek, strom (tree) \u2192 stromek\n\n/'''-\u00edk'''/\n* Tom (Tom) \u2192 Tom\u00edk (little/cute/beloved Tom = Tommy), pokoj (room) \u2192 pokoj\u00edk, k\u016fl (stake/pole) \u2192 kol\u00edk, rum (rum) \u2192 rum\u00edk, ko\u0161 (basket) \u2192 ko\u0161\u00edk\n\n====Polish====\nIn [[Polish language|Polish]] diminutives can be formed of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and some other parts of speech. They literally signify physical smallness or lack of maturity, but usually convey attitude, in most cases affection. In some contexts, they may be condescending or ironic. Diminutives can cover a significant fraction of children's speech during the time of [[language acquisition]].<ref>Ewa Haman, EARLY PRODUCTIVITY IN DERIVATION. A CASE STUDY OF DIMINUTIVES IN THE ACQUISITION OF POLISH\", Psychology of Language and Communication 2003, Vol. 7, No. 1 [http://www.plc.psychologia.pl/plc/contents/fulltext/07-1_3.pdf (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304151259/http://www.plc.psychologia.pl/plc/contents/fulltext/07-1_3.pdf |date=2012-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nFor adjectives and adverbs, diminutives in Polish are grammatically separate from [[comparative]] forms.\n\nThere are multiple affixes used to create the diminutive. Some of them are '''-ka, -czka, -\u015bka, -szka, -cia, -sia, -unia, -enka, -lka''' for feminine nouns and '''-ek, -yk, -ciek, -czek, -czyk, -szek, -u\u0144, -u\u015b, -e\u0144ki, -lki''' for masculine words, and '''-czko, -ko''' for neuter nouns, among others.\n\nThe diminutive suffixes may be stacked to create forms going even further, for example, ''malusie\u0144ki'' is considered even smaller than ''malusi'' or ''male\u0144ki''. Similarly, ''koteczek'' (little kitty) is derived from ''kotek'' (kitty), which is itself derived from ''kot'' (cat). Note that in this case, the suffix ''-ek'' is used twice, but changes to ''ecz'' once due to [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].\n\nThere are also diminutives that lexicalized, e.g., ''sto\u0142ek'' (stool), which is grammatically a diminutive of ''st\u00f3\u0142'' (table).\n\nIn many cases, the possibilities for creation of diminutives are seemingly endless and leave place to create many [[neologism]]s.

For example, {{lang|ru|\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430}} (voda, water) becomes {{lang|ru|\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (vodichka, affectionate name of water), {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0442}} (kot, male cat) becomes  {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a}} (kotik, affectionate name), {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0430}} (koshka, female cat) becomes {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (koshechka, affectionate name), {{lang|ru|\u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435}} (solntse, sun) becomes {{lang|ru|\u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0448\u043a\u043e}} (solnyshko). Often there are many diminutive forms for one word: {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0430}} (mama, mom) becomes {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (mamochka, affectionate sense), {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f}} (mamulya, affectionate and playful sense), {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430}} (mamen'ka, affectionate and old-fashioned), {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044f}} (mamanya, affectionate but disdainful), - all of them have different hues of meaning, which are hard to understand for a foreigner, but are very perceptible for a native speaker. Sometimes you can combine several diminutive suffixes to make several degrees of diminution: {{lang|ru|\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0433}} ([[pirog]], a pie) becomes {{lang|ru|\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043e\u043a}} ([[pirozhok]], a small pie, or an affectionate name), which then may become {{lang|ru|\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a}} (pirozhochek, a very small pie, or an affectionate name). The same with {{lang|ru|\u0441\u044b\u0440}} (syr, cheese), {{lang|ru|\u0441\u044b\u0440\u043e\u043a}} (syrok, an affectionate name or a name of a small packed piece of cheese, see the third paragraph), {{lang|ru|\u0441\u044b\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a}} (syrochek, an affectionate name). In both cases the first suffix -\u043e\u043a changes \u043a to \u0447, when the suffix -\u0435\u043a is added.\n\nOften formative infixes and suffixes look like diminutive ones. The well-known word, {{lang|ru|\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430}} (vodka), has the suffix, \"-ka\", which is not a diminutive, but formative, the word has a different meaning (not water, but a drink) and has its own diminutive suffix -ochka: {{lang|ru|\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (vodochka) is an affectionate name of vodka (compare voda - vodichka). There are many examples of this kind: {{lang|ru|\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0430}} (sota, a honeycomb) and {{lang|ru|\u0441\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430}} (sotka, one hundred sqr. meter), {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430}} (truba, a tube) and {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0430}} (trubka, a special kind of a tube: telephone receiver, TV tube, tobacco pipe - in all these cases there is no diminutive sense). However, {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0430}} also means a small tube (depending on context). But most of the time you can tell diminutive particle from formative by simply omitting the suffix. If the meaning of a word remains, the suffix is diminutive. For example: {{lang|ru|\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (kuchka, a small pile) -> {{lang|ru|\u043a\u0443\u0447\u0430}} (kucha, a pile) - the general meaning remains, it is a diminutive form, but {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (tachka, wheelbarrow) -> {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0430\u0447\u0430}} (tacha, no such word) - the general meaning changes, it is not a diminutive form, {{lang|ru|\u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a}} (potolok, ceiling) -> {{lang|ru|\u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043b}} (potol, no such word) - the same with masculine gender.\n\nThere is one more peculiarity. For example, the word {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u044c}} (kon', a male horse) has a diminutive form {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0451\u043a}} (koniok). But {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0451\u043a}} (koniok) also means a skate (ice-skating, no diminutive sense in this case), and has another diminutive form {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0451\u0447\u0435\u043a}} (koniochek, a small skate). The word {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0451\u043a}} also means a gable with no diminutive sense.\n\nAdjectives and adverbs can also have diminutive forms with infix {{lang|ru|-\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a-}} (-en'k-): {{lang|ru|\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439}} (siniy, blue) becomes {{lang|ru|\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439}} (sinen'kiy), {{lang|ru|\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e}} (bystro, quickly) becomes {{lang|ru|\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e}} (bystren'ko). In case of adjectives the use of diminutive form is aimed to intensify the effect of diminutive form of a noun. Diminutive forms of adverbs are used to express either benevolence in the speech or on the contrary to express superciliousness, depending on the inflection of a whole phrase.\n\nSome diminutives of proper names, [[Hypocorism#Russian|among many others]]:\n\n'''Feminine'''\n* Anastasiya \u2192 Nastya (as in [[Nastya Liukin]]), Nasten'ka, Nastyona\n* Anna \u2192 Anya, An'ka, Anka, Anechka, Annushka, Anyuta, Nyura, Nyuta, Nyusha\n* Irina \u2192 Ira, Irka, Irinka, Irinushka, Irochka, Irisha\n* Natalya \u2192 Natasha, Natashka, Natashen'ka, Nata, Natalka\n* Tatyana \u2192 Tanya, Tan'ka, Tanechka, Tanyusha, Tata, Tanchik\n* Yelizaveta \u2192 Liza, Lizochka, Lizka, Lizon'ka, Lizaveta\n* Yekaterina \u2192 Katya, Katyusha, Katen'ka, Kat'ka, Katechka, Katerina\n* Yevgeniya \u2192 Zhenya, Zhen'ka, Zhenechka\n\n'''Masculine'''\n* Aleksander \u2192 [[Sasha (name)|Sasha]], Sashka, Sashen'ka, Sashechka, Sanya, Shura, Sashok, Shurik\n* Aleksey \u2192 Alyosha (as in [[Alyosha Popovich]]), Alyoshka, Alyoshen'ka, Lyosha, Lyoshka, Lyoshen'ka, Leksey\n* Andrej \u2192 Andryusha, Andryushka, Andryushechka, Dyusha, Andreika\n*Anton \u2192  Antosha, Antoshka, Tosha, Toshka\n* Dmitriy \u2192 Dima, Mitya, Dimka, Dimushka, Dimochka, Miten'ka, Dimok, Diman, Dimon, Mityai\n* Ivan \u2192 Vanya, Van'ka, Vanechka, Vanyusha, Vanyushka, Ivanushka\n* Mikhail \u2192 Misha, Mishka, Mishen'ka, Mishechka, Mishutka, Mikhei, Mikhailo\n* Pyotr \u2192 Petya, Pet'ka, Peten'ka, Petyunya\n* Sergej \u2192 Seryoga, Seryozha, Seryozhka, Seryozhen'ka, Seryi\n* Vladimir \u2192 Volodya, Voloden'ka, Vova, Vovka, Vovochka, Vovan, Vovchik\n\n===Celtic languages===\n\n====Irish====\nIn the [[Irish language]] diminutives are formed by adding ''-\u00edn'', and sometimes ''-\u00e1n.''\n\n* R\u00f3s (Rose) > R\u00f3is\u00edn (Rosalie, Rosaleen)\n* Se\u00e1n > Se\u00e1in\u00edn (Johnny)\n* S\u00e9amas > S\u00e9amais\u00edn, Jim\u00edn\n* P\u00e1draig > P\u00e1id\u00edn (Paddy)\n* b\u00f3thar (road) > b\u00f3ithr\u00edn (country lane)\n* cailleach (old woman, hag, witch) > cail\u00edn (girl) [origin of the name Colleen]  < Old Irish 'caille' < Latin 'pallium' = 'cloak'\n* fear (man) > fir\u00edn, also feair\u00edn, (little man)\n* teach, also tigh, (house) > tig\u00edn, also teaich\u00edn\n* cloch (stone) > cloich\u00edn (pebble)\n* sr\u00e1id (street) > sr\u00e1id\u00edn (lane, alleyway)\n* s\u00e9ip\u00e9al (chapel) > s\u00e9ip\u00e9il\u00edn (small chapel)\n\nThis suffix is also used to create the female equivalent of some male names:\n\n* P\u00e1draig > P\u00e1draig\u00edn (Patricia)\n* Gear\u00f3id (Gerald/Gerard) > Gear\u00f3id\u00edn (Geraldine)\n* P\u00f3l (Paul) > P\u00f3il\u00edn (Paula)\n\n''-\u00e1n'' as a diminutive suffix is much less frequent nowadays (though it was used extensively as such in Old Irish):\n\n* leabhar (book) > leabhr\u00e1n (booklet, manual, handbook)\n* cnoc (hill) > cnoc\u00e1n (hillock)\n\n====Scottish Gaelic====\n[[Scottish Gaelic]] has two inherited diminutive suffixes of which only one (''-(e)ag'') is considered productive.\n\n* -''(e)ag'', feminine: M\u00f2r (\"Sarah\") \u2192 M\u00f2rag, [[Loch Ness|Loch Nis]] (Loch Ness) \u2192 Niseag (\"[[Loch Ness Monster|Nessie]]\")\n* -''(e)an'', masculine: ''[[loch]]'' \u2192 ''lochan'', ''[[bodach]]'' (old man) \u2192 ''bodachan'' (mannikin)\n\n===Greek===\n\n====Ancient Greek====\nSeveral diminutive derivational suffixes existed in [[Ancient Greek]].

For example, the proper noun (name) Wickramananayaka can make the diminutive Wicky. Here, only the first syllable is what is focused on.

The single character or the second of the two characters can be doubled to make it sound cuter. Some given names, such as [[Sun Feifei (actress)|Sun Feifei]]'s, are already formed in this way. Throughout China, the single character or the second of the two characters can also be prefixed by \"Little\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f}}}}, ''xi\u01ceo'') or\u2014mostly in [[Northern and southern China|Southern China]]\u2014by \"Ah\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}, ''\u0101'') to produce an affectionate or derisive diminutive name. For example, [[Andy Lau]] ({{lang|zh|\u5289\u5fb7\u83ef}}, ''Li\u00fa D\u00e9hu\u00e1'') might be referred to as \"Little Wah\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f|\u83ef}}}}, ''Xi\u01ceohu\u00e1'') or \"Ah-Wah\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f|\u83ef}}}}, ''\u0100hu\u00e1'').\n\nIn [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], \"child\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4ed4}}}}, ''zai\u00b2'') is also used as a diminutive suffix.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9B4IgAACAAJ&dq=Chinese+jerry+norman 1].</ref> [[Andy Lau]]'s more common nickname in [[Hong Kong]] is \"Wah&nbsp;Zai\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u83ef|\u4ed4}}}}, ''Waa\u2074-zai\u00b2''). Cute suffixes in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] include \"-a\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u554a}}}}, ''a''<!--sic-->) and ''-ya'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5440}}}}, ''y\u0101'').\n\n==Turkic languages==\n\n===Turkish===\n:''See also [[Turkish grammar]]''\n\n[[Turkish language|Turkish]] diminutive suffixes are ''-cik'' and ''-ce\u011fiz'', and variants thereof as dictated by the [[Turkish phonology#Consonant assimilation|consonant assimilation]] and [[vowel harmony]] rules of Turkish grammar.\n\n''-cik'' is applied in cases of endearment and affection, in particular toward infants and young children by exaggerating qualities such as smallness and youth, whereas ''-ce\u011fiz'' is used in situations of compassion and empathy, especially when expressing sympathy toward another person in times of difficulty. Note the effects of [[vowel harmony]] in the following examples:\n\n*k\u00f6y (''village'')  \u2192  k\u00f6yce\u011fiz (''dear little village'', also [[K\u00f6yce\u011fiz|a place name]])\n*kad\u0131n (''woman'') \u2192 kad\u0131nca\u011f\u0131z (''poor dear woman'')\n*\u00e7ocuk (''child'')  \u2192  \u00e7ocuk\u00e7a\u011f\u0131z (''poor dear child'')\n*kedi (''cat'')  \u2192   kedicik (''cute little cat, kitten'')\n*k\u00f6pek (''dog'') \u2192 k\u00f6pecik (''cute little dog, puppy'')\n*kitap (''book'') kitap\u00e7\u0131k (''little book, pamphlet'')\n\nIt's not common, but some adjectives may also have diminutives.\n\n* k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck (''little'') \u2192 k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcc\u00fck (''tiny'')\n* s\u0131cak (''hot'') \u2192 s\u0131cac\u0131k (''cozy, warm'')\n* \u00e7abucak (''quickly'') \u2192 \u00e7abucac\u0131k (''in no time'')\n\nThere are a few exceptions; g\u00fcl\u00fcc\u00fck (''giggle'') is derived from the verb g\u00fclmek (''to laugh''), but it's not considered a diminutive. \u00c7ocuk (''kid, child'') is not a diminutive, and it can't take a diminutive suffix. K\u0131l\u00e7\u0131k (''fish bone'') may look like a diminutive, but it's not related to k\u0131l (''body hair'') anyway. And k\u0131z\u0131lc\u0131k (''dogwood, dogberry'') is not a diminutive of k\u0131z\u0131l (''bright red''), and gelincik (''weasel'') is not a diminutive of gelin (''bride''). (''see also: [[Mehmet\u00e7ik]]'')\n\n==Uralic languages==\n\n===Estonian===\nThe diminutive suffix of Estonian is \"-kene\" in its long form, but can be shortened to \"-ke\". In all grammatical cases except for the nominative and partitive singular, the \"-ne\" ending becomes \"-se\". It is fully productive and can be used with every word. Some words, such as \"p\u00e4ike(ne)\" (sun), \"v\u00e4ike(ne)\" (little) or \"pisike(ne)\" (tiny), are diminutive in their basic form, the diminutive suffix cannot be removed from these words. The Estonian diminutive suffix can be used recursively - it can be attached to a word more than once. Forms such as \"pisikesekesekene\", having three diminutive suffixes, are grammatically legitimate. As is demonstrated by the example, in recursive usage all but the last diminutive \"-ne\" suffix become \"-se\" as in forms inflected by case.\n\n===Finnish===\nThe diminutive suffixes of Finnish \"-ke\", \"-kka\", and \"-nen\" are not universal, and cannot be used on every noun. The feature is common in Finnish [[surname]]s, f.e. 'Jokinen' could translate 'Streamling', but since this form is not used in speaking about streams, the surname could also mean 'lands by the stream' or 'lives by the stream'. Double diminutives also occur in certain words f.e. lapsu''ka''i''nen'' (child, not a baby anymore), lapso''nen'' (small child), lapsi (child).\n\nExamples:\n\n**''-ke'': ''haara'' (branch) \u2192 ''haara'''ke''''' (little branch), ''nimi'' (name) \u2192 ''nimi'''ke''''' (label, tag)\n**''-kka'': ''peni'' (dog (archaic)) \u2192 ''peni'''kka''''' (whelp, pup), ''nen\u00e4'' (nose) \u2192 ''nenu'''kka''''' (little nose)\n**''-nen'': ''lintu'' (bird) \u2192 ''lintu'''nen''''' (little bird), ''poika'' (boy, son) \u2192 ''poika'''nen''''' (little boy, animal offspring)\n\n===Hungarian===\nHungarian uses the suffixes ''-ka/ke'' and ''-cska/cske'' to form diminutive nouns. The suffixes ''-i'' and ''-csi'' may also be used with names. However, you traditionally cannot have the diminutive form of your name registered officially in Hungary (although a few of the most common diminutive forms have been registered as possible legal first names in the past years). Nouns formed this way are considered separate words (as all words that are formed using ''k\u00e9pz\u0151'' type suffixes). They may not even be grammatically related to the base word, only historically, whereas the relation has been long forgotten.\n\nSome examples:\n*Animals\n**''-us'': ''kutya'' \u2192 ''kuty'''us''''' (dog), ''cica'' \u2192 ''cic'''us''''' (cat)\n**''-ci'': ''medve'' \u2192 ''ma'''ci''''' (bear), ''borj\u00fa'' \u2192 ''bo'''ci''''' (calf), ''liba \u2192 libu'''ci''''' (goose)\n**''-ka/-ke: mad\u00e1r \u2192 mad\u00e1r'''ka''''' (bird), ''eg\u00e9r \u2192 eg\u00e9r'''ke''''' (mouse)\n**''-cska/-cske: hal \u2192 hala'''cska''''', ''m\u00e9h \u2192 m\u00e9he'''cske''''' (bee)\n*Names\n**''-i'': ''J\u00e1nos'' \u2192 ''Jan'''i''''', ''J\u00falia'' \u2192 ''Jul'''i''''', ''Kata'' \u2192 ''Kat'''i''''', ''M\u00e1ria'' \u2192 ''Mar'''i''''', ''S\u00e1ra'' \u2192 ''S\u00e1r'''i,''' Gerg\u0151/Gergely '''\u2192''' Ger'''i,''' Domo(n)kos \u2192 Dom'''i'''''\n**''-i-ka/ke'': ''J\u00e1nos'' \u2192 ''Jan'''ika''''', ''J\u00falia'' \u2192 ''Jul'''ika''''', ''M\u00e1ria'' \u2192 ''Mar'''ika,''' Ferenc \u2192 Fer'''ike''', Ter\u00e9z(ia) \u2192 Terike''\n**''-csi'': ''J\u00e1nos'' \u2192 ''Jan'''csi''''', ''J\u00falia'' \u2192 ''Jul'''csi''''', ''M\u00e1ria'' \u2192 ''Mar'''csi'''''\n**''-iska/-iske/-uska'': ''J\u00falia'' \u2192 ''Jul'''iska''''', ''M\u00e1ria'' \u2192 ''Mar'''iska''''', ''Ilona'' \u2192 ''Il'''uska'''''\n**''-us'': ''B\u00e9la'' \u2192 ''B\u00e9l'''us''', J\u00falia/Judit \u2192 Juc'''us'''''\n**''-ci'': ''L\u00e1szl\u00f3'' \u2192 ''La'''ci''''', ''J\u00falia/Judit'' \u2192 ''Ju'''ci''', Anna \u2192 An'''ci'''''\n**''-c\u00f3'': ''Ferenc'' \u2192 ''Fe'''c\u00f3''''', ''J\u00f3zsef'' \u2192 ''Jo'''c\u00f3'''''\n**-ca: ''Ilona'' \u2192 ''I'''ca''''', ''L\u00e1szl\u00f3'' \u2192 ''La'''ca'''''\n**''-tya'': ''P\u00e9ter'' \u2192 ''Pe'''tya''''', ''Zolt\u00e1n'' \u2192 ''Zo'''tya'''''\n**''-nyi'': ''S\u00e1ndor'' \u2192 ''Sa'''nyi''', M\u00e1ria \u2192 Ma'''nyi'''''\n\nNote that these are all special diminutive suffixes. The universal ''-ka/ke'' and ''-cska/cske'' can be used to create further diminutive forms, e.g. ''kutyus'''ka''''' (little doggy), ''cicus'''ka''''' (little kitty). Theoretically, more and more diminutive forms can be created this way, e.g. ''kutyusk\u00e1'''csk\u00e1cska''''' (little doggy-woggy-snoggy). Of course, this is not a common practice; the preferred translations are ''kutyuli'''mutyuli''''' (doggy-woggy) and ''cica'''mica''''' (kitty-witty).\n\n==Bantu languages==\n\n===Chichewa===\nChichewa noun class 12 and 13 contain diminutive prefixes. The prefixes are ''ka'' (12) for singular nouns and ''ti'' (13) for plural nouns. These classes do not contain any words as opposed to the [[augmentative]] marker, which is also a regular noun class containing nouns. \n* mwana (child) \u2192 '''ka'''mwana (little child)\n* ana (children) \u2192 '''ti'''ana (little children)\n\n===seSotho===\nIn the Sotho languages (South Sotho, Setswana, and Sesotho sa Lebowa), the diminunitive is formed with variants of the -ana suffix.\n* mo\u0161emane (boy) \u2192 '''mo\u0161emanyana''' (small boy)\n* koloi (car, wagon) \u2192 '''koloinyana''' (small car)\n* kolobe (pig) \u2192 '''kolobjana''' (piglet)\n\n==International auxiliary languages==\n\n===Esperanto===\n: ''See also [[Esperanto vocabulary#Word formation|Esperanto word formation]].''\nFor generic use (for living beings and inanimate objects), [[Esperanto]] has a single diminutive suffix, \"-et\".\n* domo (house) \u2192 dometo (cottage)\n* knabo (boy) \u2192 knabeto (little boy)\n* varma (warm) \u2192 varmeta (lukewarm)\n\nFor personal names and familial [[Style (manner of address)|forms of address]], the affixes \"-nj-\" and \"-\u0109j-\" are used, for females and males respectively. Unusually for Esperanto, the \"root\" is often shortened.\n* patrino (mother) \u2192 panjo (mum, mommy)\n* patro (father) \u2192 pa\u0109jo (dad(dy))\n* Aleksandra (Alexandra) \u2192 Alenjo (Sandra)\n* Aleksandro (Alexander) \u2192 Ale\u0109jo (Sandro)\n* Johano (John) \u2192 Jo\u0109jo (Johnny)\n* Maria (Mary) \u2192 Manjo\n* Sofia (Sophie) \u2192 Sonjo\n* Vilhelmo (William) \u2192 Vil\u0109jo (Bill(y), Will(y))\n\nWhereas languages such as Spanish may use the diminutive to denote offspring, as in \"perrito\" (pup), Esperanto has a dedicated and regular suffix, \"-id\" used for this purpose. Thus \"hundeto\" means \"little dog\" (such as a dog of a small breed), while \"hundido\" means a dog who is not yet fully grown.\n\n===Interlingua===\n:''See also [[Free word-building in Interlingua]].''\n[[Interlingua]] has a single diminutive suffix, -ett, for diminutives of all sorts.\n* Johannes (John) \u2192 Johannetto (Johnny)\n* camera (chamber, room) \u2192 cameretta (little room)\n* pullo (chicken) \u2192 pulletto (chick)\n\nUse of this suffix is flexible, and diminutives such as ''mama'' and ''papa'' may also be used.

The most common diminutive suffixes are  ''-ie'', ''-ock'', ''-ockie'' (double diminutive) or the Caithness ''\u2013ag'' (the latter from [[Scottish Gaelic]], and perhaps reinforcing the other two before it). ''-ie'' is by far the most common suffix used. Others are ''-le'' or ''-er'' for frequentative or diminutive emphasis. Less frequent diminutives are ''kin'' (often after the diminutive ''-ie'') and ''-lin''.\n\nExamples include\n*-{{Not a typo|ie}}: burnie (small [[burn (stream)|burn]]), feardie or feartie (frightened person, coward), gamie (gamekeeper), kiltie ([[kilt]]ed soldier), mannie (man), Nessie ([[Loch Ness Monster]]), postie (postman), wifie (woman)\n*-ock: bittock (wee bit, little bit), playock (toy), sourock ([[sorrel]]),\n*-ag: Cheordag ([[Geordie]]), bairnag (small child)\n*-ockie: hooseockie (little house), wifockie (little woman)\n*-le: crummle (a bread-crumb), snirtle (snigger, snort)\n*-er: plowter (dabble), stoiter (stumble)\n*-kin: cuitikins ([[Spats (footwear)|spatterdashes]]), flindrikin (light, flimsy), joskin ([[yokel]])\n*-lin: hauflin (half-grown boy), gorblin (unfledged bird)\n\n====Dutch====\nIn [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the diminutive is used extensively, have different meanings than size alone and is not merely restricted to nouns. It is the nuances of meaning expressed by the diminutive which make it peculiarly unique Dutch but also difficult to master for non-native speakers. It is a very productive,<ref>Bruce Donaldson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aFN9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA61#v=onepage&q&f=false Dutch: A Comprehensive Grammar]'', Routledge, 2008. {{ISBN|1134082363}}, 9781134082360, p.61</ref> can change the function of a word and are formed by adding one of the [[affix|suffixes]] '''-je''', '''-pje''', '''-kje''', '''-{{Not a typo|tje}}''', '''-etje''' to the word in question, depending on the latter's phonology:\n* '''-je''' for words ending in -b, -c, -d, -t, -f, -g, -ch, -k, -p, -v, -x, -z or -s: neef \u2192 neef'''je''' (''male cousin'', ''nephew''), lach \u2192 lach'''je''' (''laugh''), schaap \u2192 schaap'''je''' (''sheep'')\n* '''-pje''' for words ending in -m: boom (''tree'') \u2192 boom'''pje''' (but bloem'''etje''' if the meaning is ''bouquet of flowers''; see below)\n* '''-kje''' for words ending in -ing: koning (''king'') \u2192 konin'''kje''' (the 'ng'-sound transforms into 'nk'), but vondeling \u2192 vondeling'''etje''' (''foundling'')\n* '''-{{Not a typo|tje}}''' for words ending in -h, -j, -l, -n, -r, -w, or a vowel other than -y: zoen \u2192 zoen'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''kiss''), boei \u2192 boei'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''buoy''), appel \u2192 appel'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''apple''), ei \u2192 ei'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''egg''), keu \u2192 keu'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''billiard cue''). In case of a single open vowel, when adding \"-tje\" would change the pronunciation, this vowel is doubled: aut'''o''' \u2192 aut'''oo'''tje (''car''), caf'''\u00e9''' \u2192 caf'''ee'''tje (''pub'') (note the accent is lost because the 'ee' preserves the right pronunciation). The word jongen (''boy'') has an irregular diminutive, losing its ending '''-en''': jong'''en''' \u2192 jong'''etje'''\n*'''-\u2032{{Not a typo|tje}}''' for words ending in -y and for abbreviations: baby \u2192 baby'{{Not a typo|tje}}, cd \u2192 cd'tje, [[A4 paper|A4]] \u2192 A4'tje\n* '''-etje''' for words ending in -b, -l, -n, -ng or -r preceded by a \"short\" (lax) vowel: bal \u2192 ball'''etje''' (''ball''), kam \u2192 kamm'''etje''' (''comb''),  ding \u2192 ding'''etje''' (''thing''), kar \u2192 karr'''etje''' (''cart''). Note that except for the ending -ng the final consonant is doubled to preserve the vowel's shortness.\nA few words have several diminutives: kip \u2192 kipp'''etje''' or kip'''je''' (''chicken''), rib \u2192 ribb'''etje''' or rib'''je''' (''rib''). One word has even three possible diminutives: rad \u2192 rad'''je''', ra'''a'''d'''je''' or rad'''ertje''' (''cog''). A few words have more than one diminutive, of which one is formed by lengthening of the vowel sound with a different meaning. Examples: gat-gaatje/gatje, glas-glaasje/glasje, lot-lootje/lotje, pad-paadje/padje\n\nThe diminutive suffixes '''-ke(n)''' (from which the Western Dutch and later Standard Dutch form '''-tje''' has derived by [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]), '''-eke(n)''', '''-ske(n)''', '''-{{Not a typo|ie}}''', '''-kie''', and '''-pie''' are (still) regularly used in different dialects instead of the former mentioned. Some of these form part of expressions that became standard language:\n* Slapie: a buddy who one shares sleeping quarters with\n* Jonkie: a young one\n* Koppiekoppie: smart thinking\n* Koek en zopie: small food and drinks stall for ice skaters that springs up along frozen canals during winter\n* Makkie: easy job, piece of cake (From ge'''mak''' = ease.)\n* Manneke(n): little man, little fellow (from which the word [[mannequin]] was derived)\n* Bakkie: cup (of coffee), rig (radio transmitter), trailer\n\nThe form -ke(n) is nowadays still present in many women's names: Janneke (< Jan < Johannes, Dutch equivalent of John); Renske (< Rens, men's name); Marieke, Marijke, Mieke, Meike (all from Maria); Anneke (< Anna, Anne); Tineke (< Martine); Joke, Hanneke (< Johanna); and many others like Lieneke (<< Catharina, compare Caitlin), Lonneke, Wieteke, Dineke, Nelleke, etc. Similar women\u2019s names, such as Femke and Sjouke, exist in [[West Frisian language|Frisian]].<ref>http://www.friesenamen.nl/meisjesnamen</ref> Until the early twentieth century the diminutive was a normal way (in the Netherlands, not in Belgium) of forming men's names into women's names: Dirk \u2192 Dirkje, Pieter \u2192 Pietertje.\n\nIn Dutch, the diminutive is not merely restricted to nouns, but the diminutive form is a noun in some cases. Note that adverbs get an extra s appended to the diminutive:\n* adjectives: groen (''green'') \u2192 groen'''tje''' (lit. \"little green\" meaning ''rookie'') adjective \u2192 noun\n* adverbs: even (''just'') \u2192 even'''tjes''' (\"just a minute\"); net (''neat'') \u2192 net'''jes''' (''properly''); zacht (''soft'') \u2192 zacht'''jes''' (''gently'', ''slowly'')\n* numerals: een-twee'''tje''' (numeral ''one-two'' \u2192 with diminutive ''one-two pass'') numeral \u2192 noun; wij drie'''tjes''' (numeral ''three'' \u2192 with diminutive ''the three of us'')\n* personal pronouns: onderons'''je''' (pronoun ''us'' \u2192 with diminutive ''t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate'')\n* prepositions: omm'''etje''' (preposition ''around'' \u2192 with diminutive ''around the block'') preposition \u2192 noun; uit'''je''' (preposition ''out'' \u2192 with diminutive ''field trip'', ''picnic'') preposition \u2192 noun\n* verbs: moet'''je''' (verb ''to must'', ''to need'' \u2192 with diminutive ''shotgun marriage'') verb \u2192 noun\n\nSome nouns have two different diminutives, each with a different meaning:\n* bloem (''flower'') \u2192 bloem'''pje''' (lit. \"small flower\") This is the regularly formed diminutive.\n* bloem (''flower'') \u2192 bloem'''etje''' (lit. also \"small flower\", but meaning ''[[flower bouquet|bouquet]]''), as it did in the song 'Dat verdient een bloemetje' that came up with this wrongful diminutive because it fitted the music better.{{citation needed|date=August 2015|reason=According to my Dutch informants the word 'bloemetje' and its variant 'blommetje' were in common use long before the eighties campaign on whose slogan that song was based, also in compounds like 'bloemetjesjurk', 'bloemetjesbehang' and the expression 'de bloemetjes buiten zetten'}}\n* popje (''doll'') \u2192 pop'''je''' (lit. \"small doll\", but it is also a term of endearment).\n* poppetje (''doll'') \u2192 popp'''etje''' (lit. also \"small doll\" but it means also  \"human figure\" or a \"fragile girl\")\n\nA few words exist solely in a diminutive form, e.g. zeepaardje (''[[seahorse]]'') and sneeuwklokje (''[[Galanthus|Snowdrop]]''), while others, e.g. meisje (''girl''), originally a diminutive of meid (''maid''), have acquired a meaning independent of their non-diminutive forms. [[:nl:wikt:Categorie:Zelfstandig verkleinwoord|See other examples.]]\n\nA diminutive can also sometimes be added to an uncountable noun to refer to a single portion: ijs (''ice'', ''ice cream'') \u2192 ijsje (''ice cream treat'', ''cone of ice cream''), bier (''beer'') \u2192 biertje, cola \u2192 colaatje.\n\nWhen used, the diminutive has mostly a neutral or positive connotation:\n*Na een uur'''tje''' gekletst te hebben met haar vriend ging het meisje naar huis.\n:''After chatting with her boyfriend for a \"little\" hour, the girl went home.''\n\nThe diminutive can, however, also be used pejoratively.\n*Hij was vanavond weer echt het \"'mannetje'\".\n:\"He acted as if he was the \"little\" man of the evening.\"\n\nBesides the above, Dutch also has the now no longer productive diminutive ''-lijn'' (similar to the German diminutive ''-lein''), which is preserved in several words like for example ''vendelijn'' \"small flag\", ''Duimelijn'' \"Little Thumbling\", ''vogelijn'' \"little bird\" and ''lievelijn'' \"sweetie\".\n\nThe [[grammatical gender]] of words in the diminutive is always neuter, regardless of the original gender of the words.\n\n====Afrikaans====\nIn [[Afrikaans]], the diminutive is formed by adding one of the [[affix|suffixes]] '''-{{Not a typo|ie}}., -pie, -kie, -'tjie, -tjie, -jie, -etjie''' to the word, depending on the latter's phonology (some exceptions exist to these rules):\n* '''-{{Not a typo|ie}}''' for words ending in -f, -g, -k, -p or -s: [[:af:Neef|neef]] \u2192 nef'''ie''' (''male cousin''), lag \u2192 lagg'''ie''' (''laugh''), skaap \u2192 skap'''ie''' (''sheep'')\n* '''-pie''' for words ending in -m: [[:af:Boom|boom]] (''tree'') \u2192 boom'''pie''' (little tree)\n* '''-kie''' for words ending in -ing: [[:af:Koning|koning]] (''king'') \u2192 konin'''kie''' (little king)\n*'''-\u2032tjie''' for words ending in -i, -o, or -u (usually borrowed from other languages): [[:af:Impi|impi]] \u2192 impi'''\u2032tjie'''\n* '''-jie''' for words ending in -d or -t: [[:af:Hoed|hoed]] (hat) \u2192 hoed'''jie''' (little hat)\n* '''-etjie''' for [[Syllable#Components|CVC]] words ending in -b, -l, -m, -n or -r, and requires the last consonant to be doubled if it follows a short vowel: [[:af:Rob|rob]] (seal) \u2192 robb'''etjie''', bal (ball) \u2192 bal'''letjie''', kam (comb) \u2192 kamm'''etjie''', kar (car) \u2192 karr'''etjie'''\n* '''-tjie''' for other words ending in -l, -n, -r or a vowel: soen \u2192 soen'''tjie''' (kiss), [[:af:Bees|koei]] (cow) \u2192 koei'''tjie''', [[:af:Appel|appel]] (apple) \u2192 appel'''tjie''', beker (cup) \u2192 beker'''tjie''', baba (baby) \u2192 baba'''tjie'''\n\nDiminutives of words that are themselves diminutives are used, for example [[:af:Baadjie|baadjie]] (jacket) \u2192 ''baadjie'''tjie''''' (little jacket). Such constructions do not appear in Dutch.\n\nAfrikaans has almost identical usage and grammar for diminutive words as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the language Afrikaans was derived from (detailed above). There are differences in Dutch as compared to Afrikaans. One is that suffixes end with -je (e.g. beet'''je''', a [little] bit, mand'''je''', basket) as compared, i.e. in Afrikaans (e.g. bietj'''ie''', mandj'''ie'''\u2014same meanings respectively). This reflects the usage, i.e. in the dialects of the province of Holland that most of Dutch settlers came from. An other difference is that in the Dutch language also adjectives and adverbs can be conjugated as diminutives as if they were nouns. Diminutives are widely used in both languages, but possibly more so in the Afrikaans language.\n\nIn some cases the diminutive in Afrikaans is the most commonly used, or even only form of the word: bietjie (few/little), mandjie (basket), baadjie (jacket) and boontjie (bean). In other cases the diminutive may be used figuratively rather than literally to imply affection, camaraderie, [[euphemism]], sarcasm, or disdain, depending on context.\n\n\n====(High) German====\n[[German language|German]] features words such as \"H\u00e4uschen\" for \"small house\", \"W\u00fcrstchen\" for \"small sausage\" and \"H\u00fcndchen\" for \"small dog\".  Diminutives are more frequently used than in English. Some words only exist in the diminutive form, e.g. \"Kaninchen\" (\"rabbit\") derived from Old French word ''conin'', which in turn is from the Latin diminutive ''cuniculus''.  The use of diminutives is quite different between the dialects. The Alemannic dialects for example use the diminutive very often.\n\nThere are two suffixes that can be systematically applied in German:\n* ''-chen'', e.g. \"Br\u00f6tchen\" for bread roll (\"little bread\"; corresponding with English ''-kin'' as seen in \"napkin\", [[Low German]] (Low Saxon) ''-je'', ''-tje'', ''-ke'', ''-ken'' and other forms depending on the dialect area)\n* ''-lein'' e.g. \"M\u00e4nnlein\" for little man (corresponding with English ''-let'' and ''-ling'', Alemannic/Swabian/Swiss ''-l\u00e9'' (Spaetz''l\u00e9''), ''-li'' (H\u00f6rn''li''), [[Austrian Dialect|Bavarian and Austrian]] ''-l'', and [[Latin]] ''-culus'/''-cula'').\n\nThe contemporary colloquial diminutives -chen and -lein are always neuter in their [[grammatical gender]], regardless of the original word. For example, the common German word for ''girl'' is ''das M\u00e4dchen'', which is neuter because it is a diminutive of ''die Magd'' (feminine) \u2013 ''the maiden'' (Handmaid, maidservant, not: virgin).<ref>[[Elmar Seebold|Seebold, Elmar]]. 1999. ''Kluge Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache'', 23rd edition. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 530.</ref> While ''M\u00e4dchen'' is an everyday word, ''Magd'' is not common in modern use\u2014and in any meaning other than \"female farm employee\" it is associated with medieval language (as in fables, novels, etc.). However, ''-ling'' has a masculine gender. In the cases of \"Z\u00f6gling\", \"Setzling\", this form nominalizes a verb, as in, \"ziehen\" - \"Z\u00f6gling\", \"setzen\" - \"Setzling\".\nUse of these diminutive suffixes on a finally stressed [[word stem]] causes [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] of the stressed vowel.\n\n=====Austro-Bavarian=====\nIn [[Austro-Bavarian|Bavarian and Austrian German]], the ''-l'' or ''-erl'' suffix can replace almost any usual German diminutive. For example, the standard word for 'girl' in German is ''M\u00e4dchen'' and, while ''M\u00e4dchen'' is still used frequently in Austrian German, a more colloquial \"cute\" usage would be ''M\u00e4dl'', ''Madl'' or ''M\u00e4derl''. It is regular for Austrians to replace the normal ''Bisschen'' ('a little' as in \"Can I have a little more?\") with ''Bissel''. This has become a very [[distinctive feature]] of Austrian German. Contrary to the previous section, [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] are not used that frequently (Gurke - G\u00fcrkchen vs. Gurkerl).\n\nA familiar example of the ''-erl'' diminutive is ''Nannerl'', the childhood name of [[Maria Anna Mozart]], the sister of the celebrated composer. Historically, some common Austro-Bavarian surnames were also derived from (clipped) first names using the ''-l'' suffix; for example, ''(Jo)hann'' > ''H\u00e4ndl'', ''Man(fred)'' > ''M\u00e4ndl'' (both with [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''d'' and [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]), ''(Gott)fried'' > ''Friedl'', and so on.<ref>Schiffmann, Konrad. 1922. ''Das Land ob der Enns: eine altbaierische Landschaft in den Namen ihrer Siedlungen; Berg, Fl\u00fcsse und Seen.'' Munich: Oldenbourg, p. 133.</ref><ref>Schmeller, Johann Andreas. 1872\u20131877. ''Bayerisches W\u00f6rterbuch.'' Munich: Oldenbourg, p. 1738.</ref>\n\n=====Swabian=====\nIn [[Swabian German]] this is done by adding a -le suffix (the e being distinctly pronounced, but not stressed). For example, a small house would be a \"H\u00e4usle\" or a little girl a \"M\u00e4dle\".  A unique feature of Swabian is that words other than nouns may be suffixed with -le, which is not the case with other [[German dialects]] (except Bernese Swiss German), High German, or other languages: ''wasele'' (diminutive of ''was'', ''what'') or ''jetzetle'' (diminutive of ''jetzt'', ''now'') or ''kommele'' (diminutive of ''kommen'', ''come''). (In both Spanish and Italian, these may be formed similarly, e.g. ''igualito'' \u2013 diminutive of ''igual'', ''same'' and ''pochino'' or ''pochettino'' - diminutive of ''poco'', a little/a few). Many variants of Swabian also have a plural diminutive suffix: -la. E.g.: \"oi M\u00e4dle, zwoi M\u00e4dla.\"\n\n=====High Alemannic=====\nIn [[High Alemannic]] the standard suffix -li is added to the root word. A little would be ''\u00e4s bitzli'' (literally a little bite) as to \"ein bisschen\" in Standard German. The diminutive form of ''bitzli'' is ''birebitzli''.\n\nVowels of proper names often turn into an umlaut in Highest Alemannic, whereas in High Alemannic it remains the same.\nProper names: Christian becomes Chrigi, in Highest Alemannic: Chrigu. Sebastien becomes Sebi resp. Sebu. Sabrina becomes Sabsi resp. Sab\u00e4. Corinne becomes Cogi resp. Cor\u00e4. Barbara becomes Babsi resp. Babs\u00e4, Robert becomes R\u00f6bi resp. R\u00f6bu. Jakob becomes K\u00f6bi resp. K\u00f6bu. Gabriel becomes G\u00e4bu in Highest Alemannic.\n\n====Low German====\nIn varieties of [[West Low German]], spoken in the east of the Netherlands, diminutives occasionally use the [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] in combination with the suffixes -gie(n):\n* man \u2192 m\u0101nnegie ([[English language|EN]]: man \u2192 little man)\n* kom \u2192 k\u014dmmegie (EN: bowl \u2192 little bowl)\n\nIn [[East Frisian Low Saxon]], -je, -tje, and -pje are used as a diminutive suffix (e.g. ''huis'' becomes ''huisje'' (little house); ''boom'' becomes ''boompje'' (little tree)). Compare this with the [[German language|High German]] suffix -chen (see above). Some words have a slightly different suffix, even though the diminutive always ends with -je. For example, ''man'' becomes ''mannetje'' (little man). All these suffixes East Frisian Low Saxon shares with Dutch.\n\nIn [[Northern Low Saxon]], the -''je'' diminutive is rarely used, except maybe [[Gronings]], such as in  ''Buscherumpje'', a fisherman's shirt. It is usually substituted with ''l\u00fctte'', meaning \"little\", as in ''dat l\u00fctte Huus''- the small house. The same goes for the [[North Germanic languages]].\n\nHistorically, some common Low German surnames were derived from (clipped) first names using the ''-ke(n)'' suffix; for example, ''Ludwig'' > ''L\u00fcdeke'', ''Wilhelm'' > ''Wilke(n)'', ''Wernher'' >  ''Werneke'', and so on.<ref>Hirt, Herman. 1968. ''Etymologie der neuhochdeutschen Sprache''. Munich: C. H. Beck, p. 365.</ref> Some of these name bases are difficult to recognize in comparison to standard German; for example, ''Dumke, Domke'' < ''D\u00f6m'' 'Thomas',<ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=domke \"Domke,\" in Hanks, Patrick, ed. 2003. ''Dictionary of American Family Names''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=dumke \"Domke,\" in Hanks, Patrick, ed. 2003. ''Dictionary of American Family Names''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.]</ref> ''Klitzke'' < ''Klitz'' 'Clement',<ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=klitz \"Klitz,\" in Hanks, Patrick, ed. 2003. ''Dictionary of American Family Names''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=klitzke \"Klitzke,\" in Hanks, Patrick, ed. 2003. ''Dictionary of American Family Names''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.]</ref> etc. Some of these names may also have Slavic or mixed Slavic-Germanic origins.<ref>Gahlow, Hans. 1982. ''Pommersche Familiennamen: ihr Geschichts- und Heimatwert''. Neustadt/Aisch: Degener, pp. 33, 34, 52.</ref><!--This seems to be wrong information, since \"Domke\" is a Silesian name derived from early Slavic origins.  The \"ke\" ending is a Slavic variation of \"ski,\" as in Polish/Russian \"Tomsky\", English \"Thomson.\"  A comparable Pomeranian ending is \"eke.\"-->\n\n====Yiddish====\n[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] frequently uses diminutives. In Yiddish the primary diminutive is ''-l'' or ''-ele'' in singular, and ''-lekh'' or ''-elekh'' in plural, sometimes involving a vowel trade in the root. Thus Volf becomes Velvl, Khaim: Khaiml, mame (mother): mamele, Khane: Khanele, Moyshe: Moyshele, kind (child): kindl or kindele, Bobe (grandmother): Bobele, teyl (deal): teylekhl (mote), regn (rain): regndl, hant (hand): hentl, fus (foot): fisl. The longer version of the suffix (''-ele'' instead of ''-l'') sounds generally more affectionate and usually used with proper names. Sometimes a few variations of the plural diminutive forms are possible: balebos (owner, boss): balebeslekh (newly-wed young men): balebatimlekh (petty bourgeois men).\n\nMany other diminutives of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin are commonly used, mostly with proper names:\n*-ke: Khaim/Khaimke ,Mordkhe/Motke, Sore/Sorke, Khaye/Khayke, Avrom/Avromke, bruder/bruderke (brother). These forms are usually considered nicknames and are only used with very close friends and relatives.\n*-[e]nyu: kale/kalenyu (dear bride), harts/hartsenyu (sweetheart), zeyde/zeydenyu (dear grandpa). Often used as an affectionate quasi-[[vocative]].\n*-tshik: Avrom/Avromtshik, yungerman/yungermantshik (young man).\n*-inke: tate/tatinke (dear daddy), baleboste/balebostinke (dear hostess).\n*-ik: Shmuel/Shmulik, Yisroel/Srolik.\n*-tse or -tshe: Sore/Sortshe, Avrom/Avromtshe, Itsik/Itshe.\n*-(e)shi: bobe/bobeshi (dear grandma), zun/zuneshi (dear son), tate/tateshi (dear daddy).\n*-lebn: tate-lebn, Malke-lebn. This particle might be considered a distinct [[compound (linguistics)|compound word]], and not a suffix.\n\nThese suffixes can also be combined: Khaim/Khaimkele, Avrom/Avromtshikl, Itsik/Itshenyu.\n\nSome Yiddish proper names have common non-trivial diminutive forms, somewhat similar to English names such as Bob or Wendy: Akive/Kive, Yishaye/Shaye, Rivke/Rivele.\n\nYiddish also has diminutive forms of adjectives (all the following examples are given in masculine single form):\n*-lekh (-like): roytlekher (reddish), gelblekher (yellowish), zislekher (sweetish).\n*-ink (-ling): roytinker (cute red), gelinker (cute yellow), zisinker (so-sweet).\n*-tshik or -itshk: kleynitshker (teeny-tiney), altitshker (dear old).\n\nSome Yiddish diminutives have been incorporated into modern [[Israel]]i [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: Imma (mother) to Immaleh and Abba (father) to Abbaleh.\n\n====Icelandic====\nA common diminutive suffix in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] is ''-lingur'':\n\nExamples:\n* gr\u00eds (pig) \u2192 gr\u00eds'''lingur''' (piglet)\n* b\u00f3k (book) \u2192 b\u00e6k'''lingur''' (pamphlet/booklet)\n* jeppi (jeep) \u2192 jepp'''lingur''' (SUV)\n\n====Swedish====\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] use of diminutive is heavily dominated by prefixes such as \"mini-\", \"lill-\", \"sm\u00e5-\" and \"pytte-\" and all of these prefixes can be put in front of almost all nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs:\n:'''sm\u00e5'''sur (a bit angry)\n:'''pytte'''liten (tiny)\n:'''lill'''gammal (young-old, about young people who act as adults)\n:'''mini'''lektion (short lession)\n:'''sm\u00e5'''jogga (jog nonchalantly or slowly)\n:'''mini'''gitarr (small guitar)\n\nThe suffixes \"-ling\" and \"-ing\" are also used to some extent:\n\n:and (duck) -> \u00e4l'''ling''' (duckling)\n:kid (fawn) -> kil'''ling''' (goat kid)\n:g\u00e5s (goose) -> g\u00e4ss'''ling''' (gosling)\n:myndig (of age) -> mynd'''ling''' (person that is not of age, i.e. under 18)\n:halv (half) + v\u00e4xa (grow) -> halvv\u00e4x'''ing''' (semi-grown up boy)\n\nThe suffix \"-is\" can be used as a diminutive suffix to some extent but is often used as a slang prefix which is very colloquial.\n\n===Latin and Romance languages===\n\n====Latin====\nIn the [[Latin|Latin language]] the diminutive is formed also by suffixes of each gender affixed to the [[word stem]].  Each variant ending matches with a blend of the variant secondary demonstrative pronouns: In [[Old Latin]], ''ollus'', ''olla'', ''ollum''; later [[wikt\n*'''-ulus''', '''-ula''', '''-ulum''', e.g. ''glob'''ulus''''' (globule) from ''globus'' ([[globe]]).\n*'''-culus''', '''-cula''', '''-culum''', e.g. [[homunculus|''homun'''culus''''']] (so-small man) from ''homo'' (man)\n*'''-olus''', '''-ola''', '''-olum''', e.g. ''malle'''olus''''' (small hammer) from ''malleus'' (hammer)\n*'''-ellus''', '''-ella''', '''-ellum''', e.g. ''lib'''ellus'''''(little book) smaller than ''libr'''ulus''''' (small book) from ''liber'' (book)\n*'''-ittus''', '''-itta''', '''-ittum''' ([[hypocoristic]], a [[doublet]] of ''-itus'')\n\nSimilarly, the diminutive of ''[[gladius]]'' ([[sword]]) is [[gladiolus|''gladi'''olus''''']], a [[plant]] whose [[leaves]] look like small swords.\n\n[[Adjectives]] as well as [[nouns]] can be diminished, including ''paul'''ulus''''' (very small) from ''paulus'' (small).\n\nThe diminutive ending for verbs is '''-ill-''', placed after the stem and before the endings. The diminutive verb changes to the [[Amo, amas, amat|first conjugation]], no matter what the original conjugation. ''Conscribere'' \"write onto\" is [[Latin conjugation#Third conjugation|third-conjugation]], but the diminutive ''conscrib'''ill'''are'' \"scribble over\" is first-conjugation.\n\nThe Anglicisation of Latin diminutives is relatively common, especially in [[medical terminology]]. In nouns, the most common conversion is removal of the ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' endings and trading them for a mum ''e''. Hence some examples are [[wikt:vacuole|vacuole]] from ''vacu'''olum''''', [[wikt:particle|particle]] from ''particula'', and [[wikt:globule|globule]] from ''glob'''ulus'''''.\n\n====French====\n[[French language|French]] diminutives can be formed with a wide range of endings. Often, a consonant or phoneme is placed between the [[root (linguistics)|root word]] and the diminutive ending for phonetic purposes:\n''porcelet'' < pourceau, from lat. porcellus.\n\n'''Feminine nouns or names''' are typically made diminutive by adding the ending '''-ette''': ''fillette'' (little girl or little daughter [affectionate], from ''fille'', girl or daughter); ''[[courgette]]'' (small squash or marrow, i.e., zucchini, from ''courge'', squash); Jeannette (from Jeanne); ''pommettes'' (cheekbones), from ''pomme'' (apple); ''cannette'' (female duckling), from ''cane'' (female duck). This ending has crossed over into English as well (e.g. kitchenette, Corvette, farmette). Feminine nouns may also end in '''-elle''' (''mademoiselle'', from ''madame'').\n\n'''Masculine names or nouns''' may be turned into diminutives with the ending '''-ot''', '''-on''', or '''-ou''' (MF '''-eau'''), but sometimes, for phonetic reasons, an additional consonant is added (e.g. ''-on'' becomes ''-ton'', ''-ou'' becomes ''-nou'', etc.): ''Jeannot'' (Jonny), from ''Jean'' (John); ''Pierrot'' (Petey) from ''Pierre'' (Peter); ''chiot'' (puppy), from ''chien'' (dog); ''fiston'' (sonny or sonny-boy), from ''fils'' (son); ''caneton'' (he-duckling), from ''canard'' (duck or he-duck); ''chaton'' (kitten), from ''chat'' (cat); ''minou'' (kitty, presumably from the root for ''miauler'', to meow); Didou (Didier); Philou or Filou (Philippe).\n\nSome masculine diminutives are formed with the masculine version of -ette: '''-et'''. For example: ''porcelet'', piglet, from ''porc''; ''oiselet'', fledgling, from ''oiseau'', bird. However, in many cases the names for baby animals are not diminutives\u2014that is, unlike ''chaton/chat'' or ''chiot/chien'', they are [[suppletion|not derived]] from the word for the adult animal: ''poulain'', foal (an adult horse is a ''cheval''); ''agneau'', lamb (an adult sheep is ''un mouton'' or either ''une brebis'', a female sheep, or ''un b\u00e9lier'', a male sheep). French is not unique in this, but it is indicated here to clarify that not all names of animals can be turned into diminutives by the addition of diminutive endings.\n\nIn [[Old French]], '''-et/-ette''', '''-in/-ine''', '''-el/-elle''' were often used, as ''Adeline'' for Adele, ''Maillet'' for Maill, and so on.  As well, the ending ''-on'' was used for both genders, as ''Alison'' and ''Guion'' from Alice and Guy respectively.  The Germanic side of [[Vulgar Latin]] bore proper diminutives [[wikt:-oc|'''-oc''']] and '''-uc''', which went into words such as the Latin ''pocca'' and ''pucca'', to become French ''poche'' (pouch); '''-oche''' is in regular use to shorten words: ''cin\u00e9ma'' \u2192 ''cinoche''.\n\n====Italian====\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the diminutive is expressed by several derivational [[suffix]]es, applied to nouns or adjectives to create new nouns or adjectives with variable meanings. The new word is then pluralized as a word in its own right. Such derived words often have no equivalent in other languages.\n*''-ello'', ''-ella'': ''finestra'' \u2192 ''finestrella'' (window \u2192 little window), ''campana'' \u2192 ''campanello'' (bell\u2192 little bell, also meaning [[handbell]], [[doorbell]] and [[bike bell]]) or \u2192 ''campanella'' (bell\u2192 little bell, also meaning [[school bell]]);\n*''-etto'', ''-etta'', the most used one along with ''-ino'': ''casa'' \u2192 ''casetta'' (house \u2192 little house), ''povero'' \u2192 ''poveretto'' (poor / unfortunate person \u2192poor little guy), ''cane'' \u2192 ''cagnetto'' (dog \u2192 little dog); may also be applied affectionately to names, usually female names: ''[[Laura (given name)|Laura]]'' \u2192 ''Lauretta'', ''Paola''\u2192 ''Paoletta'' \n*''-ino'', ''-ina'', the most used one along with ''-etto'': ''paese'' \u2192 ''paesino'' (village \u2192 little village); also in baby talk and after other suffixes: ''bello'' \u2192 ''bellino'' (pretty), ''gatto'' \u2192 ''gattino'' (kitten);\n*''-uccio'', ''-uccia'', similar to ''-ello/-ella'', ''-etto/-etta'' and ''-ino/-ino'', it is generally a loving, benign, cutesy, or affectionate diminutive suffix: ''tesoro''\u2192''tesoruccio'' (literally \"treasure,\" but used as an Italian [[term of endearment]] \u2192 little treasure), ''amore'' \u2192 ''amoruccio'' (''Amore'' literally means \"[[love]]\", but it is often used to affectionately address someone in same sense as [[Term of endearment|darling]] or other similar terms of endearment, just as \"love\" can be used as a term of endearment in English \u2192 little darling / little love); may also be applied affectionately to names: ''[[Michele]]''\u2192''Micheluccio'', ''[[Guido]]''\u2192 ''Guiduccio''. Like many diminutives, it may also be patronizing or pejorative if used in a certain context: ''medico''\u2192 ''medicuccio'' (medical doctor \u2192 literally, \"little doctor,\" used to call someone a [[quackery|quack]]), ''femmina'' \u2192 ''femminuccia'' ([[female]]\u2192literally, a \"little girl\", but colloquially refers to a weak, effeminate, effete, or cowardly male person). In [[Southern Italy]], especially [[Sicily]], this diminutive becomes ''-uzzo'' or ''-uzza''.\n*''-iccio'', ''-iccia''\n*''-icchio'', ''-icchia'', mainly of regional use, often pejorative: ''sole'' \u2192 ''solicchio'' (sun \u2192 weak sun);\n*''-otto'', ''-otta'', often attenuating: ''aquila'' \u2192 ''aquilotto'' (eagle \u2192 baby eagle), ''stupido'' \u2192 ''stupidotto'' (stupid  \u2192 rather stupid);\nDouble diminutives, with two diminutive suffixes rather than one, are also possible: ''casa'' \u2192 ''casetta'' \u2192 ''casettina'' (house \u2192 small house \u2192 very small house), ''giovane'' \u2192 ''giovanotto'' \u2192 ''giovanottino'' (something like a young man, a lad, a youngster, etc.).\n\nSuffixes ''-accio'', ''-accia'' (rarely ''-azzo'', ''-azza''), ''-astro'', ''-astra''<ref>Corresponding etymologically to the suffix ''-aster'', also sometimes used in English.</ref> and ''-ucolo'', ''-ucola'', also exist, but they are used to form [[pejorative]] words, with no diminutive meaning: ''tempo'' \u2192 ''tempaccio'' (weather \u2192 bad or foul weather), ''popolo''\u2192''popolaccio'' (people\u2192bad people, riffraff, dregs of society), ''amore''\u2192''amorazzo'' (love\u2192frivolous, short-term love story), ''giallo'' \u2192 ''giallastro'' (yellow \u2192 yellowish, sallow), ''poeta'' \u2192 ''poetucolo'' or ''poetastro'' (poet \u2192 rhymester, poetaster)\n\nSuch suffixes are of Latin origin, except ''-etto'' and ''-otto'', which are of unclear origin.<ref>Luca Serianni, ''Grammatica italiana'', UTET, 1989. XV.70-75.</ref>\n\nMoreover, some additional [[Hypocorism|hypocoristic]] suffixes are used to create new adjectives from other adjectives (or, sometimes, from nouns): ''-iccio'', ''-icciolo'', ''-igno'', ''-ognolo'', ''-''-occio'' (of Latin origin, except the last one, whose origin is unclear).<ref>Luca Serianni, ''Grammatica italiana'', UTET, 1989. XV.54.</ref>\n\n=====Italian loanwords=====\n\nExamples that made it into English are mostly [[culinary]], like [[spaghetti]] (plural diminutive of \"spago\", meaning \"thin string\" or \"twine\"), [[linguine]] (named for its resemblance to little [[tongue]]s (\"lingue\", in Italian)),  and [[bruschetta]].  The diminution is often figurative: an [[operetta]] is similar to an [[opera]], but dealing with less serious topics.  \"Signorina\" means \"[[Miss]]\"; with \"signorino\" ([[Master (form of address)|Master]]) they have the same meanings as ''se\u00f1orita'' and ''se\u00f1orito'' in Spanish.\n\n====Portuguese====\nIn [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], diminutives can be formed with a wide range of endings but the [[Inho|most common diminutives]] are formed with the suffixes ''-(z)inho'', ''-(z)inha'', replacing the masculine and feminine endings ''-o'' and ''-a'', respectively.  The variants ''-(z)ito'' and ''-(z)ita'', direct analogues of Spanish ''-(c)ito'' and ''-(c)ita'', are also common in some regions. The forms with a ''z'' are normally added to words that end in stressed vowels, such as ''caf\u00e9'' \u2192 ''cafezinho''. Some nouns have slightly irregular diminutives.\n\nNoun diminutives are widely used in the vernacular. Occasionally, this process is extended to [[pronoun]]s (''[[wikt:pouco|pouco]]'', a little \u2192 ''pouquinho'' or ''poucochinho'', a very small amount), [[adjective]]s (e.g. ''bobo'' \u2192 ''bobinho'', meaning respectively \"silly\" and \"a bit silly\"; ''s\u00f3'' \u2192 ''sozinho'', both meaning \"alone\" or \"lonely\"), [[adverb]]s (''depressa'' \u2192 ''depressinha'', mean \"quickly\") and even [[verb]]s.\n\n====Galician====\nIn Galician, the suffix -i\u00f1o(a) is added to nouns and adjectives. It is occasionally added to [[adverbs]], in contrast with other Romance languages: ''amodi\u00f1o'', ''devagari\u00f1o'', ''engordi\u00f1o'' or the fossilized ''paseni\u00f1o'', all meaning \"slowly\".\n\n====Romanian====\n[[Romanian language|Romanian]] uses suffixes to create diminutives, most of these suffixes being of [[Latin]] origin.\nNot only names, but adjectives, adverbs and pronouns can have diminutives as well, as in Portuguese, Polish and Russian.\n\n'''Feminine suffixes'''\n*-ea (ramur\u0103 / r\u0103murea = tree branch)\n*-ic\u0103 (bucat\u0103 / buc\u0103\u021bic\u0103 = piece)\n*-ioar\u0103 (inim\u0103 / inimioar\u0103 = heart)\n*-i\u0219oar\u0103 (\u021bar\u0103 / \u021b\u0103ri\u0219oar\u0103 = country)\n*-i\u021b\u0103 (fat\u0103 / feti\u021b\u0103 = girl)\n*-u\u0219c\u0103 (ra\u021b\u0103 / r\u0103\u021bu\u0219c\u0103 = duck)\n*-u\u021b\u0103 (bunic\u0103 / bunicu\u021b\u0103 = grandmother)\n\n'''Masculine suffixes'''\n*-a\u0219 (iepure / iepura\u0219 = rabbit)\n*-el (b\u0103iat / b\u0103ie\u021bel = boy)\n*-ic (tat\u0103 / t\u0103tic = father)\n*-ior (dulap / dul\u0103pior = locker)\n*-i\u0219or (pui / pui\u0219or = chicken)\n*-ule\u021b (urs / ursule\u021b = bear)\n*-u\u0219 (c\u0103\u021bel / c\u0103\u021belu\u0219 = dog)\n*-u\u021b (pat / p\u0103tu\u021b = bed)\n\n'''Adjectives'''\n*frumos > frumu\u0219el (beautiful ;

In addition to denoting small size and/or endearment, they may also function as amplificatives (augmentatives), pejoratives (deterioratives), and to give special meanings, depending on context.<ref>[http://www.lituanus.org/1974/74_3_05.htm Studies on word-formation in Lithuanian (1944-1974), Antanas Klimas, [[University of Rochester]]]</ref>  Lithuanian diminutives are especially prevalent in poetic language, such as [[Folk music|folk songs]].

The first suffix that can be added is '''-\u0447\u0435''', (-che). At this points the noun has become neuter, because of the -e ending. The '''-\u043d\u0446\u0435''', (-ntse) suffix can further extend the diminutive (It is still neuter, again due to the -e ending). A few examples:\n* kufar (suitcase) \u2192 kufarche \u2192 kufarchentse\n* nozh (knife) \u2192 nozhche \u2192 nozhchentse\n* stol (chair) \u2192 stolche \u2192 stolchentse\n\nFeminine nouns can have up to three different, independent forms (though some of them are used only in [[Colloquialism|colloquial speech]]):\n* zhena (woman) \u2192 zhenica \u2192 zhenichka\n* riba (fish) \u2192 ribka \u2192 ribchitsa\n* saksiya (flowerpot) \u2192 saksiyka \u2192 saksiychitsa\n* glava (head) \u2192 gl\u0430vitsa \u2192 glavichka\n\nNote, that the suffixes can be any of '''-\u043a\u0430''' (-ka), '''-\u0447\u043a\u0430''' (-chka), and '''-\u0446\u0430''' (-tsa).\n\nNeuter nouns usually have one diminutive variant, formed by adding variations of '''-\u0446\u0435''' (-tse):\n* dete (child) \u2192 detentse\n* zhito (wheat grain) \u2192 zhittse\n* sluntse (sun) \u2192 slunchitse\n\nAdjectives have forms for each grammatical gender and these forms have their corresponding diminutive variant. The used suffixes are '''-\u044a\u043a''' (-uk) for masculine, '''-\u043a\u0430''' (-ka) for feminine and '''-\u043a\u043e''' (-ko) for neuter:\n* maluk (small) \u2192 munichuk, malka \u2192 munichka, malko \u2192 munichko\n* golyam (big) \u2192 golemichuk, golyam\u0430 \u2192 golemichka, golyamo \u2192 golemichko\n\n====Czech====\nIn [[Czech language|Czech]] diminutives are formed by suffixes, as in other [[Slavic languages]]. Common endings include -'''ka, -ko, -ek, -\u00edk, -inka, -enka, -e\u010dka, -i\u010dka, -ul-, -unka, -\u00ed\u010dek, -\u00ednek''' etc. The choice of suffix may depend on the noun's gender as well as the degree of smallness/affection that the speaker wishes to convey.\n\nCzech diminutives can express smallness, affection, and familiarity. Hence, \"Pet\u0159\u00edk\" may well mean \"our\", \"cute\", \"little\" or \"beloved\" Peter. Some suffixes generally express stronger familiarity (or greater smallness) than others. The most common examples are the pairs '''-ek''' and '''-e\u010dek''' (\"domek\" \u2013 small house, \"dome\u010dek\" \u2013 very small house), and '''-\u00edk''' and '''-\u00ed\u010dek''' (\"Pet\u0159\u00edk\" \u2013 small or beloved Peter, \"Pet\u0159\u00ed\u010dek\" \u2013 very small or cute Peter), '''-ko''' and '''-e\u010dko''' (\"p\u00edrko\" \u2013 small feather, \"p\u00edre\u010dko\" \u2013 very small feather), and '''-ka''' and '''-i\u010dka'''/'''-e\u010dka''' (\"tlapka\" \u2013 small paw, \"tlapi\u010dka\" \u2013 very small paw; \"pe\u0159inka\" \u2013 small duvet, \"pe\u0159ine\u010dka\" \u2013 very small duvet). However, some words already have the same ending as if they were diminutives, but they aren't. In such cases, only one diminutive form is possible, e.g. \"ko\u010dka\" (notice the -ka ending) means \"cat\" (of normal size), \"ko\u010di\u010dka\" means \"small cat\".\n\nEvery noun has a grammatically-correct diminutive form, regardless of the sense it makes. This is sometimes used for comic effect, for example diminuting the word \"obr\" (giant) to \"ob\u0159\u00edk\" (little giant). Speakers also tend to use longer endings, which are not grammatically correct, to express even stronger form of familiarity or cuteness, for example \"mimine\u010d\u00ed\u010dko\" (very small and cute baby), instead of correct \"miminko\" and \"mimine\u010dko\". Such expressions are generally understood, but are used almost exclusively in emotive situations in spoken language and are only rarely written.\n\nSome examples. Note the various stem mutations due to palatalisation, vowel shortening or vowel lengthening:\n\n/'''-ka'''/ (mainly feminine noun forms)\n* t\u00e1ta (dad) \u2192 ta\u0165ka (daddy), Anna \u2192 Anka, Ivana \u2192 Ivanka, hora (mountain) \u2192 h\u016frka (a very small mountain or big hill), noha (leg, foot) \u2192 no\u017eka (a little leg, such as on a small animal)\n\n/'''-ko'''/ (neuter noun forms)\n* r\u00e1dio \u2192 r\u00e1dijko, v\u00edno (wine) \u2192 v\u00ednko, triko (T-shirt) \u2192 tri\u010dko, pero (feather) \u2192 p\u00edrko, oko (eye) \u2192 o\u010dko\n\n/'''-ek'''/ (masculine noun forms)\n* d\u016fm (house) \u2192 domek, st\u016fl (table) \u2192 stolek, schod (stair/step) \u2192 sch\u016fdek, prostor (space) \u2192 prost\u016frek, strom (tree) \u2192 stromek\n\n/'''-\u00edk'''/\n* Tom (Tom) \u2192 Tom\u00edk (little/cute/beloved Tom = Tommy), pokoj (room) \u2192 pokoj\u00edk, k\u016fl (stake/pole) \u2192 kol\u00edk, rum (rum) \u2192 rum\u00edk, ko\u0161 (basket) \u2192 ko\u0161\u00edk\n\n====Polish====\nIn [[Polish language|Polish]] diminutives can be formed of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and some other parts of speech. They literally signify physical smallness or lack of maturity, but usually convey attitude, in most cases affection. In some contexts, they may be condescending or ironic. Diminutives can cover a significant fraction of children's speech during the time of [[language acquisition]].<ref>Ewa Haman, EARLY PRODUCTIVITY IN DERIVATION. A CASE STUDY OF DIMINUTIVES IN THE ACQUISITION OF POLISH\", Psychology of Language and Communication 2003, Vol. 7, No. 1 [http://www.plc.psychologia.pl/plc/contents/fulltext/07-1_3.pdf (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304151259/http://www.plc.psychologia.pl/plc/contents/fulltext/07-1_3.pdf |date=2012-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nFor adjectives and adverbs, diminutives in Polish are grammatically separate from [[comparative]] forms.\n\nThere are multiple affixes used to create the diminutive. Some of them are '''-ka, -czka, -\u015bka, -szka, -cia, -sia, -unia, -enka, -lka''' for feminine nouns and '''-ek, -yk, -ciek, -czek, -czyk, -szek, -u\u0144, -u\u015b, -e\u0144ki, -lki''' for masculine words, and '''-czko, -ko''' for neuter nouns, among others.\n\nThe diminutive suffixes may be stacked to create forms going even further, for example, ''malusie\u0144ki'' is considered even smaller than ''malusi'' or ''male\u0144ki''. Similarly, ''koteczek'' (little kitty) is derived from ''kotek'' (kitty), which is itself derived from ''kot'' (cat). Note that in this case, the suffix ''-ek'' is used twice, but changes to ''ecz'' once due to [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].\n\nThere are also diminutives that lexicalized, e.g., ''sto\u0142ek'' (stool), which is grammatically a diminutive of ''st\u00f3\u0142'' (table).\n\nIn many cases, the possibilities for creation of diminutives are seemingly endless and leave place to create many [[neologism]]s.

For example, {{lang|ru|\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430}} (voda, water) becomes {{lang|ru|\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (vodichka, affectionate name of water), {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0442}} (kot, male cat) becomes  {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a}} (kotik, affectionate name), {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0430}} (koshka, female cat) becomes {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (koshechka, affectionate name), {{lang|ru|\u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435}} (solntse, sun) becomes {{lang|ru|\u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0448\u043a\u043e}} (solnyshko). Often there are many diminutive forms for one word: {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0430}} (mama, mom) becomes {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (mamochka, affectionate sense), {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f}} (mamulya, affectionate and playful sense), {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430}} (mamen'ka, affectionate and old-fashioned), {{lang|ru|\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044f}} (mamanya, affectionate but disdainful), - all of them have different hues of meaning, which are hard to understand for a foreigner, but are very perceptible for a native speaker. Sometimes you can combine several diminutive suffixes to make several degrees of diminution: {{lang|ru|\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0433}} ([[pirog]], a pie) becomes {{lang|ru|\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043e\u043a}} ([[pirozhok]], a small pie, or an affectionate name), which then may become {{lang|ru|\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a}} (pirozhochek, a very small pie, or an affectionate name). The same with {{lang|ru|\u0441\u044b\u0440}} (syr, cheese), {{lang|ru|\u0441\u044b\u0440\u043e\u043a}} (syrok, an affectionate name or a name of a small packed piece of cheese, see the third paragraph), {{lang|ru|\u0441\u044b\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a}} (syrochek, an affectionate name). In both cases the first suffix -\u043e\u043a changes \u043a to \u0447, when the suffix -\u0435\u043a is added.\n\nOften formative infixes and suffixes look like diminutive ones. The well-known word, {{lang|ru|\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430}} (vodka), has the suffix, \"-ka\", which is not a diminutive, but formative, the word has a different meaning (not water, but a drink) and has its own diminutive suffix -ochka: {{lang|ru|\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (vodochka) is an affectionate name of vodka (compare voda - vodichka). There are many examples of this kind: {{lang|ru|\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0430}} (sota, a honeycomb) and {{lang|ru|\u0441\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430}} (sotka, one hundred sqr. meter), {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430}} (truba, a tube) and {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0430}} (trubka, a special kind of a tube: telephone receiver, TV tube, tobacco pipe - in all these cases there is no diminutive sense). However, {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0430}} also means a small tube (depending on context). But most of the time you can tell diminutive particle from formative by simply omitting the suffix. If the meaning of a word remains, the suffix is diminutive. For example: {{lang|ru|\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (kuchka, a small pile) -> {{lang|ru|\u043a\u0443\u0447\u0430}} (kucha, a pile) - the general meaning remains, it is a diminutive form, but {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430}} (tachka, wheelbarrow) -> {{lang|ru|\u0442\u0430\u0447\u0430}} (tacha, no such word) - the general meaning changes, it is not a diminutive form, {{lang|ru|\u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a}} (potolok, ceiling) -> {{lang|ru|\u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043b}} (potol, no such word) - the same with masculine gender.\n\nThere is one more peculiarity. For example, the word {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u044c}} (kon', a male horse) has a diminutive form {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0451\u043a}} (koniok). But {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0451\u043a}} (koniok) also means a skate (ice-skating, no diminutive sense in this case), and has another diminutive form {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0451\u0447\u0435\u043a}} (koniochek, a small skate). The word {{lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0451\u043a}} also means a gable with no diminutive sense.\n\nAdjectives and adverbs can also have diminutive forms with infix {{lang|ru|-\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a-}} (-en'k-): {{lang|ru|\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439}} (siniy, blue) becomes {{lang|ru|\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439}} (sinen'kiy), {{lang|ru|\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e}} (bystro, quickly) becomes {{lang|ru|\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e}} (bystren'ko). In case of adjectives the use of diminutive form is aimed to intensify the effect of diminutive form of a noun. Diminutive forms of adverbs are used to express either benevolence in the speech or on the contrary to express superciliousness, depending on the inflection of a whole phrase.\n\nSome diminutives of proper names, [[Hypocorism#Russian|among many others]]:\n\n'''Feminine'''\n* Anastasiya \u2192 Nastya (as in [[Nastya Liukin]]), Nasten'ka, Nastyona\n* Anna \u2192 Anya, An'ka, Anka, Anechka, Annushka, Anyuta, Nyura, Nyuta, Nyusha\n* Irina \u2192 Ira, Irka, Irinka, Irinushka, Irochka, Irisha\n* Natalya \u2192 Natasha, Natashka, Natashen'ka, Nata, Natalka\n* Tatyana \u2192 Tanya, Tan'ka, Tanechka, Tanyusha, Tata, Tanchik\n* Yelizaveta \u2192 Liza, Lizochka, Lizka, Lizon'ka, Lizaveta\n* Yekaterina \u2192 Katya, Katyusha, Katen'ka, Kat'ka, Katechka, Katerina\n* Yevgeniya \u2192 Zhenya, Zhen'ka, Zhenechka\n\n'''Masculine'''\n* Aleksander \u2192 [[Sasha (name)|Sasha]], Sashka, Sashen'ka, Sashechka, Sanya, Shura, Sashok, Shurik\n* Aleksey \u2192 Alyosha (as in [[Alyosha Popovich]]), Alyoshka, Alyoshen'ka, Lyosha, Lyoshka, Lyoshen'ka, Leksey\n* Andrej \u2192 Andryusha, Andryushka, Andryushechka, Dyusha, Andreika\n*Anton \u2192  Antosha, Antoshka, Tosha, Toshka\n* Dmitriy \u2192 Dima, Mitya, Dimka, Dimushka, Dimochka, Miten'ka, Dimok, Diman, Dimon, Mityai\n* Ivan \u2192 Vanya, Van'ka, Vanechka, Vanyusha, Vanyushka, Ivanushka\n* Mikhail \u2192 Misha, Mishka, Mishen'ka, Mishechka, Mishutka, Mikhei, Mikhailo\n* Pyotr \u2192 Petya, Pet'ka, Peten'ka, Petyunya\n* Sergej \u2192 Seryoga, Seryozha, Seryozhka, Seryozhen'ka, Seryi\n* Vladimir \u2192 Volodya, Voloden'ka, Vova, Vovka, Vovochka, Vovan, Vovchik\n\n===Celtic languages===\n\n====Irish====\nIn the [[Irish language]] diminutives are formed by adding ''-\u00edn'', and sometimes ''-\u00e1n.''\n\n* R\u00f3s (Rose) > R\u00f3is\u00edn (Rosalie, Rosaleen)\n* Se\u00e1n > Se\u00e1in\u00edn (Johnny)\n* S\u00e9amas > S\u00e9amais\u00edn, Jim\u00edn\n* P\u00e1draig > P\u00e1id\u00edn (Paddy)\n* b\u00f3thar (road) > b\u00f3ithr\u00edn (country lane)\n* cailleach (old woman, hag, witch) > cail\u00edn (girl) [origin of the name Colleen]  < Old Irish 'caille' < Latin 'pallium' = 'cloak'\n* fear (man) > fir\u00edn, also feair\u00edn, (little man)\n* teach, also tigh, (house) > tig\u00edn, also teaich\u00edn\n* cloch (stone) > cloich\u00edn (pebble)\n* sr\u00e1id (street) > sr\u00e1id\u00edn (lane, alleyway)\n* s\u00e9ip\u00e9al (chapel) > s\u00e9ip\u00e9il\u00edn (small chapel)\n\nThis suffix is also used to create the female equivalent of some male names:\n\n* P\u00e1draig > P\u00e1draig\u00edn (Patricia)\n* Gear\u00f3id (Gerald/Gerard) > Gear\u00f3id\u00edn (Geraldine)\n* P\u00f3l (Paul) > P\u00f3il\u00edn (Paula)\n\n''-\u00e1n'' as a diminutive suffix is much less frequent nowadays (though it was used extensively as such in Old Irish):\n\n* leabhar (book) > leabhr\u00e1n (booklet, manual, handbook)\n* cnoc (hill) > cnoc\u00e1n (hillock)\n\n====Scottish Gaelic====\n[[Scottish Gaelic]] has two inherited diminutive suffixes of which only one (''-(e)ag'') is considered productive.\n\n* -''(e)ag'', feminine: M\u00f2r (\"Sarah\") \u2192 M\u00f2rag, [[Loch Ness|Loch Nis]] (Loch Ness) \u2192 Niseag (\"[[Loch Ness Monster|Nessie]]\")\n* -''(e)an'', masculine: ''[[loch]]'' \u2192 ''lochan'', ''[[bodach]]'' (old man) \u2192 ''bodachan'' (mannikin)\n\n===Greek===\n\n====Ancient Greek====\nSeveral diminutive derivational suffixes existed in [[Ancient Greek]].

The single character or the second of the two characters can be doubled to make it sound cuter. Some given names, such as [[Sun Feifei (actress)|Sun Feifei]]'s, are already formed in this way. Throughout China, the single character or the second of the two characters can also be prefixed by \"Little\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f}}}}, ''xi\u01ceo'') or\u2014mostly in [[Northern and southern China|Southern China]]\u2014by \"Ah\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}, ''\u0101'') to produce an affectionate or derisive diminutive name. For example, [[Andy Lau]] ({{lang|zh|\u5289\u5fb7\u83ef}}, ''Li\u00fa D\u00e9hu\u00e1'') might be referred to as \"Little Wah\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f|\u83ef}}}}, ''Xi\u01ceohu\u00e1'') or \"Ah-Wah\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f|\u83ef}}}}, ''\u0100hu\u00e1'').\n\nIn [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], \"child\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4ed4}}}}, ''zai\u00b2'') is also used as a diminutive suffix.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9B4IgAACAAJ&dq=Chinese+jerry+norman 1].</ref> [[Andy Lau]]'s more common nickname in [[Hong Kong]] is \"Wah&nbsp;Zai\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u83ef|\u4ed4}}}}, ''Waa\u2074-zai\u00b2''). Cute suffixes in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] include \"-a\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u554a}}}}, ''a''<!--sic-->) and ''-ya'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5440}}}}, ''y\u0101'').\n\n==Turkic languages==\n\n===Turkish===\n:''See also [[Turkish grammar]]''\n\n[[Turkish language|Turkish]] diminutive suffixes are ''-cik'' and ''-ce\u011fiz'', and variants thereof as dictated by the [[Turkish phonology#Consonant assimilation|consonant assimilation]] and [[vowel harmony]] rules of Turkish grammar.\n\n''-cik'' is applied in cases of endearment and affection, in particular toward infants and young children by exaggerating qualities such as smallness and youth, whereas ''-ce\u011fiz'' is used in situations of compassion and empathy, especially when expressing sympathy toward another person in times of difficulty. Note the effects of [[vowel harmony]] in the following examples:\n\n*k\u00f6y (''village'')  \u2192  k\u00f6yce\u011fiz (''dear little village'', also [[K\u00f6yce\u011fiz|a place name]])\n*kad\u0131n (''woman'') \u2192 kad\u0131nca\u011f\u0131z (''poor dear woman'')\n*\u00e7ocuk (''child'')  \u2192  \u00e7ocuk\u00e7a\u011f\u0131z (''poor dear child'')\n*kedi (''cat'')  \u2192   kedicik (''cute little cat, kitten'')\n*k\u00f6pek (''dog'') \u2192 k\u00f6pecik (''cute little dog, puppy'')\n*kitap (''book'') kitap\u00e7\u0131k (''little book, pamphlet'')\n\nIt's not common, but some adjectives may also have diminutives.\n\n* k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck (''little'') \u2192 k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcc\u00fck (''tiny'')\n* s\u0131cak (''hot'') \u2192 s\u0131cac\u0131k (''cozy, warm'')\n* \u00e7abucak (''quickly'') \u2192 \u00e7abucac\u0131k (''in no time'')\n\nThere are a few exceptions; g\u00fcl\u00fcc\u00fck (''giggle'') is derived from the verb g\u00fclmek (''to laugh''), but it's not considered a diminutive. \u00c7ocuk (''kid, child'') is not a diminutive, and it can't take a diminutive suffix. K\u0131l\u00e7\u0131k (''fish bone'') may look like a diminutive, but it's not related to k\u0131l (''body hair'') anyway. And k\u0131z\u0131lc\u0131k (''dogwood, dogberry'') is not a diminutive of k\u0131z\u0131l (''bright red''), and gelincik (''weasel'') is not a diminutive of gelin (''bride''). (''see also: [[Mehmet\u00e7ik]]'')\n\n==Uralic languages==\n\n===Estonian===\nThe diminutive suffix of Estonian is \"-kene\" in its long form, but can be shortened to \"-ke\". In all grammatical cases except for the nominative and partitive singular, the \"-ne\" ending becomes \"-se\". It is fully productive and can be used with every word. Some words, such as \"p\u00e4ike(ne)\" (sun), \"v\u00e4ike(ne)\" (little) or \"pisike(ne)\" (tiny), are diminutive in their basic form, the diminutive suffix cannot be removed from these words. The Estonian diminutive suffix can be used recursively - it can be attached to a word more than once. Forms such as \"pisikesekesekene\", having three diminutive suffixes, are grammatically legitimate. As is demonstrated by the example, in recursive usage all but the last diminutive \"-ne\" suffix become \"-se\" as in forms inflected by case.\n\n===Finnish===\nThe diminutive suffixes of Finnish \"-ke\", \"-kka\", and \"-nen\" are not universal, and cannot be used on every noun. The feature is common in Finnish [[surname]]s, f.e. 'Jokinen' could translate 'Streamling', but since this form is not used in speaking about streams, the surname could also mean 'lands by the stream' or 'lives by the stream'. Double diminutives also occur in certain words f.e. lapsu''ka''i''nen'' (child, not a baby anymore), lapso''nen'' (small child), lapsi (child).\n\nExamples:\n\n**''-ke'': ''haara'' (branch) \u2192 ''haara'''ke''''' (little branch), ''nimi'' (name) \u2192 ''nimi'''ke''''' (label, tag)\n**''-kka'': ''peni'' (dog (archaic)) \u2192 ''peni'''kka''''' (whelp, pup), ''nen\u00e4'' (nose) \u2192 ''nenu'''kka''''' (little nose)\n**''-nen'': ''lintu'' (bird) \u2192 ''lintu'''nen''''' (little bird), ''poika'' (boy, son) \u2192 ''poika'''nen''''' (little boy, animal offspring)\n\n===Hungarian===\nHungarian uses the suffixes ''-ka/ke'' and ''-cska/cske'' to form diminutive nouns. The suffixes ''-i'' and ''-csi'' may also be used with names. However, you traditionally cannot have the diminutive form of your name registered officially in Hungary (although a few of the most common diminutive forms have been registered as possible legal first names in the past years). Nouns formed this way are considered separate words (as all words that are formed using ''k\u00e9pz\u0151'' type suffixes). They may not even be grammatically related to the base word, only historically, whereas the relation has been long forgotten.\n\nSome examples:\n*Animals\n**''-us'': ''kutya'' \u2192 ''kuty'''us''''' (dog), ''cica'' \u2192 ''cic'''us''''' (cat)\n**''-ci'': ''medve'' \u2192 ''ma'''ci''''' (bear), ''borj\u00fa'' \u2192 ''bo'''ci''''' (calf), ''liba \u2192 libu'''ci''''' (goose)\n**''-ka/-ke: mad\u00e1r \u2192 mad\u00e1r'''ka''''' (bird), ''eg\u00e9r \u2192 eg\u00e9r'''ke''''' (mouse)\n**''-cska/-cske: hal \u2192 hala'''cska''''', ''m\u00e9h \u2192 m\u00e9he'''cske''''' (bee)\n*Names\n**''-i'': ''J\u00e1nos'' \u2192 ''Jan'''i''''', ''J\u00falia'' \u2192 ''Jul'''i''''', ''Kata'' \u2192 ''Kat'''i''''', ''M\u00e1ria'' \u2192 ''Mar'''i''''', ''S\u00e1ra'' \u2192 ''S\u00e1r'''i,''' Gerg\u0151/Gergely '''\u2192''' Ger'''i,''' Domo(n)kos \u2192 Dom'''i'''''\n**''-i-ka/ke'': ''J\u00e1nos'' \u2192 ''Jan'''ika''''', ''J\u00falia'' \u2192 ''Jul'''ika''''', ''M\u00e1ria'' \u2192 ''Mar'''ika,''' Ferenc \u2192 Fer'''ike''', Ter\u00e9z(ia) \u2192 Terike''\n**''-csi'': ''J\u00e1nos'' \u2192 ''Jan'''csi''''', ''J\u00falia'' \u2192 ''Jul'''csi''''', ''M\u00e1ria'' \u2192 ''Mar'''csi'''''\n**''-iska/-iske/-uska'': ''J\u00falia'' \u2192 ''Jul'''iska''''', ''M\u00e1ria'' \u2192 ''Mar'''iska''''', ''Ilona'' \u2192 ''Il'''uska'''''\n**''-us'': ''B\u00e9la'' \u2192 ''B\u00e9l'''us''', J\u00falia/Judit \u2192 Juc'''us'''''\n**''-ci'': ''L\u00e1szl\u00f3'' \u2192 ''La'''ci''''', ''J\u00falia/Judit'' \u2192 ''Ju'''ci''', Anna \u2192 An'''ci'''''\n**''-c\u00f3'': ''Ferenc'' \u2192 ''Fe'''c\u00f3''''', ''J\u00f3zsef'' \u2192 ''Jo'''c\u00f3'''''\n**-ca: ''Ilona'' \u2192 ''I'''ca''''', ''L\u00e1szl\u00f3'' \u2192 ''La'''ca'''''\n**''-tya'': ''P\u00e9ter'' \u2192 ''Pe'''tya''''', ''Zolt\u00e1n'' \u2192 ''Zo'''tya'''''\n**''-nyi'': ''S\u00e1ndor'' \u2192 ''Sa'''nyi''', M\u00e1ria \u2192 Ma'''nyi'''''\n\nNote that these are all special diminutive suffixes. The universal ''-ka/ke'' and ''-cska/cske'' can be used to create further diminutive forms, e.g. ''kutyus'''ka''''' (little doggy), ''cicus'''ka''''' (little kitty). Theoretically, more and more diminutive forms can be created this way, e.g. ''kutyusk\u00e1'''csk\u00e1cska''''' (little doggy-woggy-snoggy). Of course, this is not a common practice; the preferred translations are ''kutyuli'''mutyuli''''' (doggy-woggy) and ''cica'''mica''''' (kitty-witty).\n\n==Bantu languages==\n\n===Chichewa===\nChichewa noun class 12 and 13 contain diminutive prefixes. The prefixes are ''ka'' (12) for singular nouns and ''ti'' (13) for plural nouns. These classes do not contain any words as opposed to the [[augmentative]] marker, which is also a regular noun class containing nouns. \n* mwana (child) \u2192 '''ka'''mwana (little child)\n* ana (children) \u2192 '''ti'''ana (little children)\n\n===seSotho===\nIn the Sotho languages (South Sotho, Setswana, and Sesotho sa Lebowa), the diminunitive is formed with variants of the -ana suffix.\n* mo\u0161emane (boy) \u2192 '''mo\u0161emanyana''' (small boy)\n* koloi (car, wagon) \u2192 '''koloinyana''' (small car)\n* kolobe (pig) \u2192 '''kolobjana''' (piglet)\n\n==International auxiliary languages==\n\n===Esperanto===\n: ''See also [[Esperanto vocabulary#Word formation|Esperanto word formation]].''\nFor generic use (for living beings and inanimate objects), [[Esperanto]] has a single diminutive suffix, \"-et\".\n* domo (house) \u2192 dometo (cottage)\n* knabo (boy) \u2192 knabeto (little boy)\n* varma (warm) \u2192 varmeta (lukewarm)\n\nFor personal names and familial [[Style (manner of address)|forms of address]], the affixes \"-nj-\" and \"-\u0109j-\" are used, for females and males respectively. Unusually for Esperanto, the \"root\" is often shortened.\n* patrino (mother) \u2192 panjo (mum, mommy)\n* patro (father) \u2192 pa\u0109jo (dad(dy))\n* Aleksandra (Alexandra) \u2192 Alenjo (Sandra)\n* Aleksandro (Alexander) \u2192 Ale\u0109jo (Sandro)\n* Johano (John) \u2192 Jo\u0109jo (Johnny)\n* Maria (Mary) \u2192 Manjo\n* Sofia (Sophie) \u2192 Sonjo\n* Vilhelmo (William) \u2192 Vil\u0109jo (Bill(y), Will(y))\n\nWhereas languages such as Spanish may use the diminutive to denote offspring, as in \"perrito\" (pup), Esperanto has a dedicated and regular suffix, \"-id\" used for this purpose. Thus \"hundeto\" means \"little dog\" (such as a dog of a small breed), while \"hundido\" means a dog who is not yet fully grown.\n\n===Interlingua===\n:''See also [[Free word-building in Interlingua]].''\n[[Interlingua]] has a single diminutive suffix, -ett, for diminutives of all sorts.\n* Johannes (John) \u2192 Johannetto (Johnny)\n* camera (chamber, room) \u2192 cameretta (little room)\n* pullo (chicken) \u2192 pulletto (chick)\n\nUse of this suffix is flexible, and diminutives such as ''mama'' and ''papa'' may also be used.

There he met his future wife Barbara, whom he married shortly after her graduation. The couple moved to [[Long Island]], living in [[Syosset, New York|Syosset]], where they brought up two daughters, Laurie and Melanie; their family eventually expanded with three grandchildren.<ref name=man>\"Man Behind the Drawing Board\", ''The Adventures of Bob Hope'' 87, 1963.</ref>\n\nHis daughter Laurie reported that Drucker died on April 8, 2020, in his Woodbury, New York, home.<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Career==\nDrucker entered the comics field by assisting Bert Whitman on the [[Publishers-Hall Syndicate|Publishers-Hall]] newspaper comic strip ''Debbie Dean'' in 1947 when he was 18, based on a recommendation from [[Will Eisner]]. He then joined the staff of National Periodical Publications ([[DC Comics]]), where he worked as a retoucher. While at DC, Drucker also [[ghostwriting|ghosted]] \"The Mountain Boys\", Paul Webb's regular gag panel for [[Esquire Magazine]].<ref name=man/> Early in the 1950s, Drucker left his DC staff gig and began doing full-time freelance work for a number of comic book publishers such as [[Dell Comics|Dell]], [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas]] and [[St. John Publications|St. John's]], as well as several humor and war titles for his former employer.\n\n===''Mad''===\nIn the fall of 1956, shortly after the departure of ''Mad'''s founding editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]], Drucker found his way to ''Mad''. His first visit to the magazine's offices coincided with a [[World Series]] broadcast, and publisher [[Bill Gaines]] told Drucker that if the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] won the game, he would be given a drawing assignment. The Dodgers won. Capricious though Drucker's alleged audition process may have been, it was a good anecdote. Years later, Gaines unsurprisingly confessed, \"We would have hired him anyway.\"\n\nDrucker had arrived at the ''Mad'' offices with pages from his [[Hopalong Cassidy]] comic book work for [[DC Comics]] and some of his \"Mountain Boys\" strips, as well as a humorous \"little situation\" featuring [[The Lone Ranger]] and [[Tonto]] that he had specifically drawn for the interview.  Though this work was unlike the likenesses and continuities he would become best known for, the ''Mad'' staff reacted favorably.  The first to review Drucker's portfolio was ''Mad'' associate editor [[Nick Meglin]], who admitted, \"I didn't spot how great he was at caricatures.  Not at first.  But then, he wasn't that great then.\"  Drucker himself says that he \"just wanted to be an artist ... to get paid for drawing anything,\" and only started focusing on caricature work because he started getting more of those assignments.  \"That's when I realized I'd found my calling,\" said Drucker.<ref>Evanier, Mark, ''MAD Art'', Watson-Guptill Publications, 2002</ref> At the time of Drucker's arrival, ''Mad'' did not regularly feature TV and movie satires. Editor [[Al Feldstein]] credited Drucker's style and ability for the decision to start featuring them in every issue.\n\nFor well over a decade, ''Mad'' had difficulty obtaining promotional photos that Drucker could use as source material for his drawings.<ref>Jacobs, Frank, The Mad World of William M. Gaines, Lyle Stuart Inc., 1972, pgs. 45-46</ref> When he was illustrating ''Mad'' parodies, Drucker's colleague [[Angelo Torres]] brought a camera into movie theaters and snapped pictures of the screen. Eventually, a generation of ''Mad'' fans grew up and some became Hollywood publicists, making Drucker's research easier. \n\nBy the time he wound down his ''Mad'' career 55 years later, Drucker held the longest uninterrupted tenure of any ''Mad'' artist.  Drucker has the most bylined articles by any ''Mad'' artist who does not also write his own material, with more than 400.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://users.pfw.edu/slaubau/mad/madcontributor.htm|title=MAD Magazine Contributors|website=users.pfw.edu|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Other work===\nDrucker also remained active for DC, illustrating ''War Stories'', among other titles. Beginning in 1959, he spent four years drawing DC's ''[[The Adventures of Bob Hope]]'' comic book.<ref name=man/>  Drucker credits this stint as a key moment in his career because it focused his work on caricature.<ref>MAD's Greatest Artists: Mort Drucker, 2012, Running Press, pg. 12</ref>\n\nIn 1962, Drucker teamed with the prolific humor writer [[Paul Laikin]] on the highly successful ''JFK Coloring Book'' (Kanrom Publishers), which sold 2,500,000 copies.  Two decades later, Drucker illustrated similar coloring books on [[Ollie North]] and [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref name=man/><ref>''Pacific Stars and Stripes'', August 24, 1987.</ref> His film posters include [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), directed by [[George Lucas]]<ref name=mort/> with Drucker also drawing the [[high school yearbook]] pictures in the [[film trailer]].\n\nDrucker also pursued assignments in television animation, movie poster art and magazine illustration, including covers for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', some of which are in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. His album covers include art for the pop band [[The Bears (band)|The Bears]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adrianbelew.net/|title=The Official Site of Adrian Belew|website=Adrian Belew|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> and the [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] album ''[[State of Euphoria]],'' as well as humor albums in the vein of his own \"JFK Coloring Book\" including \"The LBJ Menagerie\" and \"The New First Family, 1968.\"  In addition to books collecting his own work, he has provided illustrations for numerous books by others, including [[children's literature|children's books]], humor books and satire. He drew the prop cartoons used in the 1957 Broadway musical comedy, ''[[Rumple (musical)|Rumple]]''.<ref name=man/>\n\nBetween 1984 and 1987, Drucker collaborated with [[Jerry Dumas]] (and [[John Reiner]]) on the daily comic strip ''Benchley''. Set in the [[White House]], the plot revolved around the fictive character Benchley who acted as the assistant and admirer of contemporary president [[Ronald Reagan]]. Dumas commented, \"Nobody ever did a strip about the government. It's a wonderful place to set a strip. There's so much room for humor in the White House.\"<ref>\"Comic strip set in White House\", ''Lethbridge Herald'' ([[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta, Canada|Alberta]], Canada), July 5, 1984.</ref> ''Benchley'' was syndicated by the [[Register and Tribune Syndicate]].<ref name=\"(editor)\">{{cite book|author=Gary Dowell, Greg Holman, Don Mangus, James L.

The following year, for the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, Drucker and executive Mitchell Erick created the Frugies (pronounced ''fru-jees'') to promote June as National Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Month. The campaign included such characters as Lord Mushroom, Pepe L'Pepper, Penelope Pear and Adam Apple.<ref>''Frederick News-Post'', June 12, 1991.</ref>\n\n== Style ==\nIn 2012, Drucker discussed his art style, and how he applied it to his ''Mad'' assignments:\n\n<blockquote>I've always considered a caricature to be the complete person, not just a likeness.  Hands, in particular, have always been a prime focus for me as they can be as expressive of character as the exaggerations and distortions a caricaturist searches for.  I try to capture the essence of the person, not just facial features ... I've discovered through years of working at capturing a humorous likeness that it's not about the features themselves as much as the space between the features.  We all have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, hair, and jaw lines, but yet we all look different.  What makes that so is the space between them.\n\nThe artist is actually creating his own storyboard for the film.  I become the \"camera\" and look for angles, lighting, close-ups, wide angles, long shots-- just as a director does to tell the story in the most visually interesting way he can.  My first sketches are as much composition and design ideas as they are character and action images ... I don't want to get too involved in the juicy parts since some of what I'm doing will be modified or discarded as I get further involved in the storytelling.  I then stand back and look at the page as a complete unit to make sure it's designed well: \"Hmmm, three close-up panels in a row of characters talking.  Better change that middle panel to a far shot.  Maybe make that panel an open vignette.\"  ... Then I place the facing pages together and look at how the spread holds together, and sometimes make changes based on that.<ref>MAD's Greatest Artists: Mort Drucker, 2012, Running Press, pg. 13</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Praise ==\nWhen the magazine's parody of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' was published in 1980, drawn by Drucker, the magazine received a [[cease and desist]] letter from [[George Lucas]]' lawyers demanding that the issue be pulled from sale, and that ''Mad'' destroy the printing plates, surrender the original art, and turn over all profits from the issue. Unbeknownst to them, George Lucas himself had just sent ''Mad'' an effusive letter praising the parody, and declaring, \"Special Oscars should be awarded to Drucker and [[Dick DeBartolo|DeBartolo]], the [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] of comic satire.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/drucker_mort.htm|title=Mort Drucker|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>Taylor, Chris, How Star Wars Conquered the Universe, Hachette Books, 2015, pg. 122</ref>  Publisher Gaines mailed a copy of the letter to Lucas' lawyers with a handwritten message across the top: \"That's funny, George liked it!\"<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/article212487744.html MAD magazine editor Nick Meglin, an influence on cartoonists and satire, has died], by David Menconi, in ''[[the News & Observer]]''; published June 4, 2018; retrieved April 9, 2020</ref> There was no further communication on the matter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/mad-about-star-wars|title=MAD about Star Wars|date=June 23, 2014|website=StarWars.com|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Drucker had also worked on the advertising campaign for Lucas' earlier film ''[[American Graffiti]]''.

There he met his future wife Barbara, whom he married shortly after her graduation. The couple moved to [[Long Island]], living in [[Syosset, New York|Syosset]], where they brought up two daughters, Laurie and Melanie; their family eventually expanded with three grandchildren.<ref name=man>\"Man Behind the Drawing Board\", ''The Adventures of Bob Hope'' 87, 1963.</ref>\n\nHis daughter Laurie reported that Drucker died on April 8, 2020, in his Woodbury, New York, home.<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Career==\nDrucker entered the comics field by assisting Bert Whitman on the [[Publishers-Hall Syndicate|Publishers-Hall]] newspaper comic strip ''Debbie Dean'' in 1947 when he was 18, based on a recommendation from [[Will Eisner]]. He then joined the staff of National Periodical Publications ([[DC Comics]]), where he worked as a retoucher. While at DC, Drucker also [[ghostwriting|ghosted]] \"The Mountain Boys\", Paul Webb's regular gag panel for [[Esquire Magazine]].<ref name=man/> Early in the 1950s, Drucker left his DC staff gig and began doing full-time freelance work for a number of comic book publishers such as [[Dell Comics|Dell]], [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas]] and [[St. John Publications|St. John's]], as well as several humor and war titles for his former employer.\n\n===''Mad''===\nIn the fall of 1956, shortly after the departure of ''Mad'''s founding editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]], Drucker found his way to ''Mad''. His first visit to the magazine's offices coincided with a [[World Series]] broadcast, and publisher [[Bill Gaines]] told Drucker that if the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] won the game, he would be given a drawing assignment. The Dodgers won. Capricious though Drucker's alleged audition process may have been, it was a good anecdote. Years later, Gaines unsurprisingly confessed, \"We would have hired him anyway.\"\n\nDrucker had arrived at the ''Mad'' offices with pages from his [[Hopalong Cassidy]] comic book work for [[DC Comics]] and some of his \"Mountain Boys\" strips, as well as a humorous \"little situation\" featuring [[The Lone Ranger]] and [[Tonto]] that he had specifically drawn for the interview.  Though this work was unlike the likenesses and continuities he would become best known for, the ''Mad'' staff reacted favorably.  The first to review Drucker's portfolio was ''Mad'' associate editor [[Nick Meglin]], who admitted, \"I didn't spot how great he was at caricatures.  Not at first.  But then, he wasn't that great then.\"  Drucker himself says that he \"just wanted to be an artist ... to get paid for drawing anything,\" and only started focusing on caricature work because he started getting more of those assignments.  \"That's when I realized I'd found my calling,\" said Drucker.<ref>Evanier, Mark, ''MAD Art'', Watson-Guptill Publications, 2002</ref> At the time of Drucker's arrival, ''Mad'' did not regularly feature TV and movie satires. Editor [[Al Feldstein]] credited Drucker's style and ability for the decision to start featuring them in every issue.\n\nFor well over a decade, ''Mad'' had difficulty obtaining promotional photos that Drucker could use as source material for his drawings.<ref>Jacobs, Frank, The Mad World of William M. Gaines, Lyle Stuart Inc., 1972, pgs. 45-46</ref> When he was illustrating ''Mad'' parodies, Drucker's colleague [[Angelo Torres]] brought a camera into movie theaters and snapped pictures of the screen. Eventually, a generation of ''Mad'' fans grew up and some became Hollywood publicists, making Drucker's research easier. \n\nBy the time he wound down his ''Mad'' career 55 years later, Drucker held the longest uninterrupted tenure of any ''Mad'' artist.  Drucker has the most bylined articles by any ''Mad'' artist who does not also write his own material, with more than 400.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://users.pfw.edu/slaubau/mad/madcontributor.htm|title=MAD Magazine Contributors|website=users.pfw.edu|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Other work===\nDrucker also remained active for DC, illustrating ''War Stories'', among other titles. Beginning in 1959, he spent four years drawing DC's ''[[The Adventures of Bob Hope]]'' comic book.<ref name=man/>  Drucker credits this stint as a key moment in his career because it focused his work on caricature.<ref>MAD's Greatest Artists: Mort Drucker, 2012, Running Press, pg. 12</ref>\n\nIn 1962, Drucker teamed with the prolific humor writer [[Paul Laikin]] on the highly successful ''JFK Coloring Book'' (Kanrom Publishers), which sold 2,500,000 copies.  Two decades later, Drucker illustrated similar coloring books on [[Ollie North]] and [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref name=man/><ref>''Pacific Stars and Stripes'', August 24, 1987.</ref> His film posters include [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), directed by [[George Lucas]]<ref name=mort/> with Drucker also drawing the [[high school yearbook]] pictures in the [[film trailer]].\n\nDrucker also pursued assignments in television animation, movie poster art and magazine illustration, including covers for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', some of which are in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. His album covers include art for the pop band [[The Bears (band)|The Bears]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adrianbelew.net/|title=The Official Site of Adrian Belew|website=Adrian Belew|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> and the [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] album ''[[State of Euphoria]],'' as well as humor albums in the vein of his own \"JFK Coloring Book\" including \"The LBJ Menagerie\" and \"The New First Family, 1968.\"  In addition to books collecting his own work, he has provided illustrations for numerous books by others, including [[children's literature|children's books]], humor books and satire. He drew the prop cartoons used in the 1957 Broadway musical comedy, ''[[Rumple (musical)|Rumple]]''.<ref name=man/>\n\nBetween 1984 and 1987, Drucker collaborated with [[Jerry Dumas]] (and [[John Reiner]]) on the daily comic strip ''Benchley''. Set in the [[White House]], the plot revolved around the fictive character Benchley who acted as the assistant and admirer of contemporary president [[Ronald Reagan]]. Dumas commented, \"Nobody ever did a strip about the government. It's a wonderful place to set a strip. There's so much room for humor in the White House.\"<ref>\"Comic strip set in White House\", ''Lethbridge Herald'' ([[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta, Canada|Alberta]], Canada), July 5, 1984.</ref> ''Benchley'' was syndicated by the [[Register and Tribune Syndicate]].<ref name=\"(editor)\">{{cite book|author=Gary Dowell, Greg Holman, Don Mangus, James L.

The following year, for the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, Drucker and executive Mitchell Erick created the Frugies (pronounced ''fru-jees'') to promote June as National Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Month. The campaign included such characters as Lord Mushroom, Pepe L'Pepper, Penelope Pear and Adam Apple.<ref>''Frederick News-Post'', June 12, 1991.</ref>\n\n== Style ==\nIn 2012, Drucker discussed his art style, and how he applied it to his ''Mad'' assignments:\n\n<blockquote>I've always considered a caricature to be the complete person, not just a likeness.  Hands, in particular, have always been a prime focus for me as they can be as expressive of character as the exaggerations and distortions a caricaturist searches for.  I try to capture the essence of the person, not just facial features ... I've discovered through years of working at capturing a humorous likeness that it's not about the features themselves as much as the space between the features.  We all have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, hair, and jaw lines, but yet we all look different.  What makes that so is the space between them.\n\nThe artist is actually creating his own storyboard for the film.  I become the \"camera\" and look for angles, lighting, close-ups, wide angles, long shots-- just as a director does to tell the story in the most visually interesting way he can.  My first sketches are as much composition and design ideas as they are character and action images ... I don't want to get too involved in the juicy parts since some of what I'm doing will be modified or discarded as I get further involved in the storytelling.  I then stand back and look at the page as a complete unit to make sure it's designed well: \"Hmmm, three close-up panels in a row of characters talking.  Better change that middle panel to a far shot.  Maybe make that panel an open vignette.\"  ... Then I place the facing pages together and look at how the spread holds together, and sometimes make changes based on that.<ref>MAD's Greatest Artists: Mort Drucker, 2012, Running Press, pg. 13</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Praise ==\nWhen the magazine's parody of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' was published in 1980, drawn by Drucker, the magazine received a [[cease and desist]] letter from [[George Lucas]]' lawyers demanding that the issue be pulled from sale, and that ''Mad'' destroy the printing plates, surrender the original art, and turn over all profits from the issue. Unbeknownst to them, George Lucas himself had just sent ''Mad'' an effusive letter praising the parody, and declaring, \"Special Oscars should be awarded to Drucker and [[Dick DeBartolo|DeBartolo]], the [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] of comic satire.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/drucker_mort.htm|title=Mort Drucker|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>Taylor, Chris, How Star Wars Conquered the Universe, Hachette Books, 2015, pg. 122</ref>  Publisher Gaines mailed a copy of the letter to Lucas' lawyers with a handwritten message across the top: \"That's funny, George liked it!\"<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/article212487744.html MAD magazine editor Nick Meglin, an influence on cartoonists and satire, has died], by David Menconi, in ''[[the News & Observer]]''; published June 4, 2018; retrieved April 9, 2020</ref> There was no further communication on the matter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/mad-about-star-wars|title=MAD about Star Wars|date=June 23, 2014|website=StarWars.com|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Drucker had also worked on the advertising campaign for Lucas' earlier film ''[[American Graffiti]]''.

I think he draws everything the way we would all like to draw.\"  In 2012, referring to Drucker's splash page for ''Mad'''s parody of ''[[The Godfather]]'', the Comics Reporter's [[Tom Spurgeon]] wrote, \"The way he draws [[James Caan]]'s eyebrow is worth some folks' entire careers.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/bundled_tossed_untied_and_stacked052212/ |title=Bundled, Tossed, Untied And Stacked |first=Tom |last=Spurgeon |date=May 22, 2012 |website=The Comics Reporter |publisher=Tom Spurgeon |accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nMort Drucker's ''Time'' covers are in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]].
