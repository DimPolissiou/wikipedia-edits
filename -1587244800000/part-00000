The American Eskimo Dog is a member of the [[Spitz]] family. The breed's progenitors were [[German Spitz]], but due to [[Anti-German sentiment#United States 2|anti-German sentiment]] during the [[First World War]], it was renamed \"American Eskimo Dog.\" Although modern American Eskimo Dogs have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are significantly different. In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a [[circus]] performer.\n\nThere are three size varieties of the American Eskimo Dog breed, the toy, the miniature and the standard.

It is not considered an aggressive breed but, due to its watchdog history, American Eskimo dogs are generally quite vocal, barking at any stranger who comes in proximity to their owners' territory.\n\nIn Northern Europe, smaller Spitz were eventually developed into the various [[German Spitz]] breeds. European immigrants brought their Spitz pets with them to the United States, especially New York, in the early 1900s, \"all of them descended from the larger German Spitz, the [[Keeshond]], the white [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]], and the Italian Spitz, the [[Volpino Italiano]].\"<ref name=\"Clark/Brace\">{{cite book | last = Clark | first = Anne Rogers | authorlink = Anne Rogers Clark | title = The International Encyclopedia of Dogs | publisher = Howell Book House |author2= Andrew H.

While working on his idea part-time, he applied for and received a patent for his new grist mill, The Queen of the South. In 1844, Straub created the Straub Mill Company to create the mills, mill supplies, bolting machines, and reels (flour sifter). Sales at this time ranged from Ohio to New Orleans.<ref>http://www.libraries.uc.edu/research/subject_resources/business/Documents/Rotex.pdf</ref>\n\nAt the age of 70, Straub sold his business to Robert Simpson in 1863, who changed the company name to Simpson & Gault. In 1866, Straub invented and patented an improvement to the Queen of the South mills. By the 1870s, the company had sold more than 4,000 Queen of the South mills. Straub died in 1875 at the age of 81. At age 25, Robert Simpson's son Orville assumed control of the company and changed the name to Straub Machinery Company.<ref>http://www.libraries.uc.edu/research/subject_resources/business/Documents/Rotex.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the company moved to its current plant on Knowlton Street in Cincinnati, Ohio. Also in that year, the company name was changed to The Orville Simpson Company. In 1912, a flour mill in Chillicothe, Ohio wanted a device to clean up flour after grinding. Lowe Simpson, Orville's son, designed and patented a new sifter for the mill. This invention, called ROTEX, lead to many orders.<ref>http://www.libraries.uc.edu/research/subject_resources/business/Documents/Rotex.pdf</ref>\n\nThe last Queen of the South mill was shipped in 1918, 74 years after its introduction. The new ROTEX Screener helped to save the company as grist mills were replaced by newer innovations. In 1935, the bouncing ball automatic screen cleaning was introduced by ROTEX and in 1939; Lowe Simpson became the president of the company.<ref>http://www.libraries.uc.edu/research/subject_resources/business/Documents/Rotex.pdf</ref>\n\nLowe Simpson retired in 1957 and his son, Jeremy, 25, followed as president. In 1974, the name of the company was changed to ROTEX, a name that was familiar to customers. In 1988, the first non-Simpson President in 124 years, Alex Young, became president of the company. In 1995, Bill Lower succeeded Alex Young as president.<ref>http://www.libraries.uc.edu/research/subject_resources/business/Documents/Rotex.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 2001, ROTEX purchased European Licensee, Locker Industries and Thomas Locker which were founded in the United Kingdom in 1879 and Belgium in 1959 respectively. In 2004, Bill Herkamp succeeded Bill Lower.<ref>http://www.libraries.uc.edu/research/subject_resources/business/Documents/Rotex.pdf</ref>\n\nHillenbrand purchased Rotex in August 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9OU0G803.htm |title=Hillenbrand to buy Rotex Global for $240M |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}</ref> In 2014, Robert Dieckman became the ninth president since 1844, and the fifth non-Simpson family member to run the business.

While working on his idea part-time, he applied for and received a patent for his new grist mill, The Queen of the South. In 1844, Straub created the Straub Mill Company to create the mills, mill supplies, bolting machines, and reels (flour sifter). Sales at this time ranged from Ohio to New Orleans.<ref>http://www.libraries.uc.edu/research/subject_resources/business/Documents/Rotex.pdf</ref>\n\nAt the age of 70, Straub sold his business to Robert Simpson in 1863, who changed the company name to Simpson & Gault. In 1866, Straub invented and patented an improvement to the Queen of the South mills. By the 1870s, the company had sold more than 4,000 Queen of the South mills.

He had been targeted by the radical democrats, including [[Albert Chan]] of the [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] in the [[2011 Hong Kong local elections|2011 District Council election]] who opposed Democrats' compromise with the Beijing officials on the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|2012 constitutional reform proposals]] and in the [[2015 Hong Kong local elections|2015 District Council election]] by [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Cheng Chung-tai]]. He kept the seat for 15 years but was defeated in 2015 by [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] lawyer [[Junius Ho]] in 2015 by a narrow margin of 277 votes.\n\n==Legislative Councillor==\nIn April 1990, Ho and other pro-democracy activists co-founded the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] (UDHK), the first major pro-democracy party in the city, in which he became the founding vice chairman. The party transformed into today's [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] in 1994 where he was the member of the party's first executive committee.

The Democratic Party boycotted the [[Provisional Legislative Council]] controlled by Beijing and refused to take part in it. In November 1997, Ho was nominated by the Democratic Party to run for a seat in the [[National People's Congress]], but excluded from competition when failed to obtain the minimum number of nominations from the 400-strong Beijing-appointed election conference.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nIn the [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|first Legislative Council election]] of the SAR period in 1998, Ho won a seat in the New Territories West with his party colleague [[Lee Wing-tat]].

[[Albert Chan]] who had strong basis in [[Tsuen Wan]] was also elected on the expense of Lee Wing-tat. Ho was re-elected in 2004.

It was also nominated for four [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] and three [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nLondon-based journalist [[Martin Sixsmith]] has lost his job as a government adviser. He is approached at a party by the daughter of Philomena Lee. She suggests that he write a story about her mother, who was forced to give up her toddler son Anthony nearly fifty years ago. Though Sixsmith is initially reluctant to write a human interest story, he meets Philomena and decides to investigate her case.\n\nIn 1951, Philomena became pregnant and was sent by her father to [[Sean Ross Abbey]] in [[Roscrea]] in Ireland. After giving birth, she was forced to work in the [[Magdalene asylum|convent laundry]] for four years, with little contact with her son. The nuns gave her son up for adoption without giving Philomena a chance to say goodbye. She kept her lost son a secret from her family for nearly fifty years.\n\nMartin and Philomena begin their search at the convent. The nuns claim that the adoption records were destroyed in a fire years earlier; they did not, however, lose the contract she was forced to sign decades ago forbidding her from contacting her son, which Martin considers suspicious. At a pub, the locals tell Martin that the convent burnt the records deliberately, and that most of the children were sold for \u00a31,000 each to [[wealth]]y Americans.\n\nMartin's investigation reaches a dead end in Ireland, but he receives a promising lead from the United States and invites Philomena to accompany him there. His contacts help him discover that Anthony was renamed [[Michael A. Hess]], who became a [[lawyer]] and senior official in the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush]] administrations. When Philomena notices Martin in the background of a photo of Michael, he remembers that he met him years earlier while working in the US. They also learn that he has been dead for eight years.\n\nPhilomena decides she wants to meet people who knew Michael and learn more about him from them. They visit a former colleague of Michael's and discover that Michael was [[Homosexuality|gay]] and died of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. They also visit his sister Mary, who was adopted at the same time from the convent, and learn that they were both [[Psychological abuse|emotionally]] and [[physical abuse|physically abused]] by their adoptive parents, and hear about his partner Pete Olsson. After avoiding Martin's attempts to contact him, Pete agrees to talk to Philomena. He shows Philomena some videos of his life with Michael. To Martin and Philomena's surprise, they see footage of Michael, dated shortly before he died, at the Abbey where he was adopted, and Pete explains that, although he never told his family, Michael had privately wondered about his birth mother all his life, and had returned to Ireland in his final months to try to find her. Pete informs them that the nuns had told Michael that his mother had abandoned him and that they had lost contact with her. He also reveals that, against his parents' wishes, he had Michael buried in the convent's cemetery.\n\nPhilomena and Martin go to the convent to ask them where Michael's grave is. Despite Philomena's efforts to stop him, Martin angrily breaks into the private quarters and argues with an elderly nun, Sister Hildegarde McNulty, who worked at the convent when Anthony was forcibly adopted. He accuses her of lying to a dying man and denying him the chance to finally reunite with his mother, purely out of self-righteousness. Hildegarde is unrepentant, saying that losing her son was Philomena's penance for having sex out of [[Marriage|wedlock]]. Martin demands an apology, telling her that what she did was un-Christian, but is speechless when Philomena instead chooses to forgive her of her own volition. Philomena then asks to see her son's grave, where Martin tells her he has chosen not to publish the story. Philomena tells him to publish it anyway.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast as billed in film with roles from Credits-->\n<!--Billed actors-->\n<!--Pre-title actors-->\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Philomena Lee]]\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as [[Martin Sixsmith]]\n<!--Post-title billed actors-->\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Sally Mitchell\n* [[Barbara Jefford]] as Sister Hildegarde\n* [[Anna Maxwell Martin]] as Jane\n* [[Mare Winningham]] as Mary\n\n<!--non-billed notable actors with citations-->\nIn addition to the main cast, [[Sophie Kennedy Clark]] plays a young Philomena,<ref>{{cite magazine\n        |url        = http://www.vogue.com/culture/article/10-minutes-with-philomenas-sophie-kennedy-clark/#1\n        |title      = 10 Minutes with Philomena's Sophie Kennedy Clark\n        |last1      = Guiducci\n        |first1     = Mark\n        |date       = 22 November 2013\n        |magazine  = [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]\n        |accessdate = 12 August 2014\n}}</ref> [[Kate Fleetwood]] plays a young Sister Hildegarde, [[Simone Lahbib]] plays Kate Sixsmith, [[Cathy Belton]] plays Sister Claire, [[Amy McAllister]] plays Sister Anunciata, [[Sean Mahon]] plays [[Michael A.

It was also nominated for four [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] and three [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nLondon-based journalist [[Martin Sixsmith]] has lost his job as a government adviser. He is approached at a party by the daughter of Philomena Lee. She suggests that he write a story about her mother, who was forced to give up her toddler son Anthony nearly fifty years ago. Though Sixsmith is initially reluctant to write a human interest story, he meets Philomena and decides to investigate her case.\n\nIn 1951, Philomena became pregnant and was sent by her father to [[Sean Ross Abbey]] in [[Roscrea]] in Ireland. After giving birth, she was forced to work in the [[Magdalene asylum|convent laundry]] for four years, with little contact with her son. The nuns gave her son up for adoption without giving Philomena a chance to say goodbye. She kept her lost son a secret from her family for nearly fifty years.\n\nMartin and Philomena begin their search at the convent. The nuns claim that the adoption records were destroyed in a fire years earlier; they did not, however, lose the contract she was forced to sign decades ago forbidding her from contacting her son, which Martin considers suspicious. At a pub, the locals tell Martin that the convent burnt the records deliberately, and that most of the children were sold for \u00a31,000 each to [[wealth]]y Americans.\n\nMartin's investigation reaches a dead end in Ireland, but he receives a promising lead from the United States and invites Philomena to accompany him there. His contacts help him discover that Anthony was renamed [[Michael A. Hess]], who became a [[lawyer]] and senior official in the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush]] administrations. When Philomena notices Martin in the background of a photo of Michael, he remembers that he met him years earlier while working in the US. They also learn that he has been dead for eight years.\n\nPhilomena decides she wants to meet people who knew Michael and learn more about him from them. They visit a former colleague of Michael's and discover that Michael was [[Homosexuality|gay]] and died of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. They also visit his sister Mary, who was adopted at the same time from the convent, and learn that they were both [[Psychological abuse|emotionally]] and [[physical abuse|physically abused]] by their adoptive parents, and hear about his partner Pete Olsson. After avoiding Martin's attempts to contact him, Pete agrees to talk to Philomena. He shows Philomena some videos of his life with Michael. To Martin and Philomena's surprise, they see footage of Michael, dated shortly before he died, at the Abbey where he was adopted, and Pete explains that, although he never told his family, Michael had privately wondered about his birth mother all his life, and had returned to Ireland in his final months to try to find her. Pete informs them that the nuns had told Michael that his mother had abandoned him and that they had lost contact with her. He also reveals that, against his parents' wishes, he had Michael buried in the convent's cemetery.\n\nPhilomena and Martin go to the convent to ask them where Michael's grave is. Despite Philomena's efforts to stop him, Martin angrily breaks into the private quarters and argues with an elderly nun, Sister Hildegarde McNulty, who worked at the convent when Anthony was forcibly adopted. He accuses her of lying to a dying man and denying him the chance to finally reunite with his mother, purely out of self-righteousness. Hildegarde is unrepentant, saying that losing her son was Philomena's penance for having sex out of [[Marriage|wedlock]]. Martin demands an apology, telling her that what she did was un-Christian, but is speechless when Philomena instead chooses to forgive her of her own volition. Philomena then asks to see her son's grave, where Martin tells her he has chosen not to publish the story. Philomena tells him to publish it anyway.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast as billed in film with roles from Credits-->\n<!--Billed actors-->\n<!--Pre-title actors-->\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Philomena Lee]]\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as [[Martin Sixsmith]]\n<!--Post-title billed actors-->\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Sally Mitchell\n* [[Barbara Jefford]] as Sister Hildegarde\n* [[Anna Maxwell Martin]] as Jane\n* [[Mare Winningham]] as Mary\n\n<!--non-billed notable actors with citations-->\nIn addition to the main cast, [[Sophie Kennedy Clark]] plays a young Philomena,<ref>{{cite magazine\n        |url        = http://www.vogue.com/culture/article/10-minutes-with-philomenas-sophie-kennedy-clark/#1\n        |title      = 10 Minutes with Philomena's Sophie Kennedy Clark\n        |last1      = Guiducci\n        |first1     = Mark\n        |date       = 22 November 2013\n        |magazine  = [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]\n        |accessdate = 12 August 2014\n}}</ref> [[Kate Fleetwood]] plays a young Sister Hildegarde, [[Simone Lahbib]] plays Kate Sixsmith, [[Cathy Belton]] plays Sister Claire, [[Amy McAllister]] plays Sister Anunciata, [[Sean Mahon]] plays [[Michael A.

Ahead and during the season, various groups predicted, but failed to anticipate, the high amount of activity.\n\nFour of the season's storms became a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;5 hurricane]], the highest ranking on the scale. [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Emily]] in July reached peak intensity in the [[Caribbean Sea]], later weakening and striking Mexico twice. In August, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] reached peak winds in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] but weakened by the time it struck the U.S. states of [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]]. The most devastating effects of the season were felt on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], where Katrina's [[storm surge]] crippled [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], for weeks and devastated the Mississippi coastline. Katrina became the costliest U.S. hurricane, leaving $125&nbsp;billion in damage{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 2005 values of their respective currencies.|group=\"nb\"}} and 1,833&nbsp;deaths. [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] followed in September, reaching peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico before weakening and hitting near the border of [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]. The season's strongest hurricane, [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]], became the [[List of most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|most intense]] Atlantic hurricane on record, as measured by [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]]. Lasting for ten days in October, Wilma moved over [[Cozumel]], the [[Yucat\u00e1n peninsula]], and [[Florida]], causing $19&nbsp;billion in damage and 48&nbsp;deaths.\n\nThe season's impact was widespread and catastrophic. Its storms caused an estimated 3,912&nbsp;deaths and approximately $171.7&nbsp;billion in damage. It was the costliest season on record at the time, until it\u2019s record was surpassed [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season|12 years later]]. It also produced the second-highest [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) in the Atlantic basin, surpassed only by the [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933 season]]. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 2005, and the first storm \u2013 [[Tropical Storm Arlene (2005)|Arlene]] \u2013 developed on June&nbsp;8. [[Hurricane Dennis]] in July inflicted heavy damage to Cuba. [[Hurricane Stan]] in October was part of a broader weather system that killed 1,668&nbsp;people and caused $3.96&nbsp;billion in damage to eastern Mexico and Central America, with [[Guatemala]] hit the hardest.

Some forecasts predicted how many tropical cyclones would affect a particular country or territory.<ref name=\"CSU Dec 2004\"/><ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/>\n\nThe first of these forecasts was issued by CSU, which predicted on December&nbsp;5, 2004 that the season would be above average and feature 11&nbsp;named storms, 6&nbsp;hurricanes and 3&nbsp;intense hurricanes.<ref name=\"CSU Dec 2004\"/> They also noted that the Caribbean and the entire United States coastline faced an increased risk of a major hurricane making landfall.<ref name=\"CSU Dec 2004\"/> TSR issued its first forecast a few days later and predicted that the season would feature 9.6&nbsp;tropical storms, 5.7&nbsp;hurricanes, 3.3&nbsp;major hurricanes, and predicted that the [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) rating would be 145.<ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/>\n\nDuring January 2005, TSR increased its forecast to 13.9&nbsp;tropical storms, 7.8&nbsp;hurricanes, 3.6&nbsp;major hurricanes, and predicted that the ACE rating would be 157.<ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/> CSU issued its first updated forecast on April&nbsp;1, increasing their prediction to 13&nbsp;tropical storms, 7&nbsp;hurricanes, and 3&nbsp;major hurricanes, with a continued risk of a major hurricane landfall in the Caribbean or United States. The increase was based on the Atlantic continuing to warm and a strong belief that [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o conditions]] would not persist into the hurricane season.<ref name=\"CSU April\"/> On May&nbsp;2, the Cuban Institute of Meteorology (InsMet) issued their seasonal forecast, which predicted that the season would feature 13&nbsp;tropical storms and 7&nbsp;hurricanes.<ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/> This was followed on May&nbsp;16 by NOAA, who predicted a 70% chance of above normal activity, with 12&ndash;15 tropical storms, 7&ndash;9 hurricanes, and 3&ndash;5 major hurricanes.<ref name=\"NOAA May\"/> CSU issued its second forecast update on May&nbsp;31, revising its forecast to 15&nbsp;named storms, 8&nbsp;hurricanes and 4&nbsp;major hurricanes; by this point, the group believed El Ni\u00f1o conditions were unlikely.<ref name=\"CSU June\"/> \n\nIn their July forecast update, TSR anticipated that the season would be exceptionally active and well above average; the group increased their forecast to 15.3&nbsp;tropical storms, 8.8&nbsp;hurricanes, and 4.1&nbsp;major hurricanes, with an ACE rating of 190.<ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/> By the end of July, seven tropical storms and two major hurricanes had developed within the basin, which prompted CSU, InsMet, NOAA and TSR to significantly increase their seasonal forecasts at the start of August.<ref name=\"TSR Aug 2005\"/><ref name=\"NOAA August\"/><ref name=\"CSU August\"/> In their August&nbsp;5 update, CSU predicted that 13&nbsp;more storms would form, with seven more hurricanes and three more major hurricanes.<ref name=\"CSU August\"/> At the start of September, CSU updated their forecasts and predicted that eight more storms would form, with six more hurricanes and three major hurricanes.<ref name=\"CSU September\"/> By the end of September, 17&nbsp;named storms had developed, of which 9 had developed into hurricanes and 4 had become major hurricanes. Within their final update for the year, CSU predicted that October would feature 3&nbsp;named storms, 2&nbsp;hurricanes and 1&nbsp;major hurricane.<ref name=\"CSU October\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Seasonal

Most of the storms formed outside of the deep tropics and Caribbean Sea. There was often higher than normal wind shear across the deep Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a persistent [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over the eastern United States contributed to the lower than normal wind shear over the Gulf of Mexico.

Convection developed atop the center of the nascent disturbance two days later, and satellite data suggested that it was acquiring thermodynamic characteristics exhibited by tropical cyclones. On November&nbsp;22, the NHC classified the low-pressure system as a subtropical storm with the name ''Delta''. Delta took a south-southwestward course and further coalesced its associated showers, leading to its re-designation as a tropical storm on November&nbsp;23. It stalled 1,320&nbsp;miles (2,130&nbsp;km) west-southwest of the [[Canary Islands]] and attained peak winds of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) on November&nbsp;24. Delta moved erratically over the next two days and weakened to a low-end tropical storm in response to increasing wind shear. A strengthening trough over western Europe accelerated Delta towards the east-northeast on November&nbsp;27, concurrent with the brief emergence of an eye and a period of intensification. Delta's tropical characteristics later succumbed to wind shear and cold air, resulting in its extratropical transition on November&nbsp;28 while 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;mi) west-northwest of the western Canary Islands; as an extratropical system, Delta tracked east, passing north of the Canary Islands before moving into [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] on November&nbsp;29, where it dissipated.<ref name=\"DeltaTCR\" />\n\nDelta caused severe damage in the Canary Islands and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned after boats overturned; there were 12&nbsp;people missing from the overturned boat.<ref name=\"DeltaTCR\">{{cite report|author=John L.

A record 15&nbsp;storms attained hurricane status, with [[maximum sustained winds]] of at least 74&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (119&nbsp;[[km/h]]); of those, a record seven became major hurricanes, which are a Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]]. Ahead and during the season, various groups predicted, but failed to anticipate, the high amount of activity.\n\nFour of the season's storms became a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;5 hurricane]], the highest ranking on the scale. [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Emily]] in July reached peak intensity in the [[Caribbean Sea]], later weakening and striking Mexico twice. In August, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] reached peak winds in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] but weakened by the time it struck the U.S. states of [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]]. The most devastating effects of the season were felt on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], where Katrina's [[storm surge]] crippled [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], for weeks and devastated the Mississippi coastline. Katrina became the costliest U.S. hurricane, leaving $125&nbsp;billion in damage{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 2005 values of their respective currencies.|group=\"nb\"}} and 1,833&nbsp;deaths. [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] followed in September, reaching peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico before weakening and hitting near the border of [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]. The season's strongest hurricane, [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]], became the [[List of most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|most intense]] Atlantic hurricane on record, as measured by [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]]. Lasting for ten days in October, Wilma moved over [[Cozumel]], the [[Yucat\u00e1n peninsula]], and [[Florida]], causing $19&nbsp;billion in damage and 48&nbsp;deaths.\n\nThe season's impact was widespread and catastrophic. Its storms caused an estimated 3,912&nbsp;deaths and approximately $171.7&nbsp;billion in damage. It was the costliest season on record at the time, until it\u2019s record was surpassed [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season|12 years later]]. It also produced the second-highest [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) in the Atlantic basin, surpassed only by the [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933 season]]. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 2005, and the first storm \u2013 [[Tropical Storm Arlene (2005)|Arlene]] \u2013 developed on June&nbsp;8. [[Hurricane Dennis]] in July inflicted heavy damage to Cuba. [[Hurricane Stan]] in October was part of a broader weather system that killed 1,668&nbsp;people and caused $3.96&nbsp;billion in damage to eastern Mexico and Central America, with [[Guatemala]] hit the hardest.

Some forecasts predicted how many tropical cyclones would affect a particular country or territory.<ref name=\"CSU Dec 2004\"/><ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/>\n\nThe first of these forecasts was issued by CSU, which predicted on December&nbsp;5, 2004 that the season would be above average and feature 11&nbsp;named storms, 6&nbsp;hurricanes and 3&nbsp;intense hurricanes.<ref name=\"CSU Dec 2004\"/> They also noted that the Caribbean and the entire United States coastline faced an increased risk of a major hurricane making landfall.<ref name=\"CSU Dec 2004\"/> TSR issued its first forecast a few days later and predicted that the season would feature 9.6&nbsp;tropical storms, 5.7&nbsp;hurricanes, 3.3&nbsp;major hurricanes, and predicted that the [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) rating would be 145.<ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/>\n\nDuring January 2005, TSR increased its forecast to 13.9&nbsp;tropical storms, 7.8&nbsp;hurricanes, 3.6&nbsp;major hurricanes, and predicted that the ACE rating would be 157.<ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/> CSU issued its first updated forecast on April&nbsp;1, increasing their prediction to 13&nbsp;tropical storms, 7&nbsp;hurricanes, and 3&nbsp;major hurricanes, with a continued risk of a major hurricane landfall in the Caribbean or United States. The increase was based on the Atlantic continuing to warm and a strong belief that [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o conditions]] would not persist into the hurricane season.<ref name=\"CSU April\"/> On May&nbsp;2, the Cuban Institute of Meteorology (InsMet) issued their seasonal forecast, which predicted that the season would feature 13&nbsp;tropical storms and 7&nbsp;hurricanes.<ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/> This was followed on May&nbsp;16 by NOAA, who predicted a 70% chance of above normal activity, with 12&ndash;15 tropical storms, 7&ndash;9 hurricanes, and 3&ndash;5 major hurricanes.<ref name=\"NOAA May\"/> CSU issued its second forecast update on May&nbsp;31, revising its forecast to 15&nbsp;named storms, 8&nbsp;hurricanes and 4&nbsp;major hurricanes; by this point, the group believed El Ni\u00f1o conditions were unlikely.<ref name=\"CSU June\"/> \n\nIn their July forecast update, TSR anticipated that the season would be exceptionally active and well above average; the group increased their forecast to 15.3&nbsp;tropical storms, 8.8&nbsp;hurricanes, and 4.1&nbsp;major hurricanes, with an ACE rating of 190.<ref name=\"TSR July 2005\"/> By the end of July, seven tropical storms and two major hurricanes had developed within the basin, which prompted CSU, InsMet, NOAA and TSR to significantly increase their seasonal forecasts at the start of August.<ref name=\"TSR Aug 2005\"/><ref name=\"NOAA August\"/><ref name=\"CSU August\"/> In their August&nbsp;5 update, CSU predicted that 13&nbsp;more storms would form, with seven more hurricanes and three more major hurricanes.<ref name=\"CSU August\"/> At the start of September, CSU updated their forecasts and predicted that eight more storms would form, with six more hurricanes and three major hurricanes.<ref name=\"CSU September\"/> By the end of September, 17&nbsp;named storms had developed, of which 9 had developed into hurricanes and 4 had become major hurricanes.

Most of the storms formed outside of the deep tropics and Caribbean Sea. There was often higher than normal wind shear across the deep Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a persistent [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over the eastern United States contributed to the lower than normal wind shear over the Gulf of Mexico.

Convection developed atop the center of the nascent disturbance two days later, and satellite data suggested that it was acquiring thermodynamic characteristics exhibited by tropical cyclones. On November&nbsp;22, the NHC classified the low-pressure system as a subtropical storm with the name ''Delta''. Delta took a south-southwestward course and further coalesced its associated showers, leading to its re-designation as a tropical storm on November&nbsp;23. It stalled 1,320&nbsp;miles (2,130&nbsp;km) west-southwest of the [[Canary Islands]] and attained peak winds of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) on November&nbsp;24. Delta moved erratically over the next two days and weakened to a low-end tropical storm in response to increasing wind shear. A strengthening trough over western Europe accelerated Delta towards the east-northeast on November&nbsp;27, concurrent with the brief emergence of an eye and a period of intensification. Delta's tropical characteristics later succumbed to wind shear and cold air, resulting in its extratropical transition on November&nbsp;28 while 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;mi) west-northwest of the western Canary Islands; as an extratropical system, Delta tracked east, passing north of the Canary Islands before moving into [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] on November&nbsp;29, where it dissipated.<ref name=\"DeltaTCR\" />\n\nDelta caused severe damage in the Canary Islands and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned after boats overturned; there were 12&nbsp;people missing from the overturned boat.<ref name=\"DeltaTCR\">{{cite report|author=John L.

He became the president of the Executive Council of the General Diet of the People of Corsica, and also designed and wrote the [[Corsican Constitution|Constitution]] of the state.\n\nThe [[Corsican Republic]] was a [[representative democracy]] asserting that the elected Diet of Corsican representatives had no master. Paoli held his office by election and not by appointment. It made him [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces as well as chief magistrate. Paoli's government claimed the same jurisdiction as the [[Republic of Genoa]]. In terms of ''de facto'' exercise of power, the Genoese held the coastal cities, which they could defend from their citadels, but the Corsican republic controlled the rest of the island from [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]], its capital.<ref>{{cite book|title=Journal of a Landscape Painter in Corsica|first=Edward|last=Lear|publisher=Robert John Bush|year=1870|location=London|pages=260}} Downloadable Google Books.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[French conquest of Corsica]] in 1768, Paoli oversaw the Corsican resistance. Following the defeat of Corsican forces at the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]] he was forced into exile in Britain where he was a celebrated figure. He returned after the [[French Revolution]], of which he was initially supportive. He later broke with the revolutionaries and helped to create the [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]] which lasted between 1794 and 1796. After the island was re-occupied by France he again went into exile in Britain where he died in 1807.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nPaoli was born in the hamlet of Stretta, [[Morosaglia]] commune, part of the ancient parish of Rostino, [[Haute-Corse]], Corsica. He was the second son of the physician and patriot [[Giacinto Paoli]], who was to become one of three \"Generals of the People\" in the Corsican nationalist movement that rebelled against rule by the [[Republic of Genoa]], which at that time they regarded as corrupt and tyrannical. Prior to that century Corsicans more or less accepted Genoan rule. By 1729, the year of first rebellion, the Genovese were regarded as failing in their task of government. The major problems were the high murder rate because of the custom of [[Feud|vendetta]], the raiding of coastal villages by the [[Barbary pirates]], oppressive taxes and economic depression.\n\nIn the rebellion of 1729 over a new tax, the Genovese withdrew into their citadels and sent for foreign interventions, first from Austria and then from France. Defeated by professional troops the Corsicans ceded violence but kept their organisation. After surrendering to the French in 1739 Giacinto Paoli went into exile in [[Naples]] with his then 14-year-old son, Pasquale. An older brother, Clemente, remained at home as a liaison to the revolutionary diet, or assembly of the people.\n\nCorsica was subsequently distracted by the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] during which troops of a number of countries temporarily occupied the cities of Corsica. In Naples Giacinto perceiving that he had a talented son spared no effort or expense in his education, which was primarily classical. The enlightenment of which Pasquale was to become a part was neo-classical in its art, architecture and sentiments. Paoli is said once to have heard an old man on the road reciting [[Vergil]], walked up behind him, clapped him on the back, and resumed reciting at the point where the other had left off.<ref name=greg/> In 1741 Pasquale joined the Corsican regiment of the royal [[Naples|Neapolitan]] army and served in [[Calabria]] under his father.\n\nCorsican exiles in Italy were seeking assistance for the revolution, including a skilled general. In 1736 the exiles of Genoa had discovered [[Theodore of Corsica|Theodor von Neuhoff]], a soldier of fortune whom they were willing to make king, but he was unsuccessful and in 1754 languished in debtors' prison in London. The young Pasquale became of interest when in opposition to a plan to ask the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] to assume command he devised a plan for a native Corsican government. In that year Giacinto decided that Pasquale was ready to supplant Theodor and wrote to Vincente recommending that a general election be held. The subsequent popular election called by Vincente at [[Castifao|Caccia]] made Pasquale General-in-Chief of Corsica, commander of all resistance.\n\nCorsica at that time was still under the influence of feuding clans, as a result of which only the highland clans had voted in the election. The lowlanders now held an election of their own and elected Mario Matra as commander, who promptly attacked the supporters of Paoli. Moreover, Matra called on the Genovese for assistance, dragging Paoli into a conflict with them. Matra was killed shortly in battle and his support among the Corsicans collapsed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Essays, 1790\u20131890|first=Edward|last=Boyle|year=1977|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0-8369-0237-8|pages=Chapter 5, Pasquale Paoli|nopp=true}}</ref>\n\nPaoli's next task was to confine the Genovese to their citadels. His second was to design a constitution which when ratified by the population in 1755 set up a new republic, a representative democracy. Its first election made Paoli president, supplanting his former position.<ref>{{cite book|pages=205\u2013206|title=Traditions of War: Occupation, Resistance, and the Law|first=Karma|last=Nabulsi|publisher=Oxford University press|year=1999|isbn=0-19-829407-7}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nImage:PascalPaoli.jpg|Pasquale Paoli by [[Henry Benbridge]], 1768\nImage:Pasquale Paoli.jpg|From a book by [[Edward Joy Morris]], published 1855\nImage:Pasquale Paoli by W Beckey.jpg|Oil by Sir [[William Beechey]], about 1805\n</gallery>\n\n===President of the Corsican Republic===\n[[File:Flag of Corsica.svg|thumb|left|200px|Flag of the Corsican Republic (1755\u20131769)]]\n{{Main article|Corsican Republic}}\nIn November 1755, the people of Corsica ratified a constitution that proclaimed Corsica a sovereign nation, independent from the Republic of Genoa. This was the first constitution written under [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles. The new president and author of the constitution occupied himself with building a modern state; for example, he founded a university at [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]].<ref>{{cite book|title=France|first=Nicola|last=Williams|author2=Oliver Berry|author3=Steve Fallon|author4=Catherine Le Nevez|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetfran00nico/page/942 942]|isbn=1-74104-233-X|year=2007|publisher=Lonely Planet|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetfran00nico/page/942}}</ref>\n\n===French invasion===\n{{Main article|French Conquest of Corsica}}\nSeeing that they had in effect lost control of Corsica, Genoa responded by selling Corsica to the French by secret treaty in 1764 and allowing Genovese troops to be replaced quietly by French ones. When all was ready in 1768 the French made a public announcement of the union of Corsica with France and proceeded to the reconquest.<ref>{{cite book|pages=4|title=The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte|first=Sabine|last=Baring-Gould|year=2006|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|isbn=0-543-95815-9 |ref=harv}}</ref> Paoli fought a guerilla war from the mountains but in 1769 he was defeated in the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]] by vastly superior forces and took refuge in England. Corsica officially became a [[Provinces of France|French province]] in 1770.\n\n===First exile===\n{{The Club|align=right|size=400px}}\nIn London, Paoli attracted the attention of the [[Johnsonian]] circle almost immediately for which his expansive personality made him a natural fit. By the time Paoli entered the scene it had in part taken the form of [[The Club (Literary Club)|The Club]] of mainly successful men of a liberal frame of mind. Such behaviour as Paoli showing his bullet-ridden coat to all visitors and then demanding a gratuity for the observation were amusing to the group, which had begun when its members were starting their careers and according to its chronicler [[James Boswell]] were themselves needy.\n\nPaoli's memoirs were recorded by Boswell in his book, ''[[An Account of Corsica]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=James|title=An account of Corsica, the journal of a tour to that island, and memoirs of Pascal Paoli (1769)|year=1768|publisher=E. and C. Dilly|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/accountofcorsica00bosw#page/n7/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\nAfter a series of interviews with King [[George III]], Paoli was given a pension by the crown with the understanding that if he ever returned to Corsica in a position of authority he would support British interests against the French. This was not, however, a cynical arrangement. Paoli became sincerely pro-British and had a genuine affection for his new friends, including the king, a predisposition that in the [[French Revolution]] led him into the royalist camp. The arrangement also was not a treaty of any sort, as at the time neither Paoli nor George III would have any idea of future circumstances.\n\n===President of the department of Corsica===\nBy the time of the [[French revolution]] the name of Paoli had become something of an idol of liberty and democracy. In 1790 the revolutionary National Assembly in Paris passed a decree incorporating Corsica into France, essentially duplicating the work of 1780 but under a new authority. It granted amnesty to exiles, on which Paoli embarked immediately for Corsica. He arrived in time for the election of departmental officers at Orezza, ran for President, and was elected unanimously.<ref>{{harvp|Baring-Gould|2006|page=38}}</ref> [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], organiser of the elections and active [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]], did not run at this time, but he was as much an admirer of Paoli as anyone.\n\nNapoleon, on leave from his artillery regiment, returned to the regiment at [[Auxonne]], where he was working on a history of Corsica. Writing to Paoli he asked his opinion on some of it and for historical documents. The differences between the two men became apparent. Paoli thought the history amateurish and too impassioned and refused the documents; Napoleon at this point had no idea of Paoli's regal connections in Britain or moderate, even sympathetic, sentiments about royalty.<ref>{{harvp|Baring-Gould|2006|page=40}}</ref>\n\n===President of the British protectorate===\n{{Main article|Anglo-Corsican Kingdom}}\nPaoli split from the [[French Revolution]] over the issue of the execution of the king and threw in his lot with the royalist party. He did not make these views generally known, but when the revolutionary government ordered him to take [[Sardinia]] he put his nephew in charge of the expedition with secret orders to lose the conflict. In that case he was acting as a British agent, as the British had an interest in Sardinia they could not pursue if the French occupied it.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Maddalena, 22/25 February 1793|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_maddalena.html|work=Military Subjects: Battles & Campaigns|publisher=The Napoleon Series|date=1995\u20132004|accessdate=29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nHe had however also sent [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]] as a colonel in command of two companies of Corsican guard (unofficially reinforced by 6000 revolutionaries from [[Marseille]]), which participated in the assault on [[La Maddalena]] Island in February 1793. It failed because the commander, Pietro Paolo Colonna-Cesari, failed to take appropriate military action, because the island had been reinforced just prior to the attack, and because the defenders seemed to know exactly where and when the revolutionaries were going to strike.\n\nNapoleon perceived the situation during the first confrontation with his commander and assumed de facto command but the attack failed and he barely escaped. Enraged, after having been a strong supporter and admirer of Paoli, he and the entire Bonaparte family denounced Paoli as a traitor before the [[French National Convention]]. Arrest warrants were issued and sent to Corsica along with a force intended to take the citadels from the royalists{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2016}}{{clarify|pre-text=which?|reason=The sale of Corsica was before the French revolution|date=October 2010}}, who had supplanted the Genovese after the sale of Corsica. Combining together the Paolists and royalists defeated the Bonapartes and drove them from the island.\n\nPaoli then summoned a ''consulta'' (assembly) at Corte in 1793, with himself as president and formally seceded from France. He requested the protection of the British government, then at war with revolutionary France. In 1794 British sent a fleet under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Admiral Samuel Hood]]. This fleet had just been ejected from the French port of [[Toulon]] by a revolutionary army following the plan of Napoleon Bonaparte, for which he was promoted to Brigadier General. The royalists at Toulon also had requested British protection. Napoleon was now dispatched to deal with Italy as commander of the French forces there.\n\nFor a short time, Corsica was a [[protectorate]] of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], chiefly by the exertions of Hood's fleet (e.g. in the [[Siege of Calvi]]), and Paoli's co-operation. This period has become known as the \"[[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]]\" because George III was accepted as sovereign head of state, but this was not an incorporation of Corsica into the British Empire. The relationship between Paoli's government and the British was never clearly defined, resulting in numerous questions of authority. At last the crown invited Paoli to resign and return to exile in Britain with a pension, which, having no other options now, he did. Not long after, the French reconquered the island and all questions of Corsican sovereignty came to an end until the 20th century.\n\n===Second exile===\n[[File:Buste Pasquale Paoli.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cenotaph]] of Pasquale Paoli, at Westminster Abbey (London).]]\nPaoli set sail for England in October 1795, where he lived out his final years. Pasquale Paoli died on 5 February 1807 and was buried in [[Old St. Pancras]] Churchyard in London. His name is listed on the 1879 [[Burdett-Coutts Memorial]] amongst the important graves lost.\n\nA bust was placed in [[Westminster Abbey]]. In 1889 his bones were brought to Corsica in a British frigate and interred at the family home under a memorial in the Italian language.<ref>{{cite news |title=The removal of the mortal remains of PASCAL PAOLI from this country to Corsica took place on Saturday, in accordance with the expressed desire of the famous patriot's countrymen |newspaper=The Morning Post |location=London |date=2 September 1889 |page=4 }}</ref>\n\nPasquale never married and as far as is known had no heirs. Information about his intimate life is mainly lacking; however, it is believed he had an affair with [[Maria Cosway]]. However, [[Robert Harvey (UK politician)|Robert Harvey]] claims he was homosexual, when discussing how [[Carlo Buonaparte]] became Paoli's personal secretary.<ref>''The War of Wars'', Robert Harvey, Constable and Robinson Ltd, 2006, pp. 59</ref>\n\n==Pasquale Paoli and Italian irredentism==\nInsofar as [[Italian irredentism]] was a political or historical movement, Pasquale Paoli lived long before its time and did not have anything to do with the movement that ended with the occupation of Corsica by Italian fascist troops in late 1942, during [[World War II]].\n\nThere is no question, however, that Paoli was sympathetic to [[Italian culture]] and regarded his own native language as an Italian dialect (Corsican is an [[Italic language]] closely related to [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and, to some extent, [[Sardinian language]]). He was considered by [[Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo]], who collected his ''Lettere'' (Letters), as one of the precursors of the [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentism]]. The \"Babbu di a Patria\" (Father of the fatherland), as was nicknamed Pasquale Paoli by the [[Corsican Italians]], wrote in his Letters<ref>N. Tommaseo. \"Lettere di Pasquale de Paoli\" (in Archivio storico italiano, 1st series, vol. XI).</ref> the following appeal in 1768 against the French invaders:\n\n[[File:Pascal Paoli01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monument to Pasquale Paoli at [[Ile Rousse]] in Corsica: the Corsican hero made Italian the official language of his Corsican Republic in 1755]]\n\n<blockquote>''We are Corsicans by birth and sentiment, but first of all we feel Italian by language, origins, customs, traditions; and Italians are all brothers and united in the face of history and in the face of God ... As Corsicans we wish to be neither slaves nor \"rebels\" and as Italians we have the right to deal as equals with the other Italian brothers ... Either we shall be free or we shall be nothing... Either we shall win or we shall die (against the French), weapons in hand ... The war against France is right and holy as the name of God is holy and right, and here on our mountains will appear for Italy the sun of liberty....''</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(\"Siamo c\u00f2rsi per nascita e sentimento ma prima di tutto ci sentiamo italiani per lingua, origini, costumi, tradizioni e gli italiani sono tutti fratelli e solidali di fronte alla storia e di fronte a Dio\u2026 Come c\u00f2rsi non-vogliamo essere n\u00e9 schiavi n\u00e9 \"ribelli\" e come italiani abbiamo il diritto di trattare da pari con gli altri fratelli d'Italia\u2026 O saremo liberi o non-saremo niente\u2026 O vinceremo con l'onore o soccomberemo (contro i francesi) con le armi in mano... La guerra con la Francia \u00e8 giusta e santa come santo e giusto \u00e8 il nome di Dio, e qui sui nostri monti spunter\u00e0 per l'Italia il sole della libert\u00e0\u2026\")</blockquote>\n\nPasquale Paoli wanted the [[Italian language]] to be the official language of his Corsican Republic. His [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755 was in Italian and the short-lived university he founded in the city of [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] in 1765 used Italian.\n\n==Paoli commemorated in the United States==\nThe American [[Sons of Liberty]] movement were inspired by Paoli. [[Ebenezer Mackintosh|Ebenezer McIntosh]], a leader of the Sons of Liberty, named his son Paschal Paoli McIntosh in honour of him. In 1768, the editor of the ''[[New York Journal]]'' described Paoli as \"''the greatest man on earth''\". Several places in the United States are named after him. These include:\n*[[Paoli, Colorado]]\n*[[Paoli, Indiana]]\n*[[Paoli, Kentucky]]\n*[[Paoli, Oklahoma]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania]], which was named after \"General Paoli's Tavern\" a meeting-point of the [[Sons of Liberty]] and homage to the \"General of the Corsicans\".\n*[[Paoli, Wisconsin]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Corsican Italians]]\n*[[History of Corsica]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle = Paoli, Pasquale|volume=20}}\n*[[James Boswell]]'s ''Account of Corsica and Memoirs of P Paoli'' (1768)\n*N Tommaseo, \"Lettere di Pasquale de Paoli\" (in ''Archivio storico italiano'', 1st series, vol. xi.), and ''Della Corsica'', etc. (ibid., ''nuova serie'', vol. xi., parte ii.);\n*Pompei, ''De L'\u00e9tat de la Corse'' (Paris, 1821); Giovanni Livi, ''Lettere inedite di Pasquale Paoli'' (in ''Arch. stor. ital.'', 5th series, vols. v. and vi.);\n*Bartoli, ''Historia di Pascal Paoli'' (Bastia, 1891); Lencisa, ''P.

He became the president of the Executive Council of the General Diet of the People of Corsica, and also designed and wrote the [[Corsican Constitution|Constitution]] of the state.\n\nThe [[Corsican Republic]] was a [[representative democracy]] asserting that the elected Diet of Corsican representatives had no master. Paoli held his office by election and not by appointment. It made him [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces as well as chief magistrate. Paoli's government claimed the same jurisdiction as the [[Republic of Genoa]]. In terms of ''de facto'' exercise of power, the Genoese held the coastal cities, which they could defend from their citadels, but the Corsican republic controlled the rest of the island from [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]], its capital.<ref>{{cite book|title=Journal of a Landscape Painter in Corsica|first=Edward|last=Lear|publisher=Robert John Bush|year=1870|location=London|pages=260}} Downloadable Google Books.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[French conquest of Corsica]] in 1768, Paoli oversaw the Corsican resistance. Following the defeat of Corsican forces at the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]] he was forced into exile in Britain where he was a celebrated figure. He returned after the [[French Revolution]], of which he was initially supportive. He later broke with the revolutionaries and helped to create the [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]] which lasted between 1794 and 1796. After the island was re-occupied by France he again went into exile in Britain where he died in 1807.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nPaoli was born in the hamlet of Stretta, [[Morosaglia]] commune, part of the ancient parish of Rostino, [[Haute-Corse]], Corsica. He was the second son of the physician and patriot [[Giacinto Paoli]], who was to become one of three \"Generals of the People\" in the Corsican nationalist movement that rebelled against rule by the [[Republic of Genoa]], which at that time they regarded as corrupt and tyrannical. Prior to that century Corsicans more or less accepted Genoan rule. By 1729, the year of first rebellion, the Genovese were regarded as failing in their task of government. The major problems were the high murder rate because of the custom of [[Feud|vendetta]], the raiding of coastal villages by the [[Barbary pirates]], oppressive taxes and economic depression.\n\nIn the rebellion of 1729 over a new tax, the Genovese withdrew into their citadels and sent for foreign interventions, first from Austria and then from France. Defeated by professional troops the Corsicans ceded violence but kept their organisation. After surrendering to the French in 1739 Giacinto Paoli went into exile in [[Naples]] with his then 14-year-old son, Pasquale. An older brother, Clemente, remained at home as a liaison to the revolutionary diet, or assembly of the people.\n\nCorsica was subsequently distracted by the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] during which troops of a number of countries temporarily occupied the cities of Corsica. In Naples Giacinto perceiving that he had a talented son spared no effort or expense in his education, which was primarily classical. The enlightenment of which Pasquale was to become a part was neo-classical in its art, architecture and sentiments. Paoli is said once to have heard an old man on the road reciting [[Vergil]], walked up behind him, clapped him on the back, and resumed reciting at the point where the other had left off.<ref name=greg/> In 1741 Pasquale joined the Corsican regiment of the royal [[Naples|Neapolitan]] army and served in [[Calabria]] under his father.\n\nCorsican exiles in Italy were seeking assistance for the revolution, including a skilled general. In 1736 the exiles of Genoa had discovered [[Theodore of Corsica|Theodor von Neuhoff]], a soldier of fortune whom they were willing to make king, but he was unsuccessful and in 1754 languished in debtors' prison in London. The young Pasquale became of interest when in opposition to a plan to ask the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] to assume command he devised a plan for a native Corsican government. In that year Giacinto decided that Pasquale was ready to supplant Theodor and wrote to Vincente recommending that a general election be held. The subsequent popular election called by Vincente at [[Castifao|Caccia]] made Pasquale General-in-Chief of Corsica, commander of all resistance.\n\nCorsica at that time was still under the influence of feuding clans, as a result of which only the highland clans had voted in the election. The lowlanders now held an election of their own and elected Mario Matra as commander, who promptly attacked the supporters of Paoli. Moreover, Matra called on the Genovese for assistance, dragging Paoli into a conflict with them. Matra was killed shortly in battle and his support among the Corsicans collapsed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Essays, 1790\u20131890|first=Edward|last=Boyle|year=1977|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0-8369-0237-8|pages=Chapter 5, Pasquale Paoli|nopp=true}}</ref>\n\nPaoli's next task was to confine the Genovese to their citadels. His second was to design a constitution which when ratified by the population in 1755 set up a new republic, a representative democracy. Its first election made Paoli president, supplanting his former position.<ref>{{cite book|pages=205\u2013206|title=Traditions of War: Occupation, Resistance, and the Law|first=Karma|last=Nabulsi|publisher=Oxford University press|year=1999|isbn=0-19-829407-7}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nImage:PascalPaoli.jpg|Pasquale Paoli by [[Henry Benbridge]], 1768\nImage:Pasquale Paoli.jpg|From a book by [[Edward Joy Morris]], published 1855\nImage:Pasquale Paoli by W Beckey.jpg|Oil by Sir [[William Beechey]], about 1805\n</gallery>\n\n===President of the Corsican Republic===\n[[File:Flag of Corsica.svg|thumb|left|200px|Flag of the Corsican Republic (1755\u20131769)]]\n{{Main article|Corsican Republic}}\nIn November 1755, the people of Corsica ratified a constitution that proclaimed Corsica a sovereign nation, independent from the Republic of Genoa. This was the first constitution written under [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles. The new president and author of the constitution occupied himself with building a modern state; for example, he founded a university at [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]].<ref>{{cite book|title=France|first=Nicola|last=Williams|author2=Oliver Berry|author3=Steve Fallon|author4=Catherine Le Nevez|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetfran00nico/page/942 942]|isbn=1-74104-233-X|year=2007|publisher=Lonely Planet|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetfran00nico/page/942}}</ref>\n\n===French invasion===\n{{Main article|French Conquest of Corsica}}\nSeeing that they had in effect lost control of Corsica, Genoa responded by selling Corsica to the French by secret treaty in 1764 and allowing Genovese troops to be replaced quietly by French ones. When all was ready in 1768 the French made a public announcement of the union of Corsica with France and proceeded to the reconquest.<ref>{{cite book|pages=4|title=The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte|first=Sabine|last=Baring-Gould|year=2006|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|isbn=0-543-95815-9 |ref=harv}}</ref> Paoli fought a guerilla war from the mountains but in 1769 he was defeated in the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]] by vastly superior forces and took refuge in England. Corsica officially became a [[Provinces of France|French province]] in 1770.\n\n===First exile===\n{{The Club|align=right|size=400px}}\nIn London, Paoli attracted the attention of the [[Johnsonian]] circle almost immediately for which his expansive personality made him a natural fit. By the time Paoli entered the scene it had in part taken the form of [[The Club (Literary Club)|The Club]] of mainly successful men of a liberal frame of mind. Such behaviour as Paoli showing his bullet-ridden coat to all visitors and then demanding a gratuity for the observation were amusing to the group, which had begun when its members were starting their careers and according to its chronicler [[James Boswell]] were themselves needy.\n\nPaoli's memoirs were recorded by Boswell in his book, ''[[An Account of Corsica]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=James|title=An account of Corsica, the journal of a tour to that island, and memoirs of Pascal Paoli (1769)|year=1768|publisher=E. and C. Dilly|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/accountofcorsica00bosw#page/n7/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\nAfter a series of interviews with King [[George III]], Paoli was given a pension by the crown with the understanding that if he ever returned to Corsica in a position of authority he would support British interests against the French. This was not, however, a cynical arrangement. Paoli became sincerely pro-British and had a genuine affection for his new friends, including the king, a predisposition that in the [[French Revolution]] led him into the royalist camp. The arrangement also was not a treaty of any sort, as at the time neither Paoli nor George III would have any idea of future circumstances.\n\n===President of the department of Corsica===\nBy the time of the [[French revolution]] the name of Paoli had become something of an idol of liberty and democracy. In 1790 the revolutionary National Assembly in Paris passed a decree incorporating Corsica into France, essentially duplicating the work of 1780 but under a new authority. It granted amnesty to exiles, on which Paoli embarked immediately for Corsica. He arrived in time for the election of departmental officers at Orezza, ran for President, and was elected unanimously.<ref>{{harvp|Baring-Gould|2006|page=38}}</ref> [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], organiser of the elections and active [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]], did not run at this time, but he was as much an admirer of Paoli as anyone.\n\nNapoleon, on leave from his artillery regiment, returned to the regiment at [[Auxonne]], where he was working on a history of Corsica. Writing to Paoli he asked his opinion on some of it and for historical documents. The differences between the two men became apparent. Paoli thought the history amateurish and too impassioned and refused the documents; Napoleon at this point had no idea of Paoli's regal connections in Britain or moderate, even sympathetic, sentiments about royalty.<ref>{{harvp|Baring-Gould|2006|page=40}}</ref>\n\n===President of the British protectorate===\n{{Main article|Anglo-Corsican Kingdom}}\nPaoli split from the [[French Revolution]] over the issue of the execution of the king and threw in his lot with the royalist party. He did not make these views generally known, but when the revolutionary government ordered him to take [[Sardinia]] he put his nephew in charge of the expedition with secret orders to lose the conflict. In that case he was acting as a British agent, as the British had an interest in Sardinia they could not pursue if the French occupied it.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Maddalena, 22/25 February 1793|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_maddalena.html|work=Military Subjects: Battles & Campaigns|publisher=The Napoleon Series|date=1995\u20132004|accessdate=29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nHe had however also sent [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]] as a colonel in command of two companies of Corsican guard (unofficially reinforced by 6000 revolutionaries from [[Marseille]]), which participated in the assault on [[La Maddalena]] Island in February 1793. It failed because the commander, Pietro Paolo Colonna-Cesari, failed to take appropriate military action, because the island had been reinforced just prior to the attack, and because the defenders seemed to know exactly where and when the revolutionaries were going to strike.\n\nNapoleon perceived the situation during the first confrontation with his commander and assumed de facto command but the attack failed and he barely escaped. Enraged, after having been a strong supporter and admirer of Paoli, he and the entire Bonaparte family denounced Paoli as a traitor before the [[French National Convention]]. Arrest warrants were issued and sent to Corsica along with a force intended to take the citadels from the royalists{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2016}}{{clarify|pre-text=which?|reason=The sale of Corsica was before the French revolution|date=October 2010}}, who had supplanted the Genovese after the sale of Corsica. Combining together the Paolists and royalists defeated the Bonapartes and drove them from the island.\n\nPaoli then summoned a ''consulta'' (assembly) at Corte in 1793, with himself as president and formally seceded from France. He requested the protection of the British government, then at war with revolutionary France. In 1794 British sent a fleet under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Admiral Samuel Hood]]. This fleet had just been ejected from the French port of [[Toulon]] by a revolutionary army following the plan of Napoleon Bonaparte, for which he was promoted to Brigadier General. The royalists at Toulon also had requested British protection. Napoleon was now dispatched to deal with Italy as commander of the French forces there.\n\nFor a short time, Corsica was a [[protectorate]] of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], chiefly by the exertions of Hood's fleet (e.g. in the [[Siege of Calvi]]), and Paoli's co-operation. This period has become known as the \"[[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]]\" because George III was accepted as sovereign head of state, but this was not an incorporation of Corsica into the British Empire. The relationship between Paoli's government and the British was never clearly defined, resulting in numerous questions of authority. At last the crown invited Paoli to resign and return to exile in Britain with a pension, which, having no other options now, he did. Not long after, the French reconquered the island and all questions of Corsican sovereignty came to an end until the 20th century.\n\n===Second exile===\n[[File:Buste Pasquale Paoli.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cenotaph]] of Pasquale Paoli, at Westminster Abbey (London).]]\nPaoli set sail for England in October 1795, where he lived out his final years. Pasquale Paoli died on 5 February 1807 and was buried in [[Old St. Pancras]] Churchyard in London. His name is listed on the 1879 [[Burdett-Coutts Memorial]] amongst the important graves lost.\n\nA bust was placed in [[Westminster Abbey]]. In 1889 his bones were brought to Corsica in a British frigate and interred at the family home under a memorial in the Italian language.<ref>{{cite news |title=The removal of the mortal remains of PASCAL PAOLI from this country to Corsica took place on Saturday, in accordance with the expressed desire of the famous patriot's countrymen |newspaper=The Morning Post |location=London |date=2 September 1889 |page=4 }}</ref>\n\nPasquale never married and as far as is known had no heirs. Information about his intimate life is mainly lacking; however, it is believed he had an affair with [[Maria Cosway]]. However, [[Robert Harvey (UK politician)|Robert Harvey]] claims he was homosexual, when discussing how [[Carlo Buonaparte]] became Paoli's personal secretary.<ref>''The War of Wars'', Robert Harvey, Constable and Robinson Ltd, 2006, pp. 59</ref>\n\n==Pasquale Paoli and Italian irredentism==\nInsofar as [[Italian irredentism]] was a political or historical movement, Pasquale Paoli lived long before its time and did not have anything to do with the movement that ended with the occupation of Corsica by Italian fascist troops in late 1942, during [[World War II]].\n\nThere is no question, however, that Paoli was sympathetic to [[Italian culture]] and regarded his own native language as an Italian dialect (Corsican is an [[Italic language]] closely related to [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and, to some extent, [[Sardinian language]]). He was considered by [[Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo]], who collected his ''Lettere'' (Letters), as one of the precursors of the [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentism]]. The \"Babbu di a Patria\" (Father of the fatherland), as was nicknamed Pasquale Paoli by the [[Corsican Italians]], wrote in his Letters<ref>N. Tommaseo. \"Lettere di Pasquale de Paoli\" (in Archivio storico italiano, 1st series, vol. XI).</ref> the following appeal in 1768 against the French invaders:\n\n[[File:Pascal Paoli01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monument to Pasquale Paoli at [[Ile Rousse]] in Corsica: the Corsican hero made Italian the official language of his Corsican Republic in 1755]]\n\n<blockquote>''We are Corsicans by birth and sentiment, but first of all we feel Italian by language, origins, customs, traditions; and Italians are all brothers and united in the face of history and in the face of God ... As Corsicans we wish to be neither slaves nor \"rebels\" and as Italians we have the right to deal as equals with the other Italian brothers ... Either we shall be free or we shall be nothing... Either we shall win or we shall die (against the French), weapons in hand ... The war against France is right and holy as the name of God is holy and right, and here on our mountains will appear for Italy the sun of liberty....''</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(\"Siamo c\u00f2rsi per nascita e sentimento ma prima di tutto ci sentiamo italiani per lingua, origini, costumi, tradizioni e gli italiani sono tutti fratelli e solidali di fronte alla storia e di fronte a Dio\u2026 Come c\u00f2rsi non-vogliamo essere n\u00e9 schiavi n\u00e9 \"ribelli\" e come italiani abbiamo il diritto di trattare da pari con gli altri fratelli d'Italia\u2026 O saremo liberi o non-saremo niente\u2026 O vinceremo con l'onore o soccomberemo (contro i francesi) con le armi in mano... La guerra con la Francia \u00e8 giusta e santa come santo e giusto \u00e8 il nome di Dio, e qui sui nostri monti spunter\u00e0 per l'Italia il sole della libert\u00e0\u2026\")</blockquote>\n\nPasquale Paoli wanted the [[Italian language]] to be the official language of his Corsican Republic. His [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755 was in Italian and the short-lived university he founded in the city of [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] in 1765 used Italian.\n\n==Paoli commemorated in the United States==\nThe American [[Sons of Liberty]] movement were inspired by Paoli. [[Ebenezer Mackintosh|Ebenezer McIntosh]], a leader of the Sons of Liberty, named his son Paschal Paoli McIntosh in honour of him. In 1768, the editor of the ''[[New York Journal]]'' described Paoli as \"''the greatest man on earth''\". Several places in the United States are named after him. These include:\n*[[Paoli, Colorado]]\n*[[Paoli, Indiana]]\n*[[Paoli, Kentucky]]\n*[[Paoli, Oklahoma]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania]], which was named after \"General Paoli's Tavern\" a meeting-point of the [[Sons of Liberty]] and homage to the \"General of the Corsicans\".\n*[[Paoli, Wisconsin]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Corsican Italians]]\n*[[History of Corsica]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle = Paoli, Pasquale|volume=20}}\n*[[James Boswell]]'s ''Account of Corsica and Memoirs of P Paoli'' (1768)\n*N Tommaseo, \"Lettere di Pasquale de Paoli\" (in ''Archivio storico italiano'', 1st series, vol. xi.), and ''Della Corsica'', etc. (ibid., ''nuova serie'', vol. xi., parte ii.);\n*Pompei, ''De L'\u00e9tat de la Corse'' (Paris, 1821); Giovanni Livi, ''Lettere inedite di Pasquale Paoli'' (in ''Arch. stor. ital.'', 5th series, vols. v. and vi.);\n*Bartoli, ''Historia di Pascal Paoli'' (Bastia, 1891); Lencisa, ''P.
