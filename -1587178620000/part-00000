A\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, antes de la creaci\u00f3n del Departamento del Cesar un grupo de ilustres ciudadanos de Valledupar plante\u00f3 la necesidad de fundar un centro de estudios universitario. Con la fundaci\u00f3n del Departamento del Cesar surgen movimientos culturales de diversa \u00edndole que aglutinan la idea de crear en la ciudad un centro de educaci\u00f3n superior, los primeros intentos se canalizan a trav\u00e9s de la Casa de la Cultura y la creaci\u00f3n de una Seccional de la Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s en Valledupar con programas a nivel intermedio, cuyo intento fracas\u00f3 por no contar con los recursos econ\u00f3micos necesarios, los cuales deb\u00edan ser autorizados por la Asamblea Departamental.\n \nEn 1971, siendo Gobernador del Departamento, el doctor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Murgas y por iniciativa del Secretario de Educaci\u00f3n Departamental, se invit\u00f3 al Director del Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior, ICFES, con el fin de escuchar los planteamientos acerca de las ventajas que le traer\u00eda a esta regi\u00f3n la creaci\u00f3n de un instituto de carreras intermedias, que interpretara en materia educativa las necesidades de la regi\u00f3n tan rica en recursos naturales. Iniciativa que inquieta pero resulta infructuosa, por no lograr el apoyo suficiente de la clase dirigente y empresarial del Departamento.\n \nEn 1973, siendo gobernador don Manuel Germ\u00e1n Cuello Guti\u00e9rrez nace el Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Universitario del Cesar, ITUCE. El gobernador recoge la idea del diputado a la Asamblea Departamental Jaime Gnecco Hern\u00e1ndez, quien present\u00f3 la ordenanza para crear un Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Carreras Intermedias.\n \nEl ITUCE funcion\u00f3 dos a\u00f1os durante los cuales ofreci\u00f3 los programas de Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas, Administraci\u00f3n Agropecuaria y T\u00e9cnicas de la Construcci\u00f3n, pero por decisi\u00f3n del movimiento estudiantil, que se gest\u00f3 debido a que no hab\u00eda continuidad en los programas de carreras intermedias para continuar una carrera profesional, optaron por cerrarlo, prefiriendo perder dos o tres semestres. Dadas estas circunstancias el movimiento despleg\u00f3 una campa\u00f1a para la conversi\u00f3n del ITUCE en una universidad con programas acad\u00e9micos completos.\n \nEn 1975 se intent\u00f3 crear una universidad de car\u00e1cter privado por iniciativa liderada por Jorge Dangond Daza que aglutinaba dos vertientes algodoneras y ganaderas. Universidad que deber\u00eda dar cobertura a los bachilleres de la regi\u00f3n y los programas que ofrecer\u00eda deber\u00edan estar adaptados a las necesidades y potencialidades de la regi\u00f3n como son la agroindustria y la miner\u00eda. Esta idea se aplaz\u00f3 porque las encuestas y estudios realizados, por un lado, y la aceptabilidad de los estamentos estudiantiles por otro, consideraron que no exist\u00edan las condiciones necesarias para llevar a cabo el proyecto.\n \nOtro intento de concretar una iniciativa para abrir un Instituto de Carreras Intermedias de car\u00e1cter privado, que funcion\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os consecutivos, pero que tambi\u00e9n fracas\u00f3.\n \nEl rector del ITUCE, doctor Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez O\u00f1ate en 1976, encabez\u00f3 un movimiento c\u00edvico para convertir el instituto en universidad. En el movimiento logr\u00f3 aglutinar parlamentarios, profesionales, entidades c\u00edvicas y los gobiernos municipal y departamental; el comit\u00e9 organizador del dicho movimiento, encomend\u00f3 al doctor Jaime Murgas Arzuaga, representante a la c\u00e1mara, la misi\u00f3n de presentar el proyecto de ley ante el Congreso de la Rep\u00fablica para crear la Universidad Popular del Cesar. Como efectivamente se dio mediante la Ley 34 del 19 de noviembre de ese a\u00f1o.\n \nLa Universidad Popular del Cesar se cre\u00f3 \u201ccomo establecimiento p\u00fablico aut\u00f3nomo con personer\u00eda jur\u00eddica cuyo objetivo primordial ser\u00e1 la investigaci\u00f3n y la docencia a trav\u00e9s de programas que conduzcan a la obtenci\u00f3n de licenciaturas, grados profesionales y t\u00edtulos acad\u00e9micos como el de doctor\u201d.\n \nEl art\u00edculo 2\u00ba de la Ley de creaci\u00f3n de la Universidad establece que la naturaleza jur\u00eddica, la organizaci\u00f3n administrativa y la estructura acad\u00e9mica o programas de estudio e investigaci\u00f3n de las facultades, institutos, escuelas y departamentos de la Universidad Popular del Cesar ser\u00e1n los mismos de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia de conformidad con la Ley 65 de 1963 y dem\u00e1s disposiciones legales excepto su Consejo Superior Universitario.\n \nEs importante destacar que el art\u00edculo 4\u00ba de la citada de la Ley de creaci\u00f3n de la Universidad ordena que \u00e9sta para establecer las carreras, los programas e investigaciones que m\u00e1s convengan a las condiciones sociales, naturales, culturales y econ\u00f3micas del departamento, debe buscar la asistencia y colaboraci\u00f3n del Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior, ICFES. As\u00ed mismo el art\u00edculo 5\u00ba tambi\u00e9n ordena que el Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario, ICA, preste asistencia cient\u00edfica y t\u00e9cnica a la Universidad de acuerdo a los convenios rec\u00edprocos que permanentemente celebren.\n \nLas asistencias autorizadas por la Ley Org\u00e1nica de la Universidad en los art\u00edculos 2\u00ba, 4\u00ba y 5\u00ba no han sido efectivas, porque si bien es cierto, en un comienzo se busc\u00f3 la asesor\u00eda de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, sus recomendaciones no fueron tenidas en cuenta y no se continu\u00f3 con el aprovechamiento de dichas asesor\u00edas. En cuanto al ICFES su asistencia ha sido poco efectiva y m\u00e1s bien gener\u00f3 malestar por su injerencia en los asuntos internos de la Universidad con desconocimiento de la problem\u00e1tica y cultura regional. En cuanto a la asesor\u00eda del ICA, no se encontraron datos disponibles, tal vez debido a que no hay programas afines con la actividad y objeto del Instituto.\n \nLa Universidad inici\u00f3 labores el 1\u00ba de agosto de 1977 con tres Facultades: Ciencias de la Salud, Ciencias Administrativas y Contables y Ciencias de la Educaci\u00f3n, a las cuales estaban adscritos cuatro programas acad\u00e9micos: Enfermer\u00eda, Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas y Contadur\u00eda P\u00fablica, y Matem\u00e1ticas y F\u00edsica, respectivamente. Se inscribieron para acceder a los programas ofrecidos 173 aspirantes siendo la mayor\u00eda para el programa de Contadur\u00eda P\u00fablica con el 39.3%, para el programa de Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas el 25.4%, para Matem\u00e1ticas y F\u00edsica el 18.5% y el 16.8% para el programa de Enfermer\u00eda. Del total s\u00f3lo 94 fueron admitidos y matriculados, su distribuci\u00f3n fue la siguiente: Contadur\u00eda P\u00fablica 34, Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas 23, Matem\u00e1ticas y F\u00edsica 16 y Enfermer\u00eda 21. Esta poblaci\u00f3n estudiantil fue atendida por 13 profesores: 3 de tiempo completo, 1 de medio tiempo y 9 catedr\u00e1ticos.\n \nNo se encuentran evidencias de estudios de factibilidad para la creaci\u00f3n de esos programas, lo cual ha generado cr\u00edticas y pol\u00e9micas acerca de la pertinencia de los mismos para la satisfacci\u00f3n de las necesidades de la regi\u00f3n, debido a que el Departamento y sus zonas de influencia son netamente agropecuarios y mineros; factor que no se tuvo en cuenta en la implementaci\u00f3n de los programas.\n \nDado que estaba vigente el Decreto 80 de 1980, el cual regulaba la Educaci\u00f3n Superior en Colombia en todos sus aspectos; la Universidad en el momento del inicio de sus labores, se rigi\u00f3 por dicha legislaci\u00f3n. Raz\u00f3n por la cual se elaboraron: el Estatuto Org\u00e1nico, el Estatuto Docente, el Estatuto Estudiantil, la Estructura Org\u00e1nica, su Manual de Funciones acorde con la legislaci\u00f3n vigente y adoptada por el Consejo Superior Universitario, lo cual le permiti\u00f3 desarrollar las funciones sustantivas como docencia, investigaci\u00f3n y extensi\u00f3n de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior.\n \nEl humanismo constitucional, que pone al individuo en el n\u00facleo de la sociedad y al aparato estatal a su servicio, que influy\u00f3 de manera tan decidida en el nuevo orden jur\u00eddico fundado a partir de la Carta del 91, introdujo nuevos par\u00e1metros de interpretaci\u00f3n y culturizaci\u00f3n jur\u00eddico \u2013 pol\u00edtica que posibilitan una conveniente asimilaci\u00f3n de transformaciones institucionales y un consecuente cambio de la mentalidad frente a los retos y responsabilidades que de all\u00ed se desprenden.\n \nEn el Art\u00edculo 69 de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica, el constituyente de 1991, reconoce y garantiza la autonom\u00eda universitaria, entendida esta como la leg\u00edtima capacidad que tienen dichas instituciones para autodeterminarse. En desarrollo de este principio, el legislador expidi\u00f3 la ley 30 de 1992, por la cual organiz\u00f3 el servicio p\u00fablico de la educaci\u00f3n superior y estableci\u00f3 el r\u00e9gimen especial que orden\u00f3 el Constituyente para las universidades del Estado. La ley 30 expresa el mandato constitucional acerca de la autonom\u00eda universitaria en su art\u00edculo 28: \u201cLa autonom\u00eda universitaria consagrada en la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica de Colombia y de conformidad con la presente Ley, reconoce a las universidades el derecho a darse y modificar sus estatutos, designar sus autoridades acad\u00e9micas y administrativas, crear, organizar y desarrollar sus programas acad\u00e9micos, definir y organizar sus labores formativas, acad\u00e9micas, docentes, cient\u00edficas y culturales, otorgar los t\u00edtulos correspondientes, seleccionar a sus profesores, admitir a sus alumnos y adoptar sus correspondientes reg\u00edmenes y establecer, arbitrar y aplicar sus recursos para el cumplimiento de su misi\u00f3n social y de su funci\u00f3n institucional\u201d. Los art\u00edculos 19 y 20 de la Ley 30 de 1992 establecen el reconocimiento a las Universidades como tales mediante el Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n Nacional, una vez se han cumplido los requisitos que para el efecto se exigen. La Resoluci\u00f3n 03272 del 25 de junio de 1993 emanada del Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n Nacional reconoce institucionalmente como Universidad a la Universidad Popular del Cesar. Condici\u00f3n esta, suficiente y necesaria para seguir funcionando como Universidad. No obstante en dicho reconocimiento se hicieron varias recomendaciones, que entre otras fueron: la elaboraci\u00f3n de un plan de desarrollo que comprendiera como m\u00ednimo un sistema de autoevaluaci\u00f3n institucional, un plan de publicaciones para la divulgaci\u00f3n de la producci\u00f3n investigativa, un plan de cualificaci\u00f3n y actualizaci\u00f3n docente, formulaci\u00f3n y ejecuci\u00f3n de un plan de inversiones para los laboratorios, actualizaci\u00f3n de los recursos bibliogr\u00e1ficos y de hemeroteca, redes de informaci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s del mejoramiento de la planta f\u00edsica, construcci\u00f3n sede \u00fanica.\n \nLo anterior dividi\u00f3 el devenir hist\u00f3rico de la universidad en dos: antes y despu\u00e9s de la Constituci\u00f3n de 1991. Fue as\u00ed como la Sentencia C-220 del 29 de abril de 1997 ratifica la autonom\u00eda universitaria y aclara la facultad de autodeterminaci\u00f3n. Con base en lo anterior, a partir a\u00f1o 1998 en la Universidad Popular del Cesar se comienzan a implementar nuevas carreras, tales como Licenciatura en Matem\u00e1ticas e Inform\u00e1tica, Licenciatura en Lengua Castellana e Ingl\u00e9s, Licenciatura en Ciencias Naturales y Educaci\u00f3n Ambiental, Instrumentaci\u00f3n Quir\u00fargica, Microbiolog\u00eda, Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas, Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica, Ingenier\u00eda Ambiental y Sanitaria, Econom\u00eda, Administraci\u00f3n de Comercio Internacional, Derecho y Sociolog\u00eda. Aunque el programa de Ingenier\u00eda Agroindustrial fue creado en diciembre de 1994 y comenz\u00f3 a funcionar en el primer semestre de 1995.

A\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, antes de la creaci\u00f3n del Departamento del Cesar un grupo de ilustres ciudadanos de Valledupar plante\u00f3 la necesidad de fundar un centro de estudios universitario. Con la fundaci\u00f3n del Departamento del Cesar surgen movimientos culturales de diversa \u00edndole que aglutinan la idea de crear en la ciudad un centro de educaci\u00f3n superior, los primeros intentos se canalizan a trav\u00e9s de la Casa de la Cultura y la creaci\u00f3n de una Seccional de la Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s en Valledupar con programas a nivel intermedio, cuyo intento fracas\u00f3 por no contar con los recursos econ\u00f3micos necesarios, los cuales deb\u00edan ser autorizados por la Asamblea Departamental.\n \nEn 1971, siendo Gobernador del Departamento, el doctor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Murgas y por iniciativa del Secretario de Educaci\u00f3n Departamental, se invit\u00f3 al Director del Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior, ICFES, con el fin de escuchar los planteamientos acerca de las ventajas que le traer\u00eda a esta regi\u00f3n la creaci\u00f3n de un instituto de carreras intermedias, que interpretara en materia educativa las necesidades de la regi\u00f3n tan rica en recursos naturales. Iniciativa que inquieta pero resulta infructuosa, por no lograr el apoyo suficiente de la clase dirigente y empresarial del Departamento.\n \nEn 1973, siendo gobernador don Manuel Germ\u00e1n Cuello Guti\u00e9rrez nace el Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Universitario del Cesar, ITUCE. El gobernador recoge la idea del diputado a la Asamblea Departamental Jaime Gnecco Hern\u00e1ndez, quien present\u00f3 la ordenanza para crear un Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Carreras Intermedias.\n \nEl ITUCE funcion\u00f3 dos a\u00f1os durante los cuales ofreci\u00f3 los programas de Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas, Administraci\u00f3n Agropecuaria y T\u00e9cnicas de la Construcci\u00f3n, pero por decisi\u00f3n del movimiento estudiantil, que se gest\u00f3 debido a que no hab\u00eda continuidad en los programas de carreras intermedias para continuar una carrera profesional, optaron por cerrarlo, prefiriendo perder dos o tres semestres. Dadas estas circunstancias el movimiento despleg\u00f3 una campa\u00f1a para la conversi\u00f3n del ITUCE en una universidad con programas acad\u00e9micos completos.\n \nEn 1975 se intent\u00f3 crear una universidad de car\u00e1cter privado por iniciativa liderada por Jorge Dangond Daza que aglutinaba dos vertientes algodoneras y ganaderas. Universidad que deber\u00eda dar cobertura a los bachilleres de la regi\u00f3n y los programas que ofrecer\u00eda deber\u00edan estar adaptados a las necesidades y potencialidades de la regi\u00f3n como son la agroindustria y la miner\u00eda.

He was instrumental in establishing the modern [[Military of Japan|Imperial Japanese military]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Kodama_Gentaro_Bronze_Monument.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A bronze monument statue of Kodama Gentaro]]\n\n===Early life===\nBorn in [[Tokuyama, Yamaguchi|Tokuyama]], [[Su\u014d Province]] (modern [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]]), from a ''[[samurai]]'' class family loyal to the [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b domain]], Kodama began his military career fighting in the [[Boshin War]] for the [[Meiji Restoration]] against the forces of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1868. He was appointed a non-commissioned officer on 2 June 1870, advanced to sergeant major on 10 December and promoted to warrant officer on 15 April 1871; he was commissioned a second lieutenant on 6 August and promoted to lieutenant on 21 September. He was promoted to captain on 25 July 1872 and to major on 19 October 1874.\n\nAs a soldier in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army, he saw combat during the suppression of the [[Satsuma Rebellion]]. He later enrolled in the ''Osaka Heigakuryo'' (\u5927\u962a\u5175\u5b66\u5bee) military training school).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Military Biography\">Encyclopedia of Military Biography</ref> Successive and rapid promotions followed: lieutenant-colonel on 30 April 1880, colonel on 6 February 1883 and major-general on 24 August 1889.\n\n===Military career===\nKodama was appointed head of the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]], where he worked with German Major [[Jakob Meckel]] to reorganize the modern Japanese military after the [[Prussian Army|Prussian]] system.<ref>Harries, Soldiers of the Sun</ref>\n\nKodama went on to study military science as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to Germany. After his return to Japan, he was appointed [[Minister of War of Japan|Vice-minister of War]] in 1892.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Kodama, Gentaro, Count|volume=15|page=885}}</ref>\n\nAfter his service in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u201395), Kodama became [[Governor-General of Taiwan]]. During his tenure, he did much to improve on the infrastructure of Taiwan and to alleviate the living conditions of the inhabitants.<ref>Ching, Becoming Japanese</ref> He was promoted to lieutenant general on 14 October 1896. Having proved himself an excellent administrator, Kodama spent the following decade serving as [[Ministry of War of Japan|Minister of the Army]] under [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[It\u014d Hirobumi]], retaining the post and taking on the concurrent roles of [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Minister of Home Affairs]] and [[Ministry of Education (Japan)|Education]] under the following Prime Minister [[Katsura Tar\u014d]].\n\nOn 6 June 1904, Kodama was promoted to full [[general]]. However, he was asked by [[Field Marshal (Japan)|Marshal]] [[\u014cyama Iwao]] to be [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of General Staff]] of the [[Japanese Manchurian Army|Manchurian Army]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. This was a step down for him in terms of rank, but he nevertheless chose to take the position; it was a sacrifice which elicited much public applause. Throughout the Russo-Japanese War he guided the strategy of the whole campaign, as General [[Kawakami Soroku|Kawakami S\u014droku]] had done in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] ten years previously.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref>Connaughton, Rising Sun and Tumbling Bear</ref> The postwar historian [[Shiba Ry\u014dtar\u014d]] gives him complete credit for Japan's victory at the [[Siege of Port Arthur]], although there is no historical evidence for this, and Kodama kept quiet about his role in the battle.

He was appointed a non-commissioned officer on 2 June 1870, advanced to sergeant major on 10 December and promoted to warrant officer on 15 April 1871; he was commissioned a second lieutenant on 6 August and promoted to lieutenant on 21 September. He was promoted to captain on 25 July 1872 and to major on 19 October 1874.\n\nAs a soldier in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army, he saw combat during the suppression of the [[Satsuma Rebellion]]. He later enrolled in the ''Osaka Heigakuryo'' (\u5927\u962a\u5175\u5b66\u5bee\uff09 military training school).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Military Biography\">Encyclopedia of Military Biography</ref> Successive and rapid promotions followed: lieutenant-colonel on 30 April 1880, colonel on 6 February 1883 and major-general on 24 August 1889.\n\n===Military career===\nKodama was appointed head of the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]], where he worked with German Major [[Jakob Meckel]] to reorganize the modern Japanese military after the [[Prussian Army|Prussian]] system.<ref>Harries, Soldiers of the Sun</ref>\n\nKodama went on to study military science as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to Germany. After his return to Japan, he was appointed [[Minister of War of Japan|Vice-minister of War]] in 1892.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Kodama, Gentaro, Count|volume=15|page=885}}</ref>\n\nAfter his service in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u201395), Kodama became [[Governor-General of Taiwan]]. During his tenure, he did much to improve on the infrastructure of Taiwan and to alleviate the living conditions of the inhabitants.<ref>Ching, Becoming Japanese</ref> He was promoted to lieutenant general on 14 October 1896. Having proved himself an excellent administrator, Kodama spent the following decade serving as [[Ministry of War of Japan|Minister of the Army]] under [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[It\u014d Hirobumi]], retaining the post and taking on the concurrent roles of [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Minister of Home Affairs]] and [[Ministry of Education (Japan)|Education]] under the following Prime Minister [[Katsura Tar\u014d]].\n\nOn 6 June 1904, Kodama was promoted to full [[general]]. However, he was asked by [[Field Marshal (Japan)|Marshal]] [[\u014cyama Iwao]] to be [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of General Staff]] of the [[Japanese Manchurian Army|Manchurian Army]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. This was a step down for him in terms of rank, but he nevertheless chose to take the position; it was a sacrifice which elicited much public applause.

A bright point came on July 24, when the Red Sox overcame a five-run deficit as Bill Mueller hit a game-winning home run to right-center off Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]]. The game also featured the infamous brawl between Yankee superstar [[Alex Rodriguez]] and Red Sox catcher and captain [[Jason Varitek]].\n\nRed Sox General Manager [[Theo Epstein]] shook up the team at the MLB trading deadline July 31, trading the team's wildly popular yet often hurt and disgruntled shortstop, [[Nomar Garciaparra]], to the [[Chicago Cubs]],<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/g/garcino01.shtml Nomar Garciaparra Statistics and History] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref> receiving [[Orlando Cabrera]] from the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] from the [[Minnesota Twins]] in return. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox also traded AAA outfielder Henri Stanley to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for center fielder [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]]. With valuable players like Cabrera, Mientkiewicz, and Roberts in the line up, the club turned things around, winning twenty-two out of twenty-five games and going on to finish within three games of the Yankees in the AL East and qualifying for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.\n\nThe team played its home games at [[Fenway Park]], before a regular season total attendance of 2,837,294 fans.\n\n===Game log===\n{{MLB Game log|bgcolor=#c60c30; border: 5px solid #024|fgcolor=white|year=2004}}\n{{MLB Game log month|bgcolor=#024; border: 3px solid #c60c30|fgcolor=white|hide=y|month=April}}\n|- style=\"background-color:#ffbbbb\"\n| 1 || April 4 || @ [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] || 7\u20132 || [[Sidney Ponson|Ponson]] (1\u20130) || '''[[Pedro Mart\u00ednez|Mart\u00ednez]]''' (0\u20131) || [[B.

The Red Sox blew out the Angels 9\u20133 in Game 1, scoring 7 of those runs in the fourth inning. However, the Sox' 2003 off season prize pickup [[Curt Schilling]] suffered a torn [[tendon]] when he was hit by a line drive. The injury was exacerbated when Schilling fielded a ball rolling down the first base line. The second game, pitched by [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]], stayed close until Boston scored four in the ninth to win 8\u20133. In game three, what looked to be a blowout turned out to be a nail-biter, as [[Vladimir Guerrero]] hit a grand slam off Mike Timlin in the top of the seventh inning to tie it at six. However, [[David Ortiz]], who was noted for his [[Clutch hitter|clutch hitting]], delivered in the 10th inning with a game winning two-run homer, off [[Jarrod Washburn]], sailing over the [[Green Monster]]. The Red Sox advanced to a rematch in the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] against their bitter rivals, the [[New York Yankees]].\n\n====League Championship Series====\n{{Main|2004 American League Championship Series}}\nDespite high hopes that the [[Red Sox]] would finally vanquish their nemesis from [[the Bronx]], the series started disastrously for them. [[Curt Schilling]] pitched with the torn [[tendon sheath]] in his right ankle he had suffered in Game 1 of the Division Series against [[Anaheim]], and was routed for six runs in three innings. [[Yankee]] starter [[Mike Mussina]] had six perfect innings, and held an 8\u20130 lead. Despite the [[Boston Red Sox|Sox']] best effort to come back (they scored seven runs to make it 8\u20137), they ended up losing 10\u20137. In Game 2, already with his Yankees leading 1\u20130 for most of the game, [[John Olerud]] hit a two-run home run to put the New York team up for good. The Sox were soon down three games to none after a 19\u20138 loss in Game 3 at home. In that game, the two clubs set the record for most [[Run (baseball)|runs scored]] in a League Championship Series game. At that point in the history of baseball, no team had come back to win from a 3\u20130 series deficit (only the 1998 [[Atlanta Braves]] and 1999 [[New York Mets]] had ever gotten as far as a Game 6).\n\nIn Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth with Yankees [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Mariano Rivera]] on the mound. After Rivera issued a walk to [[Kevin Millar]], [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] came on to [[pinch run]] and promptly [[stolen base|stole]] second base, this being what many consider the turning point in the series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/08/07/a_stolen_moment_of_fame/|title=A stolen moment of fame|first=Bob|last=Ryan|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=August 7, 2005|authorlink=Bob Ryan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2014/04/dave_roberts_steal_alcs.html|title=Red Sox hero, now Padres coach, Dave Roberts talks about 'The Steal' (video)|date=April 8, 2014|work=Cleveland.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/98844328/dave-roberts-steal-set-amazing-2004-red-sox-playoff-run-in-motion|title=Roberts' steal set amazing 2004 playoff run in motion|first=Ian|last=Browne|work=MLB.com|date=October 17, 2014}}</ref> He then scored on an [[Run batted in|RBI]] [[Single (baseball)|single]] by [[Bill Mueller]] which sent the game to extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game on a two-run home run by [[David Ortiz]] in the 12th inning. In Game 5, the Red Sox were again down late, this time by the score of 4\u20132, as a result of [[Derek Jeter]]'s bases-clearing triple. But the Sox struck back in the eighth, as Ortiz hit a homer over the [[Green Monster]] to bring the Sox within a run. Then [[Jason Varitek]] hit a sacrifice fly to bring home Dave Roberts, scoring the tying run. The game would go for 14 innings, capped off by many squandered Yankee opportunities (they were 1 for 13 with runners in [[scoring position]]). In the top of the 12th inning, the knuckleballing [[Tim Wakefield]] came in from the bullpen, without his customary \"personal catcher\", [[Doug Mirabelli]]. Varitek, the starting catcher, had trouble with Wakefield's tricky knuckleballs in the 12th: he allowed 3 passed balls in the 13th. The third and last of those gave the Yankees runners on second and third with two out. The Red Sox were spared, however, as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]] [[Strikeout|struck out]] to end the inning. In the bottom of the 14th, Ortiz would again seal the win with a game-winning RBI single that brought home Damon. The game set the record for longest postseason game in terms of time (5 hours and 49 minutes) and for the longest American League Championship Series game (14 innings), though the former has since been broken.\n\nWith the series returning to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] for Game 6, the improbable comeback continued, with Curt Schilling pitching on an ankle that had three sutures wrapped in a bloody  white sock (red with a blood stain). Schilling struck out four, walked none, and only allowed one run over seven innings to lead the team to victory. [[Mark Bellhorn]] also helped in the effort as he hit a three-run home run in the fourth inning. Originally called a double, the umpires conferred and agreed that the ball had actually gone into the stands before falling back into the field of play, which was apparent to the television audience but angered Yankees fans.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} A key play came in the bottom of the eighth inning with Derek Jeter on first and Alex Rodr\u00edguez facing [[Bronson Arroyo]]. Rodr\u00edguez hit a ground ball down the first base line. Arroyo fielded it and reached out to tag him as he raced down the line. Rodr\u00edguez slapped at the ball and it came loose, rolling down the line. Jeter scored and Rodr\u00edguez ended up on second. After conferring, however, the umpires called Rodr\u00edguez out on interference and returned Jeter to first base, the second time in the game they reversed a call. Yankees fans, upset with the calls, littered the field with debris. The umpires called police clad in [[Riot control|riot gear]] to line the field in the top of the 9th inning. In the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees staged a rally and brought former Red Sox player [[Tony Clark]], who had played well against the Red Sox since leaving the team, to the plate as the potential winning run. Closer [[Keith Foulke]] however, struck out Clark to end the game and force a Game 7. In this game, the Red Sox completed their historic comeback on the strength of [[Derek Lowe]]'s one-hit, one-run pitching and [[Johnny Damon]]'s two home runs, including a grand slam in the second inning off the first pitch of reliever [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]], and defeated the New York Yankees, 10\u20133. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player.\n\n[[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]] are three [[professional sports]] that feature best-of-seven games series in their playoffs. Coming back to win a seven-game series when down by three games has only been accomplished by four National Hockey League teams and only one Major League Baseball team in the history of the MLB, NBA, and NHL.<BR>\nThe [[1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]] (NHL) came back from being down by three games to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] to win the [[1942 Stanley Cup Finals|1942 Stanley Cup]].<BR>\nThe [[1974\u201375 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]] (NHL) did the same when they came back to beat the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the 1975 [[Stanley Cup]] Quarterfinals.<BR>\nThe [[2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers season|Philadelphia Flyers]] (NHL), during their [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] run to the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals]], came back from three games down to defeat the [[Boston Bruins]] to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.<BR>\nThe [[Los Angeles Kings]],in the 2013\u201314 NHL Playoffs defeated the [[San Jose Sharks]] in the first round, on their way to winning the [[2014 Stanley Cup Finals|2014 Stanley Cup]].<BR>\n\nThe Boston Red Sox are currently the only team in Major League Baseball history to overcome a three game deficit in either a league or a World Series championship. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===2004 World Series===\n{{Main|2004 World Series}}\nThe Red Sox faced the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]]. The Cardinals had posted the best record in the major leagues that season, and had previously defeated the Red Sox in the {{wsy|1946}} and {{wsy|1967}} Series, with both series going seven games. The third time would be the charm, however, as the momentum and confidence Boston had built up in the ALCS would overwhelm St. Louis. The Red Sox began the Series with an 11\u20139 win, marked by [[Mark Bellhorn]]'s game-winning home run off [[Pesky's Pole]]. He later on said that he \"just did what he needed to do.\" It was the highest scoring World Series opening game ever (breaking the previous record set in {{wsy|1932}}). The Red Sox would go on to win Game 2 in Boston (thanks to another sensational performance by the bloody-socked Schilling). The Red Sox won both these games despite making 4 errors in each game. In Game 3, Pedro Mart\u00ednez shut out the Cardinals for seven innings. The Cardinals only made one real threat \u2014 in the third inning when they put runners on second and third with no outs. However, the Cardinals' rally was killed by pitcher [[Jeff Suppan]]'s baserunning gaffe. With no outs, Suppan should have scored easily from third on a [[Larry Walker]] ground ball to second baseman Bellhorn, who was playing back, conceding the run. But as Bellhorn threw out Walker at first base, Suppan inexplicably froze after taking several steps toward home and was thrown out by Sox [[first baseman]] [[David Ortiz]] as he scrambled back to third. The double play was devastating for St. Louis. The Red Sox needed one more game to win their first championship since the [[1918 World Series]]. In Game Four the Red Sox did not allow a run, and the game ended as [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]] (who would become the 2005 Red Sox starting SS) hit the ball back to Keith Foulke. (This was the second time that Renter\u00eda had ended a Series, as he had won it for the Marlins seven years prior in the [[1997 World Series]].) After Foulke lobbed the ball to Doug Mientkiewicz, the Sox had won their first World Championship in 86 years. The Sox held the Cardinals' offense (the best in the NL in 2004) to only three runs in the last three games, never trailing in the Series. [[Manny Ram\u00edrez]] was named World Series MVP. The Red Sox won Game Four of the series on October 27, eighteen years to the day from when they lost to the [[New York Mets]] in the [[1986 World Series]]. In fact, it came 18 years to the day they lost their last World Series game, as they would sweep the 2004 series.\n\nThe Red Sox performed well in the 2004 postseason. From the eighth inning of Game 5 of the American League Championship Series against the Yankees (a tie) until the end of the World Series, the Sox played 60 innings, and never trailed at any point. This was only the fourth World Series ever played in which the losing team had never held a lead.\n\n[[File:Boston Red Sox George W. Bush 2005.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Boston Red Sox are honored at the [[White House]] by President [[George W.

The Red Sox won the title about eleven minutes before totality ended. Many Red Sox fans who were turned away due to no tickets for the game were allowed to watch the final inning from the confines of Busch Stadium after being let in free of charge.\n\n[[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] commentator [[Joe Buck]] famously called the final out, saying: {{quote|Back to [[Keith Foulke|Foulke]].

A crowd of more than three million people filled the streets of Boston to cheer as the team rode on the city's famous [[DUKW|Duck Boats]]. The parade followed the same route the [[New England Patriots]] took following their victories in Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] in 2002 and [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in February.\n\nFollowing their 2004 World Series win, the Red Sox replaced the dirt from the field as a \"fresh start\".

A bright point came on July 24, when the Red Sox overcame a five-run deficit as Bill Mueller hit a game-winning home run to right-center off Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]]. The game also featured the infamous brawl between Yankee superstar [[Alex Rodriguez]] and Red Sox catcher and captain [[Jason Varitek]].\n\nRed Sox General Manager [[Theo Epstein]] shook up the team at the MLB trading deadline July 31, trading the team's wildly popular yet often hurt and disgruntled shortstop, [[Nomar Garciaparra]], to the [[Chicago Cubs]],<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/g/garcino01.shtml Nomar Garciaparra Statistics and History] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref> receiving [[Orlando Cabrera]] from the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] from the [[Minnesota Twins]] in return. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox also traded AAA outfielder Henri Stanley to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for center fielder [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]]. With valuable players like Cabrera, Mientkiewicz, and Roberts in the line up, the club turned things around, winning twenty-two out of twenty-five games and going on to finish within three games of the Yankees in the AL East and qualifying for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.\n\nThe team played its home games at [[Fenway Park]], before a regular season total attendance of 2,837,294 fans.\n\n===Game log===\n{{MLB Game log|bgcolor=#c60c30; border: 5px solid #024|fgcolor=white|year=2004}}\n{{MLB Game log month|bgcolor=#024; border: 3px solid #c60c30|fgcolor=white|hide=y|month=April}}\n|- style=\"background-color:#ffbbbb\"\n| 1 || April 4 || @ [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] || 7\u20132 || [[Sidney Ponson|Ponson]] (1\u20130) || '''[[Pedro Mart\u00ednez|Mart\u00ednez]]''' (0\u20131) || [[B.

The Red Sox blew out the Angels 9\u20133 in Game 1, scoring 7 of those runs in the fourth inning. However, the Sox' 2003 off season prize pickup [[Curt Schilling]] suffered a torn [[tendon]] when he was hit by a line drive. The injury was exacerbated when Schilling fielded a ball rolling down the first base line. The second game, pitched by [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]], stayed close until Boston scored four in the ninth to win 8\u20133. In game three, what looked to be a blowout turned out to be a nail-biter, as [[Vladimir Guerrero]] hit a grand slam off Mike Timlin in the top of the seventh inning to tie it at six. However, [[David Ortiz]], who was noted for his [[Clutch hitter|clutch hitting]], delivered in the 10th inning with a game winning two-run homer, off [[Jarrod Washburn]], sailing over the [[Green Monster]]. The Red Sox advanced to a rematch in the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] against their bitter rivals, the [[New York Yankees]].\n\n====League Championship Series====\n{{Main|2004 American League Championship Series}}\nDespite high hopes that the [[Red Sox]] would finally vanquish their nemesis from [[the Bronx]], the series started disastrously for them. [[Curt Schilling]] pitched with the torn [[tendon sheath]] in his right ankle he had suffered in Game 1 of the Division Series against [[Anaheim]], and was routed for six runs in three innings. [[Yankee]] starter [[Mike Mussina]] had six perfect innings, and held an 8\u20130 lead. Despite the [[Boston Red Sox|Sox']] best effort to come back (they scored seven runs to make it 8\u20137), they ended up losing 10\u20137. In Game 2, already with his Yankees leading 1\u20130 for most of the game, [[John Olerud]] hit a two-run home run to put the New York team up for good. The Sox were soon down three games to none after a 19\u20138 loss in Game 3 at home. In that game, the two clubs set the record for most [[Run (baseball)|runs scored]] in a League Championship Series game. At that point in the history of baseball, no team had come back to win from a 3\u20130 series deficit (only the 1998 [[Atlanta Braves]] and 1999 [[New York Mets]] had ever gotten as far as a Game 6).\n\nIn Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth with Yankees [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Mariano Rivera]] on the mound. After Rivera issued a walk to [[Kevin Millar]], [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] came on to [[pinch run]] and promptly [[stolen base|stole]] second base, this being what many consider the turning point in the series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/08/07/a_stolen_moment_of_fame/|title=A stolen moment of fame|first=Bob|last=Ryan|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=August 7, 2005|authorlink=Bob Ryan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2014/04/dave_roberts_steal_alcs.html|title=Red Sox hero, now Padres coach, Dave Roberts talks about 'The Steal' (video)|date=April 8, 2014|work=Cleveland.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/98844328/dave-roberts-steal-set-amazing-2004-red-sox-playoff-run-in-motion|title=Roberts' steal set amazing 2004 playoff run in motion|first=Ian|last=Browne|work=MLB.com|date=October 17, 2014}}</ref> He then scored on an [[Run batted in|RBI]] [[Single (baseball)|single]] by [[Bill Mueller]] which sent the game to extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game on a two-run home run by [[David Ortiz]] in the 12th inning. In Game 5, the Red Sox were again down late, this time by the score of 4\u20132, as a result of [[Derek Jeter]]'s bases-clearing triple. But the Sox struck back in the eighth, as Ortiz hit a homer over the [[Green Monster]] to bring the Sox within a run. Then [[Jason Varitek]] hit a sacrifice fly to bring home Dave Roberts, scoring the tying run. The game would go for 14 innings, capped off by many squandered Yankee opportunities (they were 1 for 13 with runners in [[scoring position]]). In the top of the 12th inning, the knuckleballing [[Tim Wakefield]] came in from the bullpen, without his customary \"personal catcher\", [[Doug Mirabelli]]. Varitek, the starting catcher, had trouble with Wakefield's tricky knuckleballs in the 12th: he allowed 3 passed balls in the 13th. The third and last of those gave the Yankees runners on second and third with two out. The Red Sox were spared, however, as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]] [[Strikeout|struck out]] to end the inning. In the bottom of the 14th, Ortiz would again seal the win with a game-winning RBI single that brought home Damon. The game set the record for longest postseason game in terms of time (5 hours and 49 minutes) and for the longest American League Championship Series game (14 innings), though the former has since been broken.\n\nWith the series returning to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] for Game 6, the improbable comeback continued, with Curt Schilling pitching on an ankle that had three sutures wrapped in a bloody  white sock (red with a blood stain). Schilling struck out four, walked none, and only allowed one run over seven innings to lead the team to victory. [[Mark Bellhorn]] also helped in the effort as he hit a three-run home run in the fourth inning. Originally called a double, the umpires conferred and agreed that the ball had actually gone into the stands before falling back into the field of play, which was apparent to the television audience but angered Yankees fans.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} A key play came in the bottom of the eighth inning with Derek Jeter on first and Alex Rodr\u00edguez facing [[Bronson Arroyo]]. Rodr\u00edguez hit a ground ball down the first base line. Arroyo fielded it and reached out to tag him as he raced down the line. Rodr\u00edguez slapped at the ball and it came loose, rolling down the line. Jeter scored and Rodr\u00edguez ended up on second. After conferring, however, the umpires called Rodr\u00edguez out on interference and returned Jeter to first base, the second time in the game they reversed a call. Yankees fans, upset with the calls, littered the field with debris. The umpires called police clad in [[Riot control|riot gear]] to line the field in the top of the 9th inning. In the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees staged a rally and brought former Red Sox player [[Tony Clark]], who had played well against the Red Sox since leaving the team, to the plate as the potential winning run. Closer [[Keith Foulke]] however, struck out Clark to end the game and force a Game 7. In this game, the Red Sox completed their historic comeback on the strength of [[Derek Lowe]]'s one-hit, one-run pitching and [[Johnny Damon]]'s two home runs, including a grand slam in the second inning off the first pitch of reliever [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]], and defeated the New York Yankees, 10\u20133. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player.\n\n[[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]] are three [[professional sports]] that feature best-of-seven games series in their playoffs. Coming back to win a seven-game series when down by three games has only been accomplished by four National Hockey League teams and only one Major League Baseball team in the history of the MLB, NBA, and NHL.<BR>\nThe [[1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]] (NHL) came back from being down by three games to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] to win the [[1942 Stanley Cup Finals|1942 Stanley Cup]].<BR>\nThe [[1974\u201375 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]] (NHL) did the same when they came back to beat the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the 1975 [[Stanley Cup]] Quarterfinals.<BR>\nThe [[2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers season|Philadelphia Flyers]] (NHL), during their [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] run to the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals]], came back from three games down to defeat the [[Boston Bruins]] to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.<BR>\nThe [[Los Angeles Kings]],in the 2013\u201314 NHL Playoffs defeated the [[San Jose Sharks]] in the first round, on their way to winning the [[2014 Stanley Cup Finals|2014 Stanley Cup]].<BR>\n\nThe Boston Red Sox are currently the only team in Major League Baseball history to overcome a three game deficit in either a league or a World Series championship. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===2004 World Series===\n{{Main|2004 World Series}}\nThe Red Sox faced the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]]. The Cardinals had posted the best record in the major leagues that season, and had previously defeated the Red Sox in the {{wsy|1946}} and {{wsy|1967}} Series, with both series going seven games. The third time would be the charm, however, as the momentum and confidence Boston had built up in the ALCS would overwhelm St. Louis. The Red Sox began the Series with an 11\u20139 win, marked by [[Mark Bellhorn]]'s game-winning home run off [[Pesky's Pole]]. He later on said that he \"just did what he needed to do.\" It was the highest scoring World Series opening game ever (breaking the previous record set in {{wsy|1932}}). The Red Sox would go on to win Game 2 in Boston (thanks to another sensational performance by the bloody-socked Schilling). The Red Sox won both these games despite making 4 errors in each game. In Game 3, Pedro Mart\u00ednez shut out the Cardinals for seven innings. The Cardinals only made one real threat \u2014 in the third inning when they put runners on second and third with no outs. However, the Cardinals' rally was killed by pitcher [[Jeff Suppan]]'s baserunning gaffe. With no outs, Suppan should have scored easily from third on a [[Larry Walker]] ground ball to second baseman Bellhorn, who was playing back, conceding the run. But as Bellhorn threw out Walker at first base, Suppan inexplicably froze after taking several steps toward home and was thrown out by Sox [[first baseman]] [[David Ortiz]] as he scrambled back to third. The double play was devastating for St. Louis. The Red Sox needed one more game to win their first championship since the [[1918 World Series]]. In Game Four the Red Sox did not allow a run, and the game ended as [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]] (who would become the 2005 Red Sox starting SS) hit the ball back to Keith Foulke. (This was the second time that Renter\u00eda had ended a Series, as he had won it for the Marlins seven years prior in the [[1997 World Series]].) After Foulke lobbed the ball to Doug Mientkiewicz, the Sox had won their first World Championship in 86 years. The Sox held the Cardinals' offense (the best in the NL in 2004) to only three runs in the last three games, never trailing in the Series. [[Manny Ram\u00edrez]] was named World Series MVP. The Red Sox won Game Four of the series on October 27, eighteen years to the day from when they lost to the [[New York Mets]] in the [[1986 World Series]]. In fact, it came 18 years to the day they lost their last World Series game, as they would sweep the 2004 series.\n\nThe Red Sox performed well in the 2004 postseason. From the eighth inning of Game 5 of the American League Championship Series against the Yankees (a tie) until the end of the World Series, the Sox played 60 innings, and never trailed at any point. This was only the fourth World Series ever played in which the losing team had never held a lead.\n\n[[File:Boston Red Sox George W. Bush 2005.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Boston Red Sox are honored at the [[White House]] by President [[George W. Bush]] following the side's winning the 2004 World Series.]]\nTo add a final, surreal touch to the Red Sox championship title, on the night the Red Sox won, a [[total lunar eclipse]] colored the moon over [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]] to a deep red hue. The Red Sox won the title about eleven minutes before totality ended. Many Red Sox fans who were turned away due to no tickets for the game were allowed to watch the final inning from the confines of Busch Stadium after being let in free of charge.\n\n[[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] commentator [[Joe Buck]] famously called the final out, saying: {{quote|Back to [[Keith Foulke|Foulke]].

A crowd of more than three million people filled the streets of Boston to cheer as the team rode on the city's famous [[DUKW|Duck Boats]]. The parade followed the same route the [[New England Patriots]] took following their victories in Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] in 2002 and [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in February.\n\nFollowing their 2004 World Series win, the Red Sox replaced the dirt from the field as a \"fresh start\".

In the story, Kakashi is the teacher of [[List of Naruto characters#Team 7|Team 7]], consisting of the series' primary characters, [[Naruto Uzumaki]], [[Sasuke Uchiha]], and [[Sakura Haruno]]. He is initially portrayed as a detached and [[apathetic]] figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends and students becomes increasingly apparent. Kakashi's past has been extensively explored in the series, resulting in a ''[[gaiden]]'' being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of ''Naruto'' media, the [[Naruto#Films|featured films]] in the series, the [[Naruto#Original video animations|original video animations]], and the [[List of Naruto video games|video games]].\n\nKakashi was originally created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by [[Kazuhiko Inoue]] in Japanese and [[Dave Wittenberg]] in the English dub.\n\nNumerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Kakashi's character. Although he has been noted to be an echo of similar detached ''[[sh\u014dnen manga]]'' characters, the duality of Kakashi's apathetic and serious sides have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the ''Naruto'' reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. [[Merchandise]] based on Kakashi has also been released, including [[key chain]]s and [[plush doll]]s.\n\n==Creation and conception==\nMasashi Kishimoto originally intended for Kakashi to debut in the second chapter of the ''Naruto'' manga, appearing prior to the other members of [[List of Naruto characters#Team 7|Team 7]]. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled [[ninja]] that ended his sentences with the polite \"''de gozaru''\" in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7.<ref name=\"FailedCh2\">{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-56931-900-6|page=128}}</ref> Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=141}}</ref> Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was not sure what the character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists' teacher would behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations.<ref name=\"kizuna\">{{cite book|title=NARUTO\uff0d\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\uff0d\u540d\u8a00\u96c6\u3000\u7d46\uff0dKIZUNA\uff0d\u3000\u5929\u30ce\u5dfb|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|year=2013|isbn=978-4-08-720681-4|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|pages=188\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nBecause he acts as a link between the other main characters of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=124}}</ref> In an interview in [[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump|''Sh\u014dnen Jump'']]'s, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi.<ref name=\"AnimeProfiles\">{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto Anime Profiles, Volume 1: Episodes 1\u201337|year=2006|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|pages=|isbn=1-4215-0657-2|url=https://archive.org/details/narutoanimeprofi0000unse}}</ref> In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi's face but was not sure whether it would be in the manga or an upcoming movie.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Weekly Shonen Jump|date=February 2014|url=http://shonenjump.viz.com/node/1962|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|quote='''Q:''' Will we ever get to see Kakashi's face under the mask? / '''Masashi Kishimoto:''' I want to reveal it.

In the story, Kakashi is the teacher of [[List of Naruto characters#Team 7|Team 7]], consisting of the series' primary characters, [[Naruto Uzumaki]], [[Sasuke Uchiha]], and [[Sakura Haruno]]. He is initially portrayed as a detached and [[apathetic]] figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends and students becomes increasingly apparent. Kakashi's past has been extensively explored in the series, resulting in a ''[[gaiden]]'' being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of ''Naruto'' media, the [[Naruto#Films|featured films]] in the series, the [[Naruto#Original video animations|original video animations]], and the [[List of Naruto video games|video games]].\n\nKakashi was originally created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by [[Kazuhiko Inoue]] in Japanese and [[Dave Wittenberg]] in the English dub.\n\nNumerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Kakashi's character. Although he has been noted to be an echo of similar detached ''[[sh\u014dnen manga]]'' characters, the duality of Kakashi's apathetic and serious sides have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the ''Naruto'' reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. [[Merchandise]] based on Kakashi has also been released, including [[key chain]]s and [[plush doll]]s.\n\n==Creation and conception==\nMasashi Kishimoto originally intended for Kakashi to debut in the second chapter of the ''Naruto'' manga, appearing prior to the other members of [[List of Naruto characters#Team 7|Team 7]]. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled [[ninja]] that ended his sentences with the polite \"''de gozaru''\" in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7.<ref name=\"FailedCh2\">{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-56931-900-6|page=128}}</ref> Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=141}}</ref> Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was not sure what the character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists' teacher would behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations.<ref name=\"kizuna\">{{cite book|title=NARUTO\uff0d\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\uff0d\u540d\u8a00\u96c6\u3000\u7d46\uff0dKIZUNA\uff0d\u3000\u5929\u30ce\u5dfb|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|year=2013|isbn=978-4-08-720681-4|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|pages=188\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nBecause he acts as a link between the other main characters of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=124}}</ref> In an interview in [[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump|''Sh\u014dnen Jump'']]'s, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi.<ref name=\"AnimeProfiles\">{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto Anime Profiles, Volume 1: Episodes 1\u201337|year=2006|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|pages=|isbn=1-4215-0657-2|url=https://archive.org/details/narutoanimeprofi0000unse}}</ref> In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi's face but was not sure whether it would be in the manga or an upcoming movie.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Weekly Shonen Jump|date=February 2014|url=http://shonenjump.viz.com/node/1962|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|quote='''Q:''' Will we ever get to see Kakashi's face under the mask? / '''Masashi Kishimoto:''' I want to reveal it.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

I grew up poor and in those days calling someone 'country' was a put-down,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} In high school, Seely was a [[cheerleading|cheerleader]] and an [[honors student]].

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

This was the origin of the Cali branch of the Javeriana University. On 20 November 1978 the board proposed the name Cali Branch, with headquarters in the capital under the same organization and higher authorities. The board of regents, at the request of the board, adopted the name Cali Branch. Today, this branch is one of the most prestigious universities in Cali.\n\nThe campus of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali is located in the south of the city, in Pance, at the foot of the [[Farallones de Cali]], part of the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)]], in a totally rural environment where vegetation and fauna abound. The campus consists of eight buildings (Las Palmas, Guayacanes, classrooms block, administration, Saman, Almendros, continuing education, and the recently opened Las Acacias). Two more buildings are being built on campus, which features five caf\u00e9s, the Javeriana Shop, a large parking lot surrounding the entire campus, a branch of [[Corpbanca]], a center of the Colombia Stock Exchange, and an MBA extension of [[Temple University]] [[Fox School of Business and Management]]. The campus also includes Alfonso Borrero Cabal auditorium; Central Library, one of the most complete in the Colombian Southwest; Loyola Sports Center; the office of entrepreneurship \"Campus Nova\", which fosters entrepreneurial talent within the university; and the Javeriano Writing Center, highly regarded for helping students develop writing skills.\n\nThe university has 35 research groups attached to the government [[Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation]]; and a station, Javeriana Stereo FM 107.5 with a wide audience in the Colombian Southwest. It offers students opportunities in more than 87 countries and boasts 120 academic cooperation agreements with universities abroad.\n\nCurrently, the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali offers 19 undergraduate programs of which eight have received quality accreditation by the Ministry of Education (Civil Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Systems Engineering and Computer Science, Business Administration, Accounting law and Psychology). The law degree from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali is prestigious in Cali and the Colombian [[:es:Sur Occidente (Barranquilla)|Suroccidente]], profiting from one of the most complete [[moot courts]] for student practice. The Cali branch of the Faculty of Health Sciences inaugurated the Moot Hospital which has high-tech teams and a superior infrastructure for student interns.\n\nIn March 2012, the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali received the Institutional Accreditation of High Quality from the Ministry of Education for eight years, placing it among the more competitive private universities in the country.\n\n== Alumni ==\nJaveriana's alumni include a vast range of prominent individuals in the history of the country and the region, with the following list representative.\n\n* [[Ernesto Samper]], President of Colombia (1994\u20131998)\n* [[Daniel Samper Pizano]], lawyer, journalist, and writer\n* [[Daniel Samper Ospina]], comedian, writer, journalist, and columnist\n* [[Misael Pastrana]], president of Colombia (1970\u20131974)\n* [[Rodolfo Llin\u00e1s]], neuroscientist, University Professor, [[New York University]]\n* [[Luis Carlos Gal\u00e1n Sarmiento]], politician\n* [[Catalina Sandino Moreno]], [[Academy Award]]-nominated actress\n* [[Catalina Robayo]], [[Miss Colombia 2010]], placed Top 16 at [[Miss Universe 2011]].\n* [[Alex Jadad|Alejandro R.

This was the origin of the Cali branch of the Javeriana University. On 20 November 1978 the board proposed the name Cali Branch, with headquarters in the capital under the same organization and higher authorities. The board of regents, at the request of the board, adopted the name Cali Branch. Today, this branch is one of the most prestigious universities in Cali.\n\nThe campus of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali is located in the south of the city, in Pance, at the foot of the [[Farallones de Cali]], part of the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)]], in a totally rural environment where vegetation and fauna abound. The campus consists of eight buildings (Las Palmas, Guayacanes, classrooms block, administration, Saman, Almendros, continuing education, and the recently opened Las Acacias). Two more buildings are being built on campus, which features five caf\u00e9s, the Javeriana Shop, a large parking lot surrounding the entire campus, a branch of [[Corpbanca]], a center of the Colombia Stock Exchange, and an MBA extension of [[Temple University]] [[Fox School of Business and Management]]. The campus also includes Alfonso Borrero Cabal auditorium; Central Library, one of the most complete in the Colombian Southwest; Loyola Sports Center; the office of entrepreneurship \"Campus Nova\", which fosters entrepreneurial talent within the university; and the Javeriano Writing Center, highly regarded for helping students develop writing skills.\n\nThe university has 35 research groups attached to the government [[Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation]]; and a station, Javeriana Stereo FM 107.5 with a wide audience in the Colombian Southwest. It offers students opportunities in more than 87 countries and boasts 120 academic cooperation agreements with universities abroad.\n\nCurrently, the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali offers 19 undergraduate programs of which eight have received quality accreditation by the Ministry of Education (Civil Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Systems Engineering and Computer Science, Business Administration, Accounting law and Psychology). The law degree from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali is prestigious in Cali and the Colombian [[:es:Sur Occidente (Barranquilla)|Suroccidente]], profiting from one of the most complete [[moot courts]] for student practice. The Cali branch of the Faculty of Health Sciences inaugurated the Moot Hospital which has high-tech teams and a superior infrastructure for student interns.\n\nIn March 2012, the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali received the Institutional Accreditation of High Quality from the Ministry of Education for eight years, placing it among the more competitive private universities in the country.\n\n== Alumni ==\nJaveriana's alumni include a vast range of prominent individuals in the history of the country and the region, with the following list representative.\n\n* [[Ernesto Samper]], President of Colombia (1994\u20131998)\n* [[Daniel Samper Pizano]], lawyer, journalist, and writer\n* [[Daniel Samper Ospina]], comedian, writer, journalist, and columnist\n* [[Misael Pastrana]], president of Colombia (1970\u20131974)\n* [[Rodolfo Llin\u00e1s]], neuroscientist, University Professor, [[New York University]]\n* [[Luis Carlos Gal\u00e1n Sarmiento]], politician\n* [[Catalina Sandino Moreno]], [[Academy Award]]-nominated actress\n* [[Catalina Robayo]], [[Miss Colombia 2010]], placed Top 16 at [[Miss Universe 2011]].\n* [[Alex Jadad|Alejandro R.
