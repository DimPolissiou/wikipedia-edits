An indictment issued in the state of Arizona alleged that Guzm\u00e1n had coordinated the shipment of {{convert|2000|kg|abbr=on}} of marijuana and about {{convert|4700|kg|abbr=on}} of cocaine from 19 October 1987 to 18 May 1990, and had received roughly US$1.5 million in drug proceeds that were shipped back to his home state. Another indictment alleged that Guzm\u00e1n earned US$100,000 for trafficking 70,000&nbsp;lb (roughly 31,750&nbsp;kg) of cocaine and an unspecified amount of marijuana in a period of three years.{{sfn|Beith, Malcolm|2010|pp=93\u201394}} In the border areas between Tecate and San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, Guzm\u00e1n ordered his men to traffic most of the drugs overland, but also through a few aircraft. By using the so-called piecemeal strategy, in which traffickers kept drug quantities relatively low, risks were reduced. Guzm\u00e1n also pioneered the use of sophisticated tunnels to move drugs across the border and into the United States.{{sfn|Beith, Malcolm|2010|pp=70\u201373}} Aside from pioneering the tunnels, Palma and Guzm\u00e1n packed cocaine into chili pepper cans under the brand \"La Comadre\" before they were shipped to the U.S. by train.<ref>{{Citation | author = Sebastian Rotella | title = Food Company Owners Charged in Drug Tunnel Case : Smuggling: Indictment names executives of Reynoso Bros. in unfinished underground passage linking San Diego and Tijuana | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | page =   |  date = 29 September 1995 | url =https://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-29/local/me-51176_1_san-diego/2| accessdate = 11 January 2016}}</ref> In return, the drug lords were paid through large suitcases filled with millions of dollars in cash.

He was instrumental in the Byzantine recovery of [[Nicaea]] from the [[Seljuk Turks]], in the reconquest of [[Cilicia]], and acted as the emperor's envoy in several missions to [[First Crusade|Crusader]] princes.\n\n==Early campaigns against the Seljuks==\n[[File:Alexius I.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Miniature of the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081\u20131118).]]\n\nBoutoumites appears in [[Anna Komnene]]'s ''[[Alexiad]]'' in 1086, when he was appointed as the ''[[dux|doux]]'' of the Byzantine fleet by Alexios, and sent against [[Abu'l Qasim (Seljuk governor of Nicaea)|Abu'l Qasim]], the semi-independent [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk Turkish]] governor of [[Nicaea]].<ref name=\"ODB\">{{harvnb|ODB|loc=\"Boutoumites\" (A. Kazhdan), pp. 318\u2013319}}.</ref><ref name=\"Skoulatos181\">{{harvnb|Skoulatos|1980|p=181}}.</ref> Abu'l Qasim was preparing to launch a fleet into the [[Sea of Marmara]] to challenge the [[Byzantine navy]]. Alexios, determined to prevent this, sent against him Boutoumites with the fleet, while [[Tatikios]] would move against his base by land. The two generals successfully destroyed the Seljuk fleet and forced Abu'l Qasim to withdraw to Nicaea, whence he concluded a truce with Byzantium.<ref name=\"Skoulatos181\"/><ref>[[Anna Komnene]], ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=202\u2013203}}.</ref>\n\nLater, in 1092, after Alexios's ''[[megas doux]]'', [[John Doukas (megas doux)|John Doukas]], defeated the emir [[Tzachas]] of [[Smyrna]], Boutoumites, along with Alexander Euphorbenos, were given as hostages to the emir to guarantee his peaceful evacuation of the island of [[Lesbos]].<ref name=\"Skoulatos181\"/><ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=270\u2013271}}.</ref> Soon after, Doukas and Boutoumites were sent against the rebellions of [[Karykes]] at [[Crete]] and [[Rhapsomates]] at [[Cyprus]]. After subduing Karykes's revolt, they headed to Cyprus, where [[Kyrenia]] fell quickly. Rhapsomates came out to meet them and occupied the heights above the city, but Boutoumites enticed many of his men to desert, and the rebel had to flee the battle. Boutoumites pursued and caught up with him at the church of the Holy Cross, where the rebel had sought refuge. Promising to spare his life, he captured him and brought him back to Doukas.<ref name=\"Skoulatos181\"/><ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=272\u2013274}}.</ref> According to tradition, while in Cyprus, he founded the [[Kykkos Monastery]] there.\n\n==First Crusade and the Siege of Nicaea==\nBoutoumites was highly regarded and trusted by Alexios; Anna Komnene calls him \"Alexios' sole confidant\". Hence he played an important role in the delicate dealings with the [[First Crusade]]: in 1096, Boutoumites was sent to escort the ship-wrecked [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]] from [[Dyrrhachium]] to [[Constantinople]], and in 1097, he was dispatched, at the head of a small detachment, to accompany the Crusader army as it marched against the Turks in [[Anatolia]].<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=315, 331}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1987|pp=144, 177}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Siege of Nicaea.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The siege of Nicaea, from a Western European illuminated manuscript.]]\n\nThe first great obstacle on the Crusaders' path was Nicaea, the Seljuk capital, prompting the [[Siege of Nicaea]] in 1097. Boutoumites had been instructed by Alexios to secure the surrender of the city to imperial forces, and not to the Crusaders. Already from the outset of the siege, Boutoumites, through numerous letters, tried to entice the Seljuks to surrender to him, whether through promises of amnesty or threats of a wholesale massacre should the Crusaders capture the city by force. The Turks had entered negotiations, allowing Boutoumites to enter the city. Two days later, at the news of the approach of a relief force under Sultan [[Kilij Arslan I]] (r. 1092\u20131107), they forced him to leave.<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=331\u2013334}}; {{harvnb|Skoulatos|1980|p=182}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1969|p=289}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=179}}.</ref> After the relief force was defeated by the Crusaders, however, and as an imperial squadron under Boutoumites gained control of the city's open supply route through the [[Ascanian Lake]] and 2,000 Byzantines under Tatikios joined the Crusaders in the siege, the city's inhabitants determined to accept Alexios's terms: Boutoumites entered Nicaea and showed them the Byzantine emperor's [[chrysobull]], offering generous terms and honours for the Sultan's wife and sister, who were in the city. Boutoumites, however, kept the deal a secret, and arranged with Tatikios for a renewed assault by the Crusaders and Tatikios's men, in which the city would ostensibly be captured by the Byzantines. The ruse worked: the day of the final assault was set for June 19, but when the assault began at dawn, the Byzantines, allowed in through the lake-ward gates, raised their standards on the battlements, leaving the Crusaders outside.<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=334\u2013338}}; {{harvnb|Skoulatos|1980|pp=182\u2013183}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1969|p=290}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=180}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough by and large the Crusaders accepted the outcome, the event soured relations. The Crusader leaders felt cheated at having been left out of the loop after the casualties they suffered in defeating the Turkish relief force, but the resentment was greater among the Crusader rank and file, who were deprived of the prospect of plunder and outraged at the Byzantines' respectful treatment of the Muslim captives.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1969|pp=290\u2013291}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}.</ref> In the aftermath of the city's fall, Boutoumites was named by Alexios as ''[[dux|doux]]'' of Nicaea. He was successful both in keeping the Crusader rank and file, still eager for pillage, in check \u2013 they were not allowed into the city except in groups of ten \u2013 and in soothing their leaders through gifts and securing their pledge of allegiance to Alexios. He also persuaded some of the Crusaders to enroll in the Byzantine army.

After subduing Karykes's revolt, they headed to Cyprus, where [[Kyrenia]] fell quickly. Rhapsomates came out to meet them and occupied the heights above the city, but Boutoumites enticed many of his men to desert, and the rebel had to flee the battle. Boutoumites pursued and caught up with him at the church of the Holy Cross, where the rebel had sought refuge.

Hence he played an important role in the delicate dealings with the [[First Crusade]]: in 1096, Boutoumites was sent to escort the ship-wrecked [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]] from [[Dyrrhachium]] to [[Constantinople]], and in 1097, he was dispatched, at the head of a small detachment, to accompany the Crusader army as it marched against the Turks in [[Anatolia]].<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=315, 331}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1987|pp=144, 177}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Siege of Nicaea.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The siege of Nicaea, from a Western European illuminated manuscript.]]\n\nThe first great obstacle on the Crusaders' path was Nicaea, the Seljuk capital, which they proceeded to [[Siege of Nicaea|besiege]]. Boutoumites had been instructed by Alexios to secure the surrender of the city to imperial forces, and not to the Crusaders. Already from the outset of the siege, Boutoumites, through numerous letters, tried to entice the Seljuks to surrender to him, whether through promises of amnesty or threats of a wholesale massacre should the Crusaders capture the city by force. The Turks had entered negotiations, allowing Boutoumites to enter the city. Two days later, at the news of the approach of a relief force under Sultan [[Kilij Arslan I]] (r. 1092\u20131107), they forced him to leave.<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=331\u2013334}}; {{harvnb|Skoulatos|1980|p=182}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1969|p=289}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=179}}.</ref> After the relief force was defeated by the Crusaders, however, and as an imperial squadron under Boutoumites gained control of the city's open supply route through the [[Ascanian Lake]] and 2,000 Byzantines under Tatikios joined the Crusaders in the siege, the city's inhabitants determined to accept Alexios's terms: Boutoumites entered Nicaea and showed them the Byzantine emperor's [[chrysobull]], offering generous terms and honours for the Sultan's wife and sister, who were in the city. Boutoumites, however, kept the deal a secret, and arranged with Tatikios for a renewed assault by the Crusaders and Tatikios's men, in which the city would ostensibly be captured by the Byzantines. The ruse worked: the day of the final assault was set for June 19, but when the assault began at dawn, the Byzantines, allowed in through the lake-ward gates, raised their standards on the battlements, leaving the Crusaders outside.<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=334\u2013338}}; {{harvnb|Skoulatos|1980|pp=182\u2013183}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1969|p=290}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=180}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough by and large the Crusaders accepted the outcome, the event soured relations. The Crusader leaders felt cheated at having been left out of the loop after the casualties they suffered in defeating the Turkish relief force, but the resentment was greater among the Crusader rank and file, who were deprived of the prospect of plunder and outraged at the Byzantines' respectful treatment of the [[Islam|Muslim]] captives.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1969|pp=290\u2013291}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}.</ref> In the aftermath of the city's fall, Boutoumites was named by Alexios as ''[[dux|doux]]'' of Nicaea.

Iliescu was a [[Senate of Romania|senator]] for the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), of which he is the founder and honorary president.\n\nHe joined the Communist Party in 1953 and became a member of its Central Committee in 1965. However, beginning with 1971, he was gradually marginalized by [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]. He had a leading role in the [[Romanian Revolution]], becoming the country's president in December 1989. In May 1990, he became Romania's first freely elected head of state. After a new constitution was approved by popular referendum, he served a further two terms as president, from 1992 to 1996, and from 2000 to 2004, separated by the presidency of [[Emil Constantinescu]], who defeated him in 1996.\n\nIliescu is widely recognized as a predominant figure in the first fifteen years of post-revolution politics. During his presidency, Romania joined [[NATO]].

For most of the 1980s (if not before), he was tailed by the [[Securitate]] (secret police), as he was known to oppose Ceau\u0219escu's harsh rule.<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>\n\n==Romanian Revolution==\n{{Main|Romanian Revolution}}\nThe Romanian Revolution began as a popular revolt in [[Timi\u0219oara]]. After Ceau\u0219escu was overthrown on 22 December, the political vacuum was filled by an organization named [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN: ''Frontul Salv\u0103rii Na\u021bionale''), formed spontaneously by second-rank communist party members opposed to the policies of Ceau\u0219escu and non-affiliated participants in the revolt. Iliescu was quickly acknowledged as the leader of the organization and therefore of the provisional authority. He first learned of the revolution when he noticed the Securitate was no longer tailing him.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nThe Ceau\u0219escus were captured, haled before a [[Trial and execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu|drumhead court-martial]], and executed on Christmas Day. Years later, Iliescu conceded that the trial and execution were \"quite shameful, but necessary\" to end the chaos that had riven the country since Ceau\u0219escu's overthow.<ref name=dem25dec>{{cite news|last=Demian|first=Sinziana|title=In Romania, Ceausescu's death haunts Christmas|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/091224/romania-nicolae-elena-ceausescu|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=Global Post|date=25 December 2009|location=Cluj Napoca}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CFSN Revolution Roumaine.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three men are walking side-by-side holding papers.

This is widely held to have meant the adoption of ''[[Perestroika]]''-style reforms rather than the complete removal of existing institutions; it can be linked to the warm reception the new regime was given by Mikhail Gorbachev and the rest of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leadership, and the fact that the first post-revolutionary international agreement signed by Romania was with that country.\n\nIliescu did not renounce Communist ideology and the program he initially presented during the revolution included restructuring the agriculture and the reorganization of trade, but not a switch to capitalism.<ref name=\"risingstar\"/> These views were held by other members of the FSN as well, such as [[Silviu Brucan]], who claimed in early 1990 that the revolution was against Ceau\u0219escu, not against communism.<ref>http://eprints-phd.biblio.unitn.it/74/1/PhDThesisSGI.pdf</ref> Iliescu later evoked the possibility of trying a \"[[Sweden|Swedish]] model\" of socialism.\n\nRumours abounded for years that Illiescu and other second-rank Communists had been planning to overthrow Ceau\u0219escu, but the events of December 1989 overtook them. For instance, [[Nicolae Militaru]], the new regime's first [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|defense minister]], said that Illiescu and others had planned to take Ceau\u0219escu prisoner in February 1990 while he was out of the capital. However, Illiescu denies this, saying that the nature of the Ceau\u0219escu regime\u2014particularly the Securitate's ubiquity\u2014made advance planning for a coup all but impossible.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\n==Presidency==\n{{expand section|date=June 2012}}\n{{Infobox President styles\n | image = Coat of arms of Romania.svg\n | size = 50px\n | name = Ion Iliescu\n | dipstyle = Pre\u0219edintele (President)\n | offstyle = Pre\u0219edintele (President)\n | altstyle = Domnia Sa/Excelen\u021ba Sa (His Excellency)\n}}\nThe [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] decided to organize itself as a party and run in the [[1990 Romanian general election|1990 general election]]\u2014the first free election held in the country in 53 years\u2013with Illiescu as its presidential candidate.

He thus became Romania's first democratically elected head of state, and the first since 1947 who was not a Communist or [[fellow traveler]]. To date, it is the only time since the end of Communism that a president has been elected in a single round.\n\nIliescu and his supporters split from the Front and created the Democratic National Salvation Front (NSDF), which later evolved into the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), then the Social Democratic Party (PSD) (see [[Social Democratic Party of Romania]]). Progressively, the Front lost its character as a [[Central government|national government]] or generic coalition, and became vulnerable to criticism for using its appeal as the first institution involved in power sharing, while engaging itself in political battles with forces that could not enjoy this status, nor the credibility.\n\nUnder the pressure of the events that led to the [[Mineriad]]s, his political stance has veered with time: from a proponent of ''Perestroika'', Iliescu recast himself as a Western European [[social democracy|social democrat]]. The main debate around the subject of his commitment to such ideals is linked to the special conditions in Romania, and especially to the strong [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist]] and autarkic attitude visible within the Ceau\u0219escu regime. Critics have pointed out that, unlike most communist-to-social democrat changes in the [[Eastern bloc]], Romania's tended to retain various cornerstones.\n\n[[File:Ion Iliescu (2004).jpg|thumb|165px|Iliescu in 2004]]\n[[File:Iliescu si Bush.jpg|thumb|250px|Iliescu and U.S. President George W.

In 1992, Iliescu [[1992 Romanian general election|won a second term]] when he received 61% of the vote in the second round. He immediately suspended his NSDF membership; the Constitution does not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his term. He ran for a third time in [[1996 Romanian general election|1996]] but, stripped of media monopoly, he lost in the second round to [[Emil Constantinescu]], his second-round opponent in 1992. Over 1,000,000 votes were cancelled, leading to accusations of widespread fraud. Nevertheless, Iliescu conceded defeat within hours of polls closing, making him the only incumbent president to lose a bid for re-election since the end of Communism.\n\nIn the [[2000 Romanian general election|2000 presidential election]] Iliescu ran again and won in the run-off against the ultra-nationalist<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitatea.net/preda-antonescu-il-secondeaza-pe-vadim-tudor-cu-discursul-ultranationalist_718413.html|title=Preda: Antonescu \u00eel secondeaz\u0103 pe Vadim Tudor cu discursul ultrana\u0163ionalist|publisher=Realitatea|accessdate=28 December 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927232910/http://www.realitatea.net/preda-antonescu-il-secondeaza-pe-vadim-tudor-cu-discursul-ultranationalist_718413.html|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/index.php?sec=article&article_id=4066|title=Article|publisher=SF Bay Times|accessdate=28 December 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016063611/http://www.sfbaytimes.com/index.php?sec=article&article_id=4066|archivedate=16 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/romania/tudor.html|title=House of Tudor|publisher=PBS|accessdate=28 December 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106052244/http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/romania/tudor.html|archivedate=6 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]].

The pejorative term for this demonstration was the [[Golaniad]] (from the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''golan'', rascal). On 13 June, an attempt of the authorities to remove from the square around 100 protesters, which had remained in the street even after the [[1990 Romanian presidential election|May elections]] had confirmed Iliescu and the FSN, resulted in attacks against several state institutions, such as the Ministry of Interior, the Bucharest Police Headquarters and the National Television. Iliescu issued a call to the Romanian people to come and defend the government, prompting several groups of miners to descend on the capital, armed with wooden clubs and bats. They trashed the [[University of Bucharest]], some newspaper offices and the headquarters of opposition parties, claiming that they were havens of decadence and immorality \u2013 drugs, firearms and munitions, \"an automatic typewriter\", and fake currency.

Iliescu was a [[Senate of Romania|senator]] for the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), of which he is the founder and honorary president.\n\nHe joined the Communist Party in 1953 and became a member of its Central Committee in 1965. However, beginning with 1971, he was gradually marginalized by [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]. He had a leading role in the [[Romanian Revolution]], becoming the country's president in December 1989. In May 1990, he became Romania's first freely elected head of state. After a new constitution was approved by popular referendum, he served a further two terms as president, from 1992 to 1996, and from 2000 to 2004, separated by the presidency of [[Emil Constantinescu]], who defeated him in 1996.\n\nIliescu is widely recognized as a predominant figure in the first fifteen years of post-revolution politics. During his presidency, Romania joined [[NATO]]. In April 2018, Ion Iliescu was charged in Romania with committing [[crimes against humanity]] during the deadly aftermath of the country's 1989 revolution.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stirileprotv.ro/justitie/ion-iliescu-asteptat-la-parchetul-general-fostul-presedinte-este-urmarit-penal-in-dosarul-revolutiei.html |title=Dosarul \"Revolu\u021biei\".

In 1931, he went to the [[Soviet Union]] to take part in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] Congress of [[Moscow]]. He remained in the USSR for the next four years and was arrested upon his return. He was imprisoned from June 1940 to August 1944 and died in August 1945. During his time in the Soviet Union, Alexandru Iliescu divorced and married Mari\u021ba, a chambermaid.\n\nIliescu married Nina \u0218erb\u0103nescu in 1951; they have no children, not by choice but because they could not, as Nina had three [[miscarriage]]s.<ref>[http://ziua.net/news.php?data=2008-09-06&id=12256 \"De ce nu a avut Ion Iliescu urmasi\"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Ziua'', 5 September 2008</ref> Born in [[Olteni\u021ba]], Iliescu studied [[fluid mechanics]] at the [[Bucharest Polytechnic Institute]] and then as a foreign student at the Energy Institute of the [[Moscow University]].

He was marginalized and removed from all major political offices, becoming vice-president of the [[Timi\u0219 County]] Council (1971\u20131974), and later president of the [[Ia\u0219i County|Ia\u0219i]] Council (1974\u20131979). Until 1989, he was in charge of the Editura Tehnic\u0103 publishing house.

After Ceau\u0219escu was overthrown on 22 December, the political vacuum was filled by an organization named [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN: ''Frontul Salv\u0103rii Na\u021bionale''), formed spontaneously by second-rank communist party members opposed to the policies of Ceau\u0219escu and non-affiliated participants in the revolt. Iliescu was quickly acknowledged as the leader of the organization and therefore of the provisional authority. He first learned of the revolution when he noticed the Securitate was no longer tailing him.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nThe Ceau\u0219escus were captured, haled before a [[Trial and execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu|drumhead court-martial]], and executed on Christmas Day. Years later, Iliescu conceded that the trial and execution were \"quite shameful, but necessary\" to end the chaos that had riven the country since Ceau\u0219escu's overthow.<ref name=dem25dec>{{cite news|last=Demian|first=Sinziana|title=In Romania, Ceausescu's death haunts Christmas|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/091224/romania-nicolae-elena-ceausescu|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=Global Post|date=25 December 2009|location=Cluj Napoca}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CFSN Revolution Roumaine.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three men are walking side-by-side holding papers.

This is widely held to have meant the adoption of ''[[Perestroika]]''-style reforms rather than the complete removal of existing institutions; it can be linked to the warm reception the new regime was given by Mikhail Gorbachev and the rest of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leadership, and the fact that the first post-revolutionary international agreement signed by Romania was with that country.\n\nIliescu did not renounce Communist ideology and the program he initially presented during the revolution included restructuring the agriculture and the reorganization of trade, but not a switch to capitalism.<ref name=\"risingstar\"/> These views were held by other members of the FSN as well, such as [[Silviu Brucan]], who claimed in early 1990 that the revolution was against Ceau\u0219escu, not against communism.<ref>http://eprints-phd.biblio.unitn.it/74/1/PhDThesisSGI.pdf</ref> Iliescu later evoked the possibility of trying a \"[[Sweden|Swedish]] model\" of socialism.\n\nRumours abounded for years that Illiescu and other second-rank Communists had been planning to overthrow Ceau\u0219escu, but the events of December 1989 overtook them. For instance, [[Nicolae Militaru]], the new regime's first [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|defense minister]], said that Illiescu and others had planned to take Ceau\u0219escu prisoner in February 1990 while he was out of the capital. However, Illiescu denies this, saying that the nature of the Ceau\u0219escu regime\u2014particularly the Securitate's ubiquity\u2014made advance planning for a coup all but impossible.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\n==Presidency==\n{{expand section|date=June 2012}}\n{{Infobox President styles\n | image = Coat of arms of Romania.svg\n | size = 50px\n | name = Ion Iliescu\n | dipstyle = Pre\u0219edintele (President)\n | offstyle = Pre\u0219edintele (President)\n | altstyle = Domnia Sa/Excelen\u021ba Sa (His Excellency)\n}}\nThe [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] decided to organize itself as a party and run in the [[1990 Romanian general election|1990 general election]]\u2014the first free election held in the country in 53 years\u2013with Illiescu as its presidential candidate. The FSN won a sweeping victory, taking strong majorities in both chambers.<ref>Nohlen & St\u00f6ver, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120205171131/http://www2.essex.ac.uk/elect/database/indexElections.asp?country=ROMANIA&election=ro90cd University of Essex]</ref> In the separate presidential election, Iliescu won handily, taking 85 percent of the vote, still the largest vote share for a free presidential election. He thus became Romania's first democratically elected head of state, and the first since 1947 who was not a Communist or [[fellow traveler]]. To date, it is the only time since the end of Communism that a president has been elected in a single round.\n\nIliescu and his supporters split from the Front and created the Democratic National Salvation Front (NSDF), which later evolved into the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), then the Social Democratic Party (PSD) (see [[Social Democratic Party of Romania]]). Progressively, the Front lost its character as a [[Central government|national government]] or generic coalition, and became vulnerable to criticism for using its appeal as the first institution involved in power sharing, while engaging itself in political battles with forces that could not enjoy this status, nor the credibility.\n\nUnder the pressure of the events that led to the [[Mineriad]]s, his political stance has veered with time: from a proponent of ''Perestroika'', Iliescu recast himself as a Western European [[social democracy|social democrat]]. The main debate around the subject of his commitment to such ideals is linked to the special conditions in Romania, and especially to the strong [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist]] and autarkic attitude visible within the Ceau\u0219escu regime. Critics have pointed out that, unlike most communist-to-social democrat changes in the [[Eastern bloc]], Romania's tended to retain various cornerstones.\n\n[[File:Ion Iliescu (2004).jpg|thumb|165px|Iliescu in 2004]]\n[[File:Iliescu si Bush.jpg|thumb|250px|Iliescu and U.S. President George W.

The pejorative term for this demonstration was the [[Golaniad]] (from the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''golan'', rascal).

He was not sure if he had been married eleven or twelve times, but claimed to have roughly 36 children.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 1931, he toured England and enjoyed a flight from Brooklands. He did not drink, or smoke, and was largely vegetarian. He held conservative views, feeling that women should have long hair and skirts, and in Turkey they should remain indoors, out of the view of strangers.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAga had 14 children, however their names were never recorded. His wife, a Turk, was highly looked upon. She was viewed as a person above most people, but died at 60 years old.\n\nAga himself refused to believe the claims of a man in [[China]] who was said to be 252 years old. Aga lived in relative anonymity until 1930, when someone, hearing his stories about meeting Napoleon and the Sultan of Turkey, pointed out that he had a claim to be the world\u2019s oldest man, and he began a public life with a tour of the USA. He said that he lost his teeth soon after [[Napoleon III]] [[Battle of Sedan|lost Sedan]]. He became prosperous through his fame and toured circus shows as the \u2018Eighth Wonder of the World\u2019.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nEventually Aga had to return home, as his wife Kudret was threatening to sue him for maintenance.

First phase was the conventional military warfare \nbetween two organized armies: The US Forces and the First Philippine Republican Army. This was period was from February to November \n1899. The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command.

The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command. The remnants of the First Philippine Republic continued the struggle for independence into local regional and provincial levels as late as 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/war |title=The Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |publisher=Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute |website=United States Department of State |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n===Works cited in footnotes===\n* Almario, Virgilio (1998) *Rebolusyong Filipino, Intimas Memorias, memoirs of  Colonel Sityar, in Spanish, page 197,  translated to Tagalog by Almario\n* {{cite book|last= Alvarez|first=Santiago V.|title=The katipunan and the revolution: memoirs of a general : with the original Tagalog text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3q-krDckHwC|year=1992|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-077-7|ref=harv}}<!--note: also mentions \n\na General Mariano Alvarez (Apoy) on p.43, \na Lieutenant General Artemio Ricarte (Vibora) on p. 80, \na General Emilio Aguinaldo (Magdalo) on p.132, \na General Ramon Bernardo (Salogo) on p.145 & 163, \na General Luis Malinis on p.147,157 \na General Lucino de la Cruz (Ipo-Ipo) on p.150,\na General Francisco de Asis (Labe, Heneral Kiko) on p.152-153, 155-156, & 164-169\na General Vincente Leyba (Kalentong) on p.159 \na General Felipe Estrella on p. 182-189\na General Eusebio Roque  (Maestrong Sebio,Dimabunggo) on p. 182-189\na General Julian Santos on p. 195\na General Salvador Estrella on p. 197\na General Modesto Ritual on p.201-202 \na Information about \"Kolorum\" (Colorum) and religious-insurrection movements on p. 207\n-->\n\n* {{cite book|last= Halili|first=M.c.|title=Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC|year=2004|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-3934-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last= Linn|first=Brian McAllister|authorlink=Brian McAllister Linn|title=The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5WOrmt_VxcC|year=2000|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4948-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nakpil|first=Carmen Guerrero |title=Whatever: a new collection of later essays, 1987-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0Ro1qPjXAC|year=2002|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-417-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/98377/king-of-the-philippines |title=King of the Philippines |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 21, 2016 |access-date=December 27, 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ochosa |first= Orlino |date= January 1, 1995|title=Bandoleros, Outlawed Guerrillas of the Philippine-American War, 1903-1907 |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Bandoleros-Outlawed-Guerrillas-Philippine-American-War-1903-1907-Orlino-Ochosa/9789711005559 |location=United States of America |publisher=New Day Publishers |isbn=9711005557|ref=harv}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Macario Sakay on  p.25\n-->\n* {{cite book|last1=Zaide|first1=Sonia M.|last2=Zaide|first2=Gregorio F.|title=The Philippines: a unique nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6ZtAQAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=All-Nations Publishing Co.|isbn=978-971-642-064-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=United States Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwtHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA664|year=1902|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Berixio Consola on  p.292\n-->\n* {{Google books| kO_WgIWHPH8C|Report of the Lieutenant-General Commanding the Army, Part 9 - U.S. Government Printing Office, 1902}}<!--note: also mentions\n\na Colonel Norberto Mayo on p. 175\n--> \n* {{Google books| ML9MAAAAYAAJ|1904 Annual Report of the Secretary of War: Volume 7 United States War Dept|page=38}}\n* {{Google books| ZEhUAAAAIAAJ|1907 Congressional Serial Set - U.S. Government Printing Office|page=240}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/ulatfilipino/311705/sino-si-heneral-kalentong-na-kilalang-kalye-sa-mandaluyong/story/ |title=Sino Si Heneral Kalentong Na Kilalang Kalye Sa Mandaluyong?

S. Wilson]], and written by Maddock, Wilson, and Underwood. ''Tremors'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] and stars [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Finn Carter]], [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]], and [[Reba McEntire]].\n\nIn the film, tired of their dull lives in the small desert town of Perfection, Nevada, repairmen Val McKee (Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Ward) try to skip town. However, they happen upon a series of mysterious deaths and a concerned seismologist Rhonda (Carter) studying unnatural readings below the ground. With the help of an eccentric [[survivalist]] couple Burt and Heather Gummer (Gross and McEntire), the group fights for survival against giant, worm-like monsters hungry for human flesh.\n\nThe film is the first installment of the [[Tremors (franchise)|''Tremors'' franchise]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2DE1631F93AA25752C0A966958260|title=Underground Creatures and Dread Events|author=Vincent Canby|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1990-01-19|author-link=Vincent Canby}}</ref> and was followed by five [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]]s: ''[[Tremors 2: Aftershocks]]'' (1996), ''[[Tremors 3: Back to Perfection]]'' (2001), ''[[Tremors 5: Bloodlines]]'' (2015), ''[[Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell]]'' (2018) and ''[[Tremors: Island Fury]]'' (2020) and a direct-to-video [[prequel]], ''[[Tremors 4: The Legend Begins]]'' (2004).

This is current 647 words long, and the guideline recommends a maximum of 700 words. -->\nValentine \"Val\" McKee and Earl Bassett are handymen working in Perfection, Nevada, an isolated ex-mining settlement in the high desert east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains. They eventually get tired of their jobs and leave for Bixby, the nearest town. As they leave, they discover the dead body of another resident, Edgar Deems, perched atop an [[Electricity pylon|electrical tower]], still grasping the tower's crossbeams and his [[.30-30 Winchester]] rifle. Jim Wallace, the town's doctor, determines that Edgar died of dehydration, apparently afraid for some reason to climb down.\n\nLater on, an unknown creature kills shepherd \"Old Fred\" and his flock of sheep. After discovering his severed head buried in the sand, Val and Earl become convinced that a serial killer is on the loose; they head back to town to warn the other residents. Two construction workers ignore Val and Earl's warning and are killed by the same creature, causing a rock slide. Val and Earl try to get help, but find the phone lines are dead, and the only road out of town is completely blocked by the rock slide. Out of sight, a snake-like creature wraps itself around their truck's rear axle. The creature is however torn apart when Val stomps on the accelerator and drives away, where they find it later when they return to town.\n\nVal and Earl return to Perfection and borrow horses. They come upon Wallace and his wife's buried [[station wagon]] near their trailer, but the couple is missing (they were killed the previous night). As they press on, an enormous burrowing worm-like creature (later named a \"graboid\" by general store owner Walter Chang), suddenly erupts out of the ground, revealing the snake-like creature to be one of the worm creature's tentacled \"tongues\": thrown from their horses, the men flee with the monster following them in pursuit. The chase ends when the eyeless creature crashes through the concrete wall of an [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]], dying from the impact. Rhonda LeBeck, a graduate student conducting [[seismology]] tests in the area, stumbles onto the scene; she deduces from previous soundings that three other graboids are in the area. Rhonda, Val, and Earl become trapped overnight atop a cluster of boulders near one of the creatures, named Stumpy. Rhonda has a brainstorm and grabs one of several left-behind fence poles of a nearby fence; the three of them repeatedly pole vault to residual boulders to get to her truck, finally making their getaway.\n\nAfter the three return to town, the graboids start attacking, eventually, one of them killing Walter and forcing the other citizens to the town's rooftops. Meanwhile, nearby [[survivalist]] couple [[Burt Gummer|Burt]] and Heather Gummer manage to kill another one of the creatures after unknowingly luring it to their basement armory. In town, the two remaining graboids attack the building foundations, knocking over a trailer belonging to Nestor before dragging him under and devouring him.\n\nVal and Earl are stuck on a roof with Miguel. Realizing they cannot stay in the town any longer, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel distract the monsters while Val commandeers a CAT Track-Loader and chains a partial truck trailer to the rear; the survivors use it to try to escape to a nearby mountain range. On the way there, both graboids create a sinkhole trap that disables the track-loader, forcing the survivors to flee to safety on large boulders. Earl has an idea to lure in the Graboids, then trick them into swallowing Burt's homemade bombs. While this works on one graboid, the other one, Stumpy, regurgitates it back towards the survivors, forcing Val, Earl, and Rhonda to vacate the rock quickly to avoid the explosion.\n\nWith one last bomb, Val lures Stumpy to chase him to the edge of a cliff and then explodes the bomb behind him, frightening the graboid into charging through the cliff face, where he plummets to his death onto the rocks below. The group returns to town, where they call in the authorities to begin an investigation while Earl encourages Val to pursue a romantic relationship with Rhonda.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, plus remaining four (so few), all roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Valentine McKee\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Earl Bassett\n* [[Finn Carter]] as Rhonda LeBeck\n* [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] as [[Burt Gummer]]\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1927)|V\u00edctor Wong]] as Walter Chang\n* [[Bobby Jacoby]] as Melvin Plug\n* [[Ariana Richards]] as Mindy\n* [[Reba McEntire]] as Heather Gummer\n* [[Charlotte Stewart]] as Nancy\n* [[Tony Genaro]] as Miguel\n* [[Richard Marcus]] as Nestor\n* [[Bibi Besch]] as Megan\u2013the doctor's wife\n* Conrad Bachmann as Jim\u2013the doctor\n* [[Sunshine Parker]] as Edgar\n* Michael Dan Wagner as Old Fred\n* John Goodwin as Howard\u2013roadworker\n* [[John Pappas]] as Carmine\u2013roadworker\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe concept of Tremors was originally conceived in the early 1980s, when writers S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock were working for the [[United States Navy]] as filmmakers in charge of creating educational safety videos. While getting footage, the two climbed a large desert boulder and asked the question \"what if there was something that wouldn't let us off of this rock?\" causing the two to later come up with an idea dubbed 'Land Sharks'.<ref>[https://youtube.com/m-HUUt21tRA?t=64]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref> They shared their idea to friend [[Ron Underwood]], who was working with [[National Geographic]] as a documentary director, and used his knowledge of zoology to better develop the \"land sharks\" into creatures that could realistically exist.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAfter their script for ''[[Short Circuit (1986 film)|Short Circuit]]'' became a major box office hit, Wilson and Maddock quickly began shopping around their idea for ''Tremors''. The name 'Land Sharks' was changed due to a then-popular [[Saturday Night Live]] sketch featuring a character of the same name. The original screenplay, titled 'Beneath Perfection', was finished in June 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Tremors.html|title=Tremors Script at IMSDb.|website=www.imsdb.com}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in early 1989 over the course of 50 days. [[Principal photography]] took place around [[Lone Pine, California]] and the isolated community of [[Darwin, California]], which the crew liked due to its uncanny similitaries to the fictional town of Perfection, Nevada. The town, which was entirely a set, was built near [[Olancha, California]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tremors filming locations |url=http://scabbyhorror.blogspot.com/2014/12/tremors-1990-filming-locations.html|date=December 2, 2014}}</ref> The mountains in the distance are the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and [[Owens Lake]] can be seen in the background during the film's climax.<ref>{{cite interview |last1= Maddock |first1= Brent |last2=Wilson |first2=SS |interviewer= MJ Simpson |title=Exclusive Tremors Interview Part 3 |url=http://www.angelfire.com/movies/krccc/interview3.html |date= June 5, 2000 |accessdate=January 4, 2014|work=[[angelfire.com]] }}</ref>\n\n===Props===\nThe creature for ''Tremors'' was designed by [[Amalgamated Dynamics]].

However, the [[MPAA]] gave the film an R-rating due to language, and the creators decided at the last minute to make the film more commercially viable.

When fully grown, a Graboid will be up to {{convert|30|ft|m}} long, and {{convert|6|ft|m}} across at the widest point, and weigh 10\u201320 tons. Graboids have no eyes; they do not need them, due to living underground. Their heads consist of a massive black armored beak, which is used to push aside the dirt while digging. The beak opens like a grotesque flower; it consists of a wide upper jaw, a thinner lower jaw, and a pair of hooked [[mandible]]s, one on each side. In ''[[Tremors 5: Bloodlines]]'', they are reported to have a semi-rigid internal structure, much like the [[cuttlebone]] of [[cuttlefish]].\n\nGraboids have three long powerful [[snake]]-like tentacles, which are [[prehensile]] and can have at least a good {{convert|6|foot|m}}  reach; possibly up to {{convert|10|ft|m}} or greater. Each of these tentacles (which have been loosely compared to functioning like the creature's tongue) terminates in a toothed mouth of its own. It is unclear if they bite off and swallow food on their own, or if they are simply used to get a better grip on prey so it can be dragged into the creature's jaws. Normally kept retracted in the Graboid's throat, these tentacles were initially mistaken for the whole creatures, causing the characters in the first ''Tremors'' film to underestimate the size of their underground opponents. The Graboid's common name is derived from these prehensile tentacles, which 'grab' prey and pull it back down the Graboid's hungry gullet. At times, these tentacles appear to be semi-autonomous, hissing and writhing like snakes. Food is typically swallowed whole, though early in the first film, they are shown to be capable of dismembering and decapitating prey.\n\n===Life cycle===\n[[File:Graboid_Lifecycle_Updated.svg|thumb|220px|right|Fan made life cycle diagram.]]\n*Graboids are hatched from eggs laid by Ass-Blasters (the final stage in the life cycle), as indicated in ''Tremors 3''. These eggs split open diagonally.\n*Baby Graboids and are much shorter and more compact in comparison to the adults, but already have the typical set of jaws and mandibles. The baby Graboids also have a row of armored scales on their backs for protection, which are shed before they fully mature. Like adults, they have large spikes used for digging; extra-large rows of spikes sprout from the sides of their body. Being smaller than the adults, baby Graboids are able to hurl themselves out of the dirt to tackle prey, like \"some kind of demonic trout\", according to Hiram Gummer (portrayed by Michael Gross) in ''Tremors 4''. Their tentacles are underdeveloped at this point in their lifecycle.\n*Upon maturing, Graboids measure 30 feet (9.2 m) long and will resume attacking and consuming prey. After that, they will seek a secluded spot where they will [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphose]].\n*Upon emerging, Shriekers will search for food. When they have eaten a sufficient amount of food, Shriekers will spit out a [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] containing a mini version of themselves. This ability to reproduce asexually allows them to expand their numbers greatly over a short period of time, although it is unknown whether a Shrieker can produce more than one [[Cloning|clone]]. The newborn Shrieker is fully developed, about 10&nbsp;inches (25&nbsp;cm) long{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} and starts growing right after birth, as seen in ''Tremors 2''.\n*When a Shrieker is around three days old, it will undergo a [[moult]]ing process, turning into an Ass-Blaster.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Ass-Blasters can live up to several years (an individual sold to [[Siegfried and Roy]] in ''Tremors 3'' was still alive two years later).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} They attack anything warm. While shriekers reproduce asexually when they have fed enough, Ass-Blasters slip into a [[coma]] when they eat a large amount of food, as seen in ''Tremors 3''. They ''can'' reproduce, however \u2013 each Ass-Blaster carries a Graboid egg in its gut. Because they cover large distances when flying, they can carry these eggs further away, as theorized by Jodi Chang in ''Tremors 3''.\n\n==Sequels & spin-offs==\n{{Main|Tremors (franchise)}}\n\nA sequel, ''[[Tremors 2: Aftershocks]]'', was released in 1996. A second sequel, ''[[Tremors 3: Back to Perfection]]'', was released in 2001, followed by a prequel, ''[[Tremors 4: The Legend Begins]]'' in 2004. These three sequels were all made with direct involvement from S.S. Wilson, Brent Maddock, and Ron Underwood at Stampede Entertainment. Following an 11-year gap, ''[[Tremors 5: Bloodlines]]'' was released in 2015, with the franchise's sixth inclusion, ''[[Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell]]'', in 2018. These two films were made by [[Universal 1440 Entertainment]] without any involvement from Stampede Entertainment.

This is current 647 words long, and the guideline recommends a maximum of 700 words. -->\nValentine \"Val\" McKee and Earl Bassett are handymen working in Perfection, Nevada, an isolated ex-mining settlement in the high desert east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains. They eventually get tired of their jobs and leave for Bixby, the nearest town. As they leave, they discover the dead body of another resident, Edgar Deems, perched atop an [[Electricity pylon|electrical tower]], still grasping the tower's crossbeams and his [[.30-30 Winchester]] rifle. Jim Wallace, the town's doctor, determines that Edgar died of dehydration, apparently afraid for some reason to climb down.\n\nLater on, an unknown creature kills shepherd \"Old Fred\" and his flock of sheep. After discovering his severed head buried in the sand, Val and Earl become convinced that a serial killer is on the loose; they head back to town to warn the other residents. Two construction workers ignore Val and Earl's warning and are killed by the same creature, causing a rock slide. Val and Earl try to get help, but find the phone lines are dead, and the only road out of town is completely blocked by the rock slide. Out of sight, a snake-like creature wraps itself around their truck's rear axle. The creature is however torn apart when Val stomps on the accelerator and drives away, where they find it later when they return to town.\n\nVal and Earl return to Perfection and borrow horses. They come upon Wallace and his wife's buried [[station wagon]] near their trailer, but the couple is missing (they were killed the previous night). As they press on, an enormous burrowing worm-like creature (later named a \"graboid\" by general store owner Walter Chang), suddenly erupts out of the ground, revealing the snake-like creature to be one of the worm creature's tentacled \"tongues\": thrown from their horses, the men flee with the monster following them in pursuit. The chase ends when the eyeless creature crashes through the concrete wall of an [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]], dying from the impact. Rhonda LeBeck, a graduate student conducting [[seismology]] tests in the area, stumbles onto the scene; she deduces from previous soundings that three other graboids are in the area. Rhonda, Val, and Earl become trapped overnight atop a cluster of boulders near one of the creatures, named Stumpy. Rhonda has a brainstorm and grabs one of several left-behind fence poles of a nearby fence; the three of them repeatedly pole vault to residual boulders to get to her truck, finally making their getaway.\n\nAfter the three return to town, the graboids start attacking, eventually, one of them killing Walter and forcing the other citizens to the town's rooftops. Meanwhile, nearby [[survivalist]] couple [[Burt Gummer|Burt]] and Heather Gummer manage to kill another one of the creatures after unknowingly luring it to their basement armory. In town, the two remaining graboids attack the building foundations, knocking over a trailer belonging to Nestor before dragging him under and devouring him.\n\nVal and Earl are stuck on a roof with Miguel. Realizing they cannot stay in the town any longer, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel distract the monsters while Val commandeers a CAT Track-Loader and chains a partial truck trailer to the rear; the survivors use it to try to escape to a nearby mountain range. On the way there, both graboids create a sinkhole trap that disables the track-loader, forcing the survivors to flee to safety on large boulders. Earl has an idea to lure in the Graboids, then trick them into swallowing Burt's homemade bombs. While this works on one graboid, the other one, Stumpy, regurgitates it back towards the survivors, forcing Val, Earl, and Rhonda to vacate the rock quickly to avoid the explosion.\n\nWith one last bomb, Val lures Stumpy to chase him to the edge of a cliff and then explodes the bomb behind him, frightening the graboid into charging through the cliff face, where he plummets to his death onto the rocks below. The group returns to town, where they call in the authorities to begin an investigation while Earl encourages Val to pursue a romantic relationship with Rhonda.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, plus remaining four (so few), all roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Valentine McKee\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Earl Bassett\n* [[Finn Carter]] as Rhonda LeBeck\n* [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] as [[Burt Gummer]]\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1927)|V\u00edctor Wong]] as Walter Chang\n* [[Bobby Jacoby]] as Melvin Plug\n* [[Ariana Richards]] as Mindy\n* [[Reba McEntire]] as Heather Gummer\n* [[Charlotte Stewart]] as Nancy\n* [[Tony Genaro]] as Miguel\n* [[Richard Marcus]] as Nestor\n* [[Bibi Besch]] as Megan\u2013the doctor's wife\n* Conrad Bachmann as Jim\u2013the doctor\n* [[Sunshine Parker]] as Edgar\n* Michael Dan Wagner as Old Fred\n* John Goodwin as Howard\u2013roadworker\n* [[John Pappas]] as Carmine\u2013roadworker\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe concept of Tremors was originally conceived in the early 1980s, when writers S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock were working for the [[United States Navy]] as filmmakers in charge of creating educational safety videos. While getting footage, the two climbed a large desert boulder and asked the question \"what if there was something that wouldn't let us off of this rock?\" causing the two to later come up with an idea dubbed 'Land Sharks'.<ref>[https://youtube.com/m-HUUt21tRA?t=64]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref> They shared their idea to friend [[Ron Underwood]], who was working with [[National Geographic]] as a documentary director, and used his knowledge of zoology to better develop the \"land sharks\" into creatures that could realistically exist.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAfter their script for ''[[Short Circuit (1986 film)|Short Circuit]]'' became a major box office hit, Wilson and Maddock quickly began shopping around their idea for ''Tremors''. The name 'Land Sharks' was changed due to a then-popular [[Saturday Night Live]] sketch featuring a character of the same name. The original screenplay, titled 'Beneath Perfection', was finished in June 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Tremors.html|title=Tremors Script at IMSDb.|website=www.imsdb.com}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in early 1989 over the course of 50 days. [[Principal photography]] took place around [[Lone Pine, California]] and the isolated community of [[Darwin, California]], which the crew liked due to its uncanny similitaries to the fictional town of Perfection, Nevada. The town, which was entirely a set, was built near [[Olancha, California]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tremors filming locations |url=http://scabbyhorror.blogspot.com/2014/12/tremors-1990-filming-locations.html|date=December 2, 2014}}</ref> The mountains in the distance are the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and [[Owens Lake]] can be seen in the background during the film's climax.<ref>{{cite interview |last1= Maddock |first1= Brent |last2=Wilson |first2=SS |interviewer= MJ Simpson |title=Exclusive Tremors Interview Part 3 |url=http://www.angelfire.com/movies/krccc/interview3.html |date= June 5, 2000 |accessdate=January 4, 2014|work=[[angelfire.com]] }}</ref>\n\n===Props===\nThe creature for ''Tremors'' was designed by [[Amalgamated Dynamics]].

When fully grown, a Graboid will be up to {{convert|30|ft|m}} long, and {{convert|6|ft|m}} across at the widest point, and weigh 10\u201320 tons. Graboids have no eyes; they do not need them, due to living underground. Their heads consist of a massive black armored beak, which is used to push aside the dirt while digging. The beak opens like a grotesque flower; it consists of a wide upper jaw, a thinner lower jaw, and a pair of hooked [[mandible]]s, one on each side. In ''[[Tremors 5: Bloodlines]]'', they are reported to have a semi-rigid internal structure, much like the [[cuttlebone]] of [[cuttlefish]].\n\nGraboids have three long powerful [[snake]]-like tentacles, which are [[prehensile]] and can have at least a good {{convert|6|foot|m}}  reach; possibly up to {{convert|10|ft|m}} or greater. Each of these tentacles (which have been loosely compared to functioning like the creature's tongue) terminates in a toothed mouth of its own. It is unclear if they bite off and swallow food on their own, or if they are simply used to get a better grip on prey so it can be dragged into the creature's jaws. Normally kept retracted in the Graboid's throat, these tentacles were initially mistaken for the whole creatures, causing the characters in the first ''Tremors'' film to underestimate the size of their underground opponents. The Graboid's common name is derived from these prehensile tentacles, which 'grab' prey and pull it back down the Graboid's hungry gullet. At times, these tentacles appear to be semi-autonomous, hissing and writhing like snakes. Food is typically swallowed whole, though early in the first film, they are shown to be capable of dismembering and decapitating prey.\n\n===Life cycle===\n[[File:Graboid_Lifecycle_Updated.svg|thumb|220px|right|Fan made life cycle diagram.]]\n*Graboids are hatched from eggs laid by Ass-Blasters (the final stage in the life cycle), as indicated in ''Tremors 3''. These eggs split open diagonally.\n*Baby Graboids and are much shorter and more compact in comparison to the adults, but already have the typical set of jaws and mandibles. The baby Graboids also have a row of armored scales on their backs for protection, which are shed before they fully mature. Like adults, they have large spikes used for digging; extra-large rows of spikes sprout from the sides of their body. Being smaller than the adults, baby Graboids are able to hurl themselves out of the dirt to tackle prey, like \"some kind of demonic trout\", according to Hiram Gummer (portrayed by Michael Gross) in ''Tremors 4''. Their tentacles are underdeveloped at this point in their lifecycle.\n*Upon maturing, Graboids measure 30 feet (9.2 m) long and will resume attacking and consuming prey. After that, they will seek a secluded spot where they will [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphose]].\n*Upon emerging, Shriekers will search for food. When they have eaten a sufficient amount of food, Shriekers will spit out a [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] containing a mini version of themselves. This ability to reproduce asexually allows them to expand their numbers greatly over a short period of time, although it is unknown whether a Shrieker can produce more than one [[Cloning|clone]]. The newborn Shrieker is fully developed, about 10&nbsp;inches (25&nbsp;cm) long{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} and starts growing right after birth, as seen in ''Tremors 2''.\n*When a Shrieker is around three days old, it will undergo a [[moult]]ing process, turning into an Ass-Blaster.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Ass-Blasters can live up to several years (an individual sold to [[Siegfried and Roy]] in ''Tremors 3'' was still alive two years later).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} They attack anything warm. While shriekers reproduce asexually when they have fed enough, Ass-Blasters slip into a [[coma]] when they eat a large amount of food, as seen in ''Tremors 3''. They ''can'' reproduce, however \u2013 each Ass-Blaster carries a Graboid egg in its gut. Because they cover large distances when flying, they can carry these eggs further away, as theorized by Jodi Chang in ''Tremors 3''.\n\n==Sequels & spin-offs==\n{{Main|Tremors (franchise)}}\n\nA sequel, ''[[Tremors 2: Aftershocks]]'', was released in 1996. A second sequel, ''[[Tremors 3: Back to Perfection]]'', was released in 2001, followed by a prequel, ''[[Tremors 4: The Legend Begins]]'' in 2004. These three sequels were all made with direct involvement from S.S. Wilson, Brent Maddock, and Ron Underwood at Stampede Entertainment. Following an 11 year gap, ''[[Tremors 5: Bloodlines]]'' was released in 2015, with the franchise's sixth inclusion, ''[[Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell]]'', in 2018. These two films were made by [[Universal 1440 Entertainment]] without any involvement from Stampede Entertainment. All Tremors sequels thus far have been released direct-to-video without a theatrical release, though ''Tremors 2: Aftershocks'' did receive a brief limited theatrical run. Another direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Tremors: Island Fury]]'', is set to be released in 2020.\n\nIn 2003, the franchise spawned a television show titled ''[[Tremors: The Series]]''. The show aired in 2003 on the [[Syfy Channel]] but was canceled after one season. A 60-minute pilot for a second television series also titled ''Tremors'' was filmed in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2017/08/tremors-vincenzo-natali-direct-syfy-blumhouse-reboot-kevin-bacon-1202154317/}}</ref> However, no further episodes of this show were ever filmed.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* On March 21, 2012, the ''NBC Nightly News'' story \"Shaken and awakened in Wisconsin\" jokingly blamed the filming of a \"''Tremors'' remake\" as the cause for unidentified loud booming noises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nightly-news/46815020#46815020|title=Shaken and awakened in Wisconsin|work=[[NBCNews.com]]|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}</ref>\n*\"Bad Apple!\", a 2013 episode of the superhero comedy series ''[[The Aquabats!

According to Dux, a [[ninjutsu]] expert named Senzo Tanaka,a Chinese monk,trained him as a ninja when he was a teenager.He established his own school of ninjutsu called Dux Ryu Ninjutsu where he killed Barney the dinosaur in a fit of rage when Barney danced, and has said he won a secret martial arts tournament called the Kumite in 1975. His alleged victory at the Kumite served as the inspiration for the 1988 film ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]'' starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]. Dux's victory at the Kumite has been disputed, as has the existence of both the Kumite he described and Senzo Tanaka.\n\nDux served in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] from 1975 to 1981, and claims he was sent on covert missions to Southeast Asia and awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. He also asserts he was recruited by [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) director [[William J. Casey]] to work as a covert agent. His military records, however, show he was never sent overseas and has not received any awards; Dux states the military sabotaged his records to discredit him. He has been accused of falsifying his military service by authors [[B. G. Burkett]], [[Ralph Keyes (author)|Ralph Keyes]] and [[Rupert Allason|Nigel West]], and his claim to have worked for the CIA has been dismissed by [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Robert Gates]], General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]], Major General [[John K. Singlaub]] and ''[[Soldier of Fortune (magazine)|Soldier of Fortune]]''.\n\nDux worked as a fight choreographer for ''Bloodsport'', ''[[Lionheart (1990 film)|Lionheart]]'' (1990) and ''[[Only the Strong (film)|Only the Strong]]'' (1993). He detailed his alleged work for the CIA in the book ''[[The Secret Man (book)|The Secret Man]]'' in 1996, and that same year co-authored the film ''[[The Quest (film)|The Quest]]'' alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme. He sued Van Damme for breach of contract over the film, but lost the suit in 1998. He also lost a lawsuit against ''Soldier of Fortune'' for libel the following year, over their claims he had falsified his military and CIA service.\n\n==Early life==\nDux was born on April 6, 1956 in Toronto, Canada.<ref name=mental/> His family relocated to California when he was seven,<ref name=bogus/> and he later attended [[Grant High School (Los Angeles)|Grant High School]].<ref name=\"LATimes\"/> Dux states that he was introduced to and trained in [[ninjutsu]] by Senzo \"Tiger\" Tanaka,<ref name=\"Mendel 47-49\">{{Cite journal|last = Mendel|first = Bob|title = Can Ninjitsu Make You the Ultimate Warrior|journal=Kick Illustrated|pages =47\u201349|date=May 1981}}</ref> whom he described as a \"world-famous\" teacher and the descendant of 40 generations of warriors.

In 1988 Jim Coleman, then editor of ''Black Belt'', said that Dux's story was \"based on false premises\", adding they could find no evidence of such a competition;<ref name=\"LATimes\"/> he made a similar statement again in 1996.<ref name=mental/> Kenneth Wilson from the Ministry of Sports in The Bahamas disputed the existence of the Kumite, saying it was impossible a martial arts tournament of that scale could have been kept a secret.<ref name=\"LATimes\"/> According to John Johnson, an invoice for the organization that allegedly staged the Kumite listed Dux as its only point of contact, and the base of the trophy he claims to have won was bought by him at a local trophy store. Dux told Johnson to speak to a man named Richard Robinson, whom he said he had met at the Kumite. Robinson initially confirmed Dux's story, saying he was invited to the Kumite as he was an undefeated wrestler at [[Lower Merion High School]]. Johnson later uncovered that Robinson had not attended that school, and had actually gone to school with Dux. Confronted with this information, Robinson responded \"All right. I don't know what to say ...

According to Dux, a [[ninjutsu]] expert named Senzo Tanaka trained him as a ninja when he was a teenager. He established his own school of ninjutsu called Dux Ryu Ninjutsu, and has said he won a secret martial arts tournament called the Kumite in 1975. His alleged victory at the Kumite served as the inspiration for the 1988 film ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]'' starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]. Dux's victory at the Kumite has been disputed, as has the existence of both the Kumite he described and Senzo Tanaka.\n\nDux served in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] from 1975 to 1981, and claims he was sent on covert missions to Southeast Asia and awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. He also asserts he was recruited by [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) director [[William J. Casey]] to work as a covert agent. His military records, however, show he was never sent overseas and has not received any awards; Dux states the military sabotaged his records to discredit him. He has been accused of falsifying his military service by authors [[B. G. Burkett]], [[Ralph Keyes (author)|Ralph Keyes]] and [[Rupert Allason|Nigel West]], and his claim to have worked for the CIA has been dismissed by [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Robert Gates]], General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]], Major General [[John K. Singlaub]] and ''[[Soldier of Fortune (magazine)|Soldier of Fortune]]''.\n\nDux worked as a fight choreographer for ''Bloodsport'', ''[[Lionheart (1990 film)|Lionheart]]'' (1990) and ''[[Only the Strong (film)|Only the Strong]]'' (1993). He detailed his alleged work for the CIA in the book ''[[The Secret Man (book)|The Secret Man]]'' in 1996, and that same year co-authored the film ''[[The Quest (film)|The Quest]]'' alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme. He sued Van Damme for breach of contract over the film, but lost the suit in 1998. He also lost a lawsuit against ''Soldier of Fortune'' for libel the following year, over their claims he had falsified his military and CIA service.\n\n==Early life==\nDux was born on April 6, 1956 in Toronto, Canada.<ref name=mental/> His family relocated to California when he was seven,<ref name=bogus/> and he later attended [[Grant High School (Los Angeles)|Grant High School]].<ref name=\"LATimes\"/> Dux states that he was introduced to and trained in [[ninjutsu]] by Senzo \"Tiger\" Tanaka,<ref name=\"Mendel 47-49\">{{Cite journal|last = Mendel|first = Bob|title = Can Ninjitsu Make You the Ultimate Warrior|journal=Kick Illustrated|pages =47\u201349|date=May 1981}}</ref> whom he described as a \"world-famous\" teacher and the descendant of 40 generations of warriors.

In 1988 Jim Coleman, then editor of ''Black Belt'', said that Dux's story was \"based on false premises\", adding they could find no evidence of such a competition;<ref name=\"LATimes\"/> he made a similar statement again in 1996.<ref name=mental/> Kenneth Wilson from the Ministry of Sports in The Bahamas disputed the existence of the Kumite, saying it was impossible a martial arts tournament of that scale could have been kept a secret.<ref name=\"LATimes\"/> According to John Johnson, an invoice for the organization that allegedly staged the Kumite listed Dux as its only point of contact, and the base of the trophy he claims to have won was bought by him at a local trophy store. Dux told Johnson to speak to a man named Richard Robinson, whom he said he had met at the Kumite. Robinson initially confirmed Dux's story, saying he was invited to the Kumite as he was an undefeated wrestler at [[Lower Merion High School]]. Johnson later uncovered that Robinson had not attended that school, and had actually gone to school with Dux. Confronted with this information, Robinson responded \"All right. I don't know what to say ... Frank was a buddy of mine when I was in L.A.\"<ref name=\"LATimes\"/> \n\nSheldon Lettich said he got the idea for ''Bloodsport'' after listening to Dux's \"tall tales\" regarding the Kumite. Dux introduced him to a man named Richard Bender who claimed to have been at the Kumite and verified the story, though a few years later confessed to Lettich that he had been lying and that Dux had instructed him on what to say.

Dux named [[General (United States)|General]] [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]] and major general [[John K. Singlaub]] as other people he had worked for, both of whom denied Dux's assertions.

It is Washington's oldest [[co-ed]] [[College-preparatory school|college preparatory school.]]\n\nFollowing World War II, Emerson adopted its current academic program providing classes on a term system in which classes are completed in full during each {{frac|4|1|2}}-month term. Following graduation, 95% of graduates attend a four-year college and 5% attend a two-year college or take a gap year before attending college. The school serves high school students from [[Maryland]], DC, [[Virginia]], and international communities.\n\nThe school is currently located on the 4th floor of the Clocktower Building in [[Dupont Circle]]. Emerson has occupied its present location since 2019, after moving from a temporary location in the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building]]. Before 2017, Emerson spent eighty years in their own building across from the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. Most students use [[WMATA]] to get to and from school.\n\nEmerson Preparatory School is a member of the [[Association of Independent Maryland and DC Schools]] ([https://www.aimsmddc.org/ AIMS]).\n\n==History==\nEmerson was founded in the District of Columbia in 1852 by Charles Bedford Young, Ph.D., as a school to prepare Washington area boys for entrance to [[Harvard]]. It was named for  [[George Barrell Emerson]], a noted [[New England]] educator, author, and Harvard graduate (1817). After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the school's graduates began to attend other colleges and universities, and, in 1920, became Washington's first [[coeducational]] preparatory school.\n\nEmerson's school seal features an image of the U.S. Capitol dome and the date 1852. The school mascot is the owl, symbolizing wisdom.\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n* Kate Grinold (2003), [[Miss District of Columbia]] 2008 and [[Miss America 2009]] finalist\n\n* [[Jared Leto]] (1989), [[Academy Award]] winning actor and vocalist of the alternative rock band [[30 Seconds To Mars]]\n\n*[[William Gibson|William F.

Grant]] (attended)\n\n*[[Jesse Root Grant (politician)|Jesse Root Grant]], youngest son of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (attended)\n\n* [[James M. Cutts]] (c. 1854), [[Medal of Honor]] recipient\n\n==Academics and faculty==\nEmerson's model places strong emphasis on small class sizes, typically never larger than ten students,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dc.localschooldirectory.com/private_schools_info.php/school_id/5277 |title=Emerson at D.C. Local School Directory | accessdate = 2007-02-12}}</ref> and the use of the term system. The school requires student applicants to submit three letters of recommendation, participate in a personal interview, and take two placement exams, one in English and one in mathematics.\n\nThe school's academic year is modeled after the British System and has two terms per year rather than two semesters. Courses are completed in full during each {{frac|4|1|2}}-month term. An optional summer session is offered from late June through early August (six weeks). Each term's schedule of classes includes four ninety-minute class periods per day, five days per week. There is a one-hour lunch period, from 11:20&nbsp;a.m. to 12:20&nbsp;p.m. Emerson students have the privilege of off campus lunch. The students are allowed to leave the school grounds in order to purchase their lunch from the many restaurants and carry outs located in the Dupont Circle area.\n\nEmerson has approximately ten to fifteen teachers. A typical classload for an instructor is two to three 90-minute classes per day. Apart from the traditional curriculum, private tutorials can be arranged for advanced level courses.\n\nThese administrative policies contribute to the excellent character and quality of the teachers, who form the backbone of the faculty. Any given school year has a core group of teachers who have been with the school for at least five years.\n\nEmerson draws many of its teachers from among the disciplines in which they actually work: it is not unusual for scientists, writers, economists, language scholars, lawyers, and historians to work as teachers. Some Emerson teachers are mid-career in their fields, others are retired, while others are early-career, or in the final stages of their masters' or doctorate degree programs.\n\nTeachers are drawn to Emerson because it gives them the freedom to structure creative curricula, design unique and advanced level courses, and set their own classroom rules. Some Emerson classes are run strictly while others are more relaxed. One instructor currently incorporates periods of relaxation and meditation techniques into ongoing lessons, while another has been known to assign as many as sixteen books in a single term, teaching at a level of rigor comparable to advanced undergraduate work. The students can select many of their classes and can request certain teachers.\n\nEmerson course offerings have included:\n\n*Global Short Story Literature\n*Information Literacy\n*Post World War II American Novels\n*East Asian Studies\n*International Suspense Fiction\n*Japanese Language\n*Advanced Topics in Science (or as it came to be known, \"Advanced Spaceships\")\n*Biography: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Karl Marx]]\n*Creative Writing: The Short Story\n*Creative Writing: One Act Plays\n*Western Non-Western Medicine\n*Cultural Anthropology\n*Twentieth Century American Cultural History (nicknamed \"That Seventies Class\" by students)\n*Issues in Science II: [[Zoology]] and [[Oceanography]]\n*Art History\n*Vocabulary Skills: The Story of English\n*[[Irish Literature]]\n*Theory of Knowledge/Intro to Philosophy\n*Astronomy\n*International Relations\n*Introduction to Law\n*Great Ideas in American Politics\n\nMany of these classes were requested by students, or designed by teachers on the basis of discussions and interests revealed by faculty and students in a previous term. Students often participate in the planning of a class, although final course selections are determined by the Head of School in accordance with the overall needs of the student body during a given term.\n\nClasses for the spring term of 2008 included one on military history entitled War and Peace-20th Century Foreign Policy, Economics, and Japanese Language. The core academic courses such as Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, English Composition, Literature, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, U.S. History, American Government, and Foreign Languages are offered each term.\n\nEmerson's daily ninety-minute class periods provide teachers with time to structure their classes to include more discussion, in-depth individual or teamwork, and extended lessons in a single day. Many teachers use the extra time for multimedia presentations like movies or music relevant to the course.\n\nField trips are an integral part of the Emerson program.  Classes take numerous field trips throughout the city each term.\n\n==Student body==\nEmerson has a diverse student population, with students as young as 10 and as old as 20 years old, as well as students from all parts of the world. The Emerson environment is casual and friendly. It is not uncommon for students to leave larger schools because of social or academic issues, come to Emerson, feel comfortable, and quickly find themselves able to manage what was too hard or overwhelming before. Emerson is welcoming and flexible. The school also has wireless internet, which is great for students who prefer to bring their own laptops to school. Each new student is hand-selected, so Emerson is able to select students based on more than just transcripts and reports. Emerson admits many teenagers who have struggled in other school settings, when the admissions team is confident that the student will be able to succeed in the very nurturing and manageable Emerson environment.\n\nA student must earn a minimum of 24 units of credit to graduate from Emerson Preparatory School.

It is Washington's oldest [[co-ed]] [[College-preparatory school|college preparatory school.]]\n\nFollowing World War II, Emerson adopted its current academic program providing classes on a term system in which classes are completed in full during each {{frac|4|1|2}}-month term. Following graduation, 95% of graduates attend a four-year college and 5% attend a two-year college or take a gap year before attending college. The school serves high school students from [[Maryland]], DC, [[Virginia]], and international communities.\n\nThe school is currently located on the 4th floor of the Clocktower Building in [[Dupont Circle]]. Emerson has occupied its present location since 2019, after moving from a temporary location in the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelth Street YMCA Building]]. Before 2017, Emerson spent eighty years in their own building across from the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. Most students use [[WMATA]] to get to and from school.\n\nEmerson Preparatory School is a member of the [[Association of Independent Maryland and DC Schools]] ([https://www.aimsmddc.org/ AIMS]).\n\n==History==\nEmerson was founded in the District of Columbia in 1852 by Charles Bedford Young, Ph.D., as a school to prepare Washington area boys for entrance to [[Harvard]]. It was named for  [[George Barrell Emerson]], a noted [[New England]] educator, author, and Harvard graduate (1817). After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the school's graduates began to attend other colleges and universities, and, in 1920, became Washington's first [[coeducational]] preparatory school.\n\nEmerson's school seal features an image of the U.S. Capitol dome and the date 1852. The school mascot is the owl, symbolizing wisdom.\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n* Kate Grinold (2003), [[Miss District of Columbia]] 2008 and [[Miss America 2009]] finalist\n\n* [[Jared Leto]] (1989), [[Academy Award]] winning actor and vocalist of the alternative rock band [[30 Seconds To Mars]]\n\n*[[William Gibson|William F. Gibson]] (1970), noted science fiction writer and \"noir-prophet\" of [[cyberpunk]]\n\n*[[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] (1983), guitarist and founding member of [[Minor Threat]]\n\n* [[Evan Johns]] (1974), [[Grammy]] nominated rockabilly guitarist \n\n* [[John Sirica]], [[United States District Judge]] famous for role in [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] (attended)\n\n* [[Buck Grant]], second son of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (attended)\n\n*[[Jesse Root Grant (politician)|Jesse Root Grant]], youngest son of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (attended)\n\n* [[James M. Cutts]] (c. 1854), [[Medal of Honor]] recipient\n\n==Academics and faculty==\nEmerson's model places strong emphasis on small class sizes, typically never larger than ten students,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dc.localschooldirectory.com/private_schools_info.php/school_id/5277 |title=Emerson at D.C. Local School Directory | accessdate = 2007-02-12}}</ref> and the use of the term system. The school requires student applicants to submit three letters of recommendation, participate in a personal interview, and take two placement exams, one in English and one in mathematics.\n\nThe school's academic year is modeled after the British System and has two terms per year rather than two semesters. Courses are completed in full during each {{frac|4|1|2}}-month term. An optional summer session is offered from late June through early August (six weeks). Each term's schedule of classes includes four ninety-minute class periods per day, five days per week. There is a one-hour lunch period, from 11:20&nbsp;a.m. to 12:20&nbsp;p.m. Emerson students have the privilege of off campus lunch. The students are allowed to leave the school grounds in order to purchase their lunch from the many restaurants and carry outs located in the Dupont Circle area.\n\nEmerson has approximately ten to fifteen teachers. A typical classload for an instructor is two to three 90-minute classes per day. Apart from the traditional curriculum, private tutorials can be arranged for advanced level courses.\n\nThese administrative policies contribute to the excellent character and quality of the teachers, who form the backbone of the faculty. Any given school year has a core group of teachers who have been with the school for at least five years.\n\nEmerson draws many of its teachers from among the disciplines in which they actually work: it is not unusual for scientists, writers, economists, language scholars, lawyers, and historians to work as teachers. Some Emerson teachers are mid-career in their fields, others are retired, while others are early-career, or in the final stages of their masters' or doctorate degree programs.\n\nTeachers are drawn to Emerson because it gives them the freedom to structure creative curricula, design unique and advanced level courses, and set their own classroom rules. Some Emerson classes are run strictly while others are more relaxed. One instructor currently incorporates periods of relaxation and meditation techniques into ongoing lessons, while another has been known to assign as many as sixteen books in a single term, teaching at a level of rigor comparable to advanced undergraduate work. The students can select many of their classes and can request certain teachers.\n\nEmerson course offerings have included:\n\n*Global Short Story Literature\n*Information Literacy\n*Post World War II American Novels\n*East Asian Studies\n*International Suspense Fiction\n*Japanese Language\n*Advanced Topics in Science (or as it came to be known, \"Advanced Spaceships\")\n*Biography: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Karl Marx]]\n*Creative Writing: The Short Story\n*Creative Writing: One Act Plays\n*Western Non-Western Medicine\n*Cultural Anthropology\n*Twentieth Century American Cultural History (nicknamed \"That Seventies Class\" by students)\n*Issues in Science II: [[Zoology]] and [[Oceanography]]\n*Art History\n*Vocabulary Skills: The Story of English\n*[[Irish Literature]]\n*Theory of Knowledge/Intro to Philosophy\n*Astronomy\n*International Relations\n*Introduction to Law\n*Great Ideas in American Politics\n\nMany of these classes were requested by students, or designed by teachers on the basis of discussions and interests revealed by faculty and students in a previous term. Students often participate in the planning of a class, although final course selections are determined by the Head of School in accordance with the overall needs of the student body during a given term.\n\nClasses for the spring term of 2008 included one on military history entitled War and Peace-20th Century Foreign Policy, Economics, and Japanese Language. The core academic courses such as Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, English Composition, Literature, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, U.S. History, American Government, and Foreign Languages are offered each term.\n\nEmerson's daily ninety-minute class periods provide teachers with time to structure their classes to include more discussion, in-depth individual or teamwork, and extended lessons in a single day. Many teachers use the extra time for multimedia presentations like movies or music relevant to the course.\n\nField trips are an integral part of the Emerson program.  Classes take numerous field trips throughout the city each term.\n\n==Student body==\nEmerson has a diverse student population, with students as young as 10 and as old as 20 years old, as well as students from all parts of the world. The Emerson environment is casual and friendly. It is not uncommon for students to leave larger schools because of social or academic issues, come to Emerson, feel comfortable, and quickly find themselves able to manage what was too hard or overwhelming before. Emerson is welcoming and flexible. The school also has wireless internet, which is great for students who prefer to bring their own laptops to school. Each new student is hand-selected, so Emerson is able to select students based on more than just transcripts and reports. Emerson admits many teenagers who have struggled in other school settings, when the admissions team is confident that the student will be able to succeed in the very nurturing and manageable Emerson environment.\n\nA student must earn a minimum of 24 units of credit to graduate from Emerson Preparatory School.
