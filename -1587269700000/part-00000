After corporate parent Fiat acquired a stake in [[Chrysler]] in 2009 the Lancia brand portfolio was revamped to include [[rebadging|rebadged]] Chrysler products, for sale in most European markets. (Lancia vehicles in the UK and Ireland were rebadged as Chryslers instead.) As sales continued to drop the Lancia-badged Chryslers were no longer offered after 2015.

In 1937, Vincenzo died of a heart attack. His wife, Adele Miglietti Lancia, and his son, [[Gianni Lancia]], took over control of the company. They persuaded [[Vittorio Jano]] to join as an engineer. Jano had already made a name for himself by designing various [[Alfa Romeo]] models, including some of its most successful race cars ever such as the [[Alfa Romeo 6C|6C]], [[Alfa Romeo P2|P2]] and [[Alfa Romeo P3|P3]].\n\n[[File:LanciaBorgoSanPaolo009.jpg|thumb|The former Lancia Borgo San Paolo Plant in Turin, where Lancia automobiles were first produced]]\n\nLancia is renowned in the automotive world for introducing cars with numerous innovations.

Other innovations involved the use of [[independent suspension]] in production cars (in an era where [[live axle]]s were common practice for both the front and rear axles of a car), and rear transaxles, which were first fitted to the [[Lancia Aurelia|Aurelia]] and [[Lancia Flaminia|Flaminia]] range.

When he was sixteen he started a business with food in [[Italy]]. Later, for a few years, he made relationships with [[South America]] and he created a food industry in [[Argentina]]. His efforts and innovations made his company a great success. His company was one of the first food companies in the country and showed new methods in this sector. When he made a fortune, he returned to Italy. By his education, Giuseppe was a translator. In 1875, he married Marianna Orazzi. In 1876, their first son Giovanni was born. In 1879 their daughter Margherita was born. She died in 1894. In 1881 their third child '''Vincenzo Lancia''' was born. Their second daughter, Anna Maria (later Anna-Maria-Giacobinni), was born in 1884. The Lancia family at that time was important for [[Turin]]. The members of the family liked to go on opera and theatre. In their free time. the Lancias  spend their time at a villa  near Turin.\n\n[[Vincenzo Lancia]] was born on 24 of August 1881 in [[Fobello]] near Turin. His father wanted Vincenzo to be a lawyer, but didn't have much interest in the humanities. He met the Battista brothers as well as Giovanni Ceirano and became interested in science and technology, especially automobiles. He saw his first cars in Turin and Milan. One of his friends Carlo Bishareti di Ruffia had a Benz and that was the first important automobile in his life. When [[FIAT]] was founded in 1899 Vincenzo was very active in the company and later became one of the most famous test drivers of Italian automobile brands. In 1922, Vincenzo married his secretary - Adele Miglietti. Vincenzo and Adele had three children Gianni, Eleonora and Maria. He died on February 15, 1937.\n\n[[Gianni Lancia]]  was born on 24 November 1924 in Turin. He finished his education with his sisters at the Technical University of Pisa. From the time he was a little boy Gianni loved sports, but his greatest passion was motor racing. This led him to become a driver for the Lancia team. Gianni became the boss of Lancia in 1950. He invested a lot of money in expensive prototypes and other unprofitable ventures that led him to sell a big part of the company to Carlo Pesenti in 1957. After that he started a business in the food industry. For a few years he lived in [[Brazil]]. He had two sons, Mariele and Vincenzo from his first marriage and had one son (Lorenzo Lancia) from his marriage to Jacqueline Sassard. He died on 30 June 2014.\n\n==Automotive==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; float:right;\"\n|+ Lancia production<br />1990\u20132019<ref name=\"oica.net\">{{cite web |url=http://oica.net/category/production-statistics/ |title=Lancia production between 1990\u20132009 |website=oica.net |accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=L'AUTO 2018 - Sintesi Statistica UNRAE |url=http://www.unrae.it/files/AnnualReportUNRAE_2018_web_5d0b31f58532f.pdf |website=unrae.it |publisher=unrae.it |accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"| Cars\n|-\n|'''1990'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|300,087\n|-\n|'''1991'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|265,172\n|-\n|'''1992'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|223,127\n|-\n|'''1993'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|163,636\n|-\n|'''1994'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|163,535\n|-\n|'''1995'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|162,416\n|-\n|'''1996'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|159,251\n|-\n|'''1997'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|176,211\n|-\n|'''1998'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|175,215\n|-\n|'''1999'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|161,019\n|-\n|'''2000''' || style=\"text-align:center;\"|170,348\n|-\n|'''2001''' || style=\"text-align:center;\"|134,812\n|-\n|'''2002'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|110,529\n|-\n|'''2003'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|108,989\n|-\n|'''2004'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|118,201\n|-\n|'''2005'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|115,543\n|-\n|'''2006'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|122,956\n|-\n|'''2007'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|118,036\n|-\n|'''2008'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|113,307\n|-\n|'''2009'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|113,810\n|-\n|'''2010'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|97,757\n|-\n|'''2011'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|100,007\n|-\n|'''2012'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|98,733\n|-\n|'''2013'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|71,223\n|-\n|'''2014'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69,835\n|-\n|'''2015'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|61,652\n|-\n|'''2016'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|67,059\n|-\n|'''2017'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|60,620\n|-\n|'''2018'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|48,555\n|-\n|'''2019'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|58,759 \n|}\n\n===Current car models===\n\n====Lancia Ypsilon====\n{{Main article|Lancia Ypsilon}}\n[[File:2013 Lancia Ypsilon 846 Elefantino.JPG|thumb|2013 [[Lancia Ypsilon]]|alt=]]\nThe Ypsilon is a premium 5-door [[supermini car]] produced since 2011.

With Ascari's death and Lancia's financial problems the company withdrew from Grand Prix racing.<ref name=\"atlasf1.autosport.com\">{{cite web |url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/timeline/50s.html |title=Formula One timeline |website=atlasf1.autosport.com |accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref> Altogether Lancia took two victories and ten podiums in Formula One.<ref name=\"4mula1.ro\">{{cite web |url=http://www.4mula1.ro/history/team/Lancia |title=Lancia Formula 1 Team |website=4mula1.ro |accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nRemnants of the Lancia team were transferred to [[Scuderia Ferrari]],<ref name=\"ddavid.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ddavid.com/formula1/lancia.htm |title=Lancia D50 |website=ddavid.com |accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref> where [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] won the [[1956 Formula One season|1956 championship]] with a Lancia-Ferrari car.\n\n===Rallying===\n{{see also|Lancia in rallying}}\n[[File:Lancia Delta S4.jpg|thumb|A [[Lancia Delta S4]] [[Group B]] rally car]]\nLancia has been very successful in motorsport over the years, and mostly in the arena of [[rallying]]. Prior to the forming of the [[World Rally Championship]], Lancia took the final [[International Championship for Manufacturers]] title with the [[Lancia Fulvia|Fulvia]] in 1972. In the WRC, they remain the most statistically successful marque (despite having withdrawn at the end of the [[1993 World Rally Championship season|1993 season]]), winning [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|constructors' titles]] with the [[Lancia Stratos|Stratos]] ([[1974 World Rally Championship season|1974]], [[1975 World Rally Championship season|1975]] and [[1976 World Rally Championship season|1976]]), the [[Lancia 037|037]] ([[1983 World Rally Championship season|1983]]) and the [[Lancia Delta|Delta]] (six consecutive wins from [[1987 World Rally Championship season|1987]] to [[1992 World Rally Championship season|1992]]). The Delta is also the most successful individual model designation ever to compete in rallying. All this gave [[Lancia]] a total of 11 [[World Rally Championship|Championships]] over the years and 15 [[European Rally Championship|European Championship]] from 1969 to 1992.\n\n[[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Miki Biasion]] both won two [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|drivers' titles]] with the Delta. Among other drivers to take several World Rally Championship wins with Lancia were [[Markku Al\u00e9n]], [[Didier Auriol]], [[Sandro Munari]], [[Bernard Darniche]], [[Walter R\u00f6hrl]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Waldeg\u00e5rd]] and [[Henri Toivonen]]. The history of the brand in rallying is also tainted with tragedy, with deaths of Italian driver [[Attilio Bettega]] at the 1985 [[Tour de Corse]] in a [[Lancia 037]] and then Finnish championship favourite Toivonen in a [[Lancia Delta S4]] at the same rally exactly a year later. These deaths would eventually lead to the end of [[Group B]] rallying.\n\n===Sports car racing===\nIn 1951 [[Mille Miglia]], Lancia Aurelia B20 GT came second overall. The car was driven by Thornley Kelham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thornleykelham.com/1950-ferrari-195s/1951-mille-miglia-lancia-aurelia-b20gt-series-1/#ad-image-23|title=1951 ex-Mille Miglia, ex-Le Mans, Lancia Aurelia B20GT \u00bb Thornley Kelham|website=www.thornleykelham.com|accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, [[Umberto Maglioli]] won the [[Targa Florio]] at the wheel of the Lancia D20. The same year Lancia introduced the [[Lancia D24|D24]] sports racer, which was an evolution of D23 model, but rebodied as a spider by Pinin Farina. Its most significant victories were: the [[1953 Carrera Panamericana]], the [[1954 Mille Miglia]] and the 1954 [[Targa Florio]].\n\n[[File:Lancia Beta MonteCarlo 1980-05-24.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Lancia Beta Montecarlo]] [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] car]]\nDuring Lancia's dominance of rallying, the company also expanded into sports cars in the late 1970s until the mid-1980s. It first ran the [[Lancia Stratos HF|Stratos HF]] in [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]], and for a brief interlude with a rare [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] version. The car was replaced with the successful [[Lancia Montecarlo|Beta Montecarlo]] Turbo winning the FIA's [[1980 World Championship for Makes]] and [[1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes]] and the 1980 [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]].\n\n[[File:Lancia LC2 Front.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Lancia LC2]] [[Group C]] sports car]]\nIn 1982 the team moved up to [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]] with the [[Lancia LC1|LC1]] Spyder, followed by the [[Group C]] [[Lancia LC2|LC2]] coup\u00e9 which featured a [[Ferrari]] powerplant in 1983. The LC2 was a match for the standard-setting [[Porsche 956]] in terms of raw speed, securing 13 pole positions over its lifetime, however its results were hampered by poor reliability and [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and it only managed to win three [[European Endurance Championship|European]] and [[World Sportscar Championship|World Endurance Championship]] races. The team's inability to compete against the dominant [[Porsche 956]] and [[Porsche 962|962]] sports cars led it to drop out of sportscar racing at the end of 1986 in order to concentrate on rallying, although private teams continued to enter LC2s with declining results until the early 1990s.\n\n====Titles====\n*[[1979 World Sportscar Championship season|1979 World Championship for Makes]] (under 2-litre division)\n*[[1980 World Championship for Makes]] (overall)\n*[[1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes]] (overall)\n*1980 [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]]\n{{-}}\n\n==Commercial vehicles==\nLancia produced a wide range of vans, trucks, buses and military vehicles from the beginning, forming Lancia Veicoli Industriali in 1912. Lancia slowly withdrew from the commercial sectors during the late 1960s and production of commercial vehicles ended in the early 1970s, shortly after Fiat's takeover of the company, with some models transferred to [[Iveco]].\n[[File:Lancia Superjolly front.jpg|thumb|[[Lancia Superjolly]]|alt=]]\n===Light commercial vehicles===\n* 1958 [[Lancia Ardea]] Furgoncino (van), Cassone (pick-up) \n* 1950 [[Lancia Beta (van)|Lancia Beta]] \n* 1953 [[Lancia Appia]] Furgoncino (van), Camioncino (pick-up) \n* 1959 [[Lancia Jolly]]\n* 1963 [[Lancia Superjolly]]\n\n===Heavy commercial vehicles===\n[[File:Lancia Triota 1921.jpg|thumb|Lancia Triota 1921]]\n[[File:Lancia Esadelta C.jpg|thumb|Lancia Esadelta C]]\n[[File:Lancia Esagamma E front3.jpg|thumb|Lancia Esagamma E]]\n[[File:Athens-trolley-1981.jpg|thumb|Lancia trolleybus in Athens]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-105-13A, Ungarn, deutscher R\u00fcckzug.jpg|thumb|Lancia 3RO military truck]]\n\n* 1915 [[Lancia Jota]]\n* 1915 [[Lancia Jota#Djota|Lancia Djota]]\n* 1921 [[Lancia Jota#Triota|Lancia Triota]]\n* 1921 [[Lancia Jota#Tetrajota|Lancia Tetrajota]]\n* 1924 [[Lancia Jota#Pentajota|Lancia Pentajota]]\n* 1926 [[Lancia Jota#Esajota|Lancia Esajota]]\n* 1927 [[Lancia Eptajota]]\n* 1932 [[Lancia Ro]]\n* 1935 [[Lancia Ro-Ro]]\n* 1938 [[Lancia 3Ro]]\n* 1943 [[Lancia Esaro]]\n* 1941 [[Lancia E290]]  electric truck, 202 built (E290 & E291) (La Lancia 3rd Ed, p.431, Wim Oude Weerink)\n* 1947 Lancia 6Ro\n* 1947 [[Lancia Esatau]]\n* 1957 Lancia Esatau B\n* 1959 [[Lancia Esadelta]]\n* 1963 Lancia Esadelta B\n* 1967 Lancia Esadelta C\n* 1969 [[Lancia Esagamma]]\n\n===Buses===\n* 1919 [[Lancia Eptaiota]] \n* 1920 [[Lancia Trijota (bus)]]\n* 1922 Lancia Tetraiota\n* 1925 Lancia Pentaiota\n* 1927 [[Lancia Omicron]] \n* 1934 [[Lancia Ro (bus)]]\n* 1947 [[Lancia Esatau (bus)]]\n* 1949 [[Lancia Esatau (bus)]] V11\n* 1953 [[Lancia Esatau (bus)]] V81\n* 1957 [[Lancia Esatau (bus)]] 703\n* 1964 [[Lancia Esagamma (bus)]] 715/718\n\n====Trolleybuses====\n* 1951 Lancia Esatau Pistoiesi\n* 1956 Lancia Esatau Piaggio Ansaldo\n* 1961 [[Lancia Esatau V.11 (trolleybus)]]\n* 1966 [[Lancia 140|Lancia Diafa trolleybus]]\n* 1967 Lancia Bimax\n* 1968 Lancia Bimax F600\n* 1968 Lancia Pistoiesi\n* 1969 Lancia Menarini Monocar\n* 1969 Lancia Esatau P Casaro\n\n===Military vehicles===\n[[File:An Italian 90-53 gun on a truck mounting joining the rows of derelict Axis vehicles and equipment jettisoned by Rommel's army.jpg|thumb]]\n* 1912 [[Lancia 1Z]] (light truck)\n* 1912 [[Lancia 1ZM]] (armoured car)\n* 1938 [[Lancia 3Ro]] (truck)\n* 1942 Lancia Esaro (truck)\n* 1942 [[Lince (armored car)|Lancia Lince]] (armoured car)\n* 1948 Lancia Esatau 6RoM (truck)\n* 1951 Lancia CL51 (Z 20) (troop transporter)\n* 1954 Lancia TL51 (Z 30) (truck)\n* 1960 Lancia 506 (truck)\n* 1975 Lancia ACL 75 (6611 M) (truck)\n* 1990 Lancia ACL 90 (truck, later [[Iveco]]) (truck)\n\n=== Tractor ===\n* 1947 Lancia 3Ro (based on Fiat)\n\n===Other===\n\n* 2007 [[Lancia Bike]]\n* 2009 [[Lancia di Lancia]] speedboat\n\n==Engines==\n\n[[File:Lancia Flavia Flat four (Boxer) engine (26097832230).jpg|thumb|Lancia Flavia Flat four]]\n\n* [[Lancia Flat-4 engine]]\n* [[Lancia V4 engine]]\n* [[Lancia V6 engine]]\n* Lancia V8 engine\n* [[Lancia Tipo 4]]\n\nThe company has also made industrial engines.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Media and sponsorship==\n[[File:Lancia Stratos HF 01.jpg|thumb|alt=|Two [[Lancia Stratos]] side by side]]\nIn 2009, the British motoring television show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' suggested that Lancia had more 'great' models than any other car company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/brand-new-clip-topgear-loves-lancia-part-1 |title=Top Gear Loves Lancia part 1 |website=topgear.com |accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref> The presenters went on to test the [[Lancia Gamma|Gamma Coup\u00e9]], [[Lancia Fulvia|Fulvia Coup\u00e9]], [[Lancia Aprilia|Aprilia]], [[Lancia Montecarlo|Montecarlo]], [[Lancia Beta Coup\u00e9|Beta Coup\u00e9]], [[Lancia Beta#HPE|HPE]], [[Lancia Stratos HF|Stratos]], [[Lancia 037|037]], [[Lancia Delta#Integrale Evoluzione II|Delta Integrale Evo II]] and [[Lancia Thema 8.32|Thema 8.32]].

Conversely, Lancia built models began to be sold in right-hand drive markets under the Chrysler badge.\n\nIn 2015 Lancia's parent company Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. became [[FCA Italy S.p.A.]], reflecting the earlier incorporation of Fiat S.p.A. into [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].\n\n===Logo===\n{{Multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | header = \n | image1 = LogoLancia1907.jpg\n | alt1 = 1907 Lancia logo\n | caption1 = 1907 Lancia radiator script\n | image2 = Hood Ornament, Kemble Air Show 2009 (3643975857).jpg\n | alt2 = 1929 Lancia logo\n | caption2 = 1929\u20131957 Lancia logo\n | image3 = LogoLancia1974.jpg\n | alt3 = 1974 Lancia logo\n | caption3 = 1974\u20132000 Lancia logo\n}}\n\n;1907\nFrom 1907 to 1910 Lancia cars didn't bear a true badge, but rather a brass plaque identifying the manufacturer (Lancia & C.) and chassis code; although some models did have a brass Lancia script on the grille.<ref name=\"lanciapress logo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lanciapress.com/press/detail/9591 |title=Un nuovo marchio per le sfide del futuro |website=lanciapress.com |publisher=Lancia Automobiles S.p.A. |date=6 March 2007 |language=IT |accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n;1911\nThe original Lancia logo was designed by Count [[Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia]].\nIn 1910 Vincenzo Lancia asked Biscaretti di Ruffia to design a badge for the company; the Count submitted six [[watercolour]] proposal sketches. Vincenzo Lancia chose a round one, composed by a blue [[lance]] and flag bearing a Lancia script (\"Lancia\" means \"lance\" in Italian) in gold, over a four-spoke steering wheel, with a hand [[throttle]] detail on the right spoke.<ref name=\"lanciapress logo\" /> The first car to bear the Lancia logo was the [[Lancia Gamma|Gamma 20 HP]] in 1911.<ref name=\"lanciapress logo\" />\n\n;1929\nIn 1929 the logo acquired its final layout: the previous round badge was superimposed on a blue shield in the shape of a [[Reuleaux triangle]] (as found in one of Biscaretti di Ruffia's six original proposals).<ref name=\"lanciapress logo\" /> Though first applied on the 1929 [[Lancia Dikappa|Dikappa]], this badge was only used consistently starting with the 1936 [[Lancia Aprilia|Aprilia]].<ref name=\"lanciapress logo\" />\n\n;1957\nBeginning with the 1957 [[Lancia Flaminia|Flaminia]], Lancia cars switched from the traditional vertical split grille to an horizontal, full-width one. The logo was moved inside the grille opening, and changed to a more stylized chromed metal open-work design; shield and steering wheel became chrome frames, the only remaining enameled surface being the blue field of the flag. This new metal logo was used on most models with some exceptions, namely [[Zagato]]-bodied [[Lancia Fulvia]]s and [[Lancia Flavia|Flavias]], the [[Lancia 2000|Lancia 2000 Berlina]] (which reprised the traditional upright grille and the round enameled badge) and the [[Lancia Stratos|Stratos HF]] (whose ornaments lacked the triangular shield).\n\n;1974\nIn 1974 the badge was redesigned on [[Umberto Agnelli]]'s request;<ref name=\"lanciapress logo\" /> it went back to a modernised silver, white and blue version of the 1929 design. Flag and lance were unified in a single shape and dispensed with the earlier minute detailing, the Lancia letters became all of the same size, and the steering wheel became also outlined in blue and lost the hand throttle detail. This logo debuted on the 1979 [[Lancia Delta#First generation|Lancia Delta]],<ref name=\"lanciapress logo\" /> and made its way on the other models as they adopted the split grille introduced by the Delta. Though lightly revised in 2000 with the addition of a chrome shield surround, the 1974 logo was used through four decades, up to 2006.\n\n;2007\nThe current logo, designed by Robilant Associati, was presented at the 2007 [[Geneva Motor Show]]\u2014a couple of months after the creation of Lancia Automobiles.<ref name=\"lanciapress logo\" /> While the traditional chrome-framed blue shield has been retained and made three-dimensional, for the first time since 1911 lance and flag are absent; the steering wheel has been stylized into a chromed circle, from which two spikes converge towards the modern Lancia logotype in the centre.\n\n===Lancia family===\n\n[[File:VittorioJano-GianniLancia.jpg|thumb|Vittorio Jano and Gianni Lancia]]\n\n'''Cavalier Giuseppe Lancia''' (1860 ([[Cuneo]]) - 1919 ([[Bordighera]])) was an Italian businessman and father of [[Vincenzo Lancia]]. When he was sixteen he started a business with food in [[Italy]]. Later, for a few years, he made relationships with [[South America]] and he created a food industry in [[Argentina]]. His efforts and innovations made his company a great success. His company was one of the first food companies in the country and showed new methods in this sector. When he made a fortune, he returned to Italy. By his education, Giuseppe was a translator. In 1875, he married Marianna Orazzi. In 1876, their first son Giovanni was born. In 1879 their daughter Margherita was born. She died in 1894. In 1881 their third child '''Vincenzo Lancia''' was born. Their second daughter, Anna Maria (later Anna-Maria-Giacobinni), was born in 1884. The Lancia family at that time was important for [[Turin]]. The members of the family liked to go on opera and theatre. In their free time. the Lancias  spend their time at a villa  near Turin.\n\n[[Vincenzo Lancia]] was born on 24 of August 1881 in [[Fobello]] near Turin. His father wanted Vincenzo to be a lawyer, but didn't have much interest in the humanities. He met the Battista brothers as well as Giovanni Ceirano and became interested in science and technology, especially automobiles. He saw his first cars in Turin and Milan. One of his friends Carlo Bishareti di Ruffia had a Benz and that was the first important automobile in his life. When [[FIAT]] was founded in 1899 Vincenzo was very active in the company and later became one of the most famous test drivers of Italian automobile brands. In 1922, Vincenzo married his secretary - Adele Miglietti. Vincenzo and Adele had three children Gianni, Eleonora and Maria. He died on February 15, 1937.\n\n[[Gianni Lancia]]  was born on 24 November 1924 in Turin. He finished his education with his sisters at the Technical University of Pisa. From the time he was a little boy Gianni loved sports, but his greatest passion was motor racing. This led him to become a driver for the Lancia team. Gianni became the boss of Lancia in 1950. He invested a lot of money in expensive prototypes and other unprofitable ventures that led him to sell a big part of the company to Carlo Pesenti in 1957. After that he started a business in the food industry. For a few years he lived in [[Brazil]]. He had two sons, Mariele and Vincenzo from his first marriage and had one son (Lorenzo Lancia) from his marriage to Jacqueline Sassard. He died on 30 June 2014.\n\n==Automotive==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; float:right;\"\n|+ Lancia production<br />1990\u20132019<ref name=\"oica.net\">{{cite web |url=http://oica.net/category/production-statistics/ |title=Lancia production between 1990\u20132009 |website=oica.net |accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=L'AUTO 2018 - Sintesi Statistica UNRAE |url=http://www.unrae.it/files/AnnualReportUNRAE_2018_web_5d0b31f58532f.pdf |website=unrae.it |publisher=unrae.it |accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"| Cars\n|-\n|'''1990'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|300,087\n|-\n|'''1991'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|265,172\n|-\n|'''1992'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|223,127\n|-\n|'''1993'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|163,636\n|-\n|'''1994'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|163,535\n|-\n|'''1995'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|162,416\n|-\n|'''1996'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|159,251\n|-\n|'''1997'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|176,211\n|-\n|'''1998'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|175,215\n|-\n|'''1999'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|161,019\n|-\n|'''2000''' || style=\"text-align:center;\"|170,348\n|-\n|'''2001''' || style=\"text-align:center;\"|134,812\n|-\n|'''2002'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|110,529\n|-\n|'''2003'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|108,989\n|-\n|'''2004'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|118,201\n|-\n|'''2005'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|115,543\n|-\n|'''2006'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|122,956\n|-\n|'''2007'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|118,036\n|-\n|'''2008'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|113,307\n|-\n|'''2009'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|113,810\n|-\n|'''2010'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|97,757\n|-\n|'''2011'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|100,007\n|-\n|'''2012'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|98,733\n|-\n|'''2013'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|71,223\n|-\n|'''2014'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69,835\n|-\n|'''2015'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|61,652\n|-\n|'''2016'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|67,059\n|-\n|'''2017'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|60,620\n|-\n|'''2018'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|48,555\n|-\n|'''2019'''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|58,759 \n|}\n\n===Current car models===\n\n====Lancia Ypsilon====\n{{Main article|Lancia Ypsilon}}\n[[File:2013 Lancia Ypsilon 846 Elefantino.JPG|thumb|2013 [[Lancia Ypsilon]]|alt=]]\nThe Ypsilon is a premium 5-door [[supermini car]] produced since 2011.

The history of the brand in rallying is also tainted with tragedy, with deaths of Italian driver [[Attilio Bettega]] at the 1985 [[Tour de Corse]] in a [[Lancia 037]] and then Finnish championship favourite Toivonen in a [[Lancia Delta S4]] at the same rally exactly a year later. These deaths would eventually lead to the end of [[Group B]] rallying.\n\n===Sports car racing===\nIn 1951 [[Mille Miglia]], Lancia Aurelia B20 GT came second overall. The car was driven by Thornley Kelham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thornleykelham.com/1950-ferrari-195s/1951-mille-miglia-lancia-aurelia-b20gt-series-1/#ad-image-23|title=1951 ex-Mille Miglia, ex-Le Mans, Lancia Aurelia B20GT \u00bb Thornley Kelham|website=www.thornleykelham.com|accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, [[Umberto Maglioli]] won the [[Targa Florio]] at the wheel of the Lancia D20. The same year Lancia introduced the [[Lancia D24|D24]] sports racer, which was an evolution of D23 model, but rebodied as a spider by Pinin Farina. Its most significant victories were: the [[1953 Carrera Panamericana]], the [[1954 Mille Miglia]] and the 1954 [[Targa Florio]].\n\n[[File:Lancia Beta MonteCarlo 1980-05-24.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Lancia Beta Montecarlo]] [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] car]]\nDuring Lancia's dominance of rallying, the company also expanded into sports cars in the late 1970s until the mid-1980s. It first ran the [[Lancia Stratos HF|Stratos HF]] in [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]], and for a brief interlude with a rare [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] version. The car was replaced with the successful [[Lancia Montecarlo|Beta Montecarlo]] Turbo winning the FIA's [[1980 World Championship for Makes]] and [[1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes]] and the 1980 [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]].\n\n[[File:Lancia LC2 Front.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Lancia LC2]] [[Group C]] sports car]]\nIn 1982 the team moved up to [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]] with the [[Lancia LC1|LC1]] Spyder, followed by the [[Group C]] [[Lancia LC2|LC2]] coup\u00e9 which featured a [[Ferrari]] powerplant in 1983. The LC2 was a match for the standard-setting [[Porsche 956]] in terms of raw speed, securing 13 pole positions over its lifetime, however its results were hampered by poor reliability and [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and it only managed to win three [[European Endurance Championship|European]] and [[World Sportscar Championship|World Endurance Championship]] races. The team's inability to compete against the dominant [[Porsche 956]] and [[Porsche 962|962]] sports cars led it to drop out of sportscar racing at the end of 1986 in order to concentrate on rallying, although private teams continued to enter LC2s with declining results until the early 1990s.\n\n====Titles====\n*[[1979 World Sportscar Championship season|1979 World Championship for Makes]] (under 2-litre division)\n*[[1980 World Championship for Makes]] (overall)\n*[[1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes]] (overall)\n*1980 [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]]\n{{-}}\n\n==Commercial vehicles==\nLancia produced a wide range of vans, trucks, buses and military vehicles from the beginning, forming Lancia Veicoli Industriali in 1912. Lancia slowly withdrew from the commercial sectors during the late 1960s and production of commercial vehicles ended in the early 1970s, shortly after Fiat's takeover of the company, with some models transferred to [[Iveco]].\n[[File:Lancia Superjolly front.jpg|thumb|[[Lancia Superjolly]]|alt=]]\n===Light commercial vehicles===\n* 1958 [[Lancia Ardea]] Furgoncino (van), Cassone (pick-up) \n* 1950 [[Lancia Beta (van)|Lancia Beta]] \n* 1953 [[Lancia Appia]] Furgoncino (van), Camioncino (pick-up) \n* 1959 [[Lancia Jolly]]\n* 1963 [[Lancia Superjolly]]\n\n===Heavy commercial vehicles===\n[[File:Lancia Triota 1921.jpg|thumb|Lancia Triota 1921]]\n[[File:Lancia Esadelta C.jpg|thumb|Lancia Esadelta C]]\n[[File:Lancia Esagamma E front3.jpg|thumb|Lancia Esagamma E]]\n[[File:Athens-trolley-1981.jpg|thumb|Lancia trolleybus in Athens]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-105-13A, Ungarn, deutscher R\u00fcckzug.jpg|thumb|Lancia 3RO military truck]]\n\n* 1915 [[Lancia Jota]]\n* 1915 [[Lancia Jota#Djota|Lancia Djota]]\n* 1921 [[Lancia Jota#Triota|Lancia Triota]]\n* 1921 [[Lancia Jota#Tetrajota|Lancia Tetrajota]]\n* 1924 [[Lancia Jota#Pentajota|Lancia Pentajota]]\n* 1926 [[Lancia Jota#Esajota|Lancia Esajota]]\n* 1927 [[Lancia Eptajota]]\n* 1932 [[Lancia Ro]]\n* 1935 [[Lancia Ro-Ro]]\n* 1938 [[Lancia 3Ro]]\n* 1943 [[Lancia Esaro]]\n* 1941 [[Lancia E290]]  electric truck, 202 built (E290 & E291) (La Lancia 3rd Ed, p.431, Wim Oude Weerink)\n* 1947 Lancia 6Ro\n* 1947 [[Lancia Esatau]]\n* 1957 Lancia Esatau B\n* 1959 [[Lancia Esadelta]]\n* 1963 Lancia Esadelta B\n* 1967 Lancia Esadelta C\n* 1969 [[Lancia Esagamma]]\n\n===Buses===\n* 1919 [[Lancia Eptaiota]] \n* 1920 [[Lancia Trijota (bus)]]\n* 1922 Lancia Tetraiota\n* 1925 Lancia Pentaiota\n* 1927 [[Lancia Omicron]] \n* 1934 [[Lancia Ro (bus)]]\n* 1947 [[Lancia Esatau (bus)]]\n* 1949 [[Lancia Esatau (bus)]] V11\n* 1953 [[Lancia Esatau (bus)]] V81\n* 1957 [[Lancia Esatau (bus)]] 703\n* 1964 [[Lancia Esagamma (bus)]] 715/718\n\n====Trolleybuses====\n* 1951 Lancia Esatau Pistoiesi\n* 1956 Lancia Esatau Piaggio Ansaldo\n* 1961 [[Lancia Esatau V.11 (trolleybus)]]\n* 1966 [[Lancia 140|Lancia Diafa trolleybus]]\n* 1967 Lancia Bimax\n* 1968 Lancia Bimax F600\n* 1968 Lancia Pistoiesi\n* 1969 Lancia Menarini Monocar\n* 1969 Lancia Esatau P Casaro\n\n===Military vehicles===\n[[File:An Italian 90-53 gun on a truck mounting joining the rows of derelict Axis vehicles and equipment jettisoned by Rommel's army.jpg|thumb]]\n* 1912 [[Lancia 1Z]] (light truck)\n* 1912 [[Lancia 1ZM]] (armoured car)\n* 1938 [[Lancia 3Ro]] (truck)\n* 1942 Lancia Esaro (truck)\n* 1942 [[Lince (armored car)|Lancia Lince]] (armoured car)\n* 1948 Lancia Esatau 6RoM (truck)\n* 1951 Lancia CL51 (Z 20) (troop transporter)\n* 1954 Lancia TL51 (Z 30) (truck)\n* 1960 Lancia 506 (truck)\n* 1975 Lancia ACL 75 (6611 M) (truck)\n* 1990 Lancia ACL 90 (truck, later [[Iveco]]) (truck)\n\n=== Tractor ===\n* 1947 Lancia 3Ro (based on Fiat)\n\n===Other===\n\n* 2007 [[Lancia Bike]]\n* 2009 [[Lancia di Lancia]] speedboat\n\n==Engines==\n\n[[File:Lancia Flavia Flat four (Boxer) engine (26097832230).jpg|thumb|Lancia Flavia Flat four]]\n\n* [[Lancia Flat-4 engine]]\n* [[Lancia V4 engine]]\n* [[Lancia V6 engine]]\n* Lancia V8 engine\n* [[Lancia Tipo 4]]\n\nThe company has also made industrial engines.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Media and sponsorship==\n[[File:Lancia Stratos HF 01.jpg|thumb|alt=|Two [[Lancia Stratos]] side by side]]\nIn 2009, the British motoring television show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' suggested that Lancia had more 'great' models than any other car company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/brand-new-clip-topgear-loves-lancia-part-1 |title=Top Gear Loves Lancia part 1 |website=topgear.com |accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref> The presenters went on to test the [[Lancia Gamma|Gamma Coup\u00e9]], [[Lancia Fulvia|Fulvia Coup\u00e9]], [[Lancia Aprilia|Aprilia]], [[Lancia Montecarlo|Montecarlo]], [[Lancia Beta Coup\u00e9|Beta Coup\u00e9]], [[Lancia Beta#HPE|HPE]], [[Lancia Stratos HF|Stratos]], [[Lancia 037|037]], [[Lancia Delta#Integrale Evoluzione II|Delta Integrale Evo II]] and [[Lancia Thema 8.32|Thema 8.32]].

{"title_page": "Virtual community", "text_new": "{{otheruses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Essay-like|article|date=March 2011}}\nA '''virtual community''' is a [[social network]] of individuals who connect through specific [[social media]], potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are [[online community|online communities]] operating under [[social networking service]]s.\n\n[[Howard Rheingold]] discussed virtual communities in his book, ''[[The Virtual Community (book)|The Virtual Community]]'', published in 1993. The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on [[The WELL]], [[computer-mediated communication]] and social groups and information science. Technologies cited include [[Usenet]], [[MUD]]s (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives [[MUSH]]es and [[MOO]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[chat room]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s. Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community.\n\nVirtual communities all encourage interaction, sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate. Some virtual communities do both. Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means: message boards, chat rooms, social networking World Wide Web sites, or virtual worlds.<ref>Hof, R. D., Browder, S., Elstrom, P. (5 May 1997). Internet Communities. Business Week.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nThe traditional definition of a community is of geographically circumscribed entity (neighborhoods, villages, etc.).  Virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically, and therefore are not communities under the original definition. Some online communities are linked geographically, and are known as community websites. However, if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members, then a virtual community is certainly a community.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">Pears, Iain. 1998. An Instance of the Fingerpost. London: Jonathan Cape.\n</ref> Virtual communities resemble real life ''[[communities]]'' in the sense that they both provide support, information, friendship and acceptance between strangers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=B |year=1999 |title= Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&pg=PA331&dq=impacts+of+virtual+communities#v=snippet&q=belonging&f=false |isbn=9780813368214 }}</ref>\n\nEarly research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of [[virtual reality|reality]], whether communities actually could exist through the media, which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology. In the seventeenth century, scholars associated with the [[Royal Society]] of London formed a community through the exchange of letters.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\"/> \"Community without propinquity\", coined by urban planner [[Melvin Webber]] in 1963 and \"community liberated\", analyzed by [[Barry Wellman]] in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community.<ref>Webber, Melvin. 1963. \"Order in Diversity: Community without Propinquity.\" Pp. 23\u201354 in Cities and Space: The Future Use of Urban Land, edited by J.

User experience metrics are based on user retention, using a consistent set of measurements to collect data on user experience. \nThe widespread use of the Internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers. The vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience.  Some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning, productivity, user satisfaction, how much people remember using the software, and how many errors they make.<ref name=\"Preece\">{{cite journal |last1=Preece |first1=Jenny |title=Socialility and Usability in Online Communities: Determining and Measuring Success |journal=Behaviour & Information Technology |date=2001 |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=347\u2013356|doi=10.1080/01449290110084683 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/487c4156883c7042516a9bb1b9c1a27efa7302b6 }}</ref>\nThe human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community. The success of an online community interface depends on the integration of usability and social semiotics. Social codes are established and reinforced by the regular repetition of behavioral patterns.<ref name=\"Semiotics\">{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=Daniel |title=Semiotics: The Basics |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, Oxon |edition=3}}</ref> People communicate their social identities or [[culture code]] through the work they do, the way they talk, the clothes they wear, their eating habits, domestic environments and possessions, and use of leisure time. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user\u2019s habits when interacting with a program. The amount of information provided during the usability test can determine demographic factors such as age, sex, or social status and help define the semiotic social code. \nDialogue and social interactions, support information design, navigation support, and accessibility are key components for good software usability.<ref name=\"Preece\" /> Efficient communication requires a common set of signs in the minds of those seeking to communicate.<ref name=\"Semiotics\" /> As technologies evolve and mature, they tend to be used by an increasingly diverse set of users. This kind of increasing complexity and evolution of technology doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the technologies are becoming easier to use.<ref name=\"Morgan Kaufmann\" /> Usability testing in virtual communities can ensure users are communicating effectively through social and semiotic codes and maintenance of social realities and identities.<ref name=\"Semiotics\" />\n\n==Effects==\n\n===On health===\n\nConcerns with a virtual community's tendency to promote less socializing include: verbal aggression and inhibitions, promotion of suicide and issues with [[privacy]]. However, studies regarding the health effects of these communities did not show any negative effects. There was a high drop-out rate of participants in the study. The health-related effects are not clear because of the lack of thoroughness and the variation in studies done on the subject.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eysenbach |first=G |year=2004 |title= Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7449 |pages=1166 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/328/7449/1166.full|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166 |pmid=15142921 |pmc=411092 }}</ref>\n\nRather, recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues.

Online health-focused communities were shown to offer a unique form of emotional support that differed from event-based realities and informational support networks. Growing amounts of presented material show how online communities affect the health of their users.  Apparently the creation of health communities has a positive impact on those who are ill or in need of medical information.<ref>{{cite book |title=Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Communities and Technologies |pages=31\u201340 |publisher=ACM |location=New York |year=2009 |doi=10.1145/1556460.1556466 |isbn=9781605587134 |series=C&T '09 |citeseerx=10.1.1.589.9656 |chapter=Supportive communication, sense of virtual community and health outcomes in online infertility groups |last1=Welbourne |first1=Jennifer L. |last2=Blanchard |first2=Anita L. |last3=Boughton |first3=Marla D. }}</ref>\n\n===On civic participation===\nNew forms of civic engagement and citizenship have emerged from the rise of social networking sites. Networking sites act as a medium for expression and discourse about issues in specific user communities. Online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media, but also connect with large networked communities. Within these spaces, young people are pushing the boundaries of traditional forms of engagement such as voting and joining political organizations and creating their own ways to discuss, connect, and act in their communities.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carvin |first=A. |date= 1 December 2006 |title= Understanding the impact of online communities on civic engagement |url=https://www.pbs.org/teachers/learning.now/2006/12/understanding_the_impact_of_on.html }}</ref>\n\nCivic engagement through [[online volunteering]] has shown to have positive effects on personal satisfaction and development. Some 84 percent of online volunteers found that their online volunteering experience had contributed to their personal development and learning.<ref>[http://www.unv.org/annual-report-2014/index.html UNV Annual Report 2014, Innovation and Knowledge]</ref>\n\n===On communication===\nIn his book [[The Wealth of Networks]] from 2006, Yochai Benkler suggests that virtual communities would \"come to represent a new form of human communal existence, providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction.\"<ref name=\"Benkler\">{{cite book |last=Benkler|first=Yochai|year=2006|title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom|url=http://www.benkler.org/Benkler_Wealth_Of_Networks_Chapter_10.pdf}}</ref> Although Benkler's prediction has not become entirely true, clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community. The two main effects that can be seen according to Benkler are a \"thickening of preexisting relations with friends, family and neighbours\" and the beginnings of the \"emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships.\"<ref name=\"Benkler\" /> Despite being acknowledged as \"loose\" relationships, Benkler argues that they remain meaningful.\n\nPrevious concerns about the effects of Internet use on community and family fell into two categories: 1) sustained, intimate human relations \"are critical to well-functioning human beings as a matter of psychological need\" and 2) people with \"social capital\" are better off than those who lack it. It leads to better results in terms of political participation.<ref name=\"Benkler\" /> However, Benkler argues that unless Internet connections actually displace direct, unmediated, human contact, there is no basis to think that using the Internet will lead to a decline in those nourishing connections we need psychologically, or in the useful connections we make socially. Benkler continues to suggest that the nature of an individual changes over time, based on social practices and expectations. There is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded, unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships. Manuel Castells calls this the 'networked society'.<ref name=\"Benkler\" />\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Internet-based ===\nThe explosive diffusion<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Constance Elise|date=2004-11-01|title=A Typology of Virtual Communities: a Multi-Disciplinary Foundation for Future Research|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/1/JCMC1011/4614445|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=00|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00228.x}}</ref> of the Internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities. Virtual communities may synthesize [[Web 2.0]] technologies with the community, and therefore have been described as Community 2.0, although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] and later on [[Usenet]]. Online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online. This interaction emphasizes the [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] element of the unwritten [[social contract]] between community members.\n\n===Internet message boards===\n[[File:Phpbb 3.0 prosilver.png|thumb|right|300px|An Internet forum powered by [[phpBB]]]]\nAn online [[Internet forum|message board]] is a forum where people can discuss thoughts or ideas on various topics or simply express an idea. Users may choose which thread, or board of discussion, they would like to read or contribute to. A user will start a discussion by making a post.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marone|first=Vittorio|year=2015|title=\"Keep in mind that I will be improving\": The opening post as a request for absolution|url=http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/51/518.pdf|journal=Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies|volume=5|issue=1|pages=136\u2013158|via=|doi=10.29333/ojcmt/2499|access-date=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018152219/http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/51/518.pdf|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other users who choose to respond can follow the discussion by adding their own posts to that thread at any time. Unlike in spoken [[conversation]]s, message boards do not usually have instantaneous responses; users actively go to the website to check for responses.\n\nAnyone can register to participate in an online message board. People can choose to participate in the virtual community, even if or when they choose not to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Unlike chat rooms, at least in practice, message boards can accommodate an almost infinite number of users.\n\nInternet users' urges to talk to and reach out to strangers online is unlike those in real-life encounters where people are hesitant and often unwilling to step in to help strangers. Studies have shown that people are more likely to intervene when they are the only one in a situation. With Internet message boards, users at their computers are alone, which might contribute to their willingness to reach out. Another possible explanation is that people can withdraw from a situation much more easily online than off. They can simply click exit or log off, whereas they would have to find a physical exit and deal with the repercussions of trying to leave a situation in real life. The lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people, because, if one chooses to keep it private, there is no associated label of gender, age, ethnicity or lifestyle.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=B. |year=1999 |title= Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&pg=PA331&dq=impacts+of+virtual+communities#v=snippet&q=belonging&f=false |isbn=9780813368214 }}</ref>\n\n===Online chat rooms===\n[[File:Xaric screen shot.jpg|right|thumb|An example of an IRC chat session on Xaric, a text-based client. Shown are two IRC channels and a private conversation.]]\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2016}}Shortly after the rise of interest in message boards and forums, people started to want a way of communicating with their \"communities\" in real time. The downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting, which, with people all around the world in different time frames, could take a while. The development of online [[chat room]]s allowed people to talk to whoever was online at the same time they were. This way, messages were sent and online users could immediately respond.\n\nThe original development by [[CB Simulator|CompuServe CB]] hosted forty channels in which users could talk to one another in real time. The idea of forty different channels led to the idea of chat rooms that were specific to different topics. Users could choose to join an already existent chat room they found interesting, or start a new \"room\" if they found nothing to their liking. Real-time chatting was also brought into virtual games, where people could play against one another and also talk to one another through text. Now, chat rooms can be found on all sorts of topics, so that people can talk with others who share similar interests. Chat rooms are now provided by [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) and other individual websites such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL.\n\nChat room users communicate through text-based messaging. Most chat room providers are similar and include an input box, a message window, and a participant list. The input box is where users can type their text-based message to be sent to the providing server. The server will then transmit the message to the computers of anyone in the chat room so that it can be displayed in the message window. The message window allows the conversation to be tracked and usually places a time stamp once the message is posted. There is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room, so that people can see who is in their virtual community.\n\nUsers can communicate as if they are speaking to one another in real life. This \"simulated reality\" attribute makes it easy for users to form a virtual community, because chat rooms allow users to get to know one another as if they were meeting in real life. The individual \"room\" feature also makes it more likely that the people within a chat room share a similar interest; an interest that allows them to bond with one another and be willing to form a friendship.<ref>{{cite web |last=Phelps |first=Alan |title=How Chat Rooms Work |publisher=Smartcomputing.com |date=11 July 2010 |url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/articles/archive/R0502/18R02/18R02.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/information/chat-room.htm |title=HowStuffWorks: How Chat Rooms Work |author=Roos, Dave |date=11 July 2010 |website= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Virtual worlds===\n[[File:Party in Hyrule, Second Life, picture 2.png|thumb|A party scene from ''[[Second Life]]'' in Hyrule]]\n[[Virtual world]]s are the most interactive of all virtual community forms. In this type of virtual community, people are connected by living as an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] in a computer-based world. Users create their own avatar character (from choosing the avatar's outfits to designing the avatar's house) and control their character's life and interactions with other characters in the 3-D virtual world. It is similar to a computer game, however there is no objective for the players. A virtual world simply gives users the opportunity to build and operate a fantasy life in the virtual realm. Characters within the world can talk to one another and have almost the same interactions people would have in reality. For example, characters can socialize with one another and hold intimate relationships online.\n\nThis type of virtual community allows for people to not only hold conversations with others in real time, but also to engage and interact with others. The avatars that users create are like humans. Users can choose to make avatars like themselves, or take on an entirely different personality than them. When characters interact with other characters, they can get to know one another not only through text based talking, but also by virtual experience (such as having avatars go on a date in the virtual world). A chat room form of a virtual community may give real time conversations, but people can only talk to one another. In a virtual world, characters can do activities together, just like friends could do in reality. Communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real life communities because the characters are physically in the same place, even if the users who are operating the characters are not. It is close to reality, except that the characters are digital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm |title=Virtuality and Its Discontents. |author=Turkle, Sherry |date=11 July 2010 |work=The American Prospect |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726150252/http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm |archive-date=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Second Life]] is one of the most popular virtual worlds on the Internet. [[Whyville]] offers a good alternative for younger audiences where safety and privacy are a concern. In Whyville you use the simulation aspect of the virtual world to experiment and learn about various phenomenon.\n\nAnother use for virtual worlds has been in business communications. Benefits from virtual world technology such as photo realistic avatars and positional sound create an atmosphere for participants that provides a less fatiguing sense of presence. Enterprise controls that allow the meeting host to dictate the permissions of the attendees such as who can speak, or who can move about allow the host to control the meeting environment. Several companies are creating business based virtual worlds including [[Second Life]]. These business based worlds have stricter controls and allow functionality such as muting individual participants, desktop sharing, or access lists to provide a highly interactive and controlled virtual world to a specific business or group. Business based virtual worlds also may provide various enterprise features such as Single Sign on with third party providers, or Content Encryption.\n\n===Social network services===\n[[File:Ad-tech London 2010 (5).JPG|263x263px|thumb|Facebook on the Ad-tech 2010]]\n[[Social networking service]]s are the most prominent type of virtual community. They are either a website or software platform that focuses on creating and maintaining relationships. Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace are all virtual communities. With these sites, one often creates a profile or account, and adds friends or follow friends. This allows people to connect and look for support using the social networking service as a gathering place. These websites often allow for people to keep up to date with their friends and acquaintances' activities without making much of an effort.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Quan-Hasse |first1=A. |last2= Young |first2=A.

Conference Proceedings \u2013 National Communication Association/American Forensic Association (Alta Conference on Argumentation), 550\u2013557 }}</ref> All of these functions encourage people to form a community, large or small, on the Internet.\n\n===Specialized information communities===\nParticipatory culture plays a large role in online and virtual communities. In participatory culture, users feel that their contributions are important and that by contributing, they are forming meaningful connections with other users. The differences between being a producer of content on the website and being a consumer on the website become blurred and overlap. According to [[Henry Jenkins]], \"Members believe their contributions matter and feel some degree of social connection with one another \"(Jenkins, et al. 2005). The exchange and consumption of information requires a degree of \"digital literacy,\" such that users are able to \"archive, annotate, appropriate, transform and recirculate media content\" (Jenkins). Specialized information communities centralizes a specific group of users who are all interested in the same topic. For example, TasteofHome.com, the website of the magazine [[Taste of Home]], is a specialized information community that focuses on baking and cooking. The users contribute consumer information relating to their hobby and additionally participate in further specialized groups and forums. Specialized Information Communities are a place where people with similar interests can discuss and share their experiences and interests.\n\n==Howard Rheingold's study==\n[[Howard Rheingold]]'s ''Virtual Community'' could be compared with [[Mark Granovetter]]'s ground-breaking \"strength of weak ties\" article published twenty years earlier in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''. Rheingold translated, practiced and published Granovetter's conjectures about strong and weak ties in the online world. His comment on the first page even illustrates the social networks in the virtual society: \"My seven year old daughter knows that her father congregates with a family of invisible friends who seem to gather in his computer. Sometimes he talks to them, even if nobody else can see them. And she knows that these invisible friends sometimes show up in the flesh, materializing from the next block or the other side of the world.\" (page 1).  Indeed, in his revised version of ''Virtual Community'', Rheingold goes so far to say that had he read [[Barry Wellman]]'s work earlier, he would have called his book \"online [[social network]]s\".\n\nRheingold's definition contains the terms \"social aggregation and personal relationships\" (pp3). Lipnack & Stamps (1997)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Virtual teams : reaching across space, time, and organizations with technology|last=Jessica.|first=Lipnack|date=1997|publisher=Wiley|others=Stamps, Jeffrey.|isbn=978-0471165538|location=New York|oclc=36138326|url=https://archive.org/details/virtualteamsreac00lipn}}</ref> and Mowshowitz (1997) point out how virtual communities can work across space, time and organizational boundaries; Lipnack & Stamps (1997)<ref name=\":0\" /> mention a common purpose; and Lee, Eom, Jung and Kim (2004) introduce \"desocialization\" which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings, e.g. an increase in virtual socialization. Calhoun (1991) presents a [[dystopia]] argument, asserting the impersonality of virtual networks. He argues that IT has a negative influence on offline interaction between individuals because virtual life takes over our lives. He believes that it also creates different personalities in people which can cause frictions in offline and online communities and groups and in personal contacts. (Wellman & Haythornthwaite, 2002). Recently, Mitch Parsell (2008) has suggested that virtual communities, particularly those that leverage Web 2.0 resources, can be pernicious by leading to attitude polarization, increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulge in their diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pernicious virtual communities: Identity, polarisation and the Web 2.0 |author=Parsell, M. (2008) |journal=Ethics and Information Technology |volume=10 |page=Volume 10, Number 1: 41\u201356 |doi=10.1007/s10676-008-9153-y |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Advantages of Internet communities==\nInternet communities offer the advantage of instant information exchange that is not possible in a real-life community. This interaction allows people to engage in many activities from their home, such as: shopping, paying bills, and searching for specific information. Users of online communities also have access to thousands of specific discussion groups where they can form specialized relationships and access information in such categories as: politics, technical assistance, social activities, health (see above) and recreational pleasures. Virtual communities provide an ideal medium for these types of relationships because information can easily be posted and response times can be very fast. Another benefit is that these types of communities can give users a feeling of membership and belonging. Users can give and receive support, and it is simple and cheap to use.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blanchard |first1= A.L. |last2= Markus |first2=M.L. |year=2002 |title= Sense of virtual community\u2014maintaining the experience of belonging .

Consumers generally feel very comfortable making transactions online provided that the seller has a good reputation throughout the community. Virtual communities also provide the advantage of [[disintermediation]] in commercial transactions, which eliminates vendors and connects buyers directly to suppliers. Disintermediation eliminates pricey mark-ups and allows for a more direct line of contact between the consumer and the manufacturer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rothaermel |first1=F.T. |last2= Sugiyama |first2=S. |year=2001 |title= Virtual internet communities and commercial success: individual and community-level theory grounded in the atypical case of timezone.com |journal=Journal of Management |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=297\u2013312 |doi=10.1177/014920630102700305}}</ref>\n\n==Disadvantages of Internet communities==\nWhile instant communication means fast access, it also means that information is posted without being reviewed for correctness. It is difficult to choose reliable sources because there is no editor who reviews each post and makes sure it is up to a certain degree of quality.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=M.A. |last2= Kollock |first2=P. |year=1999 |title= Communities in cyberspace|location= New York, New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn theory, online identities can be kept anonymous which enables people to use the virtual community for fantasy role playing as in the case of [[Second Life]]'s use of avatars. Some professionals urge caution with users who use online communities because predators also frequent these communities looking for victims who are vulnerable to online [[identity theft]] or [[online predator]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Foster |first=D. |date=18 December 2000 |title=Community and identity in the electronic village |url=http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/ |access-date=15 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117045700/http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/ |archive-date=17 January 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- READ THIS FIRST:\nDo not add HTML links to this article to promote your site.

Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are [[online community|online communities]] operating under [[social networking service]]s.\n\n[[Howard Rheingold]] discussed virtual communities in his book, ''[[The Virtual Community (book)|The Virtual Community]]'', published in 1993. The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on [[The WELL]], [[computer-mediated communication]] and social groups and information science. Technologies cited include [[Usenet]], [[MUD]]s (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives [[MUSH]]es and [[MOO]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[chat room]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s. Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community.\n\nVirtual communities all encourage interaction, sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate. Some virtual communities do both. Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means: message boards, chat rooms, social networking World Wide Web sites, or virtual worlds.<ref>Hof, R. D., Browder, S., Elstrom, P. (5 May 1997). Internet Communities. Business Week.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nThe traditional definition of a community is of geographically circumscribed entity (neighborhoods, villages, etc.).  Virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically, and therefore are not communities under the original definition. Some online communities are linked geographically, and are known as community websites. However, if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members, then a virtual community is certainly a community.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">Pears, Iain. 1998. An Instance of the Fingerpost. London: Jonathan Cape.\n</ref> Virtual communities resemble real life ''[[communities]]'' in the sense that they both provide support, information, friendship and acceptance between strangers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=B |year=1999 |title= Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&pg=PA331&dq=impacts+of+virtual+communities#v=snippet&q=belonging&f=false |isbn=9780813368214 }}</ref>\n\nEarly research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of [[virtual reality|reality]], whether communities actually could exist through the media, which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology. In the seventeenth century, scholars associated with the [[Royal Society]] of London formed a community through the exchange of letters.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\"/> \"Community without propinquity\", coined by urban planner [[Melvin Webber]] in 1963 and \"community liberated\", analyzed by [[Barry Wellman]] in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community.<ref>Webber, Melvin. 1963. \"Order in Diversity: Community without Propinquity.\" Pp. 23\u201354 in Cities and Space: The Future Use of Urban Land, edited by J.

For example, an email distribution list could serve as a personal means of communicating with family and friends, and also formally to coordinate with coworkers.\n\n=== User Experience Testing to Determine Social Codes ===\n[[User Experience]] is the ultimate goal for the program or software used by an internet community, because user experience will determine the software\u2019s success.<ref name=\"framework\">{{cite journal |last1=Sieckenius de Souza |first1=Clarisse |last2=Preece |first2=Jenny |title=A framework for analyzing and understanding online communities |journal=\u00a0Interacting with Computers |date=June 2004 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=579\u2013610}}</ref> The software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users\u2019 experience and designed specifically for online use.\nUser experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system.<ref name=\"Morgan Kaufmann\">{{cite book |last1=Tullis |first1=Thomas |last2=Albert |first2=William |title=Measuring the User Experience: Collecting, Analyzing, and Presenting Usability Metrics |date=2016 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-12-415781-1}}</ref> When it comes to testing user experience in a software interface, three main characteristics are needed: a user who is engaged, a user who is interacting with a product or interface, and defining the users\u2019 experience in ways that are and observable or measurable.<ref name=\"Morgan Kaufmann\" />\nUser experience metrics are based on a reliability and repeatability, using a consistent set of measurements to result in comparable outcomes. User experience metrics measure effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of an interface through quantifiable data collected during the testing process. \nThe widespread use of the Internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers. The vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience.  Some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning, productivity, user satisfaction, how much people remember using the software, and how many errors they make.<ref name=\"Preece\">{{cite journal |last1=Preece |first1=Jenny |title=Socialility and Usability in Online Communities: Determining and Measuring Success |journal=Behaviour & Information Technology |date=2001 |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=347\u2013356|doi=10.1080/01449290110084683 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/487c4156883c7042516a9bb1b9c1a27efa7302b6 }}</ref>\nThe human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community. The success of an online community interface depends on the integration of usability and social semiotics. Social codes are established and reinforced by the regular repetition of behavioral patterns.<ref name=\"Semiotics\">{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=Daniel |title=Semiotics: The Basics |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, Oxon |edition=3}}</ref> People communicate their social identities or [[culture code]] through the work they do, the way they talk, the clothes they wear, their eating habits, domestic environments and possessions, and use of leisure time. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user\u2019s habits when interacting with a program. The amount of information provided during the usability test can determine demographic factors such as age, sex, or social status and help define the semiotic social code. \nDialogue and social interactions, support information design, navigation support, and accessibility are key components for good software usability.<ref name=\"Preece\" /> Efficient communication requires a common set of signs in the minds of those seeking to communicate.<ref name=\"Semiotics\" /> As technologies evolve and mature, they tend to be used by an increasingly diverse set of users. This kind of increasing complexity and evolution of technology doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the technologies are becoming easier to use.<ref name=\"Morgan Kaufmann\" /> Usability testing in virtual communities can ensure users are communicating effectively through social and semiotic codes and maintenance of social realities and identities.<ref name=\"Semiotics\" />\n\n==Effects==\n\n===On health===\n\nConcerns with a virtual community's tendency to promote less socializing include: verbal aggression and inhibitions, promotion of suicide and issues with [[privacy]]. However, studies regarding the health effects of these communities did not show any negative effects. There was a high drop-out rate of participants in the study. The health-related effects are not clear because of the lack of thoroughness and the variation in studies done on the subject.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eysenbach |first=G |year=2004 |title= Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7449 |pages=1166 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/328/7449/1166.full|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166 |pmid=15142921 |pmc=411092 }}</ref>\n\nRather, recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues.  These forms of social networks allow for open conversation between individuals who are going through similar experiences, whether themselves or in their family.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eysenbach |first=G  |year=2008 |title= The Impact of the Internet on Cancer Outcomes.

These sites prove especially useful when related to rare medical conditions. People with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community, thus online communities act as primary means for such support. Online health communities can serve as supportive outlets as they facilitate connecting with others who truly understand the disease, as well as offer more practical support, such as receiving help in adjusting to life with the disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/04/135106113/patients-with-rare-diseases-connect-online |title=Web Communities Help Patients With Rare Diseases |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref> Involvement in social communities of similar health interests has created a means for patients to develop a better understanding and behavior towards treatment and health practices.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Neal |first1=L. |last2=Lindgagarrd |first2=G. |last3=Oakley |first3=K. |last4=Hansen |first4=D. |last5=Kogan |first5=S. |last6= Leimeister |first6=J.M. |last7= Selker |first7=T. |year=2006 |title=  Online Health Communities.

It is general knowledge that one participates in online communities to interact with society and develop relationships.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cocciolo |first1=A. |last2=Mineo |first2=C. |last3= Meier |first3=E. |title=Using Online Social Networks to Build Healthy Communities: A Design-based Research Investigation. 1\u201310. |url=http://www.thinkingprojects.org/bhc_paper.pdf }}</ref>  Individuals who suffer from rare or severe illnesses are unable to meet physically because of distance or because it could be a risk to their health to leave a secure environment. Thus, they have turned to the internet.  A study conducted by Haven B. Battles and Lori S.

Some studies have indicated that virtual communities can provide valuable benefits to their users. Online health-focused communities were shown to offer a unique form of emotional support that differed from event-based realities and informational support networks. Growing amounts of presented material show how online communities affect the health of their users.  Apparently the creation of health communities has a positive impact on those who are ill or in need of medical information.<ref>{{cite book |title=Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Communities and Technologies |pages=31\u201340 |publisher=ACM |location=New York |year=2009 |doi=10.1145/1556460.1556466 |isbn=9781605587134 |series=C&T '09 |citeseerx=10.1.1.589.9656 |chapter=Supportive communication, sense of virtual community and health outcomes in online infertility groups |last1=Welbourne |first1=Jennifer L. |last2=Blanchard |first2=Anita L. |last3=Boughton |first3=Marla D. }}</ref>\n\n===On civic participation===\nNew forms of civic engagement and citizenship have emerged from the rise of social networking sites. Networking sites act as a medium for expression and discourse about issues in specific user communities. Online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media, but also connect with large networked communities. Within these spaces, young people are pushing the boundaries of traditional forms of engagement such as voting and joining political organizations and creating their own ways to discuss, connect, and act in their communities.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carvin |first=A. |date= 1 December 2006 |title= Understanding the impact of online communities on civic engagement |url=https://www.pbs.org/teachers/learning.now/2006/12/understanding_the_impact_of_on.html }}</ref>\n\nCivic engagement through [[online volunteering]] has shown to have positive effects on personal satisfaction and development. Some 84 percent of online volunteers found that their online volunteering experience had contributed to their personal development and learning.<ref>[http://www.unv.org/annual-report-2014/index.html UNV Annual Report 2014, Innovation and Knowledge]</ref>\n\n===On communication===\nIn his book [[The Wealth of Networks]] from 2006, Yochai Benkler suggests that virtual communities would \"come to represent a new form of human communal existence, providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction.\"<ref name=\"Benkler\">{{cite book |last=Benkler|first=Yochai|year=2006|title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom|url=http://www.benkler.org/Benkler_Wealth_Of_Networks_Chapter_10.pdf}}</ref> Although Benkler's prediction has not become entirely true, clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community. The two main effects that can be seen according to Benkler are a \"thickening of preexisting relations with friends, family and neighbours\" and the beginnings of the \"emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships.\"<ref name=\"Benkler\" /> Despite being acknowledged as \"loose\" relationships, Benkler argues that they remain meaningful.\n\nPrevious concerns about the effects of Internet use on community and family fell into two categories: 1) sustained, intimate human relations \"are critical to well-functioning human beings as a matter of psychological need\" and 2) people with \"social capital\" are better off than those who lack it. It leads to better results in terms of political participation.<ref name=\"Benkler\" /> However, Benkler argues that unless Internet connections actually displace direct, unmediated, human contact, there is no basis to think that using the Internet will lead to a decline in those nourishing connections we need psychologically, or in the useful connections we make socially. Benkler continues to suggest that the nature of an individual changes over time, based on social practices and expectations. There is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded, unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships. Manuel Castells calls this the 'networked society'.<ref name=\"Benkler\" />\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Internet-based ===\nThe explosive diffusion<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Constance Elise|date=2004-11-01|title=A Typology of Virtual Communities: a Multi-Disciplinary Foundation for Future Research|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/1/JCMC1011/4614445|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=00|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00228.x}}</ref> of the Internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities. Virtual communities may synthesize [[Web 2.0]] technologies with the community, and therefore have been described as Community 2.0, although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] and later on [[Usenet]]. Online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online. This interaction emphasizes the [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] element of the unwritten [[social contract]] between community members.\n\n===Internet message boards===\n[[File:Phpbb 3.0 prosilver.png|thumb|right|300px|An Internet forum powered by [[phpBB]]]]\nAn online [[Internet forum|message board]] is a forum where people can discuss thoughts or ideas on various topics or simply express an idea. Users may choose which thread, or board of discussion, they would like to read or contribute to. A user will start a discussion by making a post.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marone|first=Vittorio|year=2015|title=\"Keep in mind that I will be improving\": The opening post as a request for absolution|url=http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/51/518.pdf|journal=Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies|volume=5|issue=1|pages=136\u2013158|via=|doi=10.29333/ojcmt/2499|access-date=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018152219/http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/51/518.pdf|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other users who choose to respond can follow the discussion by adding their own posts to that thread at any time. Unlike in spoken [[conversation]]s, message boards do not usually have instantaneous responses; users actively go to the website to check for responses.\n\nAnyone can register to participate in an online message board. People can choose to participate in the virtual community, even if or when they choose not to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Unlike chat rooms, at least in practice, message boards can accommodate an almost infinite number of users.\n\nInternet users' urges to talk to and reach out to strangers online is unlike those in real-life encounters where people are hesitant and often unwilling to step in to help strangers. Studies have shown that people are more likely to intervene when they are the only one in a situation. With Internet message boards, users at their computers are alone, which might contribute to their willingness to reach out. Another possible explanation is that people can withdraw from a situation much more easily online than off. They can simply click exit or log off, whereas they would have to find a physical exit and deal with the repercussions of trying to leave a situation in real life. The lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people, because, if one chooses to keep it private, there is no associated label of gender, age, ethnicity or lifestyle.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=B. |year=1999 |title= Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&pg=PA331&dq=impacts+of+virtual+communities#v=snippet&q=belonging&f=false |isbn=9780813368214 }}</ref>\n\n===Online chat rooms===\n[[File:Xaric screen shot.jpg|right|thumb|An example of an IRC chat session on Xaric, a text-based client. Shown are two IRC channels and a private conversation.]]\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2016}}Shortly after the rise of interest in message boards and forums, people started to want a way of communicating with their \"communities\" in real time. The downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting, which, with people all around the world in different time frames, could take a while. The development of online [[chat room]]s allowed people to talk to whoever was online at the same time they were. This way, messages were sent and online users could immediately respond.\n\nThe original development by [[CB Simulator|CompuServe CB]] hosted forty channels in which users could talk to one another in real time. The idea of forty different channels led to the idea of chat rooms that were specific to different topics. Users could choose to join an already existent chat room they found interesting, or start a new \"room\" if they found nothing to their liking. Real-time chatting was also brought into virtual games, where people could play against one another and also talk to one another through text. Now, chat rooms can be found on all sorts of topics, so that people can talk with others who share similar interests. Chat rooms are now provided by [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) and other individual websites such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL.\n\nChat room users communicate through text-based messaging. Most chat room providers are similar and include an input box, a message window, and a participant list. The input box is where users can type their text-based message to be sent to the providing server. The server will then transmit the message to the computers of anyone in the chat room so that it can be displayed in the message window. The message window allows the conversation to be tracked and usually places a time stamp once the message is posted. There is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room, so that people can see who is in their virtual community.\n\nUsers can communicate as if they are speaking to one another in real life. This \"simulated reality\" attribute makes it easy for users to form a virtual community, because chat rooms allow users to get to know one another as if they were meeting in real life. The individual \"room\" feature also makes it more likely that the people within a chat room share a similar interest; an interest that allows them to bond with one another and be willing to form a friendship.<ref>{{cite web |last=Phelps |first=Alan |title=How Chat Rooms Work |publisher=Smartcomputing.com |date=11 July 2010 |url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/articles/archive/R0502/18R02/18R02.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/information/chat-room.htm |title=HowStuffWorks: How Chat Rooms Work |author=Roos, Dave |date=11 July 2010 |website= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Virtual worlds===\n[[File:Party in Hyrule, Second Life, picture 2.png|thumb|A party scene from ''[[Second Life]]'' in Hyrule]]\n[[Virtual world]]s are the most interactive of all virtual community forms. In this type of virtual community, people are connected by living as an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] in a computer-based world. Users create their own avatar character (from choosing the avatar's outfits to designing the avatar's house) and control their character's life and interactions with other characters in the 3-D virtual world. It is similar to a computer game, however there is no objective for the players. A virtual world simply gives users the opportunity to build and operate a fantasy life in the virtual realm. Characters within the world can talk to one another and have almost the same interactions people would have in reality. For example, characters can socialize with one another and hold intimate relationships online.\n\nThis type of virtual community allows for people to not only hold conversations with others in real time, but also to engage and interact with others. The avatars that users create are like humans. Users can choose to make avatars like themselves, or take on an entirely different personality than them. When characters interact with other characters, they can get to know one another not only through text based talking, but also by virtual experience (such as having avatars go on a date in the virtual world). A chat room form of a virtual community may give real time conversations, but people can only talk to one another. In a virtual world, characters can do activities together, just like friends could do in reality. Communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real life communities because the characters are physically in the same place, even if the users who are operating the characters are not. It is close to reality, except that the characters are digital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm |title=Virtuality and Its Discontents. |author=Turkle, Sherry |date=11 July 2010 |work=The American Prospect |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726150252/http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm |archive-date=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Second Life]] is one of the most popular virtual worlds on the Internet. [[Whyville]] offers a good alternative for younger audiences where safety and privacy are a concern. In Whyville you use the simulation aspect of the virtual world to experiment and learn about various phenomenon.\n\nAnother use for virtual worlds has been in business communications. Benefits from virtual world technology such as photo realistic avatars and positional sound create an atmosphere for participants that provides a less fatiguing sense of presence. Enterprise controls that allow the meeting host to dictate the permissions of the attendees such as who can speak, or who can move about allow the host to control the meeting environment. Several companies are creating business based virtual worlds including [[Second Life]]. These business based worlds have stricter controls and allow functionality such as muting individual participants, desktop sharing, or access lists to provide a highly interactive and controlled virtual world to a specific business or group. Business based virtual worlds also may provide various enterprise features such as Single Sign on with third party providers, or Content Encryption.\n\n===Social network services===\n[[File:Ad-tech London 2010 (5).JPG|263x263px|thumb|Facebook on the Ad-tech 2010]]\n[[Social networking service]]s are the most prominent type of virtual community. They are either a website or software platform that focuses on creating and maintaining relationships. Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace are all virtual communities. With these sites, one often creates a profile or account, and adds friends or follow friends. This allows people to connect and look for support using the social networking service as a gathering place. These websites often allow for people to keep up to date with their friends and acquaintances' activities without making much of an effort.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Quan-Hasse |first1=A. |last2= Young |first2=A.

Conference Proceedings \u2013 National Communication Association/American Forensic Association (Alta Conference on Argumentation), 550\u2013557 }}</ref> All of these functions encourage people to form a community, large or small, on the Internet.\n\n===Specialized information communities===\nParticipatory culture plays a large role in online and virtual communities. In participatory culture, users feel that their contributions are important and that by contributing, they are forming meaningful connections with other users. The differences between being a producer of content on the website and being a consumer on the website become blurred and overlap. According to [[Henry Jenkins]], \"Members believe their contributions matter and feel some degree of social connection with one another \"(Jenkins, et al. 2005). The exchange and consumption of information requires a degree of \"digital literacy,\" such that users are able to \"archive, annotate, appropriate, transform and recirculate media content\" (Jenkins). Specialized information communities centralizes a specific group of users who are all interested in the same topic. For example, TasteofHome.com, the website of the magazine [[Taste of Home]], is a specialized information community that focuses on baking and cooking. The users contribute consumer information relating to their hobby and additionally participate in further specialized groups and forums. Specialized Information Communities are a place where people with similar interests can discuss and share their experiences and interests.\n\n==Howard Rheingold's study==\n[[Howard Rheingold]]'s ''Virtual Community'' could be compared with [[Mark Granovetter]]'s ground-breaking \"strength of weak ties\" article published twenty years earlier in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''. Rheingold translated, practiced and published Granovetter's conjectures about strong and weak ties in the online world. His comment on the first page even illustrates the social networks in the virtual society: \"My seven year old daughter knows that her father congregates with a family of invisible friends who seem to gather in his computer. Sometimes he talks to them, even if nobody else can see them. And she knows that these invisible friends sometimes show up in the flesh, materializing from the next block or the other side of the world.\" (page 1).  Indeed, in his revised version of ''Virtual Community'', Rheingold goes so far to say that had he read [[Barry Wellman]]'s work earlier, he would have called his book \"online [[social network]]s\".\n\nRheingold's definition contains the terms \"social aggregation and personal relationships\" (pp3). Lipnack & Stamps (1997)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Virtual teams : reaching across space, time, and organizations with technology|last=Jessica.|first=Lipnack|date=1997|publisher=Wiley|others=Stamps, Jeffrey.|isbn=978-0471165538|location=New York|oclc=36138326|url=https://archive.org/details/virtualteamsreac00lipn}}</ref> and Mowshowitz (1997) point out how virtual communities can work across space, time and organizational boundaries; Lipnack & Stamps (1997)<ref name=\":0\" /> mention a common purpose; and Lee, Eom, Jung and Kim (2004) introduce \"desocialization\" which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings, e.g. an increase in virtual socialization. Calhoun (1991) presents a [[dystopia]] argument, asserting the impersonality of virtual networks. He argues that IT has a negative influence on offline interaction between individuals because virtual life takes over our lives. He believes that it also creates different personalities in people which can cause frictions in offline and online communities and groups and in personal contacts. (Wellman & Haythornthwaite, 2002). Recently, Mitch Parsell (2008) has suggested that virtual communities, particularly those that leverage Web 2.0 resources, can be pernicious by leading to attitude polarization, increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulge in their diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pernicious virtual communities: Identity, polarisation and the Web 2.0 |author=Parsell, M. (2008) |journal=Ethics and Information Technology |volume=10 |page=Volume 10, Number 1: 41\u201356 |doi=10.1007/s10676-008-9153-y |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Advantages of Internet communities==\nInternet communities offer the advantage of instant information exchange that is not possible in a real-life community. This interaction allows people to engage in many activities from their home, such as: shopping, paying bills, and searching for specific information. Users of online communities also have access to thousands of specific discussion groups where they can form specialized relationships and access information in such categories as: politics, technical assistance, social activities, health (see above) and recreational pleasures. Virtual communities provide an ideal medium for these types of relationships because information can easily be posted and response times can be very fast. Another benefit is that these types of communities can give users a feeling of membership and belonging. Users can give and receive support, and it is simple and cheap to use.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blanchard |first1= A.L. |last2= Markus |first2=M.L. |year=2002 |title= Sense of virtual community\u2014maintaining the experience of belonging . Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences |citeseerx= 10.1.1.11.9800 }}</ref>\n\nEconomically, virtual communities can be commercially successful, making money through membership fees, subscriptions, usage fees, and advertising commission. Consumers generally feel very comfortable making transactions online provided that the seller has a good reputation throughout the community. Virtual communities also provide the advantage of [[disintermediation]] in commercial transactions, which eliminates vendors and connects buyers directly to suppliers. Disintermediation eliminates pricey mark-ups and allows for a more direct line of contact between the consumer and the manufacturer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rothaermel |first1=F.T. |last2= Sugiyama |first2=S. |year=2001 |title= Virtual internet communities and commercial success: individual and community-level theory grounded in the atypical case of timezone.com |journal=Journal of Management |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=297\u2013312 |doi=10.1177/014920630102700305}}</ref>\n\n==Disadvantages of Internet communities==\nWhile instant communication means fast access, it also means that information is posted without being reviewed for correctness. It is difficult to choose reliable sources because there is no editor who reviews each post and makes sure it is up to a certain degree of quality.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=M.A. |last2= Kollock |first2=P. |year=1999 |title= Communities in cyberspace|location= New York, New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn theory, online identities can be kept anonymous which enables people to use the virtual community for fantasy role playing as in the case of [[Second Life]]'s use of avatars. Some professionals urge caution with users who use online communities because predators also frequent these communities looking for victims who are vulnerable to online [[identity theft]] or [[online predator]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Foster |first=D. |date=18 December 2000 |title=Community and identity in the electronic village |url=http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/ |access-date=15 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117045700/http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/ |archive-date=17 January 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- READ THIS FIRST:\nDo not add HTML links to this article to promote your site.

Together these institutions have a combined enrollment of more than 70,000 students annually, creating both economic and social effects.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Leon County}}\nOriginally part of [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]] and later [[Gadsden County, Florida|Gadsden County]], Leon County was created in 1824.<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Florida Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQ-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA32|year=1908|publisher=Florida Historical Society.|page=32}}</ref> It was named after [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] who was the first [[Europe]]an to reach Florida.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA185|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=185}}</ref>\n\nThe United States finally acquired this territory in the nineteenth century. In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee, which only served the black community, became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County.

Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services, the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's, Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces.

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.
