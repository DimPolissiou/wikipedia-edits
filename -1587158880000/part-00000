It is set in [[Colonial Nigeria|British Nigeria]]. The lead Nigerian characters were played by African-Americans [[Paul Robeson]] and [[Nina Mae McKinney]]. The film proved a significant commercial and critical success, giving Korda the first of his four nominations for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival.\n\n==Plot==\nSanders ([[Leslie Banks]]) is a British colonial [[District Commissioner (British Colonial)|District Commissioner]] in [[Colonial Nigeria]]. He tries to rule his province fairly, including the various tribes comprising the Peoples of the River. He is regarded with respect by some and with fear by others, among whom he is referred to as \"Sandi\" and \"Lord Sandi\". He has an ally in Bosambo, a literate and educated chief (played by the American actor, [[Paul Robeson]]).\n\nWhen Sanders goes on leave, another chief, King Mofolaba, spreads the rumour that \"Sandi is dead.\" Inter-tribal war seems inevitable, and the situation is made worse by gun-runners and slavers.\n\nHis relief, Ferguson (known to the natives as Lord Ferguson), is unequal to the task; he is captured and killed by King Mofolaba. Sanders returns to restore peace. When Bosambo's wife Lilongo ([[Nina Mae McKinney]]) is kidnapped, the chief tracks down her kidnappers. Captured by them, he is saved by a relief force commanded by Sanders. Bosambo kills King Mofolaba and is subsequently named by Sanders as the King of the Peoples of the River.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Leslie Banks]] as Commissioner R.G.
