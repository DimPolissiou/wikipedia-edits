Bell attributed this change to the show's fall from number one in the [[Nielsen ratings]], since the lengthening of the show led to the departure of a number of cast members.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> \"The issue of performing in a one-hour show had not been part of their contracts,\" Bell said.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> This forced the show to recast multiple main characters and eventually phase out the original core families in favor of new ones.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/>  The show expanded to one hour on February 4, 1980.  It airs at 11:00am on most stations in the Central, Mountain and Pacific time zones, usually as a lead-in to the local noon news for most CBS stations in those regions (though some stations in the Central Time Zone opt to air it at 11:30am).

Bell changed that, first during his time as head writer of ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' and again on ''The Young and the Restless''.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 36.\"/> [[William Gray Espy]]'s Snapper Foster is considered the \"first to discover sex on a soap opera.\"<ref name=\"It's Time for My Story\"/> During the story, the character is engaged to Chris Brooks ([[Trish Stewart]]) and having a sexual relationship with Sally McGuire (Lee Crawford).<ref name=\"It's Time for My Story\"/> Other plots reflected sexual themes as well. For the first time in the genre, the dialogue and the story situations included explicit sexual themes such as premarital intercourse, impotence, incest, and rape.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> The first two rape storylines that would be told on the serial were controversial at the time as they reflected a more introspective and analytic storytelling style, the first time rape storylines would be addressed in this manner in the genre.<ref name=\"rapestoryline\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0B1y4YV5ji8C&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=y#v=onepage&q=y&r+chris+brooks+rape&f=false|title=Wallowing in Sex: The New Sexual Culture of 1970s American Television|first=Elana|last=Levine|date=January 9, 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0822339199}}</ref> The first, in 1973\u201374, revolved around the rape of Chris Brooks and the aftermath, in which she entertained (and, eventually, rejected) the idea that she was perhaps at fault for her attack. The second, in 1976, involved Chris's sister Peggy (Pamela Peters Solow) and was meant to serve as a cut-and-dried story in which no viewer could justify this attack, committed out of the blue by an authority figure.<ref name=\"rapestoryline\" />\n\nThe series also explored social issues. Jennifer Brooks underwent the first mastectomy on a soap opera.<ref name=\"The Soap Opera Book\"/> Other social issue storylines included bulimia, alcoholism, and cancer.<ref name=\"Williams, p. 98\">Williams, p. 98</ref> Lesbianism was also touched on with [[Katherine Chancellor]], who flirts with Jill while drunk in 1974 and has a brief relationship with Joann Curtis (Kay Heberle) in 1977.<ref name=\"Williams, p. 98\"/>\n\nWhen the series lengthened from a half-hour to an hour in 1980, multiple cast members who portrayed characters from the original core families departed because their contracts only bound them to performing in a half-hour show.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> A number of the characters were recast until one of the few remaining original actors, [[Jaime Lyn Bauer]], who portrayed [[Lorie Brooks]], decided to leave. When she announced her intention not to renew her contract, Bell decided to replace the original core families.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> \"As I studied the remaining cast, I realized I had two characters- [[Paul Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Paul Williams]], played by [[Doug Davidson]], and [[Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|Jack Abbott]], played by [[Terry Lester]]- both of whom had a relatively insignificant presence on the show,\" Bell said. \"They didn't have families. Hell, they didn't even have bedrooms. But these became the two characters I would build our two families around.\"<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/>\n\nThe characters from the Abbott and Williams families were integrated into the series while the Brooks and Foster families, with the exception of Jill, were phased out. The continuity of the feud between Jill and Katherine, which began in the early years of the show, smoothed the transition.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> The relationship between the two characters remained a central theme throughout the series and became the longest lasting rivalry in daytime history.<ref name=\"youngandtherestless.com\"/>\n\nAnother character introduced in the 1980s was [[Eric Braeden]]'s [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]].<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/><ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 33\"/> Originally, the character was \"a despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser\" who was intended to be killed off.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 33\"/> Braeden's tenure on the show was meant to last between eight and twelve weeks. \"When I saw Eric Braeden's first performance- the voice, the power, the inner strength- I knew immediately that I didn't want to lose this man,\" Bell said. \"He was exactly what the show needed. Not the hateful man we saw on-screen, but the man he could and would become.\"<ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 33\"/> Bell rewrote the story to save the character and put Braeden on contract. Victor's romance with Nikki Reed became a prominent plot in the series.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 33\"/>\n\nWith the success of another iconic character, [[Kimberlin Brown]]'s [[Sheila Carter]], Bell successfully crossed her over from ''The Young and the Restless'' to his second soap, ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', in 1992. The success of the crossover was due to the creativity of Bell, as the nefarious character of Sheila was presumed to have died in a fire on ''The Young and the Restless''.\n\nIn the 1990s, core black characters were introduced with the Barber and Winters families. [[Victoria Rowell]] ([[Drucilla Barber]]) and [[Tonya Lee Williams|Tonya Williams]] ([[Olivia Winters|Dr. Olivia Barber]]) were cast as the nieces of the Abbott's maid, [[Mamie Johnson (The Young and the Restless)|Mamie Johnson]], in 1990.<ref name=\"Williams, p. 103\">Williams, p. 103</ref> The brothers [[Neil Winters|Neil]] ([[Kristoff St. John]]) and [[Malcolm Winters]] ([[Shemar Moore]]) were introduced as love interests for Olivia and Drucilla.<ref name=\"Jet October 13, 1997\"/> ''The Young and the Restless'' became popular among black viewers, which Williams and St. John attributed to the writing for the black characters.<ref name=\"Jet October 13, 1997\"/><ref name=\"Jet April 7, 2008\">{{cite magazine | first=Clarence| last=Waldron | title ='Young and the Restless' Celebrates 35 Years of Drama, Success | magazine = [[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |pages= 56\u201359 |date=April 7, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 93\">Worlds Without End, p. 93</ref> \"I play a CEO at a major corporation, that's something we don't see that often,\" St. John said. \"And the show doesn't use the old African-American stereotypes that we have been seeing on TV, like the hustler, the pimp, the drug dealer.

Bell]] || style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"| 1973\u20132005 || Also the show's creator and longtime head writer (until 1998), he served as the main executive producer while working alongside of other executive producers. He wasn't credited as an executive producer until 1982 when his credit began appearing with [[H. Wesley Kenney]]. Served as solo EP from 1986 to 1987 after the departure of Kenney. He received the title of \"senior executive producer\" when [[Edward J. Scott|Edward Scott]] became EP and remained credited with the title until 2004 when he returned to the executive producer credit with [[John F. Smith]] as co-executive producer. William J. Bell died on April 29, 2005 and on the following Monday, his credit as EP was edited from the show; he was still living when those episodes were filmed.\n|-\n| [[John Conboy]] || 1973\u201382 || Served as the show's first executive producer while credited with the \"produced by\" credit as the title of executive producer was  credited hardly on any soaps (other than a small few), until the mid-1970s to 1980s. It was under his run when CBS wanted ''Y&R'' expanded from 30 minutes to an hour with the cancellation of ''[[Love of Life]]''. Also the show switched from the live-to-tape filming technique to pre-recording episodes, a practice that remains in effect to this date as with all soaps. John departed in 1982 to produce his newly created soap ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]'', which was later cancelled to make room for ''Y&R'''s sister show ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''.\n|-\n| [[H. Wesley Kenney]] || 1982\u201386 || Guided the show with more action-driven story direction inspired in large part by the more action oriented soap ''[[General Hospital]]'' which was a ratings smash at the time. The change to more action storylines are believed to be what helped the show win [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s in 1983, 1985 and 1986. Began crediting the show's cast in alphabetical order, a standard that remains to this date. Ceased the fade to next scene transition effect within the show's episodes. Had artist [[Sandy Dvore]], who designed the art drawing photos in the shows main title, to design the show's signature stylized brush stroke logo on ''Y&R'' merchandise in 1982, leading to the debut of the logo in the show's main title in January 1984.\n|-\n| [[Edward J. Scott]] || 1987\u20132001 || Debuted on the show in 1976 as an associate producer eventually becoming the \"produced by\" producer under John Conboy until 1987. Briefly filled in as EP for H. Wesley Kenney in 1986. Helped the show rise to co-#1 in 1987 with ''[[General Hospital]]'' in ratings before it solely dethroned ''GH'' as #1 in 1988 and has since remained there. Retired the longtime art drawings cast montage of the opening credits in 1988. Began the practice of crediting production principals on opening scenes of the show and adding the cast members' real-life names to the opening credits in 1999. Ceased the last commercial break between the last scene and end credits. Converted the show into [[High-definition television|HDTV]] in 2001, making it the first soap in history to do so. Returned from 2004 to 2007 as \"supervising producer\", a position he previously had briefly in 1987. Real-life husband of actress [[Melody Thomas Scott]] (Nikki Reed Newman).\n|-\n|style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"| [[David Shaughnessy]] || 2001\u201304 || Assumed executive producer position after serving as a producer and supervising producer since 1991. The Bell Dramatic Serial Co. production logo began appearing with end credits under his run. He managed to score brief returns by veteran actors such as [[Jaime Lyn Bauer]], [[William Gray Espy]], [[Meg Bennett]] and [[Jim Houghton|James Houghton]] (who wrote on the show between 1991 and 2006), all of whom who left the show back in the 1970s and 1980s, for brief storylines in 2002 and 2003. Debuted \"next episode\" preview scenes in 2003, a practice started with the ABC soaps in 1998.\n|-\n| [[John F. Smith]] || 2003\u201306 || Became co-executive producer with William J. Bell and David Shaughnessy while still serving as co-head writer with [[Kay Alden]] and [[Trent Jones]] (until 2004). Worked as a writer on the show since the early 1980s. Still maintained the co-EP title after William J. Bell's passing in 2005. Stepped down in 2006 as EP while remaining as co-head writer until November 2006.\n|-\n| [[Lynn Marie Latham]] || 2006\u201307 || Brought on as a \"creative consultant\" under John F. Smith in November 2005; Latham would later fire Smith as co-head writer in 2006. Promoted to head writer with [[Kay Alden]] and Smith in February 2006, then promoted to executive producer, becoming the show's first female EP in October 2006, after the show went that summer without an EP. Tenure as EP/HW was criticized by viewers and insiders for damaging the show's history with out-of-text writing, firing several longtime cast and crew members in favor of several unknowns, and doing too much favoritism. She was fired when she abandoned her post as EP to go on strike for the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike|2007\u201308 writer's strike]].\n|-\n| [[Josh Griffith]] || 2006\u201308 || Brought on by Lynn Marie Latham as her co-executive producer in 2006. Assumed full producer duties in December 2007, when Latham was fired. He also served as head writer with Maria Arena Bell during the 2007\u201308 writers strike. Remained as EP when Bell became sole head writer until he was fired when it was learned that he was tampering with Bell's stories; this was also known as former EP [[Edward J. Scott|Edward Scott]], who is friends with Griffith, was said to be doing the same thing on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', leading to his departure from that show.\n|-\n| [[Paul Rauch]] || 2008\u201311 || The veteran producer debuted as Maria Arena Bell's co-executive producer in October 2008. It was established that his role as co-executive producer would be to only foresee everything with the production of the show while Bell was solely responsible for the stories. This was the only time Paul ever been a co-EP and his first stop back to soap operas in six years since his 2002 departure from ''[[Guiding Light]]''. He opted not to renew his contract with ''Y&R'' after three years with the show and stepped down in May 2011.\n|-\n| [[Maria Arena Bell]] || 2008\u201312 || Bell is the wife of William Bell, Jr., the oldest son of William J. Bell and [[Lee Phillip Bell]]. Under her run, she brought the show's fictional Jabot Cosmetics to life by teaming up with a real cosmetics marketing company to help distribute the products. Named head writer in December 2007. Bell was named executive producer in October 2008, after Josh Griffith was ousted for tampering with her stories. Bell brought along veteran producer [[Paul Rauch]] to help her with the production of the show while she mostly focused on the stories. She was known for steering away from character-driven storylines in favor of plot-driven ones, which was criticized. From 2008 to 2010, she was credited as co-executive producer as well as Rauch, while her credit appeared first. Bell was let go in July 2012; an official reason was never given for her departure, however many sources speculate it was due to the controversial pairing of characters [[Sharon Newman|Sharon]] and [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]] ([[Sharon Case]] and [[Eric Braeden]]).<ref name=\"Y&R Shakeup\">{{cite book|chapter=Huge Shakeup at Y&R! |title=Soap Opera Digest |pages=4\u20135 |date=August 20, 2012|title-link=Soap Opera Digest }}</ref> One of the final milestones to happen under Bell's regime was the celebration of the 10,000th episode.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kondolojy|first1=Amanda|title=DAYTIME AND SOAP OPERA TV RATINGS CBS Celebrates ''The Young and the Restless'' Milestone 10,000th Episode on ''The Talk''|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/09/25/cbs-celebrates-the-young-and-the-restless-milestone-10000th-episode-on-the-talk/150185/|website=TVbytheNumbers|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|accessdate=July 10, 2015|location=United States|date=September 25, 2012}}</ref> The final episode under Bell's direction was broadcast on October 11, 2012; but she was credited until October 22.<ref name=\"Phelps Griffith Premiere Date\"/>\n|-\n| [[Jill Farren Phelps]] || 2012\u201316 || Named executive producer in July 2012 upon the dismissal of Maria Arena Bell.

Most Global stations use ''The Young and the Restless'' as a late-afternoon lead-in for their local newscasts,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} but times vary by market. It also airs on [[CJON-DT|NTV]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] which airs the program on a same-day-as-CBS basis.\n\nIn [[Jamaica]], the show airs on CVMTV.\n\nIn [[Trinidad]], the show airs weekdays on [[CBS]] and has been airing in Trinidad since the 1980s. In 1988, 70 percent of Trinidadians who had access to a television watched daily episodes of ''The Young and the Restless'', a series that emphasized family problems, sexual intrigue, and gossip.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/766507/The-Young-and-the-Restless</ref>\n\n=== Oceania ===\n{{Main|Screening of soap operas in Australia}}\nIn Australia, ''The Young and the Restless'' airs after ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' on [[Arena (TV network)|Arena]]. It previously aired on the [[Nine Network]] from April 1, 1974, to February 23, 2007, before joining the [[W Channel (Australia)|W]] line-up from April 2, 2007, to August 17, 2012. On July 20, 2012, it was announced that the show would move to Arena on August 20 that year after W rebranded as [[SoHo (Australian TV channel)|SoHo]]. Episodes are approximately one week behind those airing in the US at present.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn New Zealand, ''The Young and the Restless'' aired alongside ''Days  of Our Lives'' on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV ONE]] and ended on November 6, 2009.  The soap was approximately four seasons behind the CBS season due to being preempted by holiday and sporting programming.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], aired from 1987 to 1989 on [[ABS-CBN]].\n\n=== Europe ===\nIn the United Kingdom, ''The Young and The Restless'' has aired on many TV channels starting in 1990, when episodes from 1987 debuted on [[Galaxy (British television)|BSB Galaxy]] in a regular weekday timeslot, 14:00-15:00 (and repeated in the early hours of the following morning. When BSB merged with [[Sky]] in November 1990, the soap moved to Sky's flagship channel [[Sky 1|Sky One]] and aired at 11:00 weekdays until the end of 1992. When BSB's original three-year contract to air the soap expired, Sky chose not to renew it. In 1993, ''Y&R'' was picked up by [[UK Living]] (then known as simply Living, now [[Sky Living]]) in a primetime timeslot, picking up where Sky left off. This lasted until late 1995.  In 2007, Zone Romantica, now [[CBS Drama]] began broadcasting the show weekdays [four years behind US]. In 2009, when [[CBS]] went into partnership with and took over the Chellozone Channels the show was relegated to just one showing a day [in favor of repeating shows such as Dynasty and Dallas in the daytime]. It was attracting around 18\u201320,000 viewers at midnight in the last week of its broadcast in the UK in August 2010.\n\nIn Italy ''The Young and the Restless'' aired as ''Febbre d'amore'' from February 1983 to February 1984 on [[Italia 1]], from October 1984 to June 1995 on [[Rete 4]], in the summer of 1995 on [[Canale 5]] and from April 1998 to October 2009 again on Rete 4. They were US episodes shown from autumn 1979 to March 1986, from November 1989 to December 1993 and from November 1998 to January 2007.\n\nIn France, the show airs as ''Les Feux de l'Amour'' on free-to-air channel [[TF1]].\n\n==Theme music and other music==\n{{Main|Nadia's Theme}}\n\n\"[[Nadia's Theme]]\" has been the [[theme music]] of ''The Young and the Restless'' since the show's debut in 1973.<ref name=\"Total Television\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/> The melody, originally titled \"Cotton's Dream\", was composed by [[Barry De Vorzon]] and [[Perry Botkin, Jr.]]  for the 1971 theatrical film ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (film)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]''. The melody was later renamed \"Nadia's Theme\" after the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television network]]'s sports summary program ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' lent the music for a montage of Romanian gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]]'s routines during the [[1976 Summer Olympics]];<ref>[http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/heroes/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=44503 Nadia Com\u0103neci] at Olympic.org</ref> despite the title, Nadia never performed her floor exercises using this piece of music. Instead, she used a piano arrangement of a medley of the songs \"[[Yes Sir, That's My Baby (song)|Yes Sir, That's My Baby]]\" and \"[[Jump in the Line]].\"\n\nBotkin wrote a rearranged version of the piece specifically for ''The Young and the Restless''' debut.<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> The song remained unchanged, save for a slight remix in 1988 and a three-year stint in the early 2000s, when an alternate, more [[jazz]]y arrangement of that tune was used, using portions of the longer closing version of the original theme.<ref name=\"LA Times\"/>\n\nAn LP album was published in 1976 by [[A&M Records]]. The track list contains two titles of the French composer [[Michel Colombier]], ''Rainbow'' and ''Emmanuel'', a success track{{clarify|date=May 2013}} which he wrote in memory of the death of his son.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn late September and early October 2012, upon the show's 10,000th episode, the current form of opening credits were updated. In the years prior, fans criticized them for their lack of updates and cast additions (some contract players, such as [[Adrienne Frantz]], and Kimberlin Brown came and went without being added).\n\nIn mid-February 2017, the current form of opening credits were updated to honor the history on CBS Daytime and to carry them into the future as they approach the 44th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/yr-unveils-new-opening/|title=Y&R Unveils New Opening|date=February 13, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Ratings==\n{{see also|List of U.S. daytime soap opera ratings}}\nAs of 2010, ''The Young and the Restless'' has managed over 1,000 consecutive weeks in the #1 spot for daytime dramas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soaps.com/youngandrestless/news/1592/The_Young_and_the_Restless_To_Mark_1000_Weeks_on_T|title=The Young and the Restless To Mark 1000 Weeks on Top!|website=www.soaps.com|access-date=January 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203101017/http://www.soaps.com/youngandrestless/news/1592/The_Young_and_the_Restless_To_Mark_1000_Weeks_on_T|archive-date=February 3, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  On the week ending April 6, 2012, ''The Young and the Restless'' was watched by a new low of an average of 3,960,000 viewers for the week, beating its previous low of 4.209 million in October 2011, as well as being the only week to date below 4 million viewers.<ref name=RATING>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/news/ratings-new-lows-for-daysy-another-horrible-week-for-soaps|title=Ratings: New Lows For DAYS/Y&R; Another Horrible Week For Soaps \u2013 Soap Opera Network|date=April 13, 2012|publisher=}}</ref> Currently, the show is still the most-watched daytime drama; and for the season 2011\u201312, has a household rating of 3.5, and 1.5 for the Women 18\u201349 demographic.<ref name=da>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/news/ratings-new-low-for-days-in-women-18-49-viewers-2|title=Ratings: New Low For DAYS in Women 18\u201349 Viewers \u2013 Soap Opera Network|date=July 20, 2012|publisher=}}</ref> As of 2008, the Tuesday episodes of ''The Young and the Restless'' on average is the most-watched daytime drama showing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/ratings/daytimes-40-most-popular-shows|title=Daytime's 40 Most Popular Shows \u2013 Soap Opera Network|date=December 14, 2008|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWhen introduced during the 1972\u201373 season, the show was at the bottom of the ratings, but rose rapidly: ninth by 1974\u201375 and third by 1975\u201376.

Bell changed that, first during his time as head writer of ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' and again on ''The Young and the Restless''.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 36.\"/> [[William Gray Espy]]'s Snapper Foster is considered the \"first to discover sex on a soap opera.\"<ref name=\"It's Time for My Story\"/> During the story, the character is engaged to Chris Brooks ([[Trish Stewart]]) and having a sexual relationship with Sally McGuire (Lee Crawford).<ref name=\"It's Time for My Story\"/> Other plots reflected sexual themes as well. For the first time in the genre, the dialogue and the story situations included explicit sexual themes such as premarital intercourse, impotence, incest, and rape.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> The first two rape storylines that would be told on the serial were controversial at the time as they reflected a more introspective and analytic storytelling style, the first time rape storylines would be addressed in this manner in the genre.<ref name=\"rapestoryline\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0B1y4YV5ji8C&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=y#v=onepage&q=y&r+chris+brooks+rape&f=false|title=Wallowing in Sex: The New Sexual Culture of 1970s American Television|first=Elana|last=Levine|date=January 9, 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0822339199}}</ref> The first, in 1973\u201374, revolved around the rape of Chris Brooks and the aftermath, in which she entertained (and, eventually, rejected) the idea that she was perhaps at fault for her attack. The second, in 1976, involved Chris's sister Peggy (Pamela Peters Solow) and was meant to serve as a cut-and-dried story in which no viewer could justify this attack, committed out of the blue by an authority figure.<ref name=\"rapestoryline\" />\n\nThe series also explored social issues. Jennifer Brooks underwent the first mastectomy on a soap opera.<ref name=\"The Soap Opera Book\"/> Other social issue storylines included bulimia, alcoholism, and cancer.<ref name=\"Williams, p. 98\">Williams, p. 98</ref> Lesbianism was also touched on with [[Katherine Chancellor]], who flirts with Jill while drunk in 1974 and has a brief relationship with Joann Curtis (Kay Heberle) in 1977.<ref name=\"Williams, p. 98\"/>\n\nWhen the series lengthened from a half-hour to an hour in 1980, multiple cast members who portrayed characters from the original core families departed because their contracts only bound them to performing in a half-hour show.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> A number of the characters were recast until one of the few remaining original actors, [[Jaime Lyn Bauer]], who portrayed [[Lorie Brooks]], decided to leave. When she announced her intention not to renew her contract, Bell decided to replace the original core families.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> \"As I studied the remaining cast, I realized I had two characters- [[Paul Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Paul Williams]], played by [[Doug Davidson]], and [[Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|Jack Abbott]], played by [[Terry Lester]]- both of whom had a relatively insignificant presence on the show,\" Bell said. \"They didn't have families. Hell, they didn't even have bedrooms. But these became the two characters I would build our two families around.\"<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/>\n\nThe characters from the Abbott and Williams families were integrated into the series while the Brooks and Foster families, with the exception of Jill, were phased out. The continuity of the feud between Jill and Katherine, which began in the early years of the show, smoothed the transition.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/> The relationship between the two characters remained a central theme throughout the series and became the longest lasting rivalry in daytime history.<ref name=\"youngandtherestless.com\"/>\n\nAnother character introduced in the 1980s was [[Eric Braeden]]'s [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]].<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\"/><ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 33\"/> Originally, the character was \"a despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser\" who was intended to be killed off.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 33\"/> Braeden's tenure on the show was meant to last between eight and twelve weeks. \"When I saw Eric Braeden's first performance- the voice, the power, the inner strength- I knew immediately that I didn't want to lose this man,\" Bell said. \"He was exactly what the show needed. Not the hateful man we saw on-screen, but the man he could and would become.\"<ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 33\"/> Bell rewrote the story to save the character and put Braeden on contract. Victor's romance with Nikki Reed became a prominent plot in the series.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 33\"/>\n\nWith the success of another iconic character, [[Kimberlin Brown]]'s [[Sheila Carter]], Bell successfully crossed her over from ''The Young and the Restless'' to his second soap, ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', in 1992. The success of the crossover was due to the creativity of Bell, as the nefarious character of Sheila was presumed to have died in a fire on ''The Young and the Restless''.\n\nIn the 1990s, core black characters were introduced with the Barber and Winters families. [[Victoria Rowell]] ([[Drucilla Barber]]) and [[Tonya Lee Williams|Tonya Williams]] ([[Olivia Winters|Dr. Olivia Barber]]) were cast as the nieces of the Abbott's maid, [[Mamie Johnson (The Young and the Restless)|Mamie Johnson]], in 1990.<ref name=\"Williams, p. 103\">Williams, p. 103</ref> The brothers [[Neil Winters|Neil]] ([[Kristoff St. John]]) and [[Malcolm Winters]] ([[Shemar Moore]]) were introduced as love interests for Olivia and Drucilla.<ref name=\"Jet October 13, 1997\"/> ''The Young and the Restless'' became popular among black viewers, which Williams and St. John attributed to the writing for the black characters.<ref name=\"Jet October 13, 1997\"/><ref name=\"Jet April 7, 2008\">{{cite magazine | first=Clarence| last=Waldron | title ='Young and the Restless' Celebrates 35 Years of Drama, Success | magazine = [[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |pages= 56\u201359 |date=April 7, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Worlds Without End, p. 93\">Worlds Without End, p. 93</ref> \"I play a CEO at a major corporation, that's something we don't see that often,\" St. John said. \"And the show doesn't use the old African-American stereotypes that we have been seeing on TV, like the hustler, the pimp, the drug dealer.

He wasn't credited as an executive producer until 1982 when his credit began appearing with [[H. Wesley Kenney]]. Served as solo EP from 1986 to 1987 after the departure of Kenney. He received the title of \"senior executive producer\" when [[Edward J. Scott|Edward Scott]] became EP and remained credited with the title until 2004 when he returned to the executive producer credit with [[John F. Smith]] as co-executive producer. William J. Bell died on April 29, 2005 and on the following Monday, his credit as EP was edited from the show; he was still living when those episodes were filmed.\n|-\n| [[John Conboy]] || 1973\u201382 || Served as the show's first executive producer while credited with the \"produced by\" credit as the title of executive producer was  credited hardly on any soaps (other than a small few), until the mid-1970s to 1980s. It was under his run when CBS wanted ''Y&R'' expanded from 30 minutes to an hour with the cancellation of ''[[Love of Life]]''. Also the show switched from the live-to-tape filming technique to pre-recording episodes, a practice that remains in effect to this date as with all soaps. John departed in 1982 to produce his newly created soap ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]'', which was later cancelled to make room for ''Y&R'''s sister show ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''.\n|-\n| [[H. Wesley Kenney]] || 1982\u201386 || Guided the show with more action-driven story direction inspired in large part by the more action oriented soap ''[[General Hospital]]'' which was a ratings smash at the time. The change to more action storylines are believed to be what helped the show win [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s in 1983, 1985 and 1986. Began crediting the show's cast in alphabetical order, a standard that remains to this date. Ceased the fade to next scene transition effect within the show's episodes. Had artist [[Sandy Dvore]], who designed the art drawing photos in the shows main title, to design the show's signature stylized brush stroke logo on ''Y&R'' merchandise in 1982, leading to the debut of the logo in the show's main title in January 1984.\n|-\n| [[Edward J. Scott]] || 1987\u20132001 || Debuted on the show in 1976 as an associate producer eventually becoming the \"produced by\" producer under John Conboy until 1987. Briefly filled in as EP for H. Wesley Kenney in 1986. Helped the show rise to co-#1 in 1987 with ''[[General Hospital]]'' in ratings before it solely dethroned ''GH'' as #1 in 1988 and has since remained there. Retired the longtime art drawings cast montage of the opening credits in 1988. Began the practice of crediting production principals on opening scenes of the show and adding the cast members' real-life names to the opening credits in 1999. Ceased the last commercial break between the last scene and end credits. Converted the show into [[High-definition television|HDTV]] in 2001, making it the first soap in history to do so. Returned from 2004 to 2007 as \"supervising producer\", a position he previously had briefly in 1987. Real-life husband of actress [[Melody Thomas Scott]] (Nikki Reed Newman).\n|-\n|style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"| [[David Shaughnessy]] || 2001\u201304 || Assumed executive producer position after serving as a producer and supervising producer since 1991. The Bell Dramatic Serial Co. production logo began appearing with end credits under his run. He managed to score brief returns by veteran actors such as [[Jaime Lyn Bauer]], [[William Gray Espy]], [[Meg Bennett]] and [[Jim Houghton|James Houghton]] (who wrote on the show between 1991 and 2006), all of whom who left the show back in the 1970s and 1980s, for brief storylines in 2002 and 2003. Debuted \"next episode\" preview scenes in 2003, a practice started with the ABC soaps in 1998.\n|-\n| [[John F. Smith]] || 2003\u201306 || Became co-executive producer with William J. Bell and David Shaughnessy while still serving as co-head writer with [[Kay Alden]] and [[Trent Jones]] (until 2004). Worked as a writer on the show since the early 1980s. Still maintained the co-EP title after William J. Bell's passing in 2005. Stepped down in 2006 as EP while remaining as co-head writer until November 2006.\n|-\n| [[Lynn Marie Latham]] || 2006\u201307 || Brought on as a \"creative consultant\" under John F. Smith in November 2005; Latham would later fire Smith as co-head writer in 2006. Promoted to head writer with [[Kay Alden]] and Smith in February 2006, then promoted to executive producer, becoming the show's first female EP in October 2006, after the show went that summer without an EP. Tenure as EP/HW was criticized by viewers and insiders for damaging the show's history with out-of-text writing, firing several longtime cast and crew members in favor of several unknowns, and doing too much favoritism. She was fired when she abandoned her post as EP to go on strike for the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike|2007\u201308 writer's strike]].\n|-\n| [[Josh Griffith]] || 2006\u201308 || Brought on by Lynn Marie Latham as her co-executive producer in 2006. Assumed full producer duties in December 2007, when Latham was fired. He also served as head writer with Maria Arena Bell during the 2007\u201308 writers strike. Remained as EP when Bell became sole head writer until he was fired when it was learned that he was tampering with Bell's stories; this was also known as former EP [[Edward J. Scott|Edward Scott]], who is friends with Griffith, was said to be doing the same thing on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', leading to his departure from that show.\n|-\n| [[Paul Rauch]] || 2008\u201311 || The veteran producer debuted as Maria Arena Bell's co-executive producer in October 2008. It was established that his role as co-executive producer would be to only foresee everything with the production of the show while Bell was solely responsible for the stories. This was the only time Paul ever been a co-EP and his first stop back to soap operas in six years since his 2002 departure from ''[[Guiding Light]]''. He opted not to renew his contract with ''Y&R'' after three years with the show and stepped down in May 2011.\n|-\n| [[Maria Arena Bell]] || 2008\u201312 || Bell is the wife of William Bell, Jr., the oldest son of William J. Bell and [[Lee Phillip Bell]]. Under her run, she brought the show's fictional Jabot Cosmetics to life by teaming up with a real cosmetics marketing company to help distribute the products. Named head writer in December 2007. Bell was named executive producer in October 2008, after Josh Griffith was ousted for tampering with her stories. Bell brought along veteran producer [[Paul Rauch]] to help her with the production of the show while she mostly focused on the stories. She was known for steering away from character-driven storylines in favor of plot-driven ones, which was criticized. From 2008 to 2010, she was credited as co-executive producer as well as Rauch, while her credit appeared first. Bell was let go in July 2012; an official reason was never given for her departure, however many sources speculate it was due to the controversial pairing of characters [[Sharon Newman|Sharon]] and [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]] ([[Sharon Case]] and [[Eric Braeden]]).<ref name=\"Y&R Shakeup\">{{cite book|chapter=Huge Shakeup at Y&R! |title=Soap Opera Digest |pages=4\u20135 |date=August 20, 2012|title-link=Soap Opera Digest }}</ref> One of the final milestones to happen under Bell's regime was the celebration of the 10,000th episode.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kondolojy|first1=Amanda|title=DAYTIME AND SOAP OPERA TV RATINGS CBS Celebrates ''The Young and the Restless'' Milestone 10,000th Episode on ''The Talk''|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/09/25/cbs-celebrates-the-young-and-the-restless-milestone-10000th-episode-on-the-talk/150185/|website=TVbytheNumbers|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|accessdate=July 10, 2015|location=United States|date=September 25, 2012}}</ref> The final episode under Bell's direction was broadcast on October 11, 2012; but she was credited until October 22.<ref name=\"Phelps Griffith Premiere Date\"/>\n|-\n| [[Jill Farren Phelps]] || 2012\u201316 || Named executive producer in July 2012 upon the dismissal of Maria Arena Bell.

Most Global stations use ''The Young and the Restless'' as a late-afternoon lead-in for their local newscasts,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} but times vary by market. It also airs on [[CJON-DT|NTV]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] which airs the program on a same-day-as-CBS basis.\n\nIn [[Jamaica]], the show airs on CVMTV.\n\nIn [[Trinidad]], the show airs weekdays on [[CBS]] and has been airing in Trinidad since the 1980s. In 1988, 70 percent of Trinidadians who had access to a television watched daily episodes of ''The Young and the Restless'', a series that emphasized family problems, sexual intrigue, and gossip.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/766507/The-Young-and-the-Restless</ref>\n\n=== Oceania ===\n{{Main|Screening of soap operas in Australia}}\nIn Australia, ''The Young and the Restless'' airs after ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' on [[Arena (TV network)|Arena]]. It previously aired on the [[Nine Network]] from April 1, 1974, to February 23, 2007, before joining the [[W Channel (Australia)|W]] line-up on April 2, 2007, to August 17, 2012, On July 20, 2012, it was announced that the show would move to Arena on August 20, 2012, after W rebranded as [[SoHo (Australian TV channel)|SoHo]]. Episodes are approximately one week behind those airing in the US at present.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn New Zealand, ''The Young and the Restless'' aired alongside ''Days  of Our Lives'' on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV ONE]] and ended on November 6, 2009.  The soap was approximately four seasons behind the CBS season due to being preempted by holiday and sporting programming.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], aired from 1987 to 1989 on [[ABS-CBN]].\n\n=== Europe ===\nIn the United Kingdom, ''The Young and The Restless'' has aired on many TV channels starting in 1990, when episodes from 1987 debuted on [[Galaxy (British television)|BSB Galaxy]] in a regular weekday timeslot, 14:00-15:00 (and repeated in the early hours of the following morning. When BSB merged with [[Sky]] in November 1990, the soap moved to Sky's flagship channel [[Sky 1|Sky One]] and aired at 11:00 weekdays until the end of 1992. When BSB's original three-year contract to air the soap expired, Sky chose not to renew it. In 1993, ''Y&R'' was picked up by [[UK Living]] (then known as simply Living, now [[Sky Living]]) in a primetime timeslot, picking up where Sky left off. This lasted until late 1995.  In 2007, Zone Romantica, now [[CBS Drama]] began broadcasting the show weekdays [four years behind US]. In 2009, when [[CBS]] went into partnership with and took over the Chellozone Channels the show was relegated to just one showing a day [in favor of repeating shows such as Dynasty and Dallas in the daytime]. It was attracting around 18\u201320,000 viewers at midnight in the last week of its broadcast in the UK in August 2010.\n\nIn Italy ''The Young and the Restless'' aired as ''Febbre d'amore'' from February 1983 to February 1984 on [[Italia 1]], from October 1984 to June 1995 on [[Rete 4]], in the summer of 1995 on [[Canale 5]] and from April 1998 to October 2009 again on Rete 4. They were US episodes shown from autumn 1979 to March 1986, from November 1989 to December 1993 and from November 1998 to January 2007.\n\nIn France, the show airs as ''Les Feux de l'Amour'' on free-to-air channel [[TF1]].\n\n==Theme music and other music==\n{{Main|Nadia's Theme}}\n\n\"[[Nadia's Theme]]\" has been the [[theme music]] of ''The Young and the Restless'' since the show's debut in 1973.<ref name=\"Total Television\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/> The melody, originally titled \"Cotton's Dream\", was composed by [[Barry De Vorzon]] and [[Perry Botkin, Jr.]]  for the 1971 theatrical film ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (film)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]''. The melody was later renamed \"Nadia's Theme\" after the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television network]]'s sports summary program ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' lent the music for a montage of Romanian gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]]'s routines during the [[1976 Summer Olympics]];<ref>[http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/heroes/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=44503 Nadia Com\u0103neci] at Olympic.org</ref> despite the title, Nadia never performed her floor exercises using this piece of music. Instead, she used a piano arrangement of a medley of the songs \"[[Yes Sir, That's My Baby (song)|Yes Sir, That's My Baby]]\" and \"[[Jump in the Line]].\"\n\nBotkin wrote a rearranged version of the piece specifically for ''The Young and the Restless''' debut.<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> The song remained unchanged, save for a slight remix in 1988 and a three-year stint in the early 2000s, when an alternate, more [[jazz]]y arrangement of that tune was used, using portions of the longer closing version of the original theme.<ref name=\"LA Times\"/>\n\nAn LP album was published in 1976 by [[A&M Records]]. The track list contains two titles of the French composer [[Michel Colombier]], ''Rainbow'' and ''Emmanuel'', a success track{{clarify|date=May 2013}} which he wrote in memory of the death of his son.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn late September and early October 2012, upon the show's 10,000th episode, the current form of opening credits were updated.

According to the Greek historian [[Plutarch]], during the reign of [[Tiberius]] (A.D. 14\u201337), a sailor named Thamus heard a voice cry out to him from across the water, \"Thamus, are you there? When you reach [[Pelodes|Palodes]], take care to proclaim that the [[Pan (god)#\"The Great God Pan is dead\"|great god Pan is dead]].\"<ref>Plutarch, ''Moralia'' Book 5:17, ''De defectu oraculorum'' (\"The Obsolescence of Oracles\").</ref><ref name=\"laqueur\" /> The oracles of ancient Greece were known to experience auditory hallucinations while breathing in certain neurologically active vapors (such as the smoke from bay leaves), while the more pervasive delusions and symptomology were often viewed as possession by demonic forces as punishment for misdeeds.<ref name=\"laqueur\" />\n\n====Treatments====\n\nTreatment in the ancient world is ill documented, but there are some cases of therapeutics being used to attempt treatment, while the common treatment was sacrifice and prayer in an attempt to placate the gods. During the [[Middle Ages]], those with auditory hallucinations were sometimes subjected to [[trepanning]] or trial as a witch.<ref name=\"laqueur\" /> In other cases of extreme symptomatology, individuals were seen as being reduced to animals by a curse; these individuals were either left on the streets or imprisoned in [[insane asylums]]. It was the latter response that eventually led to modern [[psychiatric hospitals]].<ref name=\"boyer\"/>\n\n===Pre-modern===\n\n====Presentation====\n\nAuditory hallucinations were rethought during the enlightenment.  As a result, the predominant theory in the western world beginning in the late 18th century was that auditory hallucinations were the result of a disease in the brain (e.g. mania), and treated as such.<ref name=\"boyer\">{{cite book |chapter=Mental Health Institutions (Insane Asylums) |last1=Boyer |first1=Paul S. |title=The Oxford companion to United States history |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford Univ.

Conventional thought was that clean food, water, and air would allow the body to heal itself ([[sanatorium]]). Beginning in the 16th century [[Insane Asylum|insane asylum]]s were first introduced in order to remove \u201cthe mad dogs\u201d from the streets.<ref name=\"boyer\"/> These asylums acted as prisons until the late 18th century. This is when doctors began the attempt to treat patients. Often attending doctors would douse patients in cold water, starve them, or spin patients on a wheel. Soon, this gave way to brain specific treatments with the most famous examples including [[lobotomy]], [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock therapy]] and branding the skull with hot iron.<ref name=\"boyer\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n===Notable cases===\n[[Robert Schumann]], a famous music composer, spent the end of his life experiencing auditory hallucinations. Schumann's diaries state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the note [[Scientific pitch notation|A5]] sounding in his ears. The musical hallucinations became increasingly complex. One night he claimed to have been visited by the ghost of Schubert and wrote down the music that he was hearing. Thereafter, he began making claims that he could hear an angelic choir singing to him. As his condition worsened, the angelic voices developed into demonic ones.<ref name=\"laqueur\">{{cite news  | title=Spirited Away  | last = Laqueur | first = Thomas | name-list-format = vanc | date=2007-09-03  | pages=36\u201342 }}</ref>\n\n[[Brian Wilson]], songwriter and co-founder of [[the Beach Boys]], has [[schizoaffective disorder]] that presents itself in the form of disembodied voices.<ref name=\"BrianWilsonAbility\">{{cite web|title=Brian Wilson \u2013 A Powerful Interview|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/past/brianW/brianw.html|work=Ability Magazine|publisher=Ability Magazine}}</ref> They formed a major component of [[Bill Pohlad]]'s ''[[Love & Mercy (film)|Love & Mercy]]'' (2014), a [[biographical film]] which depicts Wilson's hallucinations as a source of musical inspiration,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tapley|first1=Kristopher | name-list-format = vanc |title=Bill Pohlad wants 'Love & Mercy' to take you inside the genius of Beach Boy Brian Wilson|url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/bill-pohlad-wants-love-mercy-to-take-you-inside-the-genius-of-beach-boy-brian-wilson|publisher=[[HitFix]]|date=May 21, 2015}}</ref> constructing songs that were partly designed to converse with them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Ann | name-list-format = vanc |title=Why Films About Musicians Leave So Much Music Off Screen|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/07/07/420818746/why-films-about-musicians-leave-so-much-music-off-screen|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Wilson has said of the voices: \"Mostly [they're] derogatory.

Such evidence comes mainly from research carried out on the neuroimaging of AVHs, on the so-called \u201cinner\u201d and \u201csubvocal\u201d speech, on \u201cvoices\u201d experienced by deaf patients, and on the phenomenology of AVHs <ref> Mitropoulos, George B.

Tome II (pp 610\u2013612). Paris: Presses\nUniversitaires de France.</ref> as well as of (Lacanian) psychoanalysis. According to the latter, the experience of the voice is linked more to speech as a chain of articulated signifying elements than to sensorium itself <ref> Lacan J (2006) \u00c9crits: The first complete edition in English.

This involves the capacity to carry out [[internal monologue]]s, as seen in reading to oneself, or going over a list silently.\n\n'''Level four (condensed inner speech)''' is the final level in the internalization process.

During the [[Middle Ages]], those with auditory hallucinations were sometimes subjected to [[trepanning]] or trial as a witch.<ref name=\"laqueur\" /> In other cases of extreme symptomatology, individuals were seen as being reduced to animals by a curse; these individuals were either left on the streets or imprisoned in [[insane asylums]]. It was the latter response that eventually led to modern [[psychiatric hospitals]].<ref name=\"boyer\"/>\n\n===Pre-modern===\n\n====Presentation====\n\nAuditory hallucinations were rethought during the enlightenment.  As a result, the predominant theory in the western world beginning in the late 18th century was that auditory hallucinations were the result of a disease in the brain (e.g. mania), and treated as such.<ref name=\"boyer\">{{cite book |chapter=Mental Health Institutions (Insane Asylums) |last1=Boyer |first1=Paul S. |title=The Oxford companion to United States history |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford Univ.

Conventional thought was that clean food, water, and air would allow the body to heal itself ([[sanatorium]]). Beginning in the 16th century [[Insane Asylum|insane asylum]]s were first introduced in order to remove \u201cthe mad dogs\u201d from the streets.<ref name=\"boyer\"/> These asylums acted as prisons until the late 18th century. This is when doctors began the attempt to treat patients. Often attending doctors would douse patients in cold water, starve them, or spin patients on a wheel. Soon, this gave way to brain specific treatments with the most famous examples including [[lobotomy]], [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock therapy]] and branding the skull with hot iron.<ref name=\"boyer\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n===Notable cases===\n[[Robert Schumann]], a famous music composer, spent the end of his life experiencing auditory hallucinations. Schumann's diaries state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the note [[Scientific pitch notation|A5]] sounding in his ears. The musical hallucinations became increasingly complex. One night he claimed to have been visited by the ghost of Schubert and wrote down the music that he was hearing. Thereafter, he began making claims that he could hear an angelic choir singing to him. As his condition worsened, the angelic voices developed into demonic ones.<ref name=\"laqueur\">{{cite news  | title=Spirited Away  | last = Laqueur | first = Thomas | name-list-format = vanc | date=2007-09-03  | pages=36\u201342 }}</ref>\n\n[[Brian Wilson]], songwriter and co-founder of [[the Beach Boys]], has [[schizoaffective disorder]] that presents itself in the form of disembodied voices.<ref name=\"BrianWilsonAbility\">{{cite web|title=Brian Wilson \u2013 A Powerful Interview|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/past/brianW/brianw.html|work=Ability Magazine|publisher=Ability Magazine}}</ref> They formed a major component of [[Bill Pohlad]]'s ''[[Love & Mercy (film)|Love & Mercy]]'' (2014), a [[biographical film]] which depicts Wilson's hallucinations as a source of musical inspiration,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tapley|first1=Kristopher | name-list-format = vanc |title=Bill Pohlad wants 'Love & Mercy' to take you inside the genius of Beach Boy Brian Wilson|url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/bill-pohlad-wants-love-mercy-to-take-you-inside-the-genius-of-beach-boy-brian-wilson|publisher=[[HitFix]]|date=May 21, 2015}}</ref> constructing songs that were partly designed to converse with them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Ann | name-list-format = vanc |title=Why Films About Musicians Leave So Much Music Off Screen|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/07/07/420818746/why-films-about-musicians-leave-so-much-music-off-screen|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Wilson has said of the voices: \"Mostly [they're] derogatory.

Such evidence comes mainly from research carried out on the neuroimaging of AVHs, on the so-called \u201cinner\u201d and \u201csubvocal\u201d speech, on \u201cvoices\u201d experienced by deaf patients, and on the phenomenology of AVHs <ref> Mitropoulos, George B.

Tome II (pp 610\u2013612). Paris: Presses\nUniversitaires de France.</ref> as well as of (Lacanian) psychoanalysis. According to the latter, the experience of the voice is linked more to speech as a chain of articulated signifying elements than to sensorium itself <ref> Lacan J (2006) \u00c9crits: The first complete edition in English.

Such methods allowed researchers to find a correlation between decreased gray matter of the left temporal lobe and difficulties in processing external sound stimulus in hallucinating patients.<ref name=\"Hugdahl K 2009\"/>\n\nFunctional neuroimaging has shown increased blood and oxygen flow to speech related areas of the left temporal lobe, including Broca's area and the thalamus.<ref name=\"Hugdahl K 2009\"/>\n\n===Causes===\nThe causes of auditory hallucinations are unclear.\n\nIt is suspected that deficits in the left temporal lobe attribute that lead to spontaneous neural activity cause speech misrepresentations that account for auditory hallucinations.<ref name=\"Hugdahl K 2009\"/>\n\nCharles Fernyhough, of the University of Durham poses one theory among many but stands as a reasonable example of the literature.

This involves the capacity to carry out [[internal monologue]]s, as seen in reading to oneself, or going over a list silently.\n\n'''Level four (condensed inner speech)''' is the final level in the internalization process.  It involves the capacity to think in terms of pure meaning without the need to put thoughts into words in order to grasp the meaning of the thought.\n\n====Disruption to internalization====\nA disruption could occur during the normal process of internalizing one's inner voice, where the individual would not interpret their own voice as belonging to them; a problem that would be interpreted as level one to level four error.<ref name=\"thinking aloud\"/><ref name=\"Jones 2007\"/><ref name=\"Fernyhough 2004\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.newideapsych.2004.09.001 | last = Fernyhough | first = Charles | name-list-format = vanc | title = Alien voices and inner dialogue: towards a developmental account of auditory verbal hallucinations | journal = New Ideas in Psychology | volume = 22 | year = 2004 | pages = 49\u201368 }}</ref>\n\n====Re-expansion====\nAlternatively, the disruption could occur during the process of re-externalizing one's inner voice, resulting in an apparent second voice that seems alien to the individual; a problem that would be interpreted as a level four to level one error.<ref name=\"thinking aloud\"/><ref name=\"Jones 2007\"/><ref name=\"Fernyhough 2004\"/>\n\n===Treatments===\nPsychopharmacological treatments include anti-psychotic medications.

It is on the coast, between [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]] and [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]].\n\nThe lands of the Carrickbrennan estate form the greater part of the civil parish of Monkstown.\n\n== History ==\nA church was built at Carrickbrennan (as Monkstown was then known) before the 8th century, and dedicated to Saint Mochonna, bishop of Inispatrick or Holmpatrick by Skerries. The grange of Carrickbrennan, otherwise Monkstown, was granted by the King to the Cistercian monks of Saint Mary's Abbey, Dublin, in 1200. The monks built their grange near to the church, and the village grew up around it. The lands of which it was a part extended as far south as Bulloch harbour on the outskirts of Dalkey, where the monks constructed a fishing harbour protected by a castle.<ref>{{cite web|title= Monkstown|url=http://www.logainm.ie|website=logainm.ie|publisher=[[Placenames Database of Ireland]]|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1539, King Henry VIII awarded the Monkstown lands to Sir John Travers, Master of the Ordnance in Ireland. John Travers lived in his Castle at Monkstown from 1557 to his death in 1562 (he is buried in the [[Carrickbrennan Graveyard]]) when the property fell to James Eustace 3rd Viscount Baltinglass through his marriage to Mary Travers. In 1580, the Castle was used as a rebellion stronghold, after which it was awarded to Sir [[Henry Wallop]], Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. The lands were later returned to Mary, the widowed Lady Baltinglass, who later married Gerald Alymer. On her death in 1610 the Castle was transferred to the Chevers family through the marriage of Mary Travers's sister Catherine to John Chevers, and the property passed directly to his second son Henry Chevers, who married Catherine, daughter of Sir Richard Fitzwilliam. Henry and Catherine Chevers lived here with their four children (Walter, Thomas, Patrick, Margaret).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nUpon the death of Henry in 1640, the castle and lands were passed to Walter Cheevers.  Walter and family received command to vacate Monkstown in 1653 by the Cromwellian Commissioners, and transplanted to Killyan, [[County Galway]]. In 1660, Walter Chevers was restored to his estate at Monkstown Castle, until his death in 1678. His death occurred on the 20th day of December 1678, and he was buried at Mountoun (Monkstown), two days later on 22nd.<ref>{{Citation | title = Funeral Certificate}}.</ref>  The Shivers family of America trace their lineage to Thomas Chevers brother of Walter Chevers of Monkstown, through the Cromwellian warrant, authorized on 26 November 1653 for Captain John Whittey to transport the Thomas Chevers family to America.\n\nMonkstown was later purchased by the [[Archbishop of Armagh]], [[Michael Boyle (the younger)|Michael Boyle]], and his son [[Murrough Boyle, 1st Viscount Blesington]] enlarged the castle, making it one of the finest residences.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nUntil about 1800, Monkstown was a rural area of open countryside, dotted here and there with large houses owned by the merchants of Dublin.  The [[Monkstown Church, Dublin|Monkstown Church (Church of Ireland)]] had been built \u2013 but was smaller than the present church.\n\nThe two small local rivers met in the area now called Pakenham Road.  The river known as Micky Briens originated in [[Sallynoggin]].  A lake beside Monkstown Castle had one small island.  The coastline was ragged and rocky, with a harbour stretching over 100 yards inland at the mouth of the aforementioned rivers, adjacent to the area now occupied by the West Pier. [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] (then called Dunleary, and later Kingstown) was then a small group of houses in the area of the Purty Kitchen, and the present area of D\u00fan Laoghaire was an area of rocky outcrops and later, quarries.\n\nWednesday, 18 November 1807 a night of disasters in southern Dublin.  In an horrific storm, two sailing ships, the Rochdale and the Prince of Wales were blown on to the rocks, one at Seapoint and the other at Blackrock.  About 400 lives in total were lost on that night, many of them washed up on the shore at Monkstown.  The disaster was one of the factors which led to the building of D\u00fan Laoghaire Harbour. Most of the victims were buried in [[Carrickbrennan Churchyard]].\n\nThe building of D\u00fan Laoghaire harbour gave an impetus to the area, and Montpelier Terrace was the first of many terraces built in the area.  The coming of the railway in 1837 had a much greater impact.  Firstly, it changed the topology of the coast, and secondly, it led to Monkstown becoming a commuter suburb of the city of Dublin.  Most of the houses along Monkstown Road and the avenues north of that road were constructed over the next 30 years. The maps of 1870 show this phase completed, but the rest of Monkstown consists of mansions surrounded by extensive gardens.  [[File:Salthill Railway Station and Hotel (17699678910).jpg|thumb|[[Salthill and Monkstown railway station]] originally built by the [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway]].]]\n\nFor the following 50 years there was little change.  The post-war developments of Castle Park, Richmond, Windsor, etc. and the more recent developments of Brook Court, Monkstown Valley, and Carrickbrennan Lawn mean that there is little opportunity for further development.\n\nThe diaries of the Rev John Thomas Hynes (1799\u20131868), a Catholic bishop who retired to Monkstown in 1861-68, provide a valuable insight into daily life in Monkstown in that period.  Hynes lived at Bloomwood, Monkstown Avenue (later renamed as Carrickbrennan Road), and later moved to Uplands, The Hill, Monkstown.  The Hynes Diaries recount such details as the coming of gas lighting, the postal and travel facilities, church affairs, and lots of local gossip.  The Hynes diaries are now preserved in Melbourne, but the full text has been made available online.<ref>{{Citation | url = <!-- http://www.unisanet.unisa.edu.au/research/condon/Hynes/ -->  https://www.cam.org.au/Portals/0/2018/MDHC/Hynes-Diary-2010-V2.pdf | title = Diaries | last = Hynes | publisher = Unisa | place = [[Australia|AU]]|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Documentary references===\n* Monkstown is first mentioned in 1450; ''Tenants Cistercians at Carrickbrennan, Villa Monachorum''.\n* Carrickbrennan, or \"Carigbrenna\", features on the 1598 map \"A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/104/zoom.html|title=A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles \u2014 Viewer \u2014 World Digital Library|website=www.wdl.org}}</ref> by [[Abraham Ortelius]].\n* Records of the Abbey of the Blessed Virgin Mary 1640.\n* Forfeiting Proprietors under the Cromwellian Settlement 1657.\n* In James Joyce's \"The Dead,\" Gabriel Conroy and his wife Gretta live in Monkstown.\n\n{{anchor|Castle}}\n\n== Noted buildings ==\n[[Image:Monkstown Castle from the East.jpg|thumb|Monkstown Castle, viewed from the east.]]\n[[Image:Monkstown Castle from the North.jpg|thumb|Monkstown Castle, viewed from the north.]]\n\nMonkstown has two old established churches, Saint Mary's [[Church of Ireland]] (1831) and Saint Patrick's Catholic Church (1866), both on Carrickbrennan Road.

Henry and Catherine Chevers lived here with their four children (Walter, Thomas, Patrick, Margaret).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nUpon the death of Henry in 1640, the castle and lands were passed to Walter Cheevers.  Walter and family received command to vacate Monkstown in 1653 by the Cromwellian Commissioners, and transplanted to Killyan, [[County Galway]]. In 1660, Walter Chevers was restored to his estate at Monkstown Castle, until his death in 1678. His death occurred on the 20th day of December 1678, and he was buried at Mountoun (Monkstown), two days later on 22nd.<ref>{{Citation | title = Funeral Certificate}}.</ref>  The Shivers family of America trace their lineage to Thomas Chevers brother of Walter Chevers of Monkstown, through the Cromwellian warrant, authorized on 26 November 1653 for Captain John Whittey to transport the Thomas Chevers family to America.\n\nMonkstown was later purchased by the [[Archbishop of Armagh]], [[Michael Boyle (the younger)|Michael Boyle]], and his son [[Murrough Boyle, 1st Viscount Blesington]] enlarged the castle, making it one of the finest residences.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nUntil about 1800, Monkstown was a rural area of open countryside, dotted here and there with large houses owned by the merchants of Dublin.  The [[Monkstown Church, Dublin|Monkstown Church (Church of Ireland)]] had been built \u2013 but was smaller than the present church.\n\nThe two small local rivers met in the area now called Pakenham Road.  The river known as Micky Briens originated in [[Sallynoggin]].  A lake beside Monkstown Castle had one small island.  The coastline was ragged and rocky, with a harbour stretching over 100 yards inland at the mouth of the aforementioned rivers, adjacent to the area now occupied by the West Pier. [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] (then called Dunleary, and later Kingstown) was then a small group of houses in the area of the Purty Kitchen, and the present area of D\u00fan Laoghaire was an area of rocky outcrops and later, quarries.\n\nWednesday, 18 November 1807 a night of disasters in southern Dublin.  In an horrific storm, two sailing ships, the Rochdale and the Prince of Wales were blown on to the rocks, one at Seapoint and the other at Blackrock.  About 400 lives in total were lost on that night, many of them washed up on the shore at Monkstown.  The disaster was one of the factors which led to the building of D\u00fan Laoghaire Harbour. Most of the victims were buried in [[Carrickbrennan Churchyard]].\n\nThe building of D\u00fan Laoghaire harbour gave an impetus to the area, and Montpelier Terrace was the first of many terraces built in the area.  The coming of the railway in 1837 had a much greater impact.  Firstly, it changed the topology of the coast, and secondly, it led to Monkstown becoming a commuter suburb of the city of Dublin.  Most of the houses along Monkstown Road and the avenues north of that road were constructed over the next 30 years. The maps of 1870 show this phase completed, but the rest of Monkstown consists of mansions surrounded by extensive gardens.  [[File:Salthill Railway Station and Hotel (17699678910).jpg|thumb|[[Salthill and Monkstown railway station]] originally built by the [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway]].]]\n\nFor the following 50 years there was little change.  The post-war developments of Castle Park, Richmond, Windsor, etc. and the more recent developments of Brook Court, Monkstown Valley, and Carrickbrennan Lawn mean that there is little opportunity for further development.\n\nThe diaries of the Rev John Thomas Hynes (1799\u20131868), a Catholic bishop who retired to Monkstown in 1861-68, provide a valuable insight into daily life in Monkstown in that period.  Hynes lived at Bloomwood, Monkstown Avenue (later renamed as Carrickbrennan Road), and later moved to Uplands, The Hill, Monkstown.  The Hynes Diaries recount such details as the coming of gas lighting, the postal and travel facilities, church affairs, and lots of local gossip.  The Hynes diaries are now preserved in Melbourne, but the full text has been made available online.<ref>{{Citation | url = <!-- http://www.unisanet.unisa.edu.au/research/condon/Hynes/ -->  https://www.cam.org.au/Portals/0/2018/MDHC/Hynes-Diary-2010-V2.pdf | title = Diaries | last = Hynes | publisher = Unisa | place = [[Australia|AU]]|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Documentary references===\n* Monkstown is first mentioned in 1450; ''Tenants Cistercians at Carrickbrennan, Villa Monachorum''.\n* Carrickbrennan, or \"Carigbrenna\", features on the 1598 map \"A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/104/zoom.html|title=A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles \u2014 Viewer \u2014 World Digital Library|website=www.wdl.org}}</ref> by [[Abraham Ortelius]].\n* Records of the Abbey of the Blessed Virgin Mary 1640.\n* Forfeiting Proprietors under the Cromwellian Settlement 1657.\n* In James Joyce's \"The Dead,\" Gabriel Conroy and his wife Gretta live in Monkstown.\n\n{{anchor|Castle}}\n\n== Noted buildings ==\n[[Image:Monkstown Castle from the East.jpg|thumb|Monkstown Castle, viewed from the east.]]\n[[Image:Monkstown Castle from the North.jpg|thumb|Monkstown Castle, viewed from the north.]]\n\nMonkstown has two old established churches, Saint Mary's [[Church of Ireland]] (1831) and Saint Patrick's Catholic Church (1866), both on Carrickbrennan Road.

Gould's campaign ended when he lost to [[Patrick Wallace]]. However, he dropped off the Main Tour after this sole season, and barely played for the next four years, due to looking after his terminally ill mother.\n\nGould returned to action in 2007 as he won his second English Amateur Championship, beating [[David Lilley (snooker player)|David Lilley]] 8\u20137 in a dramatic black-ball decider, as Lilley potted the black only for the white ball to go in-off. He then won the English Play-offs in [[Leeds]] to ensure his return to the Main Tour for [[Snooker season 2007/2008|2007/08 season]].\n\nGould reached the last 32 of the [[2007 Northern Ireland Trophy]], beating [[Matthew Stevens]] 5\u20134 from 0\u20133 down in the last 48.

Gould then also reached the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time, at the [[2009 Welsh Open (snooker)|2009 Welsh Open]], beating Stephen Hendry 5\u20133 in the last 32. Solid qualifying results in the remainder of the season helped him into the top 48 in the world rankings for [[Snooker season 2009/2010|2009/10 season]] meaning Gould had only to win two matches to qualify for events. In the [[2009 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] qualifying, Gould defeated [[Rodney Goggins]] 10\u20137, [[David Gilbert (snooker player)|David Gilbert]] 10\u20138 and former top 16 player [[Matthew Stevens]] 10\u20134 to qualify for the World Championship, where he lost in the first round.

Having qualified to the [[Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 \u2013 Finals|PTC Grand Finals]], in March 2011 Gould reached his first career final, where he was beaten 0\u20134 by Shaun Murphy.

He has appeared in three ranking finals and won one ranking title, the [[2016 German Masters]].\n\n==Career==\nGould began his professional career by playing [[Challenge Tour (snooker)|Challenge Tour]] in 2000, at the time the second-level professional tour.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cuetracker.net/pages/players.php?ID=26&season=2000/2001 | title=Martin Gould \u2013 Season 2000/2001 | accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> In 2002, Gould won his first [[English Amateur Championship]], beating Craig Taylor in the final. Gould reached the semi-finals of the 2002 European Championship.\n\nGould enjoyed a good run in the qualification for the [[2003 World Snooker Championship]], winning 8 matches, beating [[Alain Robidoux]] and [[Stephen Maguire]]. Gould's campaign ended when he lost to [[Patrick Wallace]]. However, he dropped off the Main Tour after this sole season, and barely played for the next four years, due to looking after his terminally ill mother.\n\nGould returned to action in 2007 as he won his second English Amateur Championship, beating [[David Lilley (snooker player)|David Lilley]] 8\u20137 in a dramatic black-ball decider, as Lilley potted the black only for the white ball to go in-off. He then won the English Play-offs in [[Leeds]] to ensure his return to the Main Tour for [[Snooker season 2007/2008|2007/08 season]].\n\nGould reached the last 32 of the [[2007 Northern Ireland Trophy]], beating [[Matthew Stevens]] 5\u20134 from 0\u20133 down in the last 48. He also won multiple qualifying matches at both the [[2007 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] and [[2008 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] qualifying events, although he did not ultimately qualify for either event. He finished the season inside the top 64.\n\nGould came through qualifying for the [[2008 UK Championship (snooker)|2008 UK Championship]], beating [[Supoj Saenla]] 9\u20131, [[Tom Ford (snooker player)|Tom Ford]] 9\u20136, and in the final qualifying round overturned a 2\u20135 deficit to overcome [[Dominic Dale]] 9\u20136. In the first round Gould faced eventual champion [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]], Murphy did go 7\u20133 ahead before Gould rattled off four frames in a row to bring the score back to 7\u20137, but Murphy held on to seal a 9\u20137 victory. Gould then also reached the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time, at the [[2009 Welsh Open (snooker)|2009 Welsh Open]], beating Stephen Hendry 5\u20133 in the last 32. Solid qualifying results in the remainder of the season helped him into the top 48 in the world rankings for [[Snooker season 2009/2010|2009/10 season]] meaning Gould had only to win two matches to qualify for events. In the [[2009 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] qualifying, Gould defeated [[Rodney Goggins]] 10\u20137, [[David Gilbert (snooker player)|David Gilbert]] 10\u20138 and former top 16 player [[Matthew Stevens]] 10\u20134 to qualify for the World Championship, where he lost in the first round. Despite dismal results during the first tournaments of [[Snooker season 2009/2010|2009/10 season]], he again returned to the Crucible the following year and defeated [[Marco Fu]] 10\u20139 in the first round. In the second round he spectacularly led [[Neil Robertson (snooker player)|Neil Robertson]] 6\u20130, 11\u20135 and 12\u201310, playing arguably his best snooker ever, before ultimately losing 12\u201313.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/8642142.stm Neil Robertson comeback denies Martin Gould in thriller] BBC Sport, 24 April 2010</ref> Robertson went on to win the championship that year.\n\nGould had a strong start to the [[Snooker season 2010/2011|2010/11 season]], reaching the last 16 of the [[2010 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]] after beating [[Stephen Hendry]] 5\u20133, and scored his major ranking quarter-final at the [[2010 World Open (snooker)|World Open]], where he lost 1\u20133 to [[Peter Ebdon]]. He performed successfully during the minor-ranking [[Players Tour Championship|PTC]] events, his best result being the final of the [[Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 \u2013 Event 6|Event 6]], where he lost 3\u20134 to [[Dominic Dale]] despite Dale needing snookers in the decider. Having qualified to the [[Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 \u2013 Finals|PTC Grand Finals]], in March 2011 Gould reached his first career final, where he was beaten 0\u20134 by Shaun Murphy. Gould once again qualified for the [[2011 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], and defeated [[Marco Fu]] 10\u20138 in a repeat of the previous year's first round match. Gould was then defeated by reigning [[China Open (snooker)|China Open]] champion and eventual World Championship runner-up, [[Judd Trump]].\n\n===Top 16 breakthrough===\nGould began the [[Snooker season 2011/2012|2011/2012]] season by qualifying for the first two ranking events of the year, the [[2011 Australian Goldfields Open|Australian Goldfields Open]] and the [[2011 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]], being knocked out in the first round by [[Stephen Hendry]] in the former and in the second round to [[Matthew Stevens]] in the latter.<ref name=\"2011/12\">{{cite web | url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?player=27&season=2011 | title=Martin Gould 2011/2012 | publisher=Snooker.org | accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> His consistent performances were enough to see him break into the elite top 16 for the first time in October, meaning he would no longer have to qualify for the ranking tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rankings after PTC6 (2011 Warsaw Classic) |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/dc/8f/0,,13165~167900,00.pdf |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |format=PDF |accessdate=21 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190034/http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/dc/8f/0%2C%2C13165~167900%2C00.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn November, Gould won the [[2011 Power Snooker Masters Trophy|Masters Trophy]] of the variant form of the game, [[Power Snooker]], beating reigning champion [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/page/NewsArticles/0,,13165~2522338,00.html | title=Glittering Gould's Got The Power | publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|WPBSA]] | date=20 November 2011 | accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> Gould finished 2011 by reaching the final of [[Players Tour Championship 2011/2012 \u2013 Event 11|PTC Event 11]], where he lost to [[Tom Ford (snooker player)|Tom Ford]] 3\u20134.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/19122011/58/ford-beats-gould-ptc-11-final.html | title=Ford beats Gould in PTC 11 final | work=[[Yahoo!
