But sometimes, she was a whimsical and capricious woman.\n\n\"It happened that one day, in C\u00f3rdoba in the month of February, snow fell and when Al-Rumaikiyya saw snow, she began to mourn. The king asked why she was crying, and she told him she was crying because he never let her go to the places where it snowed. The king, to please her, because C\u00f3rdoba is a city of warm temperature and there is rarely snow, planted almond trees sent from the mountains above C\u00f3rdoba so that when they bloomed in February, they appeared to be covered with snow and the queen saw her desire fulfilled.\n\n\"And again, while Al-Rumaikiyya was in her room, which was next to the river, she saw a barefoot woman who collected mud to make bricks. And when she saw this the queen began to mourn. The king asked her why she was crying, and she said she could never do what she wanted, unlike that humble woman. The king, to please her, sent for rosewater to fill a large lake in C\u00f3rdoba; then ordered that the land taken out of the lake should be filled with sugar, cinnamon, lavender, clove, musk, amber and civet, and a number of spices that smell good. When the lake was full of all these things and the mud was as you can imagine, the king told his wife to take off her shoes and step out, and then she could make mud bricks all she wanted.\n\n\"Again, she was craving something else, and she began to mourn. The king asked why she was crying, and she replied that she would not mourn if he ever did anything to please her. The good king, seeing that she did not appreciate all that he had done for her, not knowing what else he could do, he said these words in Arabic: \"Not even the day you played with mud?\" for her to understand that by the mud she should always remember that he had tried his best to satisfy her.\n\n\"And so, my lord, if that man forgets, and does not thank you for all you've done for him, simply because you have not done as he would like, I advise you not to do anything to harm him.

He used at least some of this money in late 1993 to purchase an [[AR-10]] semi-automatic rifle through a newspaper advertisement in Tasmania.\n\nBryant's father had tried to purchase a [[bed and breakfast]] property called Seascape, but Noelene (also known as Sally) and David Martin bought this property before his father could ready his finances, much to the disappointment of Bryant's father, who often complained to his son of the \"double dealing\" the Martins had done to secure the purchase. Bryant's father offered to buy another property from the Martins at Palmers Lookout Road, but they declined the offer. Bryant apparently believed the Martins had deliberately bought the property to hurt his family and believed this event to be responsible for the depression that led to his father's 1993 [[suicide]]. Bryant later described the Martins as \"very mean people\" and as \"the worse{{sic}} people in my life.\"<ref name=\"Mullen\">{{Cite web\n |last=Mullen\n |first=Paul E.\n |date=4 May 1996\n |title=Psychiatric Report Martin Bryant\n |url=http://kildall.apana.org.au/autism/articles/bryant.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170830073132/http://kildall.apana.org.au/autism/articles/bryant.html\n |archive-date = 2017-08-30\n |work=Victorian Forensic Psychiatry Services \n |accessdate=2 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1995, Bryant became suicidal after deciding he had \"had enough\". He stated, \"I just felt more people were against me. When I tried to be friendly toward them, they just walked away\". Although he had previously been little more than a social drinker, his alcohol consumption increased and, although he had not consumed any alcohol on that day, had especially escalated in the six months prior to the [[massacre]].<ref name=\"Mullen\"/>\n\nIn March 1996, Bryant had his AR-10 repaired at a gun shop and made inquiries about [[AR-15]] rifles in other gun shops. At the time of purchase, non-handguns were not required to be registered in Tasmania.\n\nAccording to Bryant, he thought the plan for Port Arthur may have first occurred to him four to 12 weeks before the event.<ref name=\"Mullen\"/><ref name=\"SupremeCourtCase\"/>\n\n=== Motivation ===\nBryant's motivation for the massacre was the refusal of the sale of Seascape by owners David and Noelene Martin and to become notorious, as revealed by his lawyer, on the Channel 7 program \"Sunday Night\" air date Sunday, 6 March 2016. From the moment he was captured, he continually wanted to know how many people he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed to listen to music on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to any news reports of his massacre. Photographers allowed in to take pictures of him in his prison cell were forced to destroy the film in his presence when the Governor found out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/managing-martin-the-jailing-of-martin-bryant/3563950 |title=Managing Martin: The Jailing of Martin Bryant |work=Radio National |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>\n\n=== Gun laws in Australia before the Port Arthur massacre ===\nA redesign of the laws for all States and Territories of Australia had been prepared by officers and presented at a meeting of Police Ministers' in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] in 1995.

The facts were then presented in court on 19 November 1996.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Morning events====\nBryant was awakened at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. by his alarm clock. His girlfriend and other family members said he had never been known to use it since he did not work and had no other commitments. At 8:00&nbsp;a.m., his girlfriend left the house to visit her parents. Bryant left the house and switched on the burglar alarm, which registered the time as 9:47&nbsp;a.m.\n\nBryant travelled to Forcett, arriving some time around 11:00&nbsp;a.m. He continued to Port Arthur and was seen driving into Seascape down the Arthur Highway around 11:45&nbsp;a.m. He stopped at the Seascape guest accommodation site <small>({{coord|43.11888|S|147.85326|E|scale:500|name=Ruin of Seascape guest accommodation}}<ref>[https://www.gettyimages.de/fotos/seascape-guesthouse?sort=mostpopular&mediatype=photography&phrase=seascape%20guesthouse Seascape guest accommodation site, Landmarks and Buildings identically in googlemaps and gettyimages.de], accessed 2018 April, 11</ref>)</small> that his father had wanted to purchase, owned by David and Noelene Martin. Bryant went inside and fired several shots, then gagged David Martin and stabbed him. Witnesses testified to different numbers of shots fired at this time. It was stated in court that it was believed that this was the time that Bryant killed the Martins, his first two victims.\n\nA couple stopped at Seascape and Bryant met them outside. When they asked if they could have a look at the accommodation, Bryant told them that they could not because his parents were away and his girlfriend was inside. His demeanour was described as quite rude and the couple felt uncomfortable. They left at about 12:35&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\nBryant drove to Port Arthur, taking the keys to the Seascape properties after locking the doors. Bryant stopped at a car which had pulled over due to overheating and talked with two people there. He suggested that they come to the Port Arthur caf\u00e9 for some coffee later.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\nHe travelled past the Port Arthur historic site towards a Palmer's Lookout Road property owned by the Martins, where he came across Roger Larner. Larner had met him on some occasions more than 15 years previously. Bryant told Larner he had been surfing and had bought a property called Fogg Lodge and was now looking to buy some cattle from Larner. Bryant also made several comments about buying the Martins' place next door. He asked if Marian Larner was home, and asked if he could continue down the driveway of the farm to see her. Larner said OK, but told Bryant he would come also. \"Bryant then responded that he might go to Nubeena first\" and he was going to return in the afternoon.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Port Arthur Historic Site====\n[[File:Port Arthur, Tasmania.JPG|thumbnail|Port Arthur Bay, Port Arthur, was the location of most of the shootings]]\n\nAt around 1:10&nbsp;p.m., Bryant got in line at the toll booth at the entrance to the historic site. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Caf\u00e9, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the caf\u00e9. The security manager saw him go up to the caf\u00e9 carrying a \"sports-type bag\" and a video camera, but ignored him. Bryant went into the caf\u00e9 and purchased a meal, which he ate on the deck outside. He attempted to start conversations with people about the lack of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|\"WASPs\"]] in the area and there not being as many [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourists as usual. He appeared nervous and \"quite regularly\" looked back to the car-park and into the caf\u00e9.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Broad Arrow Caf\u00e9 murders====\nBryant finished his meal, walked into the caf\u00e9 and returned his tray, assisted by some people who opened the door for him. He put his bag down on a table and pulled out of it a [[Colt AR-15|Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine]] with a Colt scope and one 30-round magazine attached. The bag also contained, among other things, the knife he had used to stab David Martin. It is believed the Colt magazine was partially emptied from the shootings at Seascape.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 was very small, with the tables very close together, and was particularly busy that day, with many people waiting for the next ferry. The following events happened extremely quickly. Bryant took aim from his hip and pointed his rifle at Moh Yee (William) Ng and Sou Leng Chung, who were visiting from Malaysia<ref name=\"massacre\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=9\u201311}}</ref> and were seated at a table beside Bryant. He shot them at close range, killing both instantly. Bryant then fired a shot at Mick Sargent, grazing his scalp and knocking him to the floor.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> He fired a fourth shot that killed Sargent's girlfriend, 21-year-old Kate Elizabeth Scott, by hitting her in the back of the head.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nA 28-year-old New Zealand winemaker, Jason Winter, had been helping the busy caf\u00e9 staff.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> As Bryant turned towards Winter's wife Joanne and their 15-month-old son Mitchell, Winter threw a serving tray at Bryant in an attempt to distract him. Joanne Winter's father pushed his daughter and grandson to the floor and under the table.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n[[File:Port Arthur Memorial Garden.jpg|thumb|The caf\u00e9 structure in 2015. A memorial garden has been established at the site.]]\n\n44-year-old Anthony Nightingale stood up after the sound of the first shots, but had no time to move. Nightingale yelled \"No, not here!\" as Bryant pointed the weapon at him.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> As Nightingale leaned forward, he was fatally shot through the neck and spine.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nThe next table had held a group of ten friends,<ref name=\"massacre\" /> but some had just left the table to return their meal trays and visit the gift shop. Bryant fired one shot that killed Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The second hit Walter Bennett, 66, passed through his body and struck Raymond John Sharp, 67, Kevin Sharp's brother, killing both.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The three had their backs towards Bryant, and were unaware what was happening\u200a\u2014\u200athey at first believed someone was letting off firecrackers. One of them made the comment \"That's not funny\" after hearing the first few shots, not realising that they were real. The shots were all close range, with the gun at, or just inches away from, the back of their heads. Gerald Broome, Gaye Fidler and her husband John were all struck by bullet fragments, but survived.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant then turned towards Tony and Sarah Kistan and Andrew Mills.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Both men stood up at the noise of the initial shots, but had no time to move away. Andrew Mills was shot in the head. Tony Kistan was also shot from about two metres away, also in the head, but had managed to push his wife away prior to being shot. Sarah Kistan was apparently not seen by Bryant, as she was under the table by that time.\n\nThelma Walker and Pamela Law were injured by fragments before being dragged to the ground by their friend, Peter Crosswell, as the three sheltered underneath the table.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Also injured by fragments from these shots was Patricia Barker.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nIt was only then that the majority of the people in the caf\u00e9 began to realise what was happening and that the shots were not from [[historical reenactment in Australia|a reenactment at the historical site]]. At this point, there was great confusion, with many people not knowing what to do, as Bryant was near the main exit.\n\nBryant moved just a few metres and began shooting at the table where Graham Colyer, Carolyn Loughton and her daughter Sarah were seated. Colyer was severely injured in the jaw, nearly choking to death on his own blood.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Sarah Loughton ran towards her mother, who had been moving between tables. Carolyn Loughton threw herself on top of her daughter.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant shot Carolyn Loughton in the back; her eardrum was ruptured by the [[Muzzle flash|muzzle blast]] from the gun going off beside her ear.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> She survived her injuries, but learned after she came out of surgery that, despite her efforts, Sarah had been fatally shot in the head.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant pivoted around and shot Mervyn Howard who was seated.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The bullet passed through him, through a window of the caf\u00e9, and hit a table on the outside balcony.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant quickly followed up with a shot to the neck of Mervyn Howard's wife, Mary.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant then leaned over a vacant baby stroller and pointed the gun at her head and shot her a second time.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Both of the Howards' injuries were fatal.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant was near the exit, preventing others from attempting to run past him and escape. Bryant moved across the caf\u00e9 towards the gift shop area. There was an exit door through the display area to the outside balcony, but it was locked and could only be opened with a key. As Bryant moved, Robert Elliott stood up.<ref name=\"massacre2\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=11\u201315}}</ref> He was shot in the arm and head, left slumping against the fireplace but alive.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nAll of these events, from the first bullet that killed Ng, took approximately fifteen seconds, during which Bryant fired seventeen shots, killed twelve people, and wounded ten more.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20010508013225/http://www.shootersnews.addr.com/cttranscript.htm</ref>\n\n====Gift shop murders====\nBryant moved towards the gift shop area, giving many people time to hide under tables and behind shop displays. He fatally shot the two local women who worked in the gift shop: 17-year-old Nicole Burgess, in the head, and 26-year-old Elizabeth Howard, in the arm and chest.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nCoralee Lever and Vera Jary hid behind a hessian (burlap) screen with others.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Lever's husband Dennis was fatally shot in the head.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Pauline Masters, Vera Jary's husband Ron, and Peter and Carolyn Nash had attempted to escape through a locked door but could not.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Peter Nash lay down on top of his wife to hide her from Bryant.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant moved into the gift shop area where several people, trapped with nowhere to go, were crouched down in the corners.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Gwen Neander, trying to make it to the door, was shot in the head and killed.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant saw movement in the caf\u00e9 and moved near the front door. He shot at a table and hit Peter Crosswell, who was hiding under it, in the buttock.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Jason Winter, hiding in the gift shop, thought Bryant had left the building and made a comment about it to people near him before moving out into the open. Bryant saw him, with Winter stating \"No, no\" just prior to being shot, the bullet hitting his hand, neck and chest.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> A second shot to the head proved fatal to Winter.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Fragments from those shots struck American tourist Dennis Olson, who had been hiding with his wife Mary and Winter.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Dennis Olson suffered fragment injuries to his hand, scalp, eye and chest, but survived.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nIt is not immediately clear what happened next, although at some point, Bryant reloaded his weapon. Bryant walked back to the caf\u00e9 and then returned to the gift shop, this time looking down to another corner of the shop where he found several people hiding in the corner. He walked up to them and shot Ronald Jary through the neck, then Peter Nash and Pauline Masters, killing all three.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He did not see Carolyn Nash, who was lying under her husband.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant aimed his gun at an unidentified Asian man,<ref>The identity of this man was suppressed by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|DPP]]</ref> but the rifle's magazine was empty.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant then moved to the gift shop counter, where he reloaded his rifle, leaving an empty magazine on the service counter, and left the building.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant killed eight people after moving to the gift shop, and wounded two others.\n\nIn the caf\u00e9 and gift shop combined, he fired twenty-nine shots, killed twenty people, and wounded twelve more.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>\n\n====Car park murders====\nDuring the caf\u00e9 shooting, some staff members had been able to escape through the kitchen and alerted people outside. There were a number of coaches outside with lines of people, many of whom began to hide in the buses or in nearby buildings. Others did not understand the situation or were unsure where to go. Some people believed there was some sort of [[historical reenactment]] happening, and moved towards the area.\n\nAshley John Law, a site employee, was moving people away from the caf\u00e9 into the information centre when Bryant fired at him from {{convert|50|\u2013|100|metres|yards|-1|abbr=off}} away. The bullets missed Law and hit some trees nearby.\n\nBryant then moved towards the coaches. One of the coach drivers, Royce Thompson, was shot in the back as he was moving along the passengers' side of a coach.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He fell to the ground and was able to crawl, then roll under the bus to safety, but later died of his wounds.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Brigid Cook was trying to guide people down between the buses and along the jetty area to cover. Bryant moved to the front of this bus and walked across to the next coach. People had quickly moved from this coach towards the back end, in an attempt to seek cover. As Bryant walked around it, he saw people scrambling to hide and shot at them. Brigid Cook was shot in the right thigh, causing the bone to fragment, the bullet lodging there.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> A coach driver, Ian McElwee, was hit by fragments of Cook's bone. Both were able to escape and survived.\n\nBryant then quickly moved around another coach and fired at another group of people. Winifred Aplin, running to get to cover behind another coach, was fatally shot in the side.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Another bullet grazed Yvonne Lockley's cheek, but she was able to enter one of the coaches to hide, and survived.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nSome people then started moving away from the car park towards the jetty. But someone shouted that Bryant was heading that way, so they tried to double back around the coaches to where Brigid Cook had been shot. Bryant doubled back to where Janet and Neville Quin, who owned a wildlife park on the east coast of Tasmania, were beginning to move towards Mason Cove and away from the buses.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant shot Janet Quin in the back, where she fell, unable to move, near Royce Thompson.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant then continued along the car park as people tried to escape along the shore. Doug Hutchinson was attempting to get into a coach when he was shot in the arm.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He quickly ran around the front of the coach, and then along the shore to the jetty and hid.\n\nBryant then went to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|self loading rifle]].<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew up in front of her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they realised Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.\n\nBryant moved back to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot her in the back, then left; she later died from her wounds.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> At an adjacent coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down the aisle to try to shut the door of the coach he was on.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nNeville Quin, husband of Janet, had escaped to the jetty area, but returned to look for his wife. He had been forced to leave her earlier after Bryant shot her. Bryant exited the coach and, spotting Quin, chased him around the coaches. Bryant fired at him at least twice before Quin ran onto a coach. Bryant entered the coach and pointed the gun at Neville Quin's face, saying, \"No one gets away from me\".<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Quin ducked when he realised Bryant was about to pull the trigger.

Balasko had been attempting to film the shooter. Many people, unable to use their parked cars, were hiding or running along Jetty Road and did not know where Bryant was because the gunfire was extremely loud and difficult to pinpoint.\n\nAt this time, Bryant had killed 26 people and injured 18.\n\n====Toll booth murders and carjacking====\n\nBryant then got back into his car and left the car park. Witnesses say he was sounding the horn and waving as he drove. Bryant drove along Jetty Road towards the toll booth where people were running away. Bryant passed by at least two people.\n\nAhead of him were Nanette Mikac and her children, Madeline, 3, and Alannah, 6.<ref name=\"massacre3\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=15\u201323}}</ref> Nanette was carrying Madeline, and Alannah was running slightly ahead. By this point, they had run approximately {{convert|600|metres|yd}} from the car park.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant opened his door and slowed down. Mikac moved towards the car, apparently thinking he was offering them help in escaping. Several more people witnessed this from further down the road. Someone recognised him as the gunman and yelled out \"It's him!\"<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant stepped out of the car, put his hand on Nanette Mikac's shoulder and told her to get on her knees.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> She did so, saying, \"Please don't hurt my babies\".<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant shot her in the temple, killing her. Next, he fired a shot at Madeline, which hit her in the shoulder, then shot her fatally through the chest.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant shot twice at Alannah, as she ran behind a tree, missing.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He then walked up, pressed the barrel of the gun into her neck and fired, killing her instantly.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nBryant fired at some people hiding in a bush, but missed. Having seen the murders of the children, some people further up the road began running. They told drivers of cars coming down the road to go back. The people thought Bryant would head up the road, so instead they proceeded on foot down a dirt side road and hid in the bush. The cars reversed up the road to the toll booth.\n\nBryant drove up to the toll booth, where there were several vehicles, and blocked a 1980 [[BMW 7 Series (E23)|BMW 7 Series]] owned by Mary Rose Nixon.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Inside were Nixon, driver Russell James Pollard and passengers Helene and Robert Graham Salzmann.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> An argument with Robert Salzmann ensued, and Bryant took out his rifle and shot Salzmann at point-blank range, killing him.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Pollard emerged from the BMW and went towards Bryant, who shot him in the chest, killing him.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> More cars then arrived, but seeing this, the drivers were quickly able to reverse back up the road. Bryant then moved to the BMW and pulled Nixon and Helene Salzmann from the car and shot them dead, dragging their bodies onto the road.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant transferred ammunition, handcuffs, the AR-15 rifle and a fuel container to the BMW. Mary Nixon, Russell Pollard, Helene Salzmann and Robert Salzmann are the people Bryant was charged with killing at the toll booth.<ref name=\"charges\">{{Cite web|title=The new charges against Bryant |url=http://www.geniac.net/portarthur/new.htm |date=9 July 1996 |publisher=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAnother car then came towards the toll booth and Bryant shot at it.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver, Graham Sutherland, was hit with glass. A second bullet hit the driver's door. Sutherland quickly reversed back up the road and left. Bryant then got into the BMW, leaving behind his [[Volvo 200 Series#History|Volvo 244]], including his [[USAS-12|Daewoo shotgun]] and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\n\nAt this point, Bryant had killed 33 and injured 19.\n\n====Service station murder and abduction====\nGraham Sutherland, who had just been shot at in his car, reversed back up the road and drove to the service station close by, where he tried to inform people what was happening. Bryant drove up to the service station and cut off a white [[Toyota Corolla]] that was attempting to exit onto the highway. Glenn Pears was driving, with girlfriend Zoe Hall in the passenger seat.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant quickly exited the car with his rifle in hand and tried to pull Hall from the car. Pears got out of the car and approached Bryant. Bryant pointed the gun at Pears and pushed him backwards, eventually directing him into the now open boot of the BMW, locking Pears inside.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nBryant then moved back to the passenger side of the Corolla as Hall attempted to climb over to the driver's seat.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant raised his rifle and fired three shots, killing her.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Many people around the service station witnessed this and ran to hide in nearby bushland. The service station attendant told everyone to lie down and he locked the main doors. He grabbed his rifle, but by the time he could retrieve some ammunition and load his gun, Bryant had left in the BMW. A police officer arrived several minutes later and then set out in pursuit of Bryant.\n\nZoe Hall was the 34th victim killed.\n\n====Seascape roadway====\nAs Bryant drove down to Seascape, he shot at a red [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Upon arriving at Seascape, he got out of his car. A [[Holden Frontera]] 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The car was going downhill so it was able to roll down the road out of sight around a corner, despite its broken throttle cable. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nAnother vehicle then drove down the road, carrying four people. It was not until they were almost adjacent to Bryant that they realised he was carrying a gun. Bryant shot at the car, smashing the windscreen. Douglas Horner was wounded by pieces of the windscreen.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The car proceeded ahead where White and Wanders tried to get in, but Horner did not realise the situation and drove on. When they saw that White had been shot, they came back and picked them up. Both parties then continued down to a local establishment called the Fox and Hound, where they called police.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nYet another car drove past and Bryant shot at it, hitting the passenger, Susan Williams, in the hand.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver, Simon Williams, was struck by fragments.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver of another approaching vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, hitting it but not injuring anyone. Bryant then got back into the BMW and drove down the Seascape driveway to the house where the Martins, his first victims, lay dead.\n\nSometime after he stopped, Bryant removed Pears from the boot and handcuffed him to a stair rail within the house.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> At some point, he also set the BMW on fire.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He is believed to have arrived at the house by about 2:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n===29 April 1996===\n\n====Capture====\nBryant was captured the following morning, when a fire started in the guest house, presumably set by Bryant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/martin-bryant-235987|title=Martin Bryant|website=Biography}}</ref> Bryant taunted police to \"come and get him\", but the police, believing the hostage was already dead, decided that the fire would eventually bring Bryant out. Bryant eventually ran out of the house with his clothes on fire, suffering burns to his back and buttocks. He was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment.\n\nIt was discovered that Glenn Pears had been shot during or before the standoff and had died before the fire. The remains of the Martins were also found.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Port-Arthur-Massacre|title=Port Arthur Massacre - Background, Events, Aftermath, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> It was also determined they had been shot, and that Noelene Martin had suffered blunt-force trauma. They both died before the fire; witness accounts of the gunfire, as presented to the Supreme Court of Tasmania, place the time of death of David and Noelene Martin as being approximately noon on 28 April. One weapon was found burnt in the house, and the other on the roof of the adjacent building where police believed they had seen Bryant the night before. Both weapons had suffered from massive chamber blast pressure, possibly from the heat of the house fire.\n\n== Casualties ==\n=== Fatalities ===\nThe following is a list of those killed in the Port Arthur massacre.<ref name=\"charges\" />\n\n{| style=\"background-color: transparent; width: 100%;\"\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Winifred Joyce Aplin, 58\n* Walter John Bennett, 66\n* Nicole Louise Burgess, 17\n* Sou Leng Chung, 32\n* Elva Rhonda Gaylard, 48\n* Zoe Anne Hall, 28\n* Elizabeth Jayne Howard, 26\n* Mary Elizabeth Howard, 57\n* Mervyn John Howard, 55\n* Ronald Noel Jary, 71\n* Tony Vadivelu Kistan, 51\n* Leslie Dennis Lever, 53\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Sarah Kate Loughton, 15\n* David Martin, 72\n* Noelene \"Sally\" Joyce Martin, 69\n* Pauline Virjeana Masters, 49\n* Alannah Louise Mikac, 6\n* Madeline Grace Mikac, 3\n* Nanette Patricia Mikac, 36\n* Andrew Bruce Mills, 39\n* Peter Brenton Nash, 32\n* Gwenda Joan Neander, 67\n* William Xeeng Ng, 48\n* Anthony Nightingale, 44\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Mary Rose Nixon, 60\n* Glenn Roy Pears, 35\n* Russell James Pollard, 72\n* Janette Kathleen Quin, 50\n* Helene Maria Salzmann, 50\n* Robert Graham Salzmann, 57\n* Kate Elizabeth Scott, 21\n* Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68\n* Raymond John Sharp, 67\n* Royce William Thompson, 59\n* Jason Bernard Winter, 29\n|}\n\n==Aftermath and analysis==\nThe Port Arthur tourist site reopened a few weeks later, and since then a new restaurant has been built.

The two communities exchanged items to place at their respective memorials.\n\nPaul Mullen, a forensic psychiatrist with extensive involvement following the string of massacres in Australia and New Zealand, attributes both the Port Arthur massacre and some of the earlier massacres to the [[copycat crime|copycat effect]].<ref>Mullen, Paul quoted in Hannon K 1997, \"Copycats to Blame for Massacres Says Expert\", Courier Mail, 4/3/1997</ref> In this theory the saturation media coverage provides both instruction and [[perverse incentive]]s for dysfunctional individuals to imitate previous crimes. In Tasmania, a coroner found that a report on the current affairs programme ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'', a few months earlier had guided one suicide, and may have helped create the expectation of a massacre.<ref>Hansen, Jane 1995. \"Tassie Guns\", A Current Affair 2 October 1995, featuring Roland Browne and Rebecca Peters of the Coalition for Gun Control.

The government initiated a mandatory \"buy-back\" scheme with the owners paid according to a table of valuations.

He also claimed he did not take the BMW from the vicinity of the toll booth and that his hostage was taken from the BMW. He said that he thought the man he took hostage must have died in the boot when the car exploded. He did not distinguish between the car fire and the later house fire. Such discrepancies raise speculations that Bryant was either lying during the police interview or was mentally incapable of recalling events accurately. Bryant also claimed that the guns found by police were not his, but admitted to owning the shotgun that was found with his passport back in his own car near the toll booth.\n\nInitially Bryant pleaded not guilty to the 35 murders and did not provide a confession. Bryant changed his plea to guilty for a court hearing on 19 November 1996, where he was found guilty of all charges. The judge then ordered that all evidence for the case be sealed.\n\nOn 22 November, Bryant was sentenced to 35 sentences of life imprisonment for each count of murder and sentenced to 25 years for the remaining 36 charges on 5 other offences (20 attempted murders, 3 counts infliction of grievous bodily harm, the infliction of wounds upon a further 8 persons, 4 counts of aggravated assault and 1 count of unlawfully setting fire to property). All sentences are to be served concurrently <ref>P. Milgate, (et al), 'The Sentencing of Martin Bryant', Cambridge Legal Studies, Preliminary Second Edition, pp. 254-262. https://www.cambridge.edu.au/go/titles/Cambridge-Legal-Studies---Preliminary-Second-Edition:edition-2ed/</ref> in Hobart's Risdon Prison where he remains in solitary confinement, and is not permitted any visitors other than his immediate family. His prison papers indicate that he is never to be released, and he continues to serve his term without possibility of parole.

He used at least some of this money in late 1993 to purchase an [[AR-10]] semi-automatic rifle through a newspaper advertisement in Tasmania.\n\nBryant's father had tried to purchase a [[bed and breakfast]] property called Seascape, but Noelene (also known as Sally) and David Martin bought this property before his father could ready his finances, much to the disappointment of Bryant's father, who often complained to his son of the \"double dealing\" the Martins had done to secure the purchase. Bryant's father offered to buy another property from the Martins at Palmers Lookout Road, but they declined the offer. Bryant apparently believed the Martins had deliberately bought the property to hurt his family and believed this event to be responsible for the depression that led to his father's 1993 [[suicide]]. Bryant later described the Martins as \"very mean people\" and as \"the worse{{sic}} people in my life.\"<ref name=\"Mullen\">{{Cite web\n |last=Mullen\n |first=Paul E.\n |date=4 May 1996\n |title=Psychiatric Report Martin Bryant\n |url=http://kildall.apana.org.au/autism/articles/bryant.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170830073132/http://kildall.apana.org.au/autism/articles/bryant.html\n |archive-date = 2017-08-30\n |work=Victorian Forensic Psychiatry Services \n |accessdate=2 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1995, Bryant became suicidal after deciding he had \"had enough\". He stated, \"I just felt more people were against me. When I tried to be friendly toward them, they just walked away\". Although he had previously been little more than a social drinker, his alcohol consumption increased and, although he had not consumed any alcohol on that day, had especially escalated in the six months prior to the [[massacre]].<ref name=\"Mullen\"/>\n\nIn March 1996, Bryant had his AR-10 repaired at a gun shop and made inquiries about [[AR-15]] rifles in other gun shops. At the time of purchase, non-handguns were not required to be registered in Tasmania.\n\nAccording to Bryant, he thought the plan for Port Arthur may have first occurred to him four to 12 weeks before the event.<ref name=\"Mullen\"/><ref name=\"SupremeCourtCase\"/>\n\n=== Motivation ===\nBryant's motivation for the massacre was the refusal of the sale of Seascape by owners David and Noelene Martin and to become notorious, as revealed by his lawyer, on the Channel 7 program \"Sunday Night\" air date Sunday, 6 March 2016. From the moment he was captured, he continually wanted to know how many people he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed to listen to music on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to any news reports of his massacre. Photographers allowed in to take pictures of him in his prison cell were forced to destroy the film in his presence when the Governor found out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/managing-martin-the-jailing-of-martin-bryant/3563950 |title=Managing Martin: The Jailing of Martin Bryant |work=Radio National |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>\n\n=== Gun laws in Australia before the Port Arthur massacre ===\nA redesign of the laws for all States and Territories of Australia had been prepared by officers and presented at a meeting of Police Ministers' in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] in 1995.

The facts were then presented in court on 19 November 1996.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Morning events====\nBryant was awakened at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. by his alarm clock. His girlfriend and other family members said he had never been known to use it since he did not work and had no other commitments. At 8:00&nbsp;a.m., his girlfriend left the house to visit her parents. Bryant left the house and switched on the burglar alarm, which registered the time as 9:47&nbsp;a.m.\n\nBryant travelled to Forcett, arriving some time around 11:00&nbsp;a.m. He continued to Port Arthur and was seen driving into Seascape down the Arthur Highway around 11:45&nbsp;a.m. He stopped at the Seascape guest accommodation site <small>({{coord|43.11888|S|147.85326|E|scale:500|name=Ruin of Seascape guest accommodation}}<ref>[https://www.gettyimages.de/fotos/seascape-guesthouse?sort=mostpopular&mediatype=photography&phrase=seascape%20guesthouse Seascape guest accommodation site, Landmarks and Buildings identically in googlemaps and gettyimages.de], accessed 2018 April, 11</ref>)</small> that his father had wanted to purchase, owned by David and Noelene Martin. Bryant went inside and fired several shots, then gagged David Martin and stabbed him. Witnesses testified to different numbers of shots fired at this time. It was stated in court that it was believed that this was the time that Bryant killed the Martins, his first two victims.\n\nA couple stopped at Seascape and Bryant met them outside. When they asked if they could have a look at the accommodation, Bryant told them that they could not because his parents were away and his girlfriend was inside. His demeanour was described as quite rude and the couple felt uncomfortable. They left at about 12:35&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\nBryant drove to Port Arthur, taking the keys to the Seascape properties after locking the doors. Bryant stopped at a car which had pulled over due to overheating and talked with two people there. He suggested that they come to the Port Arthur caf\u00e9 for some coffee later.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\nHe travelled past the Port Arthur historic site towards a Palmer's Lookout Road property owned by the Martins, where he came across Roger Larner. Larner had met him on some occasions more than 15 years previously. Bryant told Larner he had been surfing and had bought a property called Fogg Lodge and was now looking to buy some cattle from Larner. Bryant also made several comments about buying the Martins' place next door. He asked if Marian Larner was home, and asked if he could continue down the driveway of the farm to see her. Larner said OK, but told Bryant he would come also. \"Bryant then responded that he might go to Nubeena first\" and he was going to return in the afternoon.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Port Arthur Historic Site====\n[[File:Port Arthur, Tasmania.JPG|thumbnail|Port Arthur Bay, Port Arthur, was the location of most of the shootings]]\n\nAt around 1:10&nbsp;p.m., Bryant got in line at the toll booth at the entrance to the historic site. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Caf\u00e9, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the caf\u00e9. The security manager saw him go up to the caf\u00e9 carrying a \"sports-type bag\" and a video camera, but ignored him. Bryant went into the caf\u00e9 and purchased a meal, which he ate on the deck outside. He attempted to start conversations with people about the lack of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|\"WASPs\"]] in the area and there not being as many [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourists as usual. He appeared nervous and \"quite regularly\" looked back to the car-park and into the caf\u00e9.<ref name=SupremeCourtCase/>\n\n====Broad Arrow Caf\u00e9 murders====\nBryant finished his meal, walked into the caf\u00e9 and returned his tray, assisted by some people who opened the door for him. He put his bag down on a table and pulled out of it a [[Colt AR-15|Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine]] with a Colt scope and one 30-round magazine attached. The bag also contained, among other things, the knife he had used to stab David Martin. It is believed the Colt magazine was partially emptied from the shootings at Seascape.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 was very small, with the tables very close together, and was particularly busy that day, with many people waiting for the next ferry. The following events happened extremely quickly. Bryant took aim from his hip and pointed his rifle at Moh Yee (William) Ng and Sou Leng Chung, who were visiting from Malaysia<ref name=\"massacre\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=9\u201311}}</ref> and were seated at a table beside Bryant. He shot them at close range, killing both instantly. Bryant then fired a shot at Mick Sargent, grazing his scalp and knocking him to the floor.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> He fired a fourth shot that killed Sargent's girlfriend, 21-year-old Kate Elizabeth Scott, by hitting her in the back of the head.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nA 28-year-old New Zealand winemaker, Jason Winter, had been helping the busy caf\u00e9 staff.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> As Bryant turned towards Winter's wife Joanne and their 15-month-old son Mitchell, Winter threw a serving tray at Bryant in an attempt to distract him. Joanne Winter's father pushed his daughter and grandson to the floor and under the table.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n[[File:Port Arthur Memorial Garden.jpg|thumb|The caf\u00e9 structure in 2015. A memorial garden has been established at the site.]]\n\n44-year-old Anthony Nightingale stood up after the sound of the first shots, but had no time to move. Nightingale yelled \"No, not here!\" as Bryant pointed the weapon at him.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> As Nightingale leaned forward, he was fatally shot through the neck and spine.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nThe next table had held a group of ten friends,<ref name=\"massacre\" /> but some had just left the table to return their meal trays and visit the gift shop. Bryant fired one shot that killed Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The second hit Walter Bennett, 66, passed through his body and struck Raymond John Sharp, 67, Kevin Sharp's brother, killing both.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The three had their backs towards Bryant, and were unaware what was happening\u200a\u2014\u200athey at first believed someone was letting off firecrackers. One of them made the comment \"That's not funny\" after hearing the first few shots, not realising that they were real. The shots were all close range, with the gun at, or just inches away from, the back of their heads. Gerald Broome, Gaye Fidler and her husband John were all struck by bullet fragments, but survived.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant then turned towards Tony and Sarah Kistan and Andrew Mills.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Both men stood up at the noise of the initial shots, but had no time to move away. Andrew Mills was shot in the head. Tony Kistan was also shot from about two metres away, also in the head, but had managed to push his wife away prior to being shot. Sarah Kistan was apparently not seen by Bryant, as she was under the table by that time.\n\nThelma Walker and Pamela Law were injured by fragments before being dragged to the ground by their friend, Peter Crosswell, as the three sheltered underneath the table.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Also injured by fragments from these shots was Patricia Barker.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nIt was only then that the majority of the people in the caf\u00e9 began to realise what was happening and that the shots were not from [[historical reenactment in Australia|a reenactment at the historical site]]. At this point, there was great confusion, with many people not knowing what to do, as Bryant was near the main exit.\n\nBryant moved just a few metres and began shooting at the table where Graham Colyer, Carolyn Loughton and her daughter Sarah were seated. Colyer was severely injured in the jaw, nearly choking to death on his own blood.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Sarah Loughton ran towards her mother, who had been moving between tables. Carolyn Loughton threw herself on top of her daughter.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant shot Carolyn Loughton in the back; her eardrum was ruptured by the [[Muzzle flash|muzzle blast]] from the gun going off beside her ear.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> She survived her injuries, but learned after she came out of surgery that, despite her efforts, Sarah had been fatally shot in the head.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant pivoted around and shot Mervyn Howard who was seated.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> The bullet passed through him, through a window of the caf\u00e9, and hit a table on the outside balcony.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant quickly followed up with a shot to the neck of Mervyn Howard's wife, Mary.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Bryant then leaned over a vacant baby stroller and pointed the gun at her head and shot her a second time.<ref name=\"massacre\" /> Both of the Howards' injuries were fatal.<ref name=\"massacre\" />\n\nBryant was near the exit, preventing others from attempting to run past him and escape. Bryant moved across the caf\u00e9 towards the gift shop area. There was an exit door through the display area to the outside balcony, but it was locked and could only be opened with a key. As Bryant moved, Robert Elliott stood up.<ref name=\"massacre2\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=11\u201315}}</ref> He was shot in the arm and head, left slumping against the fireplace but alive.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nAll of these events, from the first bullet that killed Ng, took approximately fifteen seconds, during which Bryant fired seventeen shots, killed twelve people, and wounded ten more.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20010508013225/http://www.shootersnews.addr.com/cttranscript.htm</ref>\n\n====Gift shop murders====\nBryant moved towards the gift shop area, giving many people time to hide under tables and behind shop displays. He fatally shot the two local women who worked in the gift shop: 17-year-old Nicole Burgess, in the head, and 26-year-old Elizabeth Howard, in the arm and chest.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nCoralee Lever and Vera Jary hid behind a hessian (burlap) screen with others.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Lever's husband Dennis was fatally shot in the head.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Pauline Masters, Vera Jary's husband Ron, and Peter and Carolyn Nash had attempted to escape through a locked door but could not.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Peter Nash lay down on top of his wife to hide her from Bryant.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant moved into the gift shop area where several people, trapped with nowhere to go, were crouched down in the corners.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Gwen Neander, trying to make it to the door, was shot in the head and killed.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant saw movement in the caf\u00e9 and moved near the front door. He shot at a table and hit Peter Crosswell, who was hiding under it, in the buttock.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Jason Winter, hiding in the gift shop, thought Bryant had left the building and made a comment about it to people near him before moving out into the open. Bryant saw him, with Winter stating \"No, no\" just prior to being shot, the bullet hitting his hand, neck and chest.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> A second shot to the head proved fatal to Winter.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Fragments from those shots struck American tourist Dennis Olson, who had been hiding with his wife Mary and Winter.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Dennis Olson suffered fragment injuries to his hand, scalp, eye and chest, but survived.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nIt is not immediately clear what happened next, although at some point, Bryant reloaded his weapon. Bryant walked back to the caf\u00e9 and then returned to the gift shop, this time looking down to another corner of the shop where he found several people hiding in the corner. He walked up to them and shot Ronald Jary through the neck, then Peter Nash and Pauline Masters, killing all three.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He did not see Carolyn Nash, who was lying under her husband.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant aimed his gun at an unidentified Asian man,<ref>The identity of this man was suppressed by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|DPP]]</ref> but the rifle's magazine was empty.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant then moved to the gift shop counter, where he reloaded his rifle, leaving an empty magazine on the service counter, and left the building.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant killed eight people after moving to the gift shop, and wounded two others.\n\nIn the caf\u00e9 and gift shop combined, he fired twenty-nine shots, killed twenty people, and wounded twelve more.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>\n\n====Car park murders====\nDuring the caf\u00e9 shooting, some staff members had been able to escape through the kitchen and alerted people outside. There were a number of coaches outside with lines of people, many of whom began to hide in the buses or in nearby buildings. Others did not understand the situation or were unsure where to go. Some people believed there was some sort of [[historical reenactment]] happening, and moved towards the area.\n\nAshley John Law, a site employee, was moving people away from the caf\u00e9 into the information centre when Bryant fired at him from {{convert|50|\u2013|100|metres|yards|-1|abbr=off}} away. The bullets missed Law and hit some trees nearby.\n\nBryant then moved towards the coaches. One of the coach drivers, Royce Thompson, was shot in the back as he was moving along the passengers' side of a coach.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He fell to the ground and was able to crawl, then roll under the bus to safety, but later died of his wounds.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Brigid Cook was trying to guide people down between the buses and along the jetty area to cover. Bryant moved to the front of this bus and walked across to the next coach. People had quickly moved from this coach towards the back end, in an attempt to seek cover. As Bryant walked around it, he saw people scrambling to hide and shot at them. Brigid Cook was shot in the right thigh, causing the bone to fragment, the bullet lodging there.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> A coach driver, Ian McElwee, was hit by fragments of Cook's bone. Both were able to escape and survived.\n\nBryant then quickly moved around another coach and fired at another group of people. Winifred Aplin, running to get to cover behind another coach, was fatally shot in the side.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Another bullet grazed Yvonne Lockley's cheek, but she was able to enter one of the coaches to hide, and survived.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nSome people then started moving away from the car park towards the jetty. But someone shouted that Bryant was heading that way, so they tried to double back around the coaches to where Brigid Cook had been shot. Bryant doubled back to where Janet and Neville Quin, who owned a wildlife park on the east coast of Tasmania, were beginning to move towards Mason Cove and away from the buses.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant shot Janet Quin in the back, where she fell, unable to move, near Royce Thompson.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nBryant then continued along the car park as people tried to escape along the shore. Doug Hutchinson was attempting to get into a coach when he was shot in the arm.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He quickly ran around the front of the coach, and then along the shore to the jetty and hid.\n\nBryant then went to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|self loading rifle]].<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew up in front of her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they realised Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.\n\nBryant moved back to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot her in the back, then left; she later died from her wounds.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> At an adjacent coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down the aisle to try to shut the door of the coach he was on.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.<ref name=\"massacre2\" />\n\nNeville Quin, husband of Janet, had escaped to the jetty area, but returned to look for his wife. He had been forced to leave her earlier after Bryant shot her. Bryant exited the coach and, spotting Quin, chased him around the coaches. Bryant fired at him at least twice before Quin ran onto a coach. Bryant entered the coach and pointed the gun at Neville Quin's face, saying, \"No one gets away from me\".<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Quin ducked when he realised Bryant was about to pull the trigger. The bullet missed his head but hit his neck, momentarily paralysing him.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> After Bryant left, Quin managed to find his wife, although she later died in his arms.<ref name=\"massacre2\" /> Neville Quin was taken away by helicopter and survived.\n\nBryant fired at James Balasko, a U.S. citizen, hitting a nearby car. Balasko had been attempting to film the shooter. Many people, unable to use their parked cars, were hiding or running along Jetty Road and did not know where Bryant was because the gunfire was extremely loud and difficult to pinpoint.\n\nAt this time, Bryant had killed 26 people and injured 18.\n\n====Toll booth murders and carjacking====\n\nBryant then got back into his car and left the car park. Witnesses say he was sounding the horn and waving as he drove. Bryant drove along Jetty Road towards the toll booth where people were running away. Bryant passed by at least two people.\n\nAhead of him were Nanette Mikac and her children, Madeline, 3, and Alannah, 6.<ref name=\"massacre3\">{{Cite book|title=After Port Arthur |first=Carol |last=Altmann |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2006 |ISBN=1-74114-268-7 |chapter=The Massacre |pages=15\u201323}}</ref> Nanette was carrying Madeline, and Alannah was running slightly ahead. By this point, they had run approximately {{convert|600|metres|yd}} from the car park.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant opened his door and slowed down. Mikac moved towards the car, apparently thinking he was offering them help in escaping. Several more people witnessed this from further down the road. Someone recognised him as the gunman and yelled out \"It's him!\"<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant stepped out of the car, put his hand on Nanette Mikac's shoulder and told her to get on her knees.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> She did so, saying, \"Please don't hurt my babies\".<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant shot her in the temple, killing her. Next, he fired a shot at Madeline, which hit her in the shoulder, then shot her fatally through the chest.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant shot twice at Alannah, as she ran behind a tree, missing.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He then walked up, pressed the barrel of the gun into her neck and fired, killing her instantly.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nBryant fired at some people hiding in a bush, but missed. Having seen the murders of the children, some people further up the road began running. They told drivers of cars coming down the road to go back. The people thought Bryant would head up the road, so instead they proceeded on foot down a dirt side road and hid in the bush. The cars reversed up the road to the toll booth.\n\nBryant drove up to the toll booth, where there were several vehicles, and blocked a 1980 [[BMW 7 Series (E23)|BMW 7 Series]] owned by Mary Rose Nixon.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Inside were Nixon, driver Russell James Pollard and passengers Helene and Robert Graham Salzmann.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> An argument with Robert Salzmann ensued, and Bryant took out his rifle and shot Salzmann at point-blank range, killing him.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Pollard emerged from the BMW and went towards Bryant, who shot him in the chest, killing him.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> More cars then arrived, but seeing this, the drivers were quickly able to reverse back up the road. Bryant then moved to the BMW and pulled Nixon and Helene Salzmann from the car and shot them dead, dragging their bodies onto the road.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant transferred ammunition, handcuffs, the AR-15 rifle and a fuel container to the BMW. Mary Nixon, Russell Pollard, Helene Salzmann and Robert Salzmann are the people Bryant was charged with killing at the toll booth.<ref name=\"charges\">{{Cite web|title=The new charges against Bryant |url=http://www.geniac.net/portarthur/new.htm |date=9 July 1996 |publisher=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAnother car then came towards the toll booth and Bryant shot at it.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver, Graham Sutherland, was hit with glass. A second bullet hit the driver's door. Sutherland quickly reversed back up the road and left. Bryant then got into the BMW, leaving behind his [[Volvo 200 Series#History|Volvo 244]], including his [[USAS-12|Daewoo shotgun]] and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\n\nAt this point, Bryant had killed 33 and injured 19.\n\n====Service station murder and abduction====\nGraham Sutherland, who had just been shot at in his car, reversed back up the road and drove to the service station close by, where he tried to inform people what was happening. Bryant drove up to the service station and cut off a white [[Toyota Corolla]] that was attempting to exit onto the highway. Glenn Pears was driving, with girlfriend Zoe Hall in the passenger seat.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant quickly exited the car with his rifle in hand and tried to pull Hall from the car. Pears got out of the car and approached Bryant. Bryant pointed the gun at Pears and pushed him backwards, eventually directing him into the now open boot of the BMW, locking Pears inside.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nBryant then moved back to the passenger side of the Corolla as Hall attempted to climb over to the driver's seat.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Bryant raised his rifle and fired three shots, killing her.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Many people around the service station witnessed this and ran to hide in nearby bushland. The service station attendant told everyone to lie down and he locked the main doors. He grabbed his rifle, but by the time he could retrieve some ammunition and load his gun, Bryant had left in the BMW. A police officer arrived several minutes later and then set out in pursuit of Bryant.\n\nZoe Hall was the 34th victim killed.\n\n====Seascape roadway====\nAs Bryant drove down to Seascape, he shot at a red [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> Upon arriving at Seascape, he got out of his car. A [[Holden Frontera]] 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The car was going downhill so it was able to roll down the road out of sight around a corner, despite its broken throttle cable. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nAnother vehicle then drove down the road, carrying four people. It was not until they were almost adjacent to Bryant that they realised he was carrying a gun. Bryant shot at the car, smashing the windscreen. Douglas Horner was wounded by pieces of the windscreen.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The car proceeded ahead where White and Wanders tried to get in, but Horner did not realise the situation and drove on. When they saw that White had been shot, they came back and picked them up. Both parties then continued down to a local establishment called the Fox and Hound, where they called police.<ref name=\"massacre3\" />\n\nYet another car drove past and Bryant shot at it, hitting the passenger, Susan Williams, in the hand.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver, Simon Williams, was struck by fragments.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> The driver of another approaching vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, hitting it but not injuring anyone. Bryant then got back into the BMW and drove down the Seascape driveway to the house where the Martins, his first victims, lay dead.\n\nSometime after he stopped, Bryant removed Pears from the boot and handcuffed him to a stair rail within the house.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> At some point, he also set the BMW on fire.<ref name=\"massacre3\" /> He is believed to have arrived at the house by about 2:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n===29 April 1996===\n\n====Capture====\nBryant was captured the following morning, when a fire started in the guest house, presumably set by Bryant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/martin-bryant-235987|title=Martin Bryant|website=Biography}}</ref> Bryant taunted police to \"come and get him\", but the police, believing the hostage was already dead, decided that the fire would eventually bring Bryant out. Bryant eventually ran out of the house with his clothes on fire, suffering burns to his back and buttocks. He was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment.\n\nIt was discovered that Glenn Pears had been shot during or before the standoff and had died before the fire. The remains of the Martins were also found.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Port-Arthur-Massacre|title=Port Arthur Massacre - Background, Events, Aftermath, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> It was also determined they had been shot, and that Noelene Martin had suffered blunt-force trauma. They both died before the fire; witness accounts of the gunfire, as presented to the Supreme Court of Tasmania, place the time of death of David and Noelene Martin as being approximately noon on 28 April. One weapon was found burnt in the house, and the other on the roof of the adjacent building where police believed they had seen Bryant the night before. Both weapons had suffered from massive chamber blast pressure, possibly from the heat of the house fire.\n\n== Casualties ==\n=== Fatalities ===\nThe following is a list of those killed in the Port Arthur massacre.<ref name=\"charges\" />\n\n{| style=\"background-color: transparent; width: 100%;\"\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Winifred Joyce Aplin, 58\n* Walter John Bennett, 66\n* Nicole Louise Burgess, 17\n* Sou Leng Chung, 32\n* Elva Rhonda Gaylard, 48\n* Zoe Anne Hall, 28\n* Elizabeth Jayne Howard, 26\n* Mary Elizabeth Howard, 57\n* Mervyn John Howard, 55\n* Ronald Noel Jary, 71\n* Tony Vadivelu Kistan, 51\n* Leslie Dennis Lever, 53\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Sarah Kate Loughton, 15\n* David Martin, 72\n* Noelene \"Sally\" Joyce Martin, 69\n* Pauline Virjeana Masters, 49\n* Alannah Louise Mikac, 6\n* Madeline Grace Mikac, 3\n* Nanette Patricia Mikac, 36\n* Andrew Bruce Mills, 39\n* Peter Brenton Nash, 32\n* Gwenda Joan Neander, 67\n* William Xeeng Ng, 48\n* Anthony Nightingale, 44\n| width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Mary Rose Nixon, 60\n* Glenn Roy Pears, 35\n* Russell James Pollard, 72\n* Janette Kathleen Quin, 50\n* Helene Maria Salzmann, 50\n* Robert Graham Salzmann, 57\n* Kate Elizabeth Scott, 21\n* Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68\n* Raymond John Sharp, 67\n* Royce William Thompson, 59\n* Jason Bernard Winter, 29\n|}\n\n==Aftermath and analysis==\nThe Port Arthur tourist site reopened a few weeks later, and since then a new restaurant has been built.

The two communities exchanged items to place at their respective memorials.\n\nPaul Mullen, a forensic psychiatrist with extensive involvement following the string of massacres in Australia and New Zealand, attributes both the Port Arthur massacre and some of the earlier massacres to the [[copycat crime|copycat effect]].<ref>Mullen, Paul quoted in Hannon K 1997, \"Copycats to Blame for Massacres Says Expert\", Courier Mail, 4/3/1997</ref> In this theory the saturation media coverage provides both instruction and [[perverse incentive]]s for dysfunctional individuals to imitate previous crimes. In Tasmania, a coroner found that a report on the current affairs programme ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'', a few months earlier had guided one suicide, and may have helped create the expectation of a massacre.<ref>Hansen, Jane 1995. \"Tassie Guns\", A Current Affair 2 October 1995, featuring Roland Browne and Rebecca Peters of the Coalition for Gun Control.

The government initiated a mandatory \"buy-back\" scheme with the owners paid according to a table of valuations. Some 643,000 firearms were handed in at a cost of $350 million which was funded by a temporary increase in the [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] levy which raised $500 million.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514164739/http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Firearmsregulation_Frequentlyaskedquestions |archivedate=14 May 2011 |title=Firearms Regulations FAQ |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Firearmsregulation_Frequentlyaskedquestions |publisher=Attorney General's Department. |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> Media, activists, politicians and some family members of victims, notably [[Walter Mikac]] (who lost his wife and two children), spoke out in favour of the changes.\n\nMuch discussion has occurred as to the level of Bryant's [[mental health]]. At the time of the offences he was in receipt of a Disability Support [[Pension]] on the basis of being mentally handicapped. Media reports also detailed his odd behaviour as a child. He was able to drive a car and obtain a gun, despite lacking a gun licence or a driver's licence.<ref>When police questioned him as to why he didn't have a car licence, he replied. \"I didn't think I'd ever pass or get through the courses 'cos I'm not that bright.\"</ref><ref name=nedwoodtranscript>{{cite web |title=A Transcript Of The Police Interview With Martin Bryant |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~nedwood/transcript.html |publisher=Ned Wood}}</ref><ref name=loveforlifetranscript>{{Cite web |url=http://loveforlife.com.au/content/07/10/30/transcript-police-interview-martin-bryant |title=A Transcript Of The Police Interview With Martin Bryant |publisher=Love for Life}}</ref> This was a matter which, in the public debate that followed, was widely regarded as a telling demonstration of the inadequacy of the nation's gun laws.\n\n== Investigations ==\n[[Martin Bryant]], then 28, from [[New Town, Tasmania|New Town]], pleaded guilty to having carried out the shootings and was given 35 [[life sentence]]s without the possibility of [[parole]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Australian gunman laughs as he admits killing 35|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/07/australia/|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=November 7, 1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609141505/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/07/australia/|archivedate=9 June 2007}}</ref> Since 2015 he is imprisoned in the [[Risdon Prison Complex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/mass-murderer-martin-bryant-is-a-danger-to-front-line-jail-worker-says-police-officer-instrumental-in-arresting-him/story-fns0kb1g-1227525400242|title=Mass murderer Martin Bryant is a danger to front line jail workers, says police officer instrumental in arresting him|publisher=news.com|date=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Prosecution===\n{{See also|Martin Bryant#Imprisonment}}\n\nBryant was held in [[Royal Hobart Hospital]] under heavy police guard while awaiting trial.

He also claimed he did not take the BMW from the vicinity of the toll booth and that his hostage was taken from the BMW. He said that he thought the man he took hostage must have died in the boot when the car exploded. He did not distinguish between the car fire and the later house fire. Such discrepancies raise speculations that Bryant was either lying during the police interview or was mentally incapable of recalling events accurately. Bryant also claimed that the guns found by police were not his, but admitted to owning the shotgun that was found with his passport back in his own car near the toll booth.\n\nInitially Bryant pleaded not guilty to the 35 murders and did not provide a confession. Bryant changed his plea to guilty for a court hearing on 19 November 1996, where he was found guilty of all charges. The judge then ordered that all evidence for the case be sealed.\n\nOn 22 November, Bryant was sentenced to 35 sentences of life imprisonment for each count of murder and sentenced to 25 years for the remaining 36 charges on 5 other offences (20 attempted murders, 3 counts infliction of grievous bodily harm, the infliction of wounds upon a further 8 persons, 4 counts of aggravated assault and 1 count of unlawfully setting fire to property). All sentences are to be served concurrently <ref>P. Milgate, (et al), 'The Sentencing of Martin Bryant', Cambridge Legal Studies, Preliminary Second Edition, pp. 254-262. https://www.cambridge.edu.au/go/titles/Cambridge-Legal-Studies---Preliminary-Second-Edition:edition-2ed/</ref> in Hobart's Risdon Prison where he remains in solitary confinement, and is not permitted any visitors other than his immediate family. His prison papers indicate that he is never to be released, and he continues to serve his term without possibility of parole. This is very rare in Australia, where the majority of murder sentences allow for the possibility of parole after a long prison term.\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n[[Tasmanian Police]] records from the incident are in the care of the [[Tasmanian Archive and Heritage Office]].<ref name=\"ASA2018\">{{cite web |title=Session Abstracts |url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/speakers-ASA2018/session-abstracts#s5a |first1=Nicki |last1=Ottavi |publisher=[[Australian Society of Archivists]] |accessdate=26 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of massacres in Australia]]\n* [[Timeline of major crimes in Australia]]\n* [[List of events named massacres]]\n* [[List of disasters in Australia by death toll]]\n\n==References==\n<references>\n<!---->\n<ref name=SupremeCourtCase>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootersnews.addr.com/cttranscript.htm |title=THE QUEEN v.
