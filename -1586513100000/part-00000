The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters. The party should help the cabinet to be responsible for all economic affairs. Last year we made a new governmental system where the cabinet is supposed to be the control tower of the economy...No organizational unit should handle economic problems without consulting the cabinet\".<ref> Jae-Cheon Lim.

and [[executive body]] and a general state-management organ in the [[Government of North Korea]].<ref>Article 123 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The Cabinet's principal newspaper is ''[[Minju Choson]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Park Hon-youn and Ather 1949.jpg|thumb|The cabinet, headed by [[Kim Il-sung]], visiting [[Moscow]] in 1949]]\nIn North Korea's first constitution, adopted in 1948, the executive powers were vested in the Cabinet, chaired by [[Kim Il-sung]] himself. The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters. The party should help the cabinet to be responsible for all economic affairs. Last year we made a new governmental system where the cabinet is supposed to be the control tower of the economy...No organizational unit should handle economic problems without consulting the cabinet\".<ref> Jae-Cheon Lim.
