{"title_page": "Human trafficking in Indonesia", "text_new": "{{USgovtPOV|date=September 2008}}\n\n[[Indonesia]] is a source, transit, and destination country for women, children, and men [[human trafficking|trafficked]] for the purposes of commercial [[sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] and [[forced labor]]. The greatest threat of trafficking facing Indonesian men and women is that posed by conditions of forced labor and [[debt bondage]] in more developed [[Asia]]n countries and the [[Middle East]]. The government stopped permitting Indonesian women to travel to [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] as \u201ccultural performers,\u201d to curtail a practice that led to victims being trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. However, in 2007 traffickers increasingly used [[false documents]], including [[passport]]s, to obtain [[tourist visa]]s for women and girls who are subsequently forced into [[prostitution]] in Japan, through the unlawful exploitation of recruitment debts as high as $20,000 each. Trafficking of young girls to [[Taiwan]] as brides, mainly from [[West Kalimantan]], persisted. Traffickers use false [[marriage license]]s and other false documentation in order to obtain visas and subsequently force the women and girls into prostitution. Women from the [[People\u2019s Republic of China]], [[Thailand]], and [[Eastern Europe]] are trafficked to Indonesia for commercial sexual exploitation, although the numbers are small compared with the number of Indonesians trafficked for this purpose. A significant number of Indonesian men and women who migrate overseas each year to work in the [[construction]], [[agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], and [[domestic service]] sectors are subjected to conditions of forced labor or debt bondage in [[Malaysia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iraq]], [[Singapore]], Taiwan, [[Hong Kong]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Syria]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Malaysia and Saudi Arabia are the top destinations for legal and illegal Indonesian migrant workers who are trafficked for domestic servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, and forced labor. Some labor recruitment companies, known as [[PJTKI]]s, operated similarly to trafficking rings, luring both male and female workers into debt bondage, involuntary servitude, and other trafficking situations. Some workers, often women intending to migrate, entered trafficking and trafficking-like situations during their attempt to find work abroad through licensed and unlicensed PJTKIs. These labor recruiters charged workers high commission fees\u2014up to $3,000\u2014which are not regulated under Indonesian law and often require workers to incur debt to pay, leaving them vulnerable in some instances to situations of debt bondage. PJTKIs also reportedly withheld the documents of some workers, and confined them in holding centers, sometimes for periods of many months. Some PJTKIs also used threats of violence to maintain control over prospective migrant workers. Recruitment agencies routinely falsified birth dates, including for children, in order to apply for passports and migrant worker documents. Internal trafficking is a significant problem in Indonesia with women and children exploited in domestic servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, rural agriculture, mining, fishing, and cottage industries. Women and girls are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation in Malaysia, Singapore, and throughout Indonesia. Indonesians are recruited with offers of jobs in restaurants, factories, or as domestics and then forced into the sex trade. Young women and girls are trafficked throughout Indonesia and via the [[Riau Islands]], [[Kalimantan]], and [[Sulawesi]] to Malaysia and Singapore. [[Malaysian people|Malaysians]] and [[Singaporean people|Singaporeans]] constitute the largest number of [[sex tourists]], and the Riau Islands and surrounding areas operate a \u201cprostitution economy,\u201d according to local officials. Sex tourism is rampant in most [[urban area|urban]] areas and tourist destinations. A 2006 bilateral MOU between the [[Indonesian government|Indonesian]] and [[Malaysian government]]s, governing the employment of an estimated one million Indonesian domestic workers in Malaysia, failed to provide adequate protection to Indonesian migrant workers and explicitly endorsed a practice that is widely seen as a potential facilitator of forced labor\u2014the right of Malaysian employers to hold the passports of Indonesian workers. This agreement has not been amended to offer protections from forced labor conditions.<ref name=dos >[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2008''].

While the government made clear progress in bringing sex trafficking offenders to justice, in part through use of its new anti-trafficking law, a pronounced weakness shown was the failure to curb the large-scale trafficking practices of licensed and unlicensed Indonesian labor agencies.

Through that new law, Indonesia prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons, prescribing penalties of three to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as [[rape]]. Police and prosecutors began using the new anti-trafficking law during the reporting period; however, other laws were still used in cases pending widespread implementation of the new law. For the second year in a row, law enforcement efforts against traffickers increased in 2007 over 2006: arrests increased 77 percent from 142 to 252, prosecutions increased 94 percent from 56 to 109, and convictions increased 27 percent from 36 to 46. These law enforcement actions were mainly against traffickers for commercial sexual exploitation. The average sentence given to convicted trafficking offenders was 45 months. Police in late 2007 cooperated with the Manpower Ministry to shut down a manpower company that was trafficking workers, rescuing over a hundred persons, including children, and arresting staff on charges of document falsification. The 21-man national police anti-trafficking task force worked with local police, the Ministry of Manpower, the Migrant Workers Protection Agency, Immigration, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and [[NGOs]] to shut down several large trafficking syndicates. The ongoing two-part \u201cOperation Flower,\u201d which began in March 2007, targeted trafficked children, primarily in commercial sexual exploitation. This operation shut down large operations in [[red-light districts]] of [[Jakarta]], [[the Riau Islands]], [[Central Java|Central]] and [[West Java]], and elsewhere, arresting dozens of [[pimps]] and rescuing dozens of children. Separately, local police in [[North Sumatra]], [[South Sulawesi]], [[Bali]], [[Lombok]], and West Kalimantan broke up trafficking syndicates. Some individual members of the security forces reportedly engaged in or facilitated trafficking, particularly by providing protection to brothels and prostitution fronts in discos, karaoke bars, and hotels, or by receiving bribes to turn a blind eye. In [[Sorong, Papua]], local police reportedly honored the debt bondage of underage girls prostituted in local brothels as legitimate work contracts, and they pledged to enforce these terms. Although police in other areas of the country were often aware of children in commercial sexual exploitation or other trafficking situations, they frequently did not intervene to protect victims or arrest probable traffickers without specific complaints submitted by third parties. In 2007, several senior law enforcement officials complicit in trafficking were investigated for corruption, reprimanded, or transferred to less sensitive positions. There were no reports of Indonesian security forces prosecuting or disciplining their own members for involvement in prostitution or other activities related to trafficking. National Police reported arresting and prosecuting at least three immigration officials at key transit points. In May 2007, a former consul general in [[Johor Bahru]], Malaysia, was found guilty of graft for overcharging for passport fees and sentenced to two years in prison. In January 2008, a former [[Indonesian ambassador to Malaysia]] was sentenced to 30 months in jail for corruption in the collection of migration document fees. The Corruption Eradication Commission\u2019s prosecution team indicted a former senior Manpower Ministry official and a current Manpower official on corruption in relation to an audit of funds for foreign workers in Indonesia; both face 20-year jail terms.<ref name=dos />\n\n==Protection==\nIndonesia demonstrated measured improvement at national and local levels to protect victims of trafficking in Indonesia and abroad; however, available victim services remain overwhelmed by the large number of victims. Indonesia\u2019s policy is not to detain or imprison trafficking victims. Police implementation of this policy varies in practice. Local police often arrested women and children in prostitution, including trafficking victims, who operated outside recognized prostitution zones on charges of violating public order. The Government encourages victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases. Authorities continued to round up and deport a small number of foreign women in prostitution without determining whether they were victims of trafficking. The Foreign Ministry operated shelters for trafficking victims and migrant workers at its embassies and consulates abroad. In 2007, these diplomatic establishments sheltered thousands of Indonesian citizens, including trafficking victims. The Social Affairs Ministry Directorate of Social Assistance for Victims of Violence and Migrant Workers assisted victims returning from overseas by providing medical care, return and rehabilitation services. The Government provides some assistance, including limited medical aid, shelter, and financial help to its repatriated nationals who were trafficking victims. The Indonesian government provided some funding to domestic NGOs and civil society groups that supported services for trafficking victims. Work on finishing national guidelines for services to trafficked persons, through another revision of the Standard Operating Procedures for Return, Recovery and Reintegration of Trafficking Victims and a new regulation on standard minimum services met with little progress following passage of the anti-trafficking law.<ref name=dos />\n\n==Prevention==\nThe Indonesian government continued efforts to promote awareness and prevent trafficking in persons. The government continued collaboration with numerous NGO and international organization efforts to raise awareness and prevent trafficking in persons. In 2007, the [[East Java provincial government]]                                                                                         collaborated with [[NGO]]s to formulate guidance on how to deal with trafficking cases. The Nusa Tenggara Barat province\u2019s Legal Aid Association provided legal assistance to five villages in East Lombok to help formulate village regulations regarding the recruitment of migrant workers. The North Sulawesi Department of Religious Affairs established a counseling center in 2007 to provide religious counseling to victims of trafficking and those at risk. Media coverage of trafficking, both domestic and international, expanded with national television, radio and print media, and local newspapers routinely covering trafficking cases. The [[Government of Indonesia]] had not yet formed a national task force on trafficking, although this is mandated. The Government also failed to develop a second National Plan of Action to combat trafficking in persons, despite the fact that Indonesia\u2019s first National Plan of Action expired at the end of December 2007. Apart from occasional raids on brothels or fronts for prostitution, there were no reported activities to reduce demand for commercial sex acts. There were no public awareness campaigns on reducing demand for commercial sex acts or sex tourism. However, Indonesia cooperated with [[Australia]] in the investigations of [[Australian people|Australian nationals]] victimizing children for [[child sex tourism]] in Bali. Indonesian police similarly cooperated actively with U.S. law enforcement to arrest and expel [[People of the United States|American]] [[pedophile]]s [[sexually abusing]] children. Indonesian security forces participating in peacekeeping initiatives abroad received training on sexual exploitation and trafficking in persons prior to deployment. Indonesia has not ratified the [[2000 UN TIP Protocol]].<ref name=dos />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Crime in Indonesia]]\n*[[Human rights in Indonesia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Human trafficking in}}\n\n[[Category:Human trafficking in Indonesia| ]]\n[[Category:Human trafficking by country|Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Human trafficking in Oceania|Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Human trafficking in Asia|Indonesia]]\n", "text_old": "{{USgovtPOV|date=September 2008}}\n\n[[Indonesia]] is a source, transit, and destination country for women, children, and men [[human trafficking|trafficked]] for the purposes of commercial [[sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] and [[forced labor]].

In May 2007, a former consul general in [[Johor Bahru]], Malaysia, was found guilty of graft for overcharging for passport fees and sentenced to two years in prison. In January 2008, a former [[Indonesian ambassador to Malaysia]] was sentenced to 30 months in jail for corruption in the collection of migration document fees. The Corruption Eradication Commission\u2019s prosecution team indicted a former senior Manpower Ministry official and a current Manpower official on corruption in relation to an audit of funds for foreign workers in Indonesia; both face 20-year jail terms.<ref name=dos />\n\n==Protection==\nIndonesia demonstrated measured improvement at national and local levels to protect victims of trafficking in Indonesia and abroad; however, available victim services remain overwhelmed by the large number of victims. Indonesia\u2019s policy is not to detain or imprison trafficking victims. Police implementation of this policy varies in practice. Local police often arrested women and children in prostitution, including trafficking victims, who operated outside recognized prostitution zones on charges of violating public order. The Government encourages victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases. Authorities continued to round up and deport a small number of foreign women in prostitution without determining whether they were victims of trafficking. The Foreign Ministry operated shelters for trafficking victims and migrant workers at its embassies and consulates abroad. In 2007, these diplomatic establishments sheltered thousands of Indonesian citizens, including trafficking victims. The Social Affairs Ministry Directorate of Social Assistance for Victims of Violence and Migrant Workers assisted victims returning from overseas by providing medical care, return and rehabilitation services. The Government provides some assistance, including limited medical aid, shelter, and financial help to its repatriated nationals who were trafficking victims. The Indonesian government provided some funding to domestic NGOs and civil society groups that supported services for trafficking victims. Work on finishing national guidelines for services to trafficked persons, through another revision of the Standard Operating Procedures for Return, Recovery and Reintegration of Trafficking Victims and a new regulation on standard minimum services met with little progress following passage of the anti-trafficking law.<ref name=dos />\n\n==Prevention==\nThe Indonesian government continued efforts to promote awareness and prevent trafficking in persons. The government continued collaboration with numerous NGO and international organization efforts to raise awareness and prevent trafficking in persons. In 2007, the [[East Java provincial government]]                                                                                         collaborated with [[NGO]]s to formulate guidance on how to deal with trafficking cases. The Nusa Tenggara Barat province\u2019s Legal Aid Association provided legal assistance to five villages in East Lombok to help formulate village regulations regarding the recruitment of migrant workers. The North Sulawesi Department of Religious Affairs established a counseling center in 2007 to provide religious counseling to victims of trafficking and those at risk. Media coverage of trafficking, both domestic and international, expanded with national television, radio and print media, and local newspapers routinely covering trafficking cases. The [[Government of Indonesia]] had not yet formed a national task force on trafficking, although this is mandated. The Government also failed to develop a second National Plan of Action to combat trafficking in persons, despite the fact that Indonesia\u2019s first National Plan of Action expired at the end of December 2007. Apart from occasional raids on brothels or fronts for prostitution, there were no reported activities to reduce demand for commercial sex acts. There were no public awareness campaigns on reducing demand for commercial sex acts or sex tourism. However, Indonesia cooperated with [[Australia]] in the investigations of [[Australian people|Australian nationals]] victimizing children for [[child sex tourism]] in Bali. Indonesian police similarly cooperated actively with U.S. law enforcement to arrest and expel [[People of the United States|American]] [[pedophile]]s [[sexually abusing]] children. Indonesian security forces participating in peacekeeping initiatives abroad received training on sexual exploitation and trafficking in persons prior to deployment. Indonesia has not ratified the [[2000 UN TIP Protocol]].<ref name=dos />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Crime in Indonesia]]\n*[[Human rights in Indonesia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Human trafficking in}}\n\n[[Category:Human trafficking in Indonesia| ]]\n[[Category:Human trafficking by country|Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Human trafficking in Oceania|Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Human trafficking in Asia|Indonesia]]\n", "name_user": "Wikipedianuhai", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSex Trafficking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Indonesia"}

The show moved to Disney's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network and new seasons aired as a part of its ''[[ABC Kids (TV programming block)|One Saturday Morning]]'' block as ''Disney's Doug''. In 1999, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released a film finale to the series, ''[[Doug's 1st Movie]]''.\n\n===Nickelodeon Movies (1996\u201398)===\nNickelodeon Movies was then founded in 1996. On July 10, 1996, the studio released its first film, ''[[Harriet the Spy (film)|Harriet the Spy]]'', a spy-comedy film based on the 1964 [[Harriet the Spy|novel of the same name]].\n\nOn July 25, 1997, the studio then released another film, ''[[Good Burger]]'', a comedy film, starring [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Kel Mitchell]], [[Abe Vigoda]], [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]], [[Shar Jackson]], [[Josh Server]], [[Lori Beth Denberg]], [[Jan Schweiterman]], [[Linda Cardellini]] and [[Sinbad]].

The success of ''Rango'' led Paramount to create its own animation studio, [[Paramount Animation]].\n\n9 months later, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies partnered with [[Columbia Pictures]] once again and released ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'', a performance-captured animated [[3D film]], directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and produced by [[Peter Jackson]], based on three of the [[The Adventures of Tintin|comic book series of the same name]] by [[Herg\u00e9]], ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'' (1941), ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' (1943), and ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]'' (1944). This film was released in 3D and [[IMAX]] 3D theaters, as well normal \"2D\" theaters, and earned $77,591,831 in North America and $296,402,120 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $373,993,951.<ref name=\"Box office\">{{cite web|title=The Adventures of Tintin|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=tintin.htm|access-date=April 13, 2012}}</ref> It also was studio's first animated film to be shown in 3D. [[John Williams]], the composer for the film, was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. This film became the first non-[[Pixar]] film to win a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]], and is the first Nickelodeon film to do so.\n\nOn February 28, 2012, a sequel to ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'' titled ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' was announced to be in production, and was scheduled to be released in 2015.{{Update inline|date=January 2016}}\n[[Philippe Dauman]], the president and CEO of the studio's parent company [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], told sources:<ref name=HollyWood />\n<blockquote>\n\"We will be releasing a ''SpongeBob'' movie at the end of 2014, which will serve to start off or be one of our films that starts off our new animation effort.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nDauman also once again said that the Paramount animation productions will be a new opportunity for his company as they will each cost less than $100 million, and the animation unit will only have 30 to 40 people, allowing for good financial returns and profits. Thanks to modern technology, the films still look \"great\" despite the lower cost, he said. He also lauded his studio team for winning an animation Oscar for ''Rango'', the studio's first fully owned CGI effort. \"We're very proud of that,\" he said.<ref name=HollyWood>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Daniel|title=Paramount to Release 'SpongeBob' Movie in Late 2014|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/viacom-paramount-release-spongebob-movie-late-2014-philippe-dauman295695|access-date=February 28, 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Levine|first=Daniel|title=Paramount announces plans to release second 'Spongebob Squarepants' film in 2014|url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/feature/2012/02/paramount-announces-plans-release-second-spongebob-squarepants-film-2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719160413/http://thecelebritycafe.com/feature/2012/02/paramount-announces-plans-release-second-spongebob-squarepants-film-2014|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 19, 2013|access-date=October 5, 2012|newspaper=TheCelebrityCafe.com|date=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe sequel was directed by [[Paul Tibbitt]], written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger]], produced by [[Mary Parent]], and executive-produced by the series' creator, [[Stephen Hillenburg]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Graser|first1=Marc|last2=Kroll|first2=Justin|title=Paramount ramping up animation slate|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118057934|access-date=August 17, 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=August 16, 2012}}</ref> The series' cast members reprised their roles from the first film.<ref>WN.com; [http://article.wn.com/view/2012/03/04/SpongeBob_SquarePants_Film_Planned_for_2014/ The main voice actors of the 2004 film will reprise their role in the 2014 film]</ref> The sequel was animated using the same animation style ([[traditional animation]]) as [[SpongeBob SquarePants|the TV show was]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billdesowitz.com/spongebob-kicks-off-new-paramount-ani-division/|title=SpongeBob Kicks Off New Paramount Ani Division|work=billdesowitz.com|access-date=February 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, following the news of the [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] buyout of the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' franchise, it was announced that Nickelodeon would produce [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|a new film]] through Paramount Pictures with an expected release date sometime in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://michaelbay.com/blog/files/a64c818a1f8c52bc7b6c741c91e71e33-761.php|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120401181721/http://www.michaelbay.com/blog/files/a64c818a1f8c52bc7b6c741c91e71e33-761.php|url-status= dead|archive-date= April 1, 2012|title= 'Ninja Turtles' Title|last= Bay|first= Michael|publisher= Michael Bay Dot Com|date= March 27, 2012|access-date= March 27, 2012|df= mdy-all}}</ref> In late May 2011, it was announced that Paramount and Nickelodeon had brought Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes partners Brad Fuller and Andrew Form on to produce the next film that would reboot the film series.<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/08/paramount-hires-marcum-holloway-for-fast-tracked-ninja-turtles-as-next-big-franchise/|title=Paramount Revs Up 'Ninja Turtles' Reboot|author=Nikki Finke|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 18, 2015|date=August 20, 2010}}</ref> Bay, Fuller, and Form would produce alongside Walker and Mednick.

Founded in 1995, the company released its first film ''[[Harriet the Spy (film)|Harriet the Spy]]'' in 1996. It has produced family features and films based on Nickelodeon programs, as well as other adaptations and original projects. Its films are co-produced and/or distributed by fellow [[ViacomCBS]] division [[Paramount Pictures]]. The studio's highest-grossing films are ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2014), which grossed $493.3 million worldwide, ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (2011),<ref name=\"Box office\"/> which grossed $374 million worldwide, and ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' (2015), which grossed $323.4 million worldwide.\n\n==History==\n===Nickelodeon/20th Century Fox deal (1993\u201395)===\nIn 1993, Nickelodeon forged a 2-year contract with [[20th Century Fox]] to make feature films.

With the creative differences with [[John Kricfalusi]], the creator of ''Ren & Stimpy'' and an inability to market that property in a family-friendly manner instead of a \"cynical and gross humor\" scuttled that film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-05-19/business/9305190485_1_beece-production-facilities-nick|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=May 19, 1993|author=Catherine Hinman|title=Nickelodeon Adds Movies To Its Credits|access-date=January 18, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1993\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=May 1993|author=Thomas R King|title=Nickelodeon, Fox Film, chase family viewers}}</ref> However, Paramount and Viacom would go forward and start development on ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'' a year after the acquisition.\n\nThe Nickelodeon version of the ''Doug'' film was not made due to the acquisition of the show's production studio, [[Jumbo Pictures]], by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1996. The show moved to Disney's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network and new seasons aired as a part of its ''[[ABC Kids (TV programming block)|One Saturday Morning]]'' block as ''Disney's Doug''. In 1999, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released a film finale to the series, ''[[Doug's 1st Movie]]''.\n\n===Nickelodeon Movies (1996\u201398)===\nNickelodeon Movies was then founded in 1996. On July 10, 1996, the studio released its first film, ''[[Harriet the Spy (film)|Harriet the Spy]]'', a spy-comedy film based on the 1964 [[Harriet the Spy|novel of the same name]].\n\nOn July 25, 1997, the studio then released another film, ''[[Good Burger]]'', a comedy film, starring [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Kel Mitchell]], [[Abe Vigoda]], [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]], [[Shar Jackson]], [[Josh Server]], [[Lori Beth Denberg]], [[Jan Schweiterman]], [[Linda Cardellini]] and [[Sinbad]]. It was based on the ''Good Burger'' sketch on Nickelodeon's popular sketch comedy series ''[[All That]]''.\n\nOn November 20, 1998, the studio released ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'', Nickelodeon Movies' first animated film and the first Nicktoon to be shown in theaters.

Westminster John Knox Press. p 665.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\nWoodbey was born into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in [[Johnson County, Tennessee]], to Charles and Rachel Woodbey. Little is known about his childhood, though it is reported that he learned to read at a young age. Following the conclusion of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Woodbey made his way to [[Emporia, Kansas]] and was ordained a [[Baptist]] minister in 1874. He ministered in churches in [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]] and [[Missouri]].<ref name=\"Reverend George W. Woodbey\">[http://blackpast.org/?q=aah/woodbey-george-washington-1854 \"Reverend George W. Woodbey\"] Blackpast, Retrieved 4/26/08</ref><ref>Miller, S.M. (2003) \" For White Men Only: The Socialist Party of America and Issues of Gender, Ethnicity and Race\", ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era'', vol. 2;3</ref>\n\nWoodbey became active in the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and by the 1880s became interested in social reform.  In Omaha he joined the [[Prohibition Party]] and ran on their ticket for [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nebraska|Lieutenant Governor of Nebraska]] in 1890. He was Nebraska's Prohibition Party's candidate for Congress in 1894.<ref name=\"Reverend George W. Woodbey\"/>\n\nIn the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 Presidential campaigns]], Woodbey supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]] of Nebraska.  During this period Woodbey became familiar with the ideas of [[Eugene Debs]], a labor organizer and future five-time Socialist candidate for president. The Democratic Party invited Woodbey to deliver speeches, but then cut him off because he was too strongly socialist.\n\n===Socialist===\nWoodbey became a member of the Socialist Party. He never took the Socialist Party to task on the question of race, even after his own nomination for vice presidential candidate was met with only one vote.  Woodbey believed the Socialist Party could help solve [[Racism in the United States|racial problems in the United States]] because of its emphasis on economic changes to the system. Woodbey also saw the struggle for socialism as an extension of the struggle against slavery: as the Civil War had ended [[Slavery#Chattel slavery|chattel slavery]], so would the replacement of capitalism with socialism abolish [[wage slavery]]. Woodbey directly compared the means of repression used to discipline slaves and the working class, stating: \"In the days of chattel slavery the masters had a patrol force to keep the negroes in their place and protect the interests of the masters. Today the capitalists use the police for the same purpose\".<ref name=jacobin />\n\nWoodbey also noted the emergence of [[class stratification]] among the black community, and expressed skepticism regarding relying on upper-class black leadership in the fight against racism, noting that whilst many believed \"the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few Negroes will solve this problem... a few white men have all the wealth and the rest of their brothers are getting poorer every day\". Like [[Eugene Debs]], he was also notable for his opposition to the [[Nativism (politics)#United States|anti-immigrant sentiments]] that were commonplace in the American labor movement and the Socialist Party at the time.<ref name=jacobin>{{cite web |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/04/socialism-marx-race-class-struggle-color-line |title=Socialism and Black Oppression |last=Heideman |first=Paul |date=30 April 2018 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe promoted the causes of socialism across California and was recognized as one of the great socialist orators of the time. His ability to bring his message to the common man made him a reputation on the streets. On one occasion, Woodbey was denied access to a restaurant due to his race. He turned the situation around by putting together a successful boycott of the restaurant and hotel with the help of socialist comrades.<ref>Foner, P.S. (1977) ''American Socialism and Black Americans From the Age of Jackson to World War II.'' Greenwood Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1902 Woodbey moved to San Diego, where he was pastor of Mt. Zion Baptist Church.  He served on the executive board of the [[Socialist Party of California]], and traveled around the state in his work.  He believed that the socialist message of helping the poor was consistent with his Christian beliefs.<ref name=\"blackpast.org\">[http://blackpast.org/?q=aah/woodbey-george-washington-1854 \"Reverend George W. Woodbey\"], Blackpast, Retrieved 4/26/08</ref>\n\nBecause of the inflammatory nature of his message, Woodbey was in and out of jail for several years. In 1905, after one particular incident, the police hospitalized the orator. He organized a protest and went to the county jail to lodge a formal complaint. His complaint was met by being physically thrown from the building. Woodbey would then press charges of assault and battery on the officer. The case was taken to court and a jury found the defendant not guilty. The verdict was not what Woodbey was looking for, but it gave him an unexpected boost with the community. The event also allowed him to demonize the police as shills for the capitalist machine.<ref>Philip S. Foner (ed.), ''Black Socialist Preacher: The Teachings of Reverend George Washington Woodbey and His Disciple, Reverend G. W. Slater, Jr.'' San Francisco: Synthesis, 1983.</ref>\n\n===Political ideas===\nGeorge Washington Woodbey published several works on the ideas of socialism, one of which is ''What to do and how to do it'' published in 1903. The purpose of this pamphlet was to reach out to those citizens who didn't understand socialism's ideals or how those ideals might be implemented once socialism was adopted by the American people. Woodbey was a natural orator, and this pamphlet was a response to a request for a written collective of his socialist talks. Woodbey uses a visit to his mother after a 17-year absence to structure the pamphlet and give it a more approachable tone that an everyday person could understand. Woodbey makes it clear immediately that his [[Christian socialism|socialist beliefs are all related to the Christian teachings]] of the [[Bible]], not in conflict with them as many Christians believed at the time, by citing [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] just in the Introduction. \nHis teachings are all based on the Christian belief that as God made the Earth and everything on it for the purpose of human use and survival; it and everything on it therefore belongs to the human race as a whole and cannot be owned or sold. However he also makes it clear that one does not have to be Christian to be socialist or vis versa, because people of all creeds can at the very least agree that humans rely on the Earth for survival. He goes on to support freedom of religion for all people.\n\nWoodbey describes the major flaw in capitalism as people paying for what they have already earned through work. As all people have a right to the Earth and its resources, paying another person rent for the ability to live on Earth that is already rightfully theirs is wrong. He cites philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] in support of not owning or selling land.\n\nWoodbey argues that capital, like the tools and machines for work, is created by labor, so a capitalist who is not producing anything for society but rather exploiting the production of the laborers is further separating the classes of society so that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, further dividing society. Capitalism also creates an economy in which a limited number of individuals can be successful. Saving one's wages could be a way to better their station in society, but as the economy is powered by spending, saving is not effective if the majority do it because it eliminates the market for what they are producing.\n\nIn the next section of the pamphlet, Woodbey explains the goals of the socialist party. In a socialist society, all people would work together, all owning equally land, machines, tools, and roads so that none would need to pay for what their labor produced. It's like a family who runs a farm and does not need to pay for the food they produce because they've already paid for it through work, just on a much larger scale. Woodbey lists four things that socialists want:\n\n# All people to have equal interest in the land because all people need the Earth to survive.\n# All people to own the tools with which they do work. Tools are defined as everything from a screwdriver to a large manufacturing facility.\n# All people to own equally all modes of transportation both for themselves and their goods.\n# The working class to make all the laws over industry by direct vote.\n\nThe existence of these four things in society would create a society that celebrates the labors of the working class and recognizes their importance. The over-all equality between people in the socialist system is something that ties racial issues very close to socialism. Woodbey felt that a system of total equality would have helped African-Americans to obtain the freedoms and justice that they were denied.\nWoodbey argued that at the time of publication, socialism was going through a period of agitation in which many intelligent socialists were spreading the ideals and goals of socialism to create more socialists. He predicted that socialism would grow tremendously and influence governments all over the world.<ref>Foner, Philip S. \"Reverend George Washington Woodbey: Early Twentieth Century Black Socialist\", Journal of Negro History. 1976, Vol. 61 Issue 2, p. 136-157.</ref>\n\nHe describes a socialist government as needing very few laws. He argues that with equal ownership and concern for society's production, men would no longer be swayed to illegal acts for monetary gain. He proposes a system in which any citizen can propose a law, and with enough support (he suggests 5% of the population) [[Initiative|the law would be presented for vote]]. If a majority were in support of it, it would become a law. Woodbey does not mention or distinguish between State and Federal government in this section. Giving each worker equal interest and shareholding in the industries in which they work creates less demand for bosses and management chains, thereby creating more laborers. Woodbey envisions a society in which, given these parameters, the majority would vote in favor of equal distribution of goods to all citizens given that all citizens are equal owners. He also envisions a severe drop in all criminal activity, and a schooling system that prepares men and women for their positions in specific industries. With equal opportunities among the people, the differences between people would disappear and rid the society of prejudice. Any citizen who does not follow the laws passed by the majority of voters would be forced to go without a living.<ref>Foner, Philip S.

Slater took the mantle of Socialism from Woodbey and continued to teach and preach his message as a disciple of the Socialist movement.<ref>Philip S.

Westminster John Knox Press. p 665.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\nWoodbey was born into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in [[Johnson County, Tennessee]], to Charles and Rachel Woodbey. Little is known about his childhood, though it is reported that he learned to read at a young age. Following the conclusion of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Woodbey made his way to [[Emporia, Kansas]] and was ordained a [[Baptist]] minister in 1874. He ministered in churches in [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]] and [[Missouri]].<ref name=\"Reverend George W. Woodbey\">[http://blackpast.org/?q=aah/woodbey-george-washington-1854 \"Reverend George W.

In Omaha he joined the [[Prohibition Party]] and ran on their ticket for [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nebraska|Lieutenant Governor of Nebraska]] in 1890. He was Nebraska's Prohibition Party's candidate for Congress in 1894.<ref name=\"Reverend George W. Woodbey\"/>\n\nIn the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 Presidential campaigns]], Woodbey supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]] of Nebraska.  During this period Woodbey became familiar with the ideas of [[Eugene Debs]], a labor organizer and future five-time Socialist candidate for President. The Democratic Party invited Woodbey to deliver speeches, but then cut him off because he was too strongly socialist.\n\n===Socialist===\nWoodbey became a member of the Socialist Party. He never took the Socialist Party to task on the question of race, even after his own nomination for Vice Presidential candidate was met with only one vote.  Woodbey believed the Socialist Party could help solve [[Racism in the United States|racial problems in the United States]] because of its emphasis on economic changes to the system. Woodbey also saw the struggle for socialism as an extension of the struggle against slavery: as the Civil War had ended [[Slavery#Chattel slavery|chattel slavery]], so would the replacement of capitalism with socialism abolish [[wage slavery]]. Woodbey directly compared the means of repression used to discipline slaves and the working class, stating: \"In the days of chattel slavery the masters had a patrol force to keep the negroes in their place and protect the interests of the masters. Today the capitalists use the police for the same purpose\".<ref name=jacobin />\n\nWoodbey also noted the emergence of [[class stratification]] among the black community, and expressed skepticism regarding relying on upper-class black leadership in the fight against racism, noting that whilst many believed \"the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few Negroes will solve this problem... a few white men have all the wealth and the rest of their brothers are getting poorer every day\". Like [[Eugene Debs]], he was also notable for his opposition to the [[Nativism (politics)#United States|anti-immigrant sentiments]] that were commonplace in the American labor movement and the Socialist Party at the time.<ref name=jacobin>{{cite web |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/04/socialism-marx-race-class-struggle-color-line |title=Socialism and Black Oppression |last=Heideman |first=Paul |date=30 April 2018 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe promoted the causes of socialism across California and was recognized as one of the great socialist orators of the time. His ability to bring his message to the common man made him a reputation on the streets. On one occasion, Woodbey was denied access to a restaurant due to his race. He turned the situation around by putting together a successful boycott of the restaurant and hotel with the help of socialist comrades.<ref>Foner, P.S. (1977) ''American Socialism and Black Americans From the Age of Jackson to World War II.'' Greenwood Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1902 Woodbey moved to San Diego, where he was pastor of Mt. Zion Baptist Church.  He served on the executive board of the [[Socialist Party of California]], and traveled around the state in his work.  He believed that the socialist message of helping the poor was consistent with his Christian beliefs.<ref name=\"blackpast.org\">[http://blackpast.org/?q=aah/woodbey-george-washington-1854 \"Reverend George W. Woodbey\"], Blackpast, Retrieved 4/26/08</ref>\n\nBecause of the inflammatory nature of his message, Woodbey was in and out of jail for several years. In 1905, after one particular incident, the police hospitalized the orator. He organized a protest and went to the county jail to lodge a formal complaint. His complaint was met by being physically thrown from the building. Woodbey would then press charges of assault and battery on the officer. The case was taken to court and a jury found the defendant not guilty. The verdict was not what Woodbey was looking for, but it gave him an unexpected boost with the community. The event also allowed him to demonize the police as shills for the capitalist machine.<ref>Philip S. Foner (ed.), ''Black Socialist Preacher: The Teachings of Reverend George Washington Woodbey and His Disciple, Reverend G. W. Slater, Jr.'' San Francisco: Synthesis, 1983.</ref>\n\n===Political ideas===\nGeorge Washington Woodbey published several works on the ideas of socialism, one of which is ''What to do and how to do it'' published in 1903. The purpose of this pamphlet was to reach out to those citizens who didn't understand socialism's ideals or how those ideals might be implemented once socialism was adopted by the American people. Woodbey was a natural orator, and this pamphlet was a response to a request for a written collective of his socialist talks. Woodbey uses a visit to his mother after a 17-year absence to structure the pamphlet and give it a more approachable tone that an everyday person could understand. Woodbey makes it clear immediately that his [[Christian socialism|socialist beliefs are all related to the Christian teachings]] of the [[Bible]], not in conflict with them as many Christians believed at the time, by citing [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] just in the Introduction. \nHis teachings are all based on the Christian belief that as God made the Earth and everything on it for the purpose of human use and survival; it and everything on it therefore belongs to the human race as a whole and cannot be owned or sold. However he also makes it clear that one does not have to be Christian to be socialist or vis versa, because people of all creeds can at the very least agree that humans rely on the Earth for survival. He goes on to support freedom of religion for all people.\n\nWoodbey describes the major flaw in capitalism as people paying for what they have already earned through work. As all people have a right to the Earth and its resources, paying another person rent for the ability to live on Earth that is already rightfully theirs is wrong. He cites philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] in support of not owning or selling land.\n\nWoodbey argues that capital, like the tools and machines for work, is created by labor, so a capitalist who is not producing anything for society but rather exploiting the production of the laborers is further separating the classes of society so that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, further dividing society. Capitalism also creates an economy in which a limited number of individuals can be successful. Saving one's wages could be a way to better their station in society, but as the economy is powered by spending, saving is not effective if the majority do it because it eliminates the market for what they are producing.\n\nIn the next section of the pamphlet, Woodbey explains the goals of the socialist party. In a socialist society, all people would work together, all owning equally land, machines, tools, and roads so that none would need to pay for what their labor produced. It's like a family who runs a farm and does not need to pay for the food they produce because they've already paid for it through work, just on a much larger scale. Woodbey lists four things that socialists want:\n\n# All people to have equal interest in the land because all people need the Earth to survive.\n# All people to own the tools with which they do work. Tools are defined as everything from a screwdriver to a large manufacturing facility.\n# All people to own equally all modes of transportation both for themselves and their goods.\n# The working class to make all the laws over industry by direct vote.\n\nThe existence of these four things in society would create a society that celebrates the labors of the working class and recognizes their importance. The over-all equality between people in the socialist system is something that ties racial issues very close to socialism. Woodbey felt that a system of total equality would have helped African-Americans to obtain the freedoms and justice that they were denied.\nWoodbey argued that at the time of publication, socialism was going through a period of agitation in which many intelligent socialists were spreading the ideals and goals of socialism to create more socialists. He predicted that socialism would grow tremendously and influence governments all over the world.<ref>Foner, Philip S. \"Reverend George Washington Woodbey: Early Twentieth Century Black Socialist\", Journal of Negro History. 1976, Vol. 61 Issue 2, p136-157.</ref>\n\nHe describes a socialist government as needing very few laws. He argues that with equal ownership and concern for society's production, men would no longer be swayed to illegal acts for monetary gain. He proposes a system in which any citizen can propose a law, and with enough support (he suggests 5% of the population) [[Initiative|the law would be presented for vote]]. If a majority were in support of it, it would become a law. Woodbey does not mention or distinguish between State and Federal government in this section. Giving each worker equal interest and shareholding in the industries in which they work creates less demand for bosses and management chains, thereby creating more laborers. Woodbey envisions a society in which, given these parameters, the majority would vote in favor of equal distribution of goods to all citizens given that all citizens are equal owners. He also envisions a severe drop in all criminal activity, and a schooling system that prepares men and women for their positions in specific industries. With equal opportunities among the people, the differences between people would disappear and rid the society of prejudice. Any citizen who does not follow the laws passed by the majority of voters would be forced to go without a living.<ref>Foner, Philip S.

(2003) p. 673.</ref> however, an article by Woodbey was printed in a [[Chicago]] publication in 1909.  He was said to have been active in [[California]] as late as 1923.<ref name=\"blackpast.org\"/>\n\nWoodbey died in [[Los Angeles, California]] on August 27, 1937 at the home of his son William, survived by his third wife and three children.\n\nReverend [[George W. Slater, Jr.]] credited Woodbey for his conversion and understanding of Socialism. Slater took the mantle of Socialism from Woodbey and continued to teach and preach his message as a disciple of the Socialist movement.<ref>Philip S.
