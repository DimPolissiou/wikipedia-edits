In [[Malaysia]], it can be known as ''sepak raga'' as well. In the [[Philippines]], the related native sport is known as ''[[sip\u00e0]]'', while the international version is known by the borrowed terms ''sip\u00e0 t\u00e1kraw'' or ''sepak takraw''. In [[Thailand]], it is known simply as ''takraw''. In [[Laos]], it is ''kataw'' ({{lang-lo|\"twine\" and \"kick\"}}).<ref name=kelley /> In [[Myanmar]], it is known as [[Chinlone|''chin lone'']], and is considered more of an art as there is often no opposing team, and the point is to keep the ball aloft gracefully and interestingly.\n\nSimilar games include [[footbag net]], [[footvolley]], [[football tennis]], [[bossaball]], [[jianzi]], [[jokgu]] and [[sipa]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Sepak\" is the [[Malay language|Malay]] word for kick and \"takraw\" is the [[Thai language|Thai]] word for a woven [[rattan]] ball; therefore sepak takraw quite literally means \"to kick a ball\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/sepak_takraw|title=sepak takraw {{!}} Definition of sepak takraw in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-09-18}}</ref>\n\nSepak takraw is known in many names across Southeast Asia; including {{lang-id|sepak takraw}}; {{lang-ms|sepak raga}}; {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e30\u0e01\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d}}, {{RTGS|''takro''}}, {{IPA-th|t\u0101.kr\u0254\u0302\u02d0|pron}}; {{lang-my|\u1015\u102d\u102f\u1000\u103a\u1000\u103b\u1031\u102c\u103a\u1001\u103c\u1004\u103a\u1038}}, ''Pike Kyaw Chin''; {{lang-fil|sip\u00e0, sip\u00e0 t\u00e1kraw, sep\u00e1k t\u00e1kraw}}, {{IPA-tl|s\u025b\u031dp\u00e4k t\u00e4k\u027e\u0250w|pron}}; {{lang-km|\u179f\u17b8\u178a\u1780\u17cb}}, ''Sei Dak''; {{lang-lo|\u0e81\u0eb0\u0e95\u0ecd\u0ec9}}, ''ka-taw''; {{lang-vi|c\u1ea7u m\u00e2y}}, \"calameae ball\" or \"rattan ball\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw game.webm|thumb|Video recording of a Sepak Takraw game]]\nTakraw really began to take off, however, in the late 1980s when Kurt Sonderegger, an American working in Switzerland, met a fellow American who showed him a bouncy ball made of woven strips of rattan. The traveller told Sonderegger that the ball was from Thailand and gave him the ball as a gift.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], sepak takraw was spread from nearby Malacca across the strait to [[Riau islands]] and [[Riau]] area in Sumatra as early as the 16th century, where it is also called as ''Sepak Raga'' in local Malay tongue,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1302 |title=Permainan Sepak Raga |publisher=Melayuonline.com |accessdate=25 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325191325/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1302 |archive-date=25 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://id.voi.co.id/fitur/voi-pesona-indonesia/4125-sepak-raga-permainan-tradisional-masyarakat-di-propinsi-kepulauan-riau.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107190942/http://id.voi.co.id/fitur/voi-pesona-indonesia/4125-sepak-raga-permainan-tradisional-masyarakat-di-propinsi-kepulauan-riau.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 November 2010 |title=Sepak Raga, Permainan Tradisional Masyarakat Di Propinsi Kepulauan Riau |publisher=Id.voi.co.id |accessdate=25 March 2014 }}</ref> at that time some of Sumatran areas were part of Malacca sultanate. From there the Malay people spread across archipelago and introduced the game to [[Bugis|Buginese people]] in Sulawesi. Then the game is developed as Buginese traditional game which is called \"Raga\" (the players are called \"Pa'Raga\"). The \"Raga\" can trace its origin from [[Malacca Sultanate]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1224/permainan-marraga-akraga|title=Permainan Marraga/Akraga (Bugis)|publisher=Melayuonline|accessdate=4 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412070015/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1224/permainan-marraga-akraga|archive-date=12 April 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was popular in South Sulawesi since the 19th century. Some men playing \"Raga\" encircling within a group, the ball is passed from one to another and the man who kicked the ball highest is the winner. \"Raga\" is also played for fun by demonstrating some tricks, such as kicking the ball and putting it on top of player's head holds by ''tengkolok bugis'' (Bugis cloth headgear similar to Malay ''tanjak'').\n\nIn Thailand (formerly Siam), there was evidence that the Thai had played Sepak Takraw since the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], at least during the reign of King [[Naresuan]] (1590\u20131605).<ref name=\"world\">{{cite web|title=The History of Takraw in Thailand|publisher=Sepaktakrawworld.com|url=http://www.sepaktakrawworld.com/index.php/-tournament-/13-vigo-cup|access-date=17 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127171636/http://www.sepaktakrawworld.com/index.php/-tournament-/13-vigo-cup|archive-date=27 January 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> A French historian, [[Fran\u00e7ois Henri Turpin]], wrote about how the Siamese played the game of takraw to stay in shape.<ref name=\"world\"/>  Murals at [[Bangkok]]'s [[Wat Phra Kaeo]] which was built in 1785, depict the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Hanuman]] playing sepak takraw in a ring with a troop of [[monkey]]s. The game was played in its circle form for hundreds of years, and the modern version of ''sepak takraw'' began taking shape in Thailand sometime during the early 1740s. In 1929 the Siam Sports Association drafted the first rules for takraw competition.<ref name=\"world\"/> Four years later, the association introduced the volleyball-style net and held the first public contest. Within just a few years, takraw was introduced to the curriculum in Siamese schools. The game became such a cherished local custom that another exhibition of volleyball-style takraw was staged to celebrate the kingdom's first constitution in 1933, the year after Thailand abolished [[absolute monarchy]].\n[[File:Mindanao Bangsamoro Islamic Game Set.jpg|thumb|A traditional ''sip\u00e0'' (rattan wicker ball) from the [[Maranao people]] of the [[Philippines]], along with ''kakasing'' [[top]]s and a ''[[sungka]]'' board]]\nIn the Philippines the sport was called \"''[[sip\u00e0]]''\" (or \"''sip\u00e0 salama''\" among [[Muslim Filipinos]]) and along with traditional [[Filipino martial arts|martial arts]] survived the three century Spanish colonisation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gowing |first1=P.G. |title=Heritage of Philippine Muslims |url=http://www.muslimmindanao.ph/muslim_arts.html |website=Muslim Filipinos -- Heritage and Horizon |accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref> It is a popular sport played by children in Philippines. It was the Philippine national sport until it was replaced by [[arnis]] in 2009. Sepak Takraw is included in Philippine's elementary and highschool curriculum. In [[Myanmar]], or Burma, it was dubbed \"[[chinlone]]\", in [[Laos]] \"kator\", \"c\u1ea7u m\u00e2y\" in Vietnam and in Indonesia \"raga\" or \"sepak takraw\".<ref name=\"kelley\" />\n\nSome of the people believed that many variations of the game evolved from [[cuju]], an ancient Chinese military exercise, where soldiers would try to keep a feathered shuttlecock airborne by kicking it back and forth between two people. As the sport developed, the animal hide and chicken feathers were eventually replaced by balls made of woven strips of rattan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe first versions of sepak takraw were not so much of a competition, but rather cooperative displays of skill designed to exercise the body, improve dexterity and loosen the limbs after long periods of sitting, standing or working.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nBy the 1940s, the net version of the game had spread throughout Southeast Asia, and formal rules were introduced. This sport became officially known as \"sepak takraw\".\n\n==Competition==\nInternational play is now governed by [[International Sepaktakraw Federation|ISTAF]], the International Sepak Takraw Federation.  Major competitions for the sport such as the [[ISTAF SuperSeries]], the [[ISTAF World Cup]] and the [[King's Cup World Championships]] are held every year.\n\nSepak takraw is now a regular sport event in the [[Asian Games]] and the [[Southeast Asian Games]].\nThailand has won the most medal's for talraw,people say that Thailand are the best at takraw.\nThe best sepak takraw palyer is Anuwat Chaichana with multiple gold medals, Anuwat Chaichana accolades speak to why he is famous. He is a staple on Thailand\u2019s team. Many consider him to be one of the best sepak takraw players ever. Being such an experienced striker with so much power, it\u2019s no wonder he is one of the famous sepak takraw players. \n\n===Asian Games===\n{{main|Sepak takraw at the Asian Games}}\nSepak takraw has been a sport at the Asian Games since [[Sepak takraw at the 1990 Asian Games|1990]] with Thailand securing the highest number of gold medals.\n\n===Canada===\nThe Lao people first brought sepak takraw into Canada when they immigrated as refugees in the 1970s. But the game got exposure outside the Laotian communities and really started taking off when a Saskatchewan teacher, Richard (Rick) Engel, who encountered sepak takraw while living in Asia, included it in Asian Sport, Education & Culture (ASEC) International's School Presentation Program. Sepak takraw was so well received by schools that it became part of ASEC's mandate to help introduce, promote and organise the sport right across the country. In May 1998, after getting many schools playing sepak takraw, and by networking with experienced players, ASEC International organised the first Canadian inter-provincial tournament to include men's, boys and girls teams. By the end of 1998, Engel was sent to Bangkok, Thailand to film at the 14th King's Cup Sepak Takraw World Championships \u2013 the footage of which was used to produce a widely used instructional sepak takraw video/DVD, called ''Sepak Takraw \u2013 Just for Kicks''.\n\nOn 11 December 1998, the Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC)<ref>[http://takrawcanada.com/?q=node/32 Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC)]</ref> was incorporated to organise and govern the sport nationally. Its office was set up in Regina, SK, where there are experienced players and organisational support, and where it could share the resources and office space of the already established ASEC International, a committee from which has now become Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc.<ref>[http://www.sepaktakrawsask.com/ Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc.]</ref> The first annual Canadian Open Sepak Takraw Championships (a national and international tournament event) were held in May 1999 in Regina, SK, and have over the years attracted teams from across Canada, the United States, Japan, Malaysia and China. That same year Canada also attended its first International Sepak Takraw Federation (ISTAF) Congress and was accepted as members of ISTAF, which governs the sport globally. In 2000, Rick Engel, Perry Senko and Brydon Blacklaws played for Team Canada and earned a silver medal in the entry level division of the King's Cup World Sepak Takraw Championships in Thailand. Another major milestone was achieved on 3 December 2000, when STAC and the sport of sepak takraw became an official class E Member of the Canadian Olympic Committee.\n\nCanada has since contributed much to the development of sepak takraw worldwide, with Engel authoring three instructional sepak takraw books<ref>[http://takrawcanada.com/?q=node/15#block-block-3]</ref> and helping produce five sepak takraw DVDs, while STAC does the publishing. The most notable of these books is ''Sepak Takraw 101 - The Complete Coaching/Instructional Manual for Sepak Takraw (Kick Volleyball)'', the third edition of which has also been translated and published in the Indonesian language and released in Indonesia through a government education project. Engel has found himself to be in demand, introducing the sport and conducting sepak takraw skills clinics in schools and sessions at physical education teachers' conferences all over Canada, the US and Europe.\n\n===Japan===\nA Japanese team played at the [[1990 Asian Games]] in Beijing. While as of 2010 there are no professional teams in Japan, university level teams had been established at [[Asia University (Japan)|Asia University]], [[Chiba University]], [[Keio University]], and [[Waseda University]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/sport/sepak-takraw/|title=Sepak Takraw: By veronica lodge|date=4 February 2010|magazine=[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]]|accessdate=4 February 2010|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115065439/http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/sport/sepak-takraw/|archivedate=15 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe earliest accounts of organized takraw in the United States involve a group of students from  Northrop University (Greg St. Pierre, Thomas Gong, Joel \"big bird\" Nelson, and Mark Kimitsuka) in 1986 in Inglewood, California, learning about and playing the sport in Los Angeles. In the early 80s, Southeast Asians held soccer tournaments that had takraw events in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and California, especially within the Lao, Hmong and Thai communities.<ref>The Log, Northrop University Student Newspaper, 5 November 1987, Vol 35, No. 3.</ref> Malaysian students attending the University often enjoyed playing the sport on a court on top of the dormitory cafeteria. They taught a handful of curious American students how to play, which in turn inspired [[Malaysia Airlines]] to sponsor a US team from the university to attend the National Tournament in Kuala Lumpur in November 1987. The Northrop team played in a bracket of international new teams with Korea, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The US team beat Sri Lanka and Australia to bring home the gold.<ref>Northrop University Magazine, December 1987, Vol 3, No. 4.</ref>\n\nLos Angeles's Asian community and Northrop's team had already established a takraw community in and around L.A. Sonderegger moved to Los Angeles, founded the United States Takraw Association, and started a business that sold plastic takraw balls. In 1989, he was sent an invitation from the International Sepak Takraw Federation, and Sonderegger along with a few of the Northrop group travelled to represent the United States in the World Championships.\n\nThe team was beaten badly but the takraw world was enchanted with the fact that non-Asian teams had competed at the World Championships.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1005482/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=8 August 1994}}</ref>\n\n==Rules and regulations==\nMeasurements of courts and equipment often vary among tournaments and organisations that operate from a recreational to a competitive level; ''international competitive rules and regulations are used in this section.'' There are two types of event categories: the regu and the doubles regu. The regu category is played by three players on each team while the doubles regu is played by two players on each team.\n\n===Expressions===\n''Takraw'' is the Thai word for the hand-woven rattan ball originally used in the game. Therefore, the game is essentially \"kick ball\".<ref>Talking Takraw[Electronic Version]. ''Journal of Mens Fitness,'' Vol. 20, Issue 10.</ref>  The concept of Footvolley originates from Thai Takraw pronounced (Tha-Graw)  Also, sometimes misnamed by foreigners as \"Shaolin Soccer\" however it is an ancient game mainly enjoyed between Thai and Laos.\n\n===Court===\n[[File:Sepak Takraw court diagram.svg|thumb|250px|Sepak takraw court diagram]]\nThe sepak takraw sport is played on a similar to [[badminton]] double sized court.<ref name=\"sportsmatchmaker.com\">Sportsmatchmaker.

In [[Malaysia]], it can be known as ''sepak raga'' as well. In the [[Philippines]], the related native sport is known as ''[[sip\u00e0]]'', while the international version is known by the borrowed terms ''sip\u00e0 t\u00e1kraw'' or ''sepak takraw''. In [[Thailand]], it is known simply as ''takraw''. In [[Laos]], it is ''kataw'' ({{lang-lo|\"twine\" and \"kick\"}}).<ref name=kelley /> In [[Myanmar]], it is known as [[Chinlone|''chin lone'']], and is considered more of an art as there is often no opposing team, and the point is to keep the ball aloft gracefully and interestingly.\n\nSimilar games include [[footbag net]], [[footvolley]], [[football tennis]], [[bossaball]], [[jianzi]], [[jokgu]] and [[sipa]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Sepak\" is the [[Malay language|Malay]] word for kick and \"takraw\" is the [[Thai language|Thai]] word for a woven [[rattan]] ball; therefore sepak takraw quite literally means \"to kick a ball\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/sepak_takraw|title=sepak takraw {{!}} Definition of sepak takraw in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-09-18}}</ref>\n\nSepak takraw is known in many names across Southeast Asia; including {{lang-id|sepak takraw}}; {{lang-ms|sepak raga}}; {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e30\u0e01\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d}}, {{RTGS|''takro''}}, {{IPA-th|t\u0101.kr\u0254\u0302\u02d0|pron}}; {{lang-my|\u1015\u102d\u102f\u1000\u103a\u1000\u103b\u1031\u102c\u103a\u1001\u103c\u1004\u103a\u1038}}, ''Pike Kyaw Chin''; {{lang-fil|sip\u00e0, sip\u00e0 t\u00e1kraw, sep\u00e1k t\u00e1kraw}}, {{IPA-tl|s\u025b\u031dp\u00e4k t\u00e4k\u027e\u0250w|pron}}; {{lang-km|\u179f\u17b8\u178a\u1780\u17cb}}, ''Sei Dak''; {{lang-lo|\u0e81\u0eb0\u0e95\u0ecd\u0ec9}}, ''ka-taw''; {{lang-vi|c\u1ea7u m\u00e2y}}, \"calameae ball\" or \"rattan ball\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw game.webm|thumb|Video recording of a Sepak Takraw game]]\nTakraw really began to take off, however, in the late 1980s when Kurt Sonderegger, an American working in Switzerland, met a fellow American who showed him a bouncy ball made of woven strips of rattan. The traveller told Sonderegger that the ball was from Thailand and gave him the ball as a gift.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], sepak takraw was spread from nearby Malacca across the strait to [[Riau islands]] and [[Riau]] area in Sumatra as early as the 16th century, where it is also called as ''Sepak Raga'' in local Malay tongue,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1302 |title=Permainan Sepak Raga |publisher=Melayuonline.com |accessdate=25 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325191325/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1302 |archive-date=25 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://id.voi.co.id/fitur/voi-pesona-indonesia/4125-sepak-raga-permainan-tradisional-masyarakat-di-propinsi-kepulauan-riau.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107190942/http://id.voi.co.id/fitur/voi-pesona-indonesia/4125-sepak-raga-permainan-tradisional-masyarakat-di-propinsi-kepulauan-riau.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 November 2010 |title=Sepak Raga, Permainan Tradisional Masyarakat Di Propinsi Kepulauan Riau |publisher=Id.voi.co.id |accessdate=25 March 2014 }}</ref> at that time some of Sumatran areas were part of Malacca sultanate. From there the Malay people spread across archipelago and introduced the game to [[Bugis|Buginese people]] in Sulawesi. Then the game is developed as Buginese traditional game which is called \"Raga\" (the players are called \"Pa'Raga\"). The \"Raga\" can trace its origin from [[Malacca Sultanate]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1224/permainan-marraga-akraga|title=Permainan Marraga/Akraga (Bugis)|publisher=Melayuonline|accessdate=4 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412070015/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1224/permainan-marraga-akraga|archive-date=12 April 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was popular in South Sulawesi since the 19th century. Some men playing \"Raga\" encircling within a group, the ball is passed from one to another and the man who kicked the ball highest is the winner. \"Raga\" is also played for fun by demonstrating some tricks, such as kicking the ball and putting it on top of player's head holds by ''tengkolok bugis'' (Bugis cloth headgear similar to Malay ''tanjak'').\n\nIn Thailand (formerly Siam), there was evidence that the Thai had played Sepak Takraw since the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], at least during the reign of King [[Naresuan]] (1590\u20131605).<ref name=\"world\">{{cite web|title=The History of Takraw in Thailand|publisher=Sepaktakrawworld.com|url=http://www.sepaktakrawworld.com/index.php/-tournament-/13-vigo-cup|access-date=17 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127171636/http://www.sepaktakrawworld.com/index.php/-tournament-/13-vigo-cup|archive-date=27 January 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> A French historian, [[Fran\u00e7ois Henri Turpin]], wrote about how the Siamese played the game of takraw to stay in shape.<ref name=\"world\"/>  Murals at [[Bangkok]]'s [[Wat Phra Kaeo]] which was built in 1785, depict the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Hanuman]] playing sepak takraw in a ring with a troop of [[monkey]]s. The game was played in its circle form for hundreds of years, and the modern version of ''sepak takraw'' began taking shape in Thailand sometime during the early 1740s. In 1929 the Siam Sports Association drafted the first rules for takraw competition.<ref name=\"world\"/> Four years later, the association introduced the volleyball-style net and held the first public contest. Within just a few years, takraw was introduced to the curriculum in Siamese schools. The game became such a cherished local custom that another exhibition of volleyball-style takraw was staged to celebrate the kingdom's first constitution in 1933, the year after Thailand abolished [[absolute monarchy]].\n[[File:Mindanao Bangsamoro Islamic Game Set.jpg|thumb|A traditional ''sip\u00e0'' (rattan wicker ball) from the [[Maranao people]] of the [[Philippines]], along with ''kakasing'' [[top]]s and a ''[[sungka]]'' board]]\nIn the Philippines the sport was called \"''[[sip\u00e0]]''\" (or \"''sip\u00e0 salama''\" among [[Muslim Filipinos]]) and along with traditional [[Filipino martial arts|martial arts]] survived the three century Spanish colonisation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gowing |first1=P.G. |title=Heritage of Philippine Muslims |url=http://www.muslimmindanao.ph/muslim_arts.html |website=Muslim Filipinos -- Heritage and Horizon |accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref> It is a popular sport played by children in Philippines. It was the Philippine national sport until it was replaced by [[arnis]] in 2009. Sepak Takraw is included in Philippine's elementary and highschool curriculum. In [[Myanmar]], or Burma, it was dubbed \"[[chinlone]]\", in [[Laos]] \"kator\", \"c\u1ea7u m\u00e2y\" in Vietnam and in Indonesia \"raga\" or \"sepak takraw\".<ref name=\"kelley\" />\n\nSome of the people believed that many variations of the game evolved from [[cuju]], an ancient Chinese military exercise, where soldiers would try to keep a feathered shuttlecock airborne by kicking it back and forth between two people. As the sport developed, the animal hide and chicken feathers were eventually replaced by balls made of woven strips of rattan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe first versions of sepak takraw were not so much of a competition, but rather cooperative displays of skill designed to exercise the body, improve dexterity and loosen the limbs after long periods of sitting, standing or working.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nBy the 1940s, the net version of the game had spread throughout Southeast Asia, and formal rules were introduced. This sport became officially known as \"sepak takraw\".\n\n==Competition==\nInternational play is now governed by [[International Sepaktakraw Federation|ISTAF]], the International Sepak Takraw Federation.  Major competitions for the sport such as the [[ISTAF SuperSeries]], the [[ISTAF World Cup]] and the [[King's Cup World Championships]] are held every year.\n\nSepak takraw is now a regular sport event in the [[Asian Games]] and the [[Southeast Asian Games]].\nThailand has won the most medal's for talraw,people say that Thailand are the best at takraw.\nThe best sepak takraw palyer is Anuwat Chaichana with multiple gold medals, Anuwat Chaichana accolades speak to why he is famous. He is a staple on Thailand\u2019s team. Many consider him to be one of the best sepak takraw players ever. Being such an experienced striker with so much power, it\u2019s no wonder he is one of the famous sepak takraw players. \n\n===Asian Games===\n{{main|Sepak takraw at the Asian Games}}\nSepak takraw has been a sport at the Asian Games since [[Sepak takraw at the 1990 Asian Games|1990]] with Thailand securing the highest number of gold medals.\n\n===Canada===\nThe Lao people first brought sepak takraw into Canada when they immigrated as refugees in the 1970s. But the game got exposure outside the Laotian communities and really started taking off when a Saskatchewan teacher, Richard (Rick) Engel, who encountered sepak takraw while living in Asia, included it in Asian Sport, Education & Culture (ASEC) International's School Presentation Program. Sepak takraw was so well received by schools that it became part of ASEC's mandate to help introduce, promote and organise the sport right across the country. In May 1998, after getting many schools playing sepak takraw, and by networking with experienced players, ASEC International organised the first Canadian inter-provincial tournament to include men's, boys and girls teams. By the end of 1998, Engel was sent to Bangkok, Thailand to film at the 14th King's Cup Sepak Takraw World Championships \u2013 the footage of which was used to produce a widely used instructional sepak takraw video/DVD, called ''Sepak Takraw \u2013 Just for Kicks''.\n\nOn 11 December 1998, the Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC)<ref>[http://takrawcanada.com/?q=node/32 Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC)]</ref> was incorporated to organise and govern the sport nationally. Its office was set up in Regina, SK, where there are experienced players and organisational support, and where it could share the resources and office space of the already established ASEC International, a committee from which has now become Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc.<ref>[http://www.sepaktakrawsask.com/ Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc.]</ref> The first annual Canadian Open Sepak Takraw Championships (a national and international tournament event) were held in May 1999 in Regina, SK, and have over the years attracted teams from across Canada, the United States, Japan, Malaysia and China. That same year Canada also attended its first International Sepak Takraw Federation (ISTAF) Congress and was accepted as members of ISTAF, which governs the sport globally. In 2000, Rick Engel, Perry Senko and Brydon Blacklaws played for Team Canada and earned a silver medal in the entry level division of the King's Cup World Sepak Takraw Championships in Thailand. Another major milestone was achieved on 3 December 2000, when STAC and the sport of sepak takraw became an official class E Member of the Canadian Olympic Committee.\n\nCanada has since contributed much to the development of sepak takraw worldwide, with Engel authoring three instructional sepak takraw books<ref>[http://takrawcanada.com/?q=node/15#block-block-3]</ref> and helping produce five sepak takraw DVDs, while STAC does the publishing. The most notable of these books is ''Sepak Takraw 101 - The Complete Coaching/Instructional Manual for Sepak Takraw (Kick Volleyball)'', the third edition of which has also been translated and published in the Indonesian language and released in Indonesia through a government education project. Engel has found himself to be in demand, introducing the sport and conducting sepak takraw skills clinics in schools and sessions at physical education teachers' conferences all over Canada, the US and Europe.\n\n===Japan===\nA Japanese team played at the [[1990 Asian Games]] in Beijing. While as of 2010 there are no professional teams in Japan, university level teams had been established at [[Asia University (Japan)|Asia University]], [[Chiba University]], [[Keio University]], and [[Waseda University]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/sport/sepak-takraw/|title=Sepak Takraw: By veronica lodge|date=4 February 2010|magazine=[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]]|accessdate=4 February 2010|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115065439/http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/sport/sepak-takraw/|archivedate=15 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe earliest accounts of organized takraw in the United States involve a group of students from  Northrop University (Greg St. Pierre, Thomas Gong, Joel \"big bird\" Nelson, and Mark Kimitsuka) in 1986 in Inglewood, California, learning about and playing the sport in Los Angeles. In the early 80s, Southeast Asians held soccer tournaments that had takraw events in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and California, especially within the Lao, Hmong and Thai communities.<ref>The Log, Northrop University Student Newspaper, 5 November 1987, Vol 35, No. 3.</ref> Malaysian students attending the University often enjoyed playing the sport on a court on top of the dormitory cafeteria. They taught a handful of curious American students how to play, which in turn inspired [[Malaysia Airlines]] to sponsor a US team from the university to attend the National Tournament in Kuala Lumpur in November 1987. The Northrop team played in a bracket of international new teams with Korea, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The US team beat Sri Lanka and Australia to bring home the gold.<ref>Northrop University Magazine, December 1987, Vol 3, No. 4.</ref>\n\nLos Angeles's Asian community and Northrop's team had already established a takraw community in and around L.A. Sonderegger moved to Los Angeles, founded the United States Takraw Association, and started a business that sold plastic takraw balls. In 1989, he was sent an invitation from the International Sepak Takraw Federation, and Sonderegger along with a few of the Northrop group travelled to represent the United States in the World Championships.\n\nThe team was beaten badly but the takraw world was enchanted with the fact that non-Asian teams had competed at the World Championships.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1005482/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=8 August 1994}}</ref>\n\n==Rules and regulations==\nMeasurements of courts and equipment often vary among tournaments and organisations that operate from a recreational to a competitive level; ''international competitive rules and regulations are used in this section.'' There are two types of event categories: the regu and the doubles regu. The regu category is played by three players on each team while the doubles regu is played by two players on each team.\n\n===Expressions===\n''Takraw'' is the Thai word for the hand-woven rattan ball originally used in the game. Therefore, the game is essentially \"kick ball\".<ref>Talking Takraw[Electronic Version]. ''Journal of Mens Fitness,'' Vol. 20, Issue 10.</ref>  The concept of Footvolley originates from Thai Takraw pronounced (Tha-Graw)  Also, sometimes misnamed by foreigners as \"Shaolin Soccer\" however it is an ancient game mainly enjoyed between Thai and Laos.\n\n===Court===\n[[File:Sepak Takraw court diagram.svg|thumb|250px|Sepak takraw court diagram]]\nThe sepak takraw sport is played on a similar to [[badminton]] double sized court.<ref name=\"sportsmatchmaker.com\">Sportsmatchmaker.

The winner is determined by best of three regus (win 2 out of 3 regus), where a winner of each individual regu is determined by best of 3 sets, played up to 21 points per set.\n\nIn the last 3rd set the change of sides takes place when one team reaches 11 points.\n\nPoint: when either serving side or receiving side commits a fault, a point is awarded to the opponent side.<ref name=\"istaf\" />\n\n==Competing countries==\nInternational play is now governed by ISTAF, the International Sepak Takraw Federation\nServing: Teams alternate serve every three points, regardless of who wins the points. I.e., each team serves three times, then the other team serves three times, and so on. If a tie takes place at 21-21, each team alternates one serve each until a winner is determined.\n\nSet: each set is won by the side which scores 21 points with a minimum lead of two points to a ceiling of 25 points. In the event of a 21-21 tie, the set shall be won by the side which gets a lead of two points, or when a side reaches 25 points (whichever occurs first).\n\nMatch: a match is won by the team who has won two sets. A team event match is won by the team that wins two regus.\n\nRanking: in group stages of tournaments or team events (round robin) the ranking in a group is determined by:\n1. Sum of match wins; a match win gives 1 point\n2. Sum set points\n3.

It is located {{convert|25|km|mi|0}} northeast of [[Edmonton]], Alberta's capital city. Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time; the rail company paying for it in exchange for free land for its station in Fort Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"peterream2\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=339}}</ref>  Prior to the bridge, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry.<ref name=\"peterream2\" /> In the decade after the railway arrived, the town's population nearly doubled to 993.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=557}}</ref>\nIn 1913, a fire swept through a large portion of the city's business section, destroying $24,000 worth of buildings (roughly $550,000 in 2020).<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:CN Caboose Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|CN Caboose #79242 at the Fort Saskatchewan Station]]\n=== The Provincial Gaol ===\nA new $200,000 provincial gaol (roughly $4.5 million in 2020) opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used to hold prisoners since the N.W.M.P. fort was constructed in 1875.<ref name=\"peterream3\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |pages=420\u2013425}}</ref> The fort was demolished to make room for the prison.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves. This was meant to provide convenient access to the prison for the Warden while normalizing life for the Warden's wife and children; recognizing his duel role as Warden, and as father/husband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidmurrayarchitect.ca/fort-saskatchewan-historic-buildings/|title=Fort Saskatchewan Historic Buildings|date=2016-03-02|website=David Murray Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion and development ===\nIn 1952, [[Sherritt Gordon Mines]] started construction on a $25-million nickel refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, which started production in 1954.<ref name=\"peterream4\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=459}}</ref> Following Sherritt Gordon's locating in Fort Saskatchewan, more industries constructed plants in the town.

It was released by [[Epic Records]] on November 26, 1991. Jackson, [[Bill Bottrell]], [[Teddy Riley]], and [[Bruce Swedien]] co-produced the album. This was Jackson's first album since ''[[Forever, Michael]]'' (1975) not produced by longtime collaborator [[Quincy Jones]]. Featured artists include [[Heavy D]], [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Wreckx-n-Effect]]. The music incorporates [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[new jack swing]], a new genre in vogue at the time. Elements of [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Rock music|rock]] can also be found. Twelve of the album's fourteen songs were written or co-written by Jackson, discoursing topics like [[racism]], [[poverty]], [[Romance (love)|romance]], self-improvement, and the welfare of children and the world.\n\n''Dangerous'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], as well as in ten other countries' charts. Nine singles premiered between November 1991 and December 1993, including two exclusively released outside the United States. The album produced four singles that reached top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[Remember the Time]]\", \"[[In the Closet]]\", \"[[Will You Be There]]\" and number-one single \"[[Black or White]]\".\n\nThe [[Dangerous World Tour]] grossed $100 million (equivalent to $177 million in 2019) which made it one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours#1990s|highest-grossing tours of the 1990s]]. All proceeds went to charities including Jackson's [[Heal the World Foundation]]. Jackson sold the film and broadcast rights for the 1992 [[Bucharest]] concert to [[HBO]] for $21 million, the highest amount for a concert performer to appear on television at the time.\n\n''Dangerous'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], having sold over 32 million copies worldwide and was certified [[RIAA certification|8\u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in August 2018. An influence on contemporary pop and R&B artists, ''Dangerous'' has been rated by critics and publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, as well as considered by some critics as Jackson's artistic peak. It received four [[Grammy Award]] nominations and won [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]].\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the success of ''Bad'', Jackson wanted more independence and control over the creative process and separated himself from Quincy Jones to avoid the perception that his success was dependent on the long-time producer. Jackson began working on new tracks in 1989 with a handful of members from the B-team of ''Bad'', including Matt Forger and Bill Bottrell.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3847}} The album was originally conceived as a greatest-hits collection with a handful of new songs similar to Madonna's ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]''.The proposed title was ''Decade''. Jackson signed off on the idea in early 1989 and test pressings were made by [[Epic Records]]. Jackson received $18 million in advance.{{Sfn|Vogel|2019|p=|loc=3898}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/21/movies/michael-jackson-gets-thriller-of-deal-to-stay-with-sony.html|title=Michael Jackson Gets Thriller of Deal To Stay With Sony|work=The New York Times|first=Randall|last=Rothenberg|date=March 21, 1991|accessdate=June 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626135856/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/21/movies/michael-jackson-gets-thriller-of-deal-to-stay-with-sony.html|archive-date=June 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Decades'' was originally scheduled for a late 1989 release date but was delayed several times.

Buxer was originally hired as a technician for his expertise in electronic equipment. A fortuitous relationship grew between Jackson and Buxer, to which Buxer recalled, \"Musically speaking, we were on the same wavelength; we spoke the same language.\"{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3891}} The Jackson-Buxer partnership would continue for twenty years.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3892}} \n\nFor most of the rhythm tracks, Jackson worked with Loren at [[Westlake Recording Studios|Westlake Studios]].

It was released by [[Epic Records]] on November 26, 1991. Jackson, [[Bill Bottrell]], [[Teddy Riley]], and [[Bruce Swedien]] co-produced the album. This was Jackson's first album since ''[[Forever, Michael]]'' (1975) not produced by longtime collaborator [[Quincy Jones]]. Featured artists include [[Heavy D]], [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Wreckx-n-Effect]]. The music incorporates [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[new jack swing]], a new genre in vogue at the time. Elements of [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Rock music|rock]] can also be found. Twelve of the album's fourteen songs were written or co-written by Jackson, discoursing topics like [[racism]], [[poverty]], [[Romance (love)|romance]], self-improvement, and the welfare of children and the world.\n\n''Dangerous'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], as well as in ten other countries' charts. Nine singles premiered between November 1991 and December 1993, including two exclusively released outside the United States. The album produced four singles that reached top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[Remember the Time]]\", \"[[In the Closet]]\", \"[[Will You Be There]]\" and number-one single \"[[Black or White]]\".\n\nThe [[Dangerous World Tour]] grossed $100 million (equivalent to $177 million in 2019) which made it one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours#1990s|highest-grossing tours of the 1990s]]. All proceeds went to charities including Jackson's [[Heal the World Foundation]]. Jackson sold the film and broadcast rights for the 1992 [[Bucharest]] concert to [[HBO]] for $21 million, the highest amount for a concert performer to appear on television at the time.\n\n''Dangerous'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], having sold over 32 million copies worldwide and was certified [[RIAA certification|8\u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in August 2018. An influence on contemporary pop and R&B artists, ''Dangerous'' has been rated by critics and publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, as well as considered by some critics as Jackson's artistic peak. It received four [[Grammy Award]] nominations and won [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]].\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the success of ''Bad'', Jackson wanted more independence and control over the creative process and separated himself from Quincy Jones to avoid the perception that his success was dependent on the long-time producer. Jackson began working on new tracks in 1989 with a handful of members from the B-team of ''Bad'', including Matt Forger and Bill Bottrell.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3847}} The album was originally conceived as a greatest-hits collection with a handful of new songs similar to Madonna's ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]''.The proposed title was ''Decade''. Jackson signed off on the idea in early 1989 and test pressings were made by [[Epic Records]]. Jackson received $18 million in advance.{{Sfn|Vogel|2019|p=|loc=3898}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/21/movies/michael-jackson-gets-thriller-of-deal-to-stay-with-sony.html|title=Michael Jackson Gets Thriller of Deal To Stay With Sony|work=The New York Times|first=Randall|last=Rothenberg|date=March 21, 1991|accessdate=June 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626135856/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/21/movies/michael-jackson-gets-thriller-of-deal-to-stay-with-sony.html|archive-date=June 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Decades'' was originally scheduled for a late 1989 release date but was delayed several times. Another release date was set for November 1990, but it never materialized. Jackson was preoccupied with on-going changes in his management team while also attempting to realize his film-making ambitions.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3951}} In June 1990, the artist collapsed while dancing in his home studio due to a possible panic attack, with symptoms of chest pains, dehydration and inflammation of the ribs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/06/07/michael-jackson-to-leave-hospital/53533bf1-b446-4cac-8fd2-9b84a581436c/|title=MICHAEL JACKSON TO LEAVE HOSPITAL|first=Carla|last=Hall|date=June 7, 1990|work=The Washington Post|access-date=November 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116015010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/06/07/michael-jackson-to-leave-hospital/53533bf1-b446-4cac-8fd2-9b84a581436c/|archive-date=November 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Soon after, ''Decades'' was dropped entirely, and Jackson determined that his new material constituted a full album, which he called ''Dangerous''.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3923}}\n\n== Recording ==\nFor about a year between 1989 and 1990, recording took place primarily at Record One (a branch of [[Ocean Way Recording|Ocean Way Studios]] in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles|Sherman Oaks]]) where Jackson arranged for executive control over the facility for $4,000 per day.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3927}}<ref name=RS1992>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/michael-jackson-the-making-of-the-king-of-pop-19920109|date=January 9, 1992|title=Michael Jackson: The Making of 'The King of Pop'|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701044839/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/michael-jackson-the-making-of-the-king-of-pop-19920109|archive-date=July 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> During this time most work had proceeded with three producers (Bill Bottrell, Bruce Swedien and Bryan Loren) in three distinct studios with Jackson.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3929}} Bottrell co-wrote and produced \"Give In to Me\" and \"Black or White,\" while also receiving writing credits for \"Dangerous\" and production credits for \"Who Is It.\"<ref name=\"soundonsound\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/classic-tracks-michael-jackson-black-or-white|title=CLASSIC TRACKS: Michael Jackson 'Black Or White'|website=Sound on Sound|access-date=January 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101153116/https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/classic-tracks-michael-jackson-black-or-white|archive-date=November 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> He was previously forced out of the production of ''Bad'' by Quincy Jones, but Jackson brought him back for ''Dangerous'', in which he was known as the \"rock guy.\"{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3864}} Bottrell also introduced classically trained keyboardist Brad Buxer to Jackson. Buxer was originally hired as a technician for his expertise in electronic equipment. A fortuitous relationship grew between Jackson and Buxer, to which Buxer recalled, \"Musically speaking, we were on the same wavelength; we spoke the same language.\"{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3891}} The Jackson-Buxer partnership would continue for twenty years.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3892}} \n\nFor most of the rhythm tracks, Jackson worked with Loren at [[Westlake Recording Studios|Westlake Studios]]. Their work had begun since the end of Jackson's [[Bad (tour)|''Bad'' tour]], and together they recorded \"Work That Body,\" \"She Got It,\" \"Serious Effect,\" \"Do Not Believe It,\" \"Seven Digits,\" and \"Man in Black.\"{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3951}} Loren wanted to recapture the organic R&B feeling of Jackson's past albums like ''[[Off the Wall]]'' and ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]''.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3952}} [[LL Cool J]] was invited to rap on \"Serious Effect\" and \"Truth about Youth,\" because Jackson wanted to add hip-hop to the record. The rapper had been critical of Jackson but changed his tune to praise after their collaboration.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3962}} Ultimately, however, none of Loren's recordings would make the final cut.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=4152}}\n\nThough Loren's material was strong, it was not up to Jackson's standards, and he was searching a newer type of sound that would be as compelling as Janet Jackson's ''[[Rhythm Nation (album)|Rhythm Nation]]''. Jackson discovered [[new jack swing]], a more aggressive and urban sound, after reaching out to [[L.A. Reid|Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]] and [[Babyface (musician)|Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds]], who were producers of that style of music.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3978}} In June 1990, Jackson hired Teddy Riley, also known as the \"Father of New Jack Swing.\" By then, Jackson had already recorded over fifty songs.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=4000}} Initially recording at Record One, Riley moved to nearby [[Larrabee Sound Studios|Larrabee Studios]] after a few weeks, because other producers were working at the Sherman Oaks Studio.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=4023}} Unlike Loren, Riley wanted ''Dangerous'' to sound different from Jackson's earlier work, and Jackson admired Riley for bringing in newer styles. In wanting everything to sound unique, Jackson challenged Riley to create new instrumentals without relying on stock [[Synthesizer|synth]] and [[drum machine]] sounds.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=4045}} Riley rehauled some of Loren's work such as \"She Got It\" and \"Serious Effect.\" \"[[Jam (song)|Jam]]\" and \"Dangerous\" continued developing with Riley. \"Dangerous\" was originally recorded with Bottrell, but Jackson was not satisfied until improvements were made.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=4058}} Riley said he brought Jackson's music back to its \"barest forms\" of R&B and funk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/michael-jackson-recording-dangerous-with-teddy-riley-211776|title=Michael Jackson: recording Dangerous with Teddy Riley|first=Future Music2009-07-03T12:24:00 183Z|last=Guitars|website=MusicRadar|accessdate=November 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725222801/https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/michael-jackson-recording-dangerous-with-teddy-riley-211776|archive-date=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBy spring of 1991, Jackson prepared the track list for the final cut of ''Dangerous'' which included several tracks he recorded with Riley: \"Remember the Time,\" \"Dangerous,\" and \"[[In the Closet]].\" For \"In the Closet,\" Jackson had planned a duet with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] which did not materialize. Her half of the duet was then changed and replaced with Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=4098}} The meeting with [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] took more than a year to coordinate, and the two musicians collaborated on \"Black or White\" and \"[[Give In to Me]].\"{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=4112}} Swedien recalled recording sessions lasting up to 18 hours. On one occasion, he ordered Jackson not to leave the studio until he sang the vocals for \"Keep the Faith\" all the way through: \"This was scary but he did it. He didn't leave the studio until dawn.\"<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7690901.html|title='Dangerous' breakdown|date=December 12, 1991|newspaper=The Boston Globe|first=Michael|last=Blowen|accessdate=June 25, 2018|via=[[Highbeam Research]]|url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626001448/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7690901.html|archive-date=June 26, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nJackson had spent an exorbitant $10 million to record ''Dangerous''.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=4132}} Executives at Epic set a deadline for the album, wanting it released before November 28, 1991, [[Thanksgiving Day]].

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on. However, what it did do was to make me want to read the book \u2013 if only to find out what happened!\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sibley |first=Brian |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=6}}</ref> Jackson bought a tie-in paperback edition.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books. To allow the story to be clearer for viewers, Jackson takes a more [[chronology|chronological]] approach to the story than did Tolkien. During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters.<ref name=\"FOTR SEE\" />\n\nEarlier versions of the script included additional characters like Fatty Bolger, Glorfindel, Elladan, Elrohir, Erkenbrand, Imrahil and Forlong.<ref name=\"quest\">{{Cite book |author=Brian Sibley |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2006 |isbn=0-00-717558-2 |location=London |pages=329\u201387 |chapter=Quest for the Ring|author-link=Brian Sibley}}</ref> At one point, Jackson even considered reintroducing Tom Bombadil in a cameo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugEFwc5bMB8&list=PLCZgoww3m_249koI9ngypkNy5kKy3J3SX&index=70 |title=Philippa Boyens interview in Comic-Con, 2014 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> Gimli was going to swear throughout the films, and Arwen would join the Fellowship in Rohan and share a nude scene with Aragorn in the pools of the Glittering Caves.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Anything You Can Imagine |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=200\u2013203}}</ref>\n\nJackson hired long-time collaborator [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] to lead [[Weta Workshop]] on five major design elements: armour, weapons, [[prosthetic makeup]], creatures, and miniatures.

He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books.

Jackson has since founded his own film production company, [[Wingnut Films]], as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as ''The Lord of the Rings'' series.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.
