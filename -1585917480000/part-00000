Applications of technologies encompassing these characteristics can be found in subterranean living and space habitats. The tunnels of Pyh\u00e4salmi Mine bear a resemblance to the conditions of pressurized lava tunnels in Mars and as such provide a good environment to test out such innovations. The project will also compare the differences in production above ground and underground.  In July 2019 the first insect farm was built in lab 2 at 1430 meters underground. The first species grown there is house crickets ([[House cricket|Acheta domesticus]]) and the first generation has been successfully harvested. Due to the location of the farm, heating expenses are eliminated because the geothermal energy keeps the temperature at a constant 25 degrees. The crickets produced during the project cannot be sold because of legislation, but have been made into product samples.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.talouselama.fi/uutiset/pyhasalmen-tyhjentyvassa-kaivoksessa-kasvatetaan-nyt-sirkkoja-maan-alla-testataan-ruokatuotantoa-joka-voisi-toimia-myos-marsin-laavatunneleissa/19cb54f8-1f8c-435e-a705-dbd3bd527f1e|title=Pyh\u00e4salmen tyhjentyv\u00e4ss\u00e4 kaivoksessa kasvatetaan nyt sirkkoja \u2013 maan alla testataan ruokatuotantoa, joka voisi toimia my\u00f6s Marsin laavatunneleissa|last=Palm\u00e9n|first=Joanna|website=Talousel\u00e4m\u00e4|language=fi|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://callio.info/2017/wp-content/uploads/CEIFM-pressijulkaisu-29.8_v2.pdf|title=Hy\u00f6nteistuotantoa Pyh\u00e4salmen kaivoksessa|last=|first=|date=29 August 2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Plant Production in Mine ===\nPlant Production in Mine was a project and study conducted by the Natural Resources Institute of Finland (LUKE)[https://www.luke.fi/en/] in Callio Lab laboratories at 660 meters underground. The goal of the project was to study how plant production can be implemented in a controlled underground environment. The experiment began with growing common hop ([[Humulus lupulus]]) in April 2018 using hydroponic technology. Fertilization, watering, air ventilation and temperature was controlled through automation and remote control. If optimal growing conditions can be characterized, this would broach the possibility of year round production of hops with hundreds of harvests instead of just one. This could have the potential of replacing foreign imported hops for national breweries. Other plants that have been grown in the labs are potato, woad, and common nettle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/pohjois-suomi/humala-kasvaa-pyhasalmen-kaivoksessa-660-metrin-syvyydessa-maan-alla-vuodenajalla-tai-vuorokaudenajalla-ei-ole-valia/805529/|title=Humala kasvaa Pyh\u00e4salmen kaivoksessa 660 metrin syvyydess\u00e4 \u2013 maan alla vuodenajalla tai vuorokaudenajalla ei ole v\u00e4li\u00e4|website=Kaleva.fi|language=fi|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/galleriat/pyhasalmen-kaivoksessa-kasvatetaan-nokkosta-ja-perunaa/10269/|title=Kuvagalleria: Pyh\u00e4salmen kaivoksessa kasvatetaan nokkosta ja perunaa|last=Kontiainen|first=Jarmo|date=July 7, 2017|website=Kaleva.fi|language=fi|access-date=2018-03-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Intelligent Lighting ===\nThe Intelligent Lighting pilot study conducted at Pyh\u00e4salmi Mine is studying the effects of artificial light in an underground working environment.

As was customary at the time, as populations increased, other counties were organized from its land area. Woodward Avenue and the [[Detroit and Pontiac Railroad]] helped draw settlers in the 1840s. By 1840, Oakland had more than fifty lumber mills, processing wood harvested from the region and the Upper Peninsula. Pontiac, located on the [[Clinton River (Michigan)|Clinton River]], was Oakland's first town and became the county seat. After the Civil War, Oakland was still primarily a rural, agricultural county with numerous isolated villages. By the end of the 19th century, three rail lines served Pontiac, and the city attracted carriage and wagon factories. In the late 1890s streetcars were constructed here and to Detroit.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAt that time, developers made southern Oakland County a suburb of Detroit; a Cincinnati firm platted a section of Royal Oak called \"Urbanrest.\" Migration worked both ways. Several thousand people moved from Oakland County farms to Detroit as the city attracted factories. By 1910, a number of rich [[Detroit]]ers had summer homes and some year-round residences in what became Bloomfield Hills. The auto age enveloped Pontiac in the early 1900s. The [[Oakland (automobile)|Oakland Motor Car Company]] was founded in 1907 and became a part of General Motors Corp., which was soon Pontiac's dominant firm.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the 1950s, the Detroit metropolitan population began migrating to the suburbs, aided by the GI Bill for veterans and federal subsidies for highways and freeways.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Oakland County is among the ten highest-income counties in the United States with more than one million population.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The median price of a home in Oakland County increased to $164,697, more than $30,000 above the national median. Oakland County is home to popular super-regional shopping malls such as [[Somerset Collection]], [[Twelve Oaks Mall]], and [[Great Lakes Crossing Outlets]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOn March 10, 2020, Michigan reported the first 2 coronavirus cases, one of which was in Oakland County.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|907|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|868|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|40|sqmi}} (4.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_26.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 27, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113024015/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_26.txt|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOakland County was originally divided into 25 separate [[townships]], which are listed below. Each township is roughly equal in size at six miles (10&nbsp;km) by six miles, for a total township area of {{convert|36|sqmi|km2}}.  The roots of this design were born out of the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and the subsequent [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787.  Oakland County itself is a prime example of the land policy that was established, as all townships are equal in size (save for slight variations due to waterways).  Section 16 in each township was reserved for financing and maintaining public education, and even today many schools in Oakland County townships are located within that section.\n\n[[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], where the city of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] is located, borders Oakland County to the south. [[8 Mile Road]], also known as \"Baseline Road\" in some areas, is the boundary between these counties.  The baseline was used during the original surveying for Michigan, and it serves as the northern/southern boundaries for counties from [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] to [[Lake Michigan]]. As more working and middle-class populations moved to the suburbs from the 1950s on, this divide (8 Mile Road) became historically known as an unofficial racial dividing line between what became the predominantly [[Black people|black]] city and almost exclusively [[whites|white]] suburbs.\n\nSince the late 20th century, however, the patterns of ''de facto'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]] have faded as the suburbs have become more diverse. Middle-class African Americans have left the city, settling in inner-ring suburbs, notably Southfield (75.08%), west of [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]]. Based on the 2010 Census, the following cities also have significant minority ethnic populations: Farmington (25.3%), Farmington Hills (31.7%), Novi (30.12%), [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]] (62.61%), Lathrup Village (72.97%), Orchard Lake Village (16.08%), Rochester Hills (20.94%), Troy (29.4%), Wixom (26.28%), West Bloomfield (24.0%), Bloomfield (18.28%), Bloomfield Hills (14.2%), [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] (17.2%), and Madison Heights (17.7%). Ferndale has a concentration of [[Arab Americans]], who also live in nearby areas, and numerous [[Asian Americans]], particularly [[India]]ns, have also settled in these areas.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer County]] (northeast)\n*[[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] (northwest)\n*[[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb County]] (east)\n*[[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] (southeast)\n*[[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]] (southwest)\n*[[Livingston County, Michigan|Livingston County]] (west)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 330\n|1830= 4911\n|1840= 23646\n|1850= 31270\n|1860= 38261\n|1870= 40867\n|1880= 41537\n|1890= 41245\n|1900= 44792\n|1910= 49576\n|1920= 90050\n|1930= 211251\n|1940= 254068\n|1950= 396001\n|1960= 690259\n|1970= 907871\n|1980= 1011793\n|1990= 1083592\n|2000= 1194156\n|2010= 1202362\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1259201\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{citeweb|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml|title=QuickFacts|accessdate=April 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717015826/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16/16055.html|archive-date=July 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 27, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=September 27, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811110448/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/|archivedate=August 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/mi190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 27, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215142038/http://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/mi190090.txt|archivedate=February 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

The [[county commission|county board of commissioners]] controls the budget but has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions&mdash;police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. &mdash; are the responsibility of individual cities and townships. Oakland County has an elected sheriff, and his or her law-enforcement services are used throughout the county. Fourteen cities/townships do not have municipal police forces, but rather contract with the sheriff for police services specific to the municipalities. For instance, the city of Rochester Hills does not have a \"Rochester Hills Police Department,\" but instead has an established sheriff substation in the city with deputies who are dedicated to that city only. That branch operates as the Oakland County Sheriff's Department, Rochester Hills substation. The sheriff operates in the same manner with other municipalities who opt not to have their own police agencies. This typically is a cost-effective way for municipalities to provide police services to its citizens.  The county sheriff also maintains a civil division, marine division, alcohol and traffic enforcement units, and an aviation division.\n\n===Elected officials===\n* [[County Executive]]: [[David Coulter (politician)|Dave Coulter]] (Democrat){{ref|a}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/03/l-brooks-patterson-oakland-county-gerald-poisson/1909186001/|title=L.

However, since the 1990s it has become more competitive and has voted for the Democratic candidate for President in the last six elections.\n\nIn 1996, Bill Clinton became the first Democrat to secure the plurality of Oakland County presidential votes since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and only the fourth to do so since 1892. Al Gore and John Kerry also carried the county, by narrow margins, against George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, respectively. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win a majority in the county since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. (''See table at right''.) He again carried the county in 2012, though by a smaller margin.\n\nWhile the Democratic Party has found increasing success in Presidential elections in Oakland County, the state Republican Party has remained strong in recent gubernatorial and state elections. The county favored Governor [[Rick Snyder]] (R) by a 22-percent margin in the [http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/MI/Oakland/22923/42960/en/summary.html 2010] statewide elections and again by a 12-point margin in [http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/MI/Oakland/54212/149511/en/summary.html 2014]. While Republicans held a majority on the County Commission for most of its history, following the 2018 elections, there are 11 Democrats and 10 Republicans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theoaklandpress.com/news/elections/oakland-county-board-of-commissioners-majority-democratic-for-third-time/article_04063cb6-e2a4-11e8-b25c-530fb554a487.html|title=Oakland County Board of Commissioners majority Democratic for third time in history|last=Cavitt|first=Mark|date=November 7, 2018|publisher=[[The Oakland Press]]|accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[116th United States Congress|116th Congress]], Oakland County is represented by four Democrats, [[Brenda Lawrence]] ([[Michigan's 14th congressional district|14th]]), [[Andy Levin]] ([[Michigan's 9th congressional district|9th]]), [[Haley Stevens]] ([[Michigan's 11th congressional district|11th]]) and [[Elissa Slotkin]] ([[Michigan's 8th congressional district|8th]]).

This airport is in Wayne County in the city of [[Detroit]].\n\n===Major highways===\n*{{jct|state=MI|I|75|name1=[[Walter Chrysler|Walter P. Chrysler]] Freeway}} is the main north-south highway in the region, serving Flint, Pontiac, Troy, and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Fisher and Detroit-Toledo Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of [[Lake Erie]].\n*{{jct|country=USA|I|96}} runs northwest-southeast through Oakland County and (as the Jeffries Freeway) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.\n*{{jct|state=MI|I|275}} runs north-south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and I-696 in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit.\n*{{jct|country=USA|I|696|name1=[[Walter Reuther|Walter P. Reuther]] Freeway}} runs east-west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit.  Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit.\n*{{jct|state=MI|US|24}} ends just outside of Clarkston at I-75. To the south, US 24 serves suburban Detroit and [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]] before entering [[Ohio]]. Much of US 24 in Oakland County is named Telegraph Road, and it is a major north-south road extending from [[Toledo, Ohio]], through Monroe, Wayne, and Oakland Counties to [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. It gained notoriety in a song (''Telegraph Road'') by the group [[Dire Straits]].\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|1|name1=Woodward Avenue}} has a northern terminus in Pontiac. The route continues southerly from Oakland County into the City of Detroit, ending downtown. The Detroit Zoo is located along M-1 in Oakland County.  M-1 is also home to the [[Woodward Dream Cruise]], a classic-car cruise from Pontiac to [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] that is held in August. It is the largest single-day classic-car cruise in America.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|5}}\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|10|name1=[[John C.

To the north, the route continues to [[Lapeer, Michigan|Lapeer]] and beyond. Note: M-24 and US 24 do not intersect at present, although this was the case until the 1950s.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|39|name1=Southfield Freeway}} runs north-south from I-94 in Allen Park to Southfield.  North of Nine Mile Road, the freeway ends and continues as Southfield Road into Birmingham.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|59}} (Highland Road [from Pontiac westerly], Huron Street [within Pontiac] and Veterans Memorial Freeway [Pontiac to [[Utica, Michigan|Utica]]]), continues east in Macomb County as Hall Road to [[Clinton Charter Township, Michigan|Clinton Township]] and west to I-96 near [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]]\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|102}} Perhaps better known as 8 Mile Road, M-102 follows the Oakland\u2013Wayne county line for most of its length. 8 Mile Road, known by many due to the film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', forms the dividing line between Detroit on the south and the suburbs of Macomb and Oakland counties on the north. It is also known as Baseline Road outside of Detroit, because it coincides with the [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] used in surveying Michigan; that baseline is also the boundary for a number of Michigan counties. It is designated M-102 for much of its length in Wayne County.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|150|name1=Rochester Road}} serves as a spur highway from M-59 into the city of Rochester.\n*[[Grand River Avenue]] connects the suburbs of Brighton, Novi, and Farmington to downtown Detroit. The avenue follows the route of old [[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|US&nbsp;16]] before I-96 replaced it in 1962. It is one of the five roads planned by Judge August Woodward to radiate out from Detroit and connect the city to other parts of the state.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Wolverine (train)|Wolverine]] serves Oakland County with 3 daily trains each way, stopping in [[Pontiac Transportation Center|Pontiac]], [[Troy Transit Center|Troy]], [[Royal Oak station (Michigan)|Royal Oak]], and continuing on to [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]].\n\n===Mile roads===\n{{Main|Mile Road System (Detroit)}}\n*Surface-street navigation in metro Detroit is commonly anchored by \"mile roads,\" major east-west surface streets that are spaced at one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) intervals and increment as one travels north and away from the city center. Mile roads sometimes have two names, the numeric name (e.g., 15 Mile Road), used in Macomb County, and a local name (e.g., Maple Road), used in Oakland County (for the most part).\n\n===Bicycling===\nThe conditions on most non-residential roads in Oakland County are not favorable to bicycling. Exceptions to this are primarily in the inner-ring suburbs within the southeast corner of the county. This is due to their [[Grid plan|street grid]].\n\nA primary reason for these unfavorable cycling conditions is the [[Road Commission for Oakland County]] has a policy of not accommodating bicycles on the road. As a result, some communities have designated [[sidepath]]s (locally called \"safety paths\") as bike routes which do not meet the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) guidelines for bicycling facilities and have been found to be less safe than on-road bike facilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.massbike.org/resources/stats.htm#sidewalk |title=Risk of Sidewalk and Wrong-way Riding |accessdate=March 17, 2007 |work=Bicyclist Injuries: Learning from the Statistics |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520071232/http://www.massbike.org/resources/stats.htm#sidewalk <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 20, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, there are no designated [[League of American Bicyclists#Bicycle Friendly Communities|Bicycle Friendly Communities]] within Oakland County.\n\nOnly the city of [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] has a built comprehensive bicycle network of [[bike lanes]] and signed shared roadways.\n\n==Education==\nThe County of Oakland counterpart in public education (K-12) is the [[Oakland Schools]], an [[Intermediate school district]].\n\n===Higher education===\nOakland County is home to several institutions of higher education.\n*[[Baker College]],  [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] campus\n*[[Oakland University]], [[Rochester, Michigan|Rochester]]\n*The [[Western Michigan University Thomas M.

As was customary at the time, as populations increased, other counties were organized from its land area. Woodward Avenue and the [[Detroit and Pontiac Railroad]] helped draw settlers in the 1840s. By 1840, Oakland had more than fifty lumber mills, processing wood harvested from the region and the Upper Peninsula. Pontiac, located on the [[Clinton River (Michigan)|Clinton River]], was Oakland's first town and became the county seat. After the Civil War, Oakland was still primarily a rural, agricultural county with numerous isolated villages. By the end of the 19th century, three rail lines served Pontiac, and the city attracted carriage and wagon factories. In the late 1890s streetcars were constructed here and to Detroit.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAt that time, developers made southern Oakland County a suburb of Detroit; a Cincinnati firm platted a section of Royal Oak called \"Urbanrest.\" Migration worked both ways. Several thousand people moved from Oakland County farms to Detroit as the city attracted factories. By 1910, a number of rich [[Detroit]]ers had summer homes and some year-round residences in what became Bloomfield Hills. The auto age enveloped Pontiac in the early 1900s. The [[Oakland (automobile)|Oakland Motor Car Company]] was founded in 1907 and became a part of General Motors Corp., which was soon Pontiac's dominant firm.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the 1950s, the Detroit metropolitan population began migrating to the suburbs, aided by the GI Bill for veterans and federal subsidies for highways and freeways.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Oakland County is among the ten highest-income counties in the United States with more than one million population.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The median price of a home in Oakland County increased to $164,697, more than $30,000 above the national median. Oakland County is home to popular super-regional shopping malls such as [[Somerset Collection]], [[Twelve Oaks Mall]], and [[Great Lakes Crossing Outlets]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOn March 10, 2020, Michigan reported the first 2 coronavirus cases, one of which was in Oakland County.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|907|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|868|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|40|sqmi}} (4.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_26.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 27, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113024015/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_26.txt|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOakland County was originally divided into 25 separate [[townships]], which are listed below. Each township is roughly equal in size at six miles (10&nbsp;km) by six miles, for a total township area of {{convert|36|sqmi|km2}}.  The roots of this design were born out of the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and the subsequent [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787.  Oakland County itself is a prime example of the land policy that was established, as all townships are equal in size (save for slight variations due to waterways).  Section 16 in each township was reserved for financing and maintaining public education, and even today many schools in Oakland County townships are located within that section.\n\n[[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], where the city of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] is located, borders Oakland County to the south. [[8 Mile Road]], also known as \"Baseline Road\" in some areas, is the boundary between these counties.  The baseline was used during the original surveying for Michigan, and it serves as the northern/southern boundaries for counties from [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] to [[Lake Michigan]]. As more working and middle-class populations moved to the suburbs from the 1950s on, this divide (8 Mile Road) became historically known as an unofficial racial dividing line between what became the predominantly [[Black people|black]] city and almost exclusively [[whites|white]] suburbs.\n\nSince the late 20th century, however, the patterns of ''de facto'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]] have faded as the suburbs have become more diverse. Middle-class African Americans have left the city, settling in inner-ring suburbs, notably Southfield (75.08%), west of [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]].

The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.90 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.70 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $86,567, making Oakland County the 21st wealthiest county in the United States: (http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/richest-counties-in-the-united-states.html).

The [[county commission|county board of commissioners]] controls the budget but has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions&mdash;police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. &mdash; are the responsibility of individual cities and townships. Oakland County has an elected sheriff, and his or her law-enforcement services are used throughout the county. Fourteen cities/townships do not have municipal police forces, but rather contract with the sheriff for police services specific to the municipalities. For instance, the city of Rochester Hills does not have a \"Rochester Hills Police Department,\" but instead has an established sheriff substation in the city with deputies who are dedicated to that city only. That branch operates as the Oakland County Sheriff's Department, Rochester Hills substation. The sheriff operates in the same manner with other municipalities who opt not to have their own police agencies. This typically is a cost-effective way for municipalities to provide police services to its citizens.  The county sheriff also maintains a civil division, marine division, alcohol and traffic enforcement units, and an aviation division.\n\n===Elected officials===\n* [[County Executive]]: [[David Coulter (politician)|Dave Coulter]] (Democrat){{ref|a}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/03/l-brooks-patterson-oakland-county-gerald-poisson/1909186001/|title=L.

However, since the 1990s it has become more competitive and has voted for the Democratic candidate for President in the last six elections.\n\nIn 1996, Bill Clinton became the first Democrat to secure the plurality of Oakland County presidential votes since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and only the fourth to do so since 1892. Al Gore and John Kerry also carried the county, by narrow margins, against George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, respectively. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win a majority in the county since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. (''See table at right''.) He again carried the county in 2012, though by a smaller margin.\n\nWhile the Democratic Party has found increasing success in Presidential elections in Oakland County, the state Republican Party has remained strong in recent gubernatorial and state elections. The county favored Governor [[Rick Snyder]] (R) by a 22-percent margin in the [http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/MI/Oakland/22923/42960/en/summary.html 2010] statewide elections and again by a 12-point margin in [http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/MI/Oakland/54212/149511/en/summary.html 2014].

Young International Airport|Coleman A. Young International Airport (DET)]] (Detroit) - General aviation only. This airport is in Wayne County in the city of [[Detroit]].\n\n===Major highways===\n*{{jct|state=MI|I|75|name1=[[Walter Chrysler|Walter P. Chrysler]] Freeway}} is the main north-south highway in the region, serving Flint, Pontiac, Troy, and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Fisher and Detroit-Toledo Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of [[Lake Erie]].\n*{{jct|country=USA|I|96}} runs northwest-southeast through Oakland County and (as the Jeffries Freeway) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.\n*{{jct|state=MI|I|275}} runs north-south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and I-696 in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit.\n*{{jct|country=USA|I|696|name1=[[Walter Reuther|Walter P. Reuther]] Freeway}} runs east-west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit.  Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit.\n*{{jct|state=MI|US|24}} ends just outside of Clarkston at I-75. To the south, US 24 serves suburban Detroit and [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]] before entering [[Ohio]]. Much of US 24 in Oakland County is named Telegraph Road, and it is a major north-south road extending from [[Toledo, Ohio]], through Monroe, Wayne, and Oakland Counties to [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. It gained notoriety in a song (''Telegraph Road'') by the group [[Dire Straits]].\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|1|name1=Woodward Avenue}} has a northern terminus in Pontiac. The route continues southerly from Oakland County into the City of Detroit, ending downtown. The Detroit Zoo is located along M-1 in Oakland County.  M-1 is also home to the [[Woodward Dream Cruise]], a classic-car cruise from Pontiac to [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] that is held in August. It is the largest single-day classic-car cruise in America.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|5}}\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|10|name1=[[John C. Lodge]] Freeway}} runs largely parallel to I-75 from Southfield to downtown Detroit.  The service drives are named Northwestern Highway.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|15}} (Ortonville Road, Main Street in Clarkston)\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|24|name1=Lapeer Road}} has a southern terminus at I-75 northeast of Pontiac. To the north, the route continues to [[Lapeer, Michigan|Lapeer]] and beyond. Note: M-24 and US 24 do not intersect at present, although this was the case until the 1950s.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|39|name1=Southfield Freeway}} runs north-south from I-94 in Allen Park to Southfield.  North of Nine Mile Road, the freeway ends and continues as Southfield Road into Birmingham.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|59}} (Highland Road [from Pontiac westerly], Huron Street [within Pontiac] and Veterans Memorial Freeway [Pontiac to [[Utica, Michigan|Utica]]]), continues east in Macomb County as Hall Road to [[Clinton Charter Township, Michigan|Clinton Township]] and west to I-96 near [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]]\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|102}} Perhaps better known as 8 Mile Road, M-102 follows the Oakland\u2013Wayne county line for most of its length. 8 Mile Road, known by many due to the film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', forms the dividing line between Detroit on the south and the suburbs of Macomb and Oakland counties on the north. It is also known as Baseline Road outside of Detroit, because it coincides with the [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] used in surveying Michigan; that baseline is also the boundary for a number of Michigan counties. It is designated M-102 for much of its length in Wayne County.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|150|name1=Rochester Road}} serves as a spur highway from M-59 into the city of Rochester.\n*[[Grand River Avenue]] connects the suburbs of Brighton, Novi, and Farmington to downtown Detroit. The avenue follows the route of old [[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|US&nbsp;16]] before I-96 replaced it in 1962. It is one of the five roads planned by Judge August Woodward to radiate out from Detroit and connect the city to other parts of the state.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Wolverine (train)|Wolverine]] serves Oakland County with 3 daily trains each way, stopping in [[Pontiac Transportation Center|Pontiac]], [[Troy Transit Center|Troy]], [[Royal Oak station (Michigan)|Royal Oak]], and continuing on to [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]].\n\n===Mile roads===\n{{Main|Mile Road System (Detroit)}}\n*Surface-street navigation in metro Detroit is commonly anchored by \"mile roads,\" major east-west surface streets that are spaced at one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) intervals and increment as one travels north and away from the city center. Mile roads sometimes have two names, the numeric name (e.g., 15 Mile Road), used in Macomb County, and a local name (e.g., Maple Road), used in Oakland County (for the most part).\n\n===Bicycling===\nThe conditions on most non-residential roads in Oakland County are not favorable to bicycling. Exceptions to this are primarily in the inner-ring suburbs within the southeast corner of the county. This is due to their [[Grid plan|street grid]].\n\nA primary reason for these unfavorable cycling conditions is the [[Road Commission for Oakland County]] has a policy of not accommodating bicycles on the road. As a result, some communities have designated [[sidepath]]s (locally called \"safety paths\") as bike routes which do not meet the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) guidelines for bicycling facilities and have been found to be less safe than on-road bike facilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.massbike.org/resources/stats.htm#sidewalk |title=Risk of Sidewalk and Wrong-way Riding |accessdate=March 17, 2007 |work=Bicyclist Injuries: Learning from the Statistics |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520071232/http://www.massbike.org/resources/stats.htm#sidewalk <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 20, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, there are no designated [[League of American Bicyclists#Bicycle Friendly Communities|Bicycle Friendly Communities]] within Oakland County.\n\nOnly the city of [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] has a built comprehensive bicycle network of [[bike lanes]] and signed shared roadways.\n\n==Education==\nThe County of Oakland counterpart in public education (K-12) is the [[Oakland Schools]], an [[Intermediate school district]].\n\n===Higher education===\nOakland County is home to several institutions of higher education.\n*[[Baker College]],  [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] campus\n*[[Oakland University]], [[Rochester, Michigan|Rochester]]\n*The [[Western Michigan University Thomas M.

The Silverdome was also the site of [[Super Bowl XVI]], where the [[San Francisco 49ers]] defeated the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], the first of 5 Super Bowl titles for the 49ers.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2017, prior to the move to [[Little Caesars Arena]] in Detroit, the [[Detroit Pistons]] played their home games at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] and from 1978 to 1988, they played at the Pontiac Silverdome.\n\nThe Pontiac Silverdome has also hosted various other sporting events since it opened.\n\n==Communities==\n[[File:Oakland County, MI census map2.png|thumb|right|500px|[[United States Census|U.S. Census]] data map showing local municipal boundaries within Oakland County.

This course focuses on improving students' abilities to write in a university setting and introduces students to writing practices in the disciplines and professions.<ref>Duffy, John. \"[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/03/16/essay-value-first-year-writing-courses Essay on the Value of First-year Writing Courses].\" ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''.

Some institutions of higher education require only one term of FYC, while others require two or three courses.

This debate centers around how effective the first-year composition course is and the changes that need to be made to develop the field of composition. While most schools do require some form of the first-year composition course, there are some schools that have decided to abolish the first-year composition requirement. Some scholars, such as Sharon Crowley in ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays,'' argue that this requirement should be abolished. Crowley does not suggest the course itself be removed, only the requirement that all freshmen take the course. She states that students would still be interested in the course if the requirement was abolished and that removing the requirement would strengthen the field of composition. She implies that composition studies is marginalized within the university because of the view of the first-year composition course as a skill course. Removing the requirement, she states, would remove the association of composition studies with introductory courses, giving more acknowledgement to the field.<ref> Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1998. pg 241\u201343.

Web.</ref> However, there are scholars who do not agree with this stance, argue that the first-year composition course is needed in the university, and believe that the requirement should remain. Scholar David Smit is one critic who favors keeping the requirement. He suggests that the requirement can be kept and the curriculum and structure of the first-year composition course altered for improvement. Smit explains that many of the developmental goals of those who favor abolishing the requirement can still be achieved by offering more writing experiences. He proposes more genre writing in composition courses with a \"[[scaffolding]]\" progression of discipline writing. If this was done, he suggests, the concerns over the status of composition studies in the university would still be solved, as the course would no longer be seen as skills based.<ref> Smit, David.

The murder of Pope Innocent's papal legate [[Pierre de Castelnau]] in 1208 sparked the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229).

These inquisitions responded to large popular movements throughout Europe considered [[apostasy|apostate]] or heretical to [[Christianity]], in particular the [[Cathars]] in southern France and the [[Waldensians]] in both southern France and northern Italy. Other Inquisitions followed after these first inquisition movements. The legal basis for some inquisitorial activity came from [[Pope Innocent IV]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Ad extirpanda]]'' of 1252, which explicitly authorized (and defined the appropriate circumstances for) the use of [[torture]] by the Inquisition for eliciting confessions from heretics.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.0028-4289.2006.00142.x|title = Aquinas on Torture| journal=New Blackfriars| volume=87| issue=1009| pages=229\u2013237|year = 2006|last1 = Bishop|first1 = Jordan}}</ref> However, [[Nicholas Eymerich]], the inquisitor who wrote the \"Directorium Inquisitorum\", stated: 'Quaestiones sunt fallaces et ineficaces' (\"interrogations via torture are misleading and futile\").

By the end of the Middle Ages, [[England]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] were the only large western nations without a papal inquisition.\nMost inquisitors were friars who taught theology and/or law in the universities.

[[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] had asked [[Pope Leo X]] for the installation of the Inquisition in 1515, but only after his death in 1521 did [[Pope Paul III]] acquiesce.

Spain had [[Alhambra decree|expelled its Sephardi population in 1492]]; many of these Spanish Jews left Spain for Portugal but eventually were subject to inquisition there as well.\n\nThe Portuguese Inquisition held its first ''auto-da-f\u00e9'' in 1540. The Portuguese inquisitors mostly focused upon the [[Jew]]ish [[New Christians]] (i.e. ''[[conversos]]'' or ''[[marranos]]''). The Portuguese Inquisition expanded its scope of operations from Portugal to its colonial possessions, including Brazil, [[Cape Verde]], and [[Goa Inquisition|Goa]]. In the colonies, it continued as a religious court, investigating and trying cases of breaches of the tenets of orthodox Roman Catholicism until 1821. King [[John III of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o III]] (reigned 1521\u201357) extended the activity of the courts to cover [[censorship]], [[divination]], [[witchcraft]], and [[bigamy]]. Originally oriented for a religious action, the Inquisition exerted an influence over almost every aspect of Portuguese society: political, cultural, and social.\n\nThe [[Goa Inquisition]], which began in 1560, was initiated by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest [[Francis Xavier]] from his headquarters in Malacca, originally because of the [[New Christian]]s who were living there and also in Goa and the region whose population had reverted to [[Judaism]]. The Goa inquisition also focused upon Catholic converts from [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]] who were thought to have returned to their original ways. In addition, this inquisition prosecuted non-converts who broke prohibitions against the observance of [[Hindu]] or [[Muslim]] rites or interfered with Portuguese attempts to convert non-Christians to Catholicism.<ref name=\"Salomon, H.

These inquisitions responded to large popular movements throughout Europe considered [[apostasy|apostate]] or heretical to [[Christianity]], in particular the [[Cathars]] in southern France and the [[Waldensians]] in both southern France and northern Italy. Other Inquisitions followed after these first inquisition movements. The legal basis for some inquisitorial activity came from [[Pope Innocent IV]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Ad extirpanda]]'' of 1252, which explicitly authorized (and defined the appropriate circumstances for) the use of [[torture]] by the Inquisition for eliciting confessions from heretics.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.0028-4289.2006.00142.x|title = Aquinas on Torture| journal=New Blackfriars| volume=87| issue=1009| pages=229\u2013237|year = 2006|last1 = Bishop|first1 = Jordan}}</ref> However, [[Nicholas Eymerich]], the inquisitor who wrote the \"Directorium Inquisitorum\", stated: 'Quaestiones sunt fallaces et ineficaces' (\"interrogations via torture are misleading and futile\").

So the Inquisition in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], in the lands of the [[Reconquista]] counties and kingdoms like [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], had a special socio-political basis as well as more fundamental religious motives.\n\nIn some parts of Spain towards the end of the 14th century, there was a wave of violent [[anti-Judaism]], encouraged by the preaching of [[Ferrand Martinez]], [[Archdeacon]] of [[\u00c9cija]]. In the [[pogrom]]s of June 1391 in Seville, hundreds of Jews were killed, and the [[synagogue]] was completely destroyed.

Forced baptism was contrary to the law of the Catholic Church, and theoretically anybody who had been forcibly baptized could legally return to Judaism. However, this was very narrowly interpreted. Legal definitions of the time theoretically acknowledged that a forced baptism was not a valid sacrament, but confined this to cases where it was literally administered by physical force. A person who had consented to baptism under threat of death or serious injury was still regarded as a voluntary convert, and accordingly forbidden to revert to Judaism.<ref>[[Raymond of Pe\u00f1afort]], ''Summa'', lib. 1 p.33, citing D.45 c.5.</ref>  After the public violence, many of the converted \"felt it safer to remain in their new religion\".<ref>Kamen, ''Spanish Inquisition'', p. 10.</ref> Thus, after 1391, a new social group appeared and were referred to as ''[[conversos]]'' or ''New Christians''.\n\nKing [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] established the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478.

The Goa inquisition also focused upon Catholic converts from [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]] who were thought to have returned to their original ways.

In February 2020, a WHO spokesperson clarified that \"there is no official category [for a pandemic]\".{{efn|For clarification, WHO does not use the old system of six phases\u2014ranging from phase{{nbsp}}1 (no reports of animal influenza causing human infections) to phase{{nbsp}}6 (a pandemic)\u2014that some people may be familiar with from H1N1 in 2009.}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-who-idUKKCN20I0PD|title=WHO says it no longer uses 'pandemic' category, but virus still emergency|date=24 February 2020|work=Reuters|access-date=29 February 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ''ad interim'' for Health Security and Environment, WHO said \"An easy way to think about pandemic{{nbsp}}... is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

Jones\u2019s work challenges us to understand the frameworks of modernism, which embraced black musical forms but excluded black visual art from its canon\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cassel Oliver|first1=Valerie|title=Outside the Lines|date=2014|publisher=Houston: Contemporary Arts Museum|location=Houston, Texas|page=145|isbn=9781933619460|oclc=902842760}}</ref> During ''Absorb / Diffuse,'' her fall 2011 exhibition at [[The Kitchen]] in New York City, Jones presented a piece titled ''From The Low'', which is a sound piece that has multiple music samples, ranging from jazz to modern electronica. ''From The Low'' presents her political statement: that African-American artists and musicians are absent from modernism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artspace.com/jennie_c__jones|title=Jennie C.

With the amalgamation of industrial acoustic materials, often used in recording studios and listening rooms, Jones's art focuses on building a bridge between two-dimensional works, architecture, and sound.
