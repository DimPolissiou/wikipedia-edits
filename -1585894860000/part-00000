Jarvis and a core team summited Carstensz Pyramid (4,884&nbsp;m) in Indonesia, and Mount Stanley (5,109&nbsp;m) and Mount Baker (4,844&nbsp;m) in Uganda. Simultaneously, other 25zero teams climbed Mount Kenya (5,199&nbsp;m), Kilimanjaro (5,895&nbsp;m) and a number of Ecuadorian peaks. Footage, observations and stories from these climbs were transmitted to a government-endorsed press conference for 25zero at COP21 in Paris.\n\n=== 2016 ===\nIn 2016, Jarvis and colleague Royal Marines Sergeant Major Barry Gray went on an information-gathering and mountain-climbing expedition to Ecuador for the 25zero project. They successfully summited three glaciated mountains in Ecuador: Illiniza Sur (5,248&nbsp;m), Antisana (5,704&nbsp;m) and Chimborazo (6,310&nbsp;m). The trip coincided with the ongoing UN climate change talks in Marrakech ([[COP22]]).\n\n=== 2017 ===\nIn September 2017, Jarvis together with Ecuadorian climbers Edgar Parra and Ethan Sigle summited Carihuazo (5,018&nbsp;m), and climbed and documented glacier decline on Cayambe (5,790&nbsp;m) and Cotopaxi (5,897&nbsp;m).\n\n=== 2018 ===\nIn June 2018, Jarvis assembled a large climbing team, including a film crew and several social media and mountaineering identities, to undertake climbs in East Africa, including Kilimanjaro, Mount Speke, and Mount Stanley.\n\n== Awards ==\n25zero (and the project team) has received a number of awards for contribution to conservation and public education.\n\n=== Australian Geographic Society, 2016 ===\nThe project has received citation through the annual awards of the [[Australian Geographic]] Society, with project leader Tim Jarvis receiving the title of Conservationist of the Year in 2016, for his work on 25zero.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2016/10/winners-of-australian-geographic-societys-2016-awards|title=Winners of the 2016 Australian Geographic Society Awards|last=|first=|date=27 October 2016|website=Australian Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 September 2017}}</ref> The Society had also supported the expedition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/adventure/2015/11/tim-jarvis-25zero-intro|title=Tim Jarvis 25zero expedition: background|last=|first=|date=27 November 2015|website=Australian Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Bettison-James Award, 2016 ===\nJarvis was jointly awarded the Jim Bettison and Helen James Award in 2016 in recognition of the 25zero project.<ref name=\":1\" /> The award is patronised by the Jim Bettison and Helen James Foundation, and recognises \"lifelong high achievement in an area of expertise and enable further work of benefit to the community\"<ref name=\":0\" /> and administered by the [[Adelaide Film Festival]] and the [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Glaciology]]\n", "text_old": "'''25zero''' is a mountaineering project, tracking [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|equatorial glacial melt]] and raising awareness of the impacts of [[climate change]], led by explorer<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rnafternoons/australias-50-trailblazing-explorers/6977262|title=Meet Australia's trailblazing explorers|last=Morris|first=Emma|date=26 November 2015|work=ABC Radio National|access-date=16 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> [[Tim Jarvis]] [[Order of Australia|AM]].

It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] representative of the family [[Phascolarctidae]] and its closest living relatives are the [[wombat]]s, which comprise the family [[Vombatidae]]. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[South Australia]]. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of {{convert|60|\u2013|85|cm|abbr=on}} and weighs {{convert|4|\u2013|15|kg|0|abbr=on}}. [[Fur]] colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate [[subspecies]], but this is disputed.\n\nKoalas typically inhabit open [[eucalypt]] woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and [[maternal bond|bonding]] exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males [[animal communication|communicate]] with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from [[scent gland]]s located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' [[pouch (marsupial)|pouches]], where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as [[Marsupial#Early development|joeys]], are fully [[weaned]] around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various [[pathogen]]s, such as [[Chlamydiaceae]] bacteria and the [[koala retrovirus]].\n\nKoalas were hunted by [[Indigenous Australians]] and depicted in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|myths]] and [[cave art]] for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist [[George Perry (naturalist)|George Perry]]. Botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] wrote the first detailed scientific [[species description|description]] of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist [[John Gould]] illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a [[symbol of Australia]]. Koalas are listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale [[culling]]s in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. [[Animal sanctuary|Sanctuaries]] were established, and [[species translocation|translocation]] efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. Among the many threats to their existence are [[habitat destruction]] caused by agriculture, urbanisation, droughts and associated [[bushfire]]s, some related to climate change.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/30/climate-change-threats-koalas|title=Climate change compounds rising threats to koala|last=Bhandari|first=Neena|date=30 April 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 January 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Increased habitat loss may also increase risks from vehicle traffic, dog attacks, pesticides in waterways, and increased food competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.savethekoala.com/about-koalas/threats-koala|title=Threats to the Koala {{!}} Australian Koala Foundation|website=www.savethekoala.com|access-date=3 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunney|first=Daniel|last2=Gresser|first2=Shaan|last3=O'Neill|first3=Lisa|last4=Matthews|first4=Alison|last5=Rhodes|first5=Jonathan|date=30 November 2006|title=The impact of fire and dogs on Koalas at Port Stephens, New South Wales, using population viability analysis|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43478536_The_impact_of_fire_and_dogs_on_Koalas_at_Port_Stephens_New_South_Wales_using_population_viability_analysis|journal=Pacific Conservation Biology|volume=13|doi=10.1071/PC070189}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/11/koalas-near-extinction-myth-australia-fires/|title=No, koalas aren't 'functionally extinct'\u2014yet|last=Daly|first=Natasha|date=25 November 2019|website=National Geographic Animals|url-status=live|access-date=3 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word koala comes from the [[Sydney Language|Dharug]] ''gula'', meaning ''no water''.

Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force himself on a female, mounting her from behind, and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant or is more familiar. The bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders.

A common technique used to capture the animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark to the end of a long, thin pole, so as to form a [[noose]]. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick ([[waddy]]).<ref>Moyal, pp. 59\u201361.</ref> According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered [[taboo]] to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.<ref>Moyal, pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bush men and dogs, with a wall of animal skins (including koala pelts), between 1870-1900.jpg|thumb|upright=2:3|left|Bushmen photographed with their dogs in front of a wall of animal skins (including koala pelts), between 1870 and 1900]]\n\nThe koala was heavily hunted by European settlers in the early 20th century,<ref>Moyal, pp. 121\u201328.</ref> largely for its thick, soft fur.

For example, in 1930\u201331, 165 koalas were [[Species translocation|translocated]] to [[Quail Island (Victoria)|Quail Island]]. After a period of population growth, and subsequent overbrowsing of gum trees on the island, about 1,300 animals were released into mainland areas in 1944.  The practice of translocating koalas became commonplace; Victorian State manager Peter Menkorst estimated that from 1923 to 2006, about 25,000 animals were translocated to more than 250 release sites across Victoria.<ref>Moyal, pp. 166\u201367.</ref> Since the 1990s, government agencies have tried to control their numbers by culling, but public and international outcry has forced the use of translocation and [[Sterility (physiology)|sterilisation]], instead.<ref>Jackson, pp. 184\u201387.</ref>\n\n[[File:Panneaux koala kangourou.jpg|thumb|Road sign depicting a koala and a kangaroo]]\nOne of the biggest [[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] threats to the koala is [[habitat destruction]] and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]].

It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] representative of the family [[Phascolarctidae]] and its closest living relatives are the [[wombat]]s, which comprise the family [[Vombatidae]]. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[South Australia]]. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of {{convert|60|\u2013|85|cm|abbr=on}} and weighs {{convert|4|\u2013|15|kg|0|abbr=on}}. [[Fur]] colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate [[subspecies]], but this is disputed.\n\nKoalas typically inhabit open [[eucalypt]] woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and [[maternal bond|bonding]] exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males [[animal communication|communicate]] with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from [[scent gland]]s located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' [[pouch (marsupial)|pouches]], where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as [[Marsupial#Early development|joeys]], are fully [[weaned]] around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various [[pathogen]]s, such as [[Chlamydiaceae]] bacteria and the [[koala retrovirus]].\n\nKoalas were hunted by [[Indigenous Australians]] and depicted in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|myths]] and [[cave art]] for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist [[George Perry (naturalist)|George Perry]]. Botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] wrote the first detailed scientific [[species description|description]] of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist [[John Gould]] illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a [[symbol of Australia]]. Koalas are listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale [[culling]]s in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. [[Animal sanctuary|Sanctuaries]] were established, and [[species translocation|translocation]] efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. Among the many threats to their existence are [[habitat destruction]] caused by agriculture, urbanisation, droughts and associated [[bushfire]]s, some related to climate change.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/30/climate-change-threats-koalas|title=Climate change compounds rising threats to koala|last=Bhandari|first=Neena|date=30 April 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 January 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Increased habitat loss may also increase risks from vehicle traffic, dog attacks, pesticides in waterways, and increased food competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.savethekoala.com/about-koalas/threats-koala|title=Threats to the Koala {{!}} Australian Koala Foundation|website=www.savethekoala.com|access-date=3 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunney|first=Daniel|last2=Gresser|first2=Shaan|last3=O'Neill|first3=Lisa|last4=Matthews|first4=Alison|last5=Rhodes|first5=Jonathan|date=30 November 2006|title=The impact of fire and dogs on Koalas at Port Stephens, New South Wales, using population viability analysis|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43478536_The_impact_of_fire_and_dogs_on_Koalas_at_Port_Stephens_New_South_Wales_using_population_viability_analysis|journal=Pacific Conservation Biology|volume=13|doi=10.1071/PC070189}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/11/koalas-near-extinction-myth-australia-fires/|title=No, koalas aren't 'functionally extinct'\u2014yet|last=Daly|first=Natasha|date=25 November 2019|website=National Geographic Animals|url-status=live|access-date=3 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word koala comes from the [[Sydney Language|Dharug]] ''gula'', meaning ''no water''.

However, males do not appear to recognise these signs, and have been observed to mount non-oestrous females. Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force himself on a female, mounting her from behind, and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant or is more familiar. The bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. These fights may allow the female to assess which is dominant.<ref>Martin and Handasyde, pp. 58\u201360.</ref> Older males usually have accumulated scratches, scars, and cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids.<ref>Moyal, p.

The owner of the latter park, Noel Burnet, became the first to successfully breed koalas and earned a reputation as the foremost contemporary authority on the marsupial.<ref>Moyal, pp. 157\u201359.</ref> In 1934, [[David Fleay]], curator of Australian mammals at the [[Melbourne Zoo]], established the first Australian faunal enclosure at an Australian zoo, and featured the koala.

Fleay later continued his conservation efforts at [[Healesville Sanctuary]] and the [[David Fleay Wildlife Park]].<ref>Moyal, pp. 159\u201361.</ref>\n\nSince 1870, koalas have been introduced to several coastal and offshore islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island. Their numbers have significantly increased,<ref>Jackson, pp. 163\u201364.</ref> and since the islands are not large enough to sustain such high koala numbers, [[browsing (herbivory)|overbrowsing]] has become a problem.<ref>Jackson, p. 179.</ref> In the 1920s, Lewis initiated a program of large-scale relocation and rehabilitation programs to transfer koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced to new regions, with the intent of eventually returning them to their former range. For example, in 1930\u201331, 165 koalas were [[Species translocation|translocated]] to [[Quail Island (Victoria)|Quail Island]]. After a period of population growth, and subsequent overbrowsing of gum trees on the island, about 1,300 animals were released into mainland areas in 1944.  The practice of translocating koalas became commonplace; Victorian State manager Peter Menkorst estimated that from 1923 to 2006, about 25,000 animals were translocated to more than 250 release sites across Victoria.<ref>Moyal, pp. 166\u201367.</ref> Since the 1990s, government agencies have tried to control their numbers by culling, but public and international outcry has forced the use of translocation and [[Sterility (physiology)|sterilisation]], instead.<ref>Jackson, pp. 184\u201387.</ref>\n\n[[File:Panneaux koala kangourou.jpg|thumb|Road sign depicting a koala and a kangaroo]]\nOne of the biggest [[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] threats to the koala is [[habitat destruction]] and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]].
