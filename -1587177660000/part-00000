The incident led to closure of the fraternity's chapter at the university and, {{as of|2017|November|14|lc=y|df=US}}, at least 26 members of the fraternity face charges, including [[manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/13/us/penn-state-fraternity-hazing-death/index.html|title=Recovered video leads to new charges in Penn State fraternity death|first=Sara |last=Ganim|work=CNN|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>\n\n== Hazing incident ==\n\nPiazza was a 19-year-old sophomore engineering student at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. He was a [[wikt:pledge|pledge]] of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] [[fraternity]] at the university. On the night of February 2, 2017, while undergoing [[hazing]] activities for the fraternity, Piazza, on an essentially empty stomach, drank large amounts of alcohol in a short time as part of an obstacle course called \"The Gauntlet\", which required each pledge to drink from a bottle of vodka, drink a beer, and finally drink from a bag of wine. It later was revealed that Piazza took prescription anti-depressants, which contributed to his inebriation. The fraternity was supposed to be alcohol-free after a suspension in 2009.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn this state of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]], he fell on the basement stairs of the house and was knocked unconscious. He was carried to a couch, where surveillance cameras captured a conspicuous bruise that bloomed on his left abdomen, however, this was shown to have originated from another one of the alcohol-fueled rush events for fraternities that Piazza had attended a week earlier.\n\nSome time later, Piazza regained consciousness and rolled off the couch. Three brothers picked him up and placed him back on the couch. Security footage shows them poking Piazza in the face, to determine if he was okay, but he remained unconscious and unresponsive. A newly initiated fraternity chapter member attempted to render aid to Piazza, encouraging fraternity members to call 911 and get an ambulance to the house. He was shoved up against a wall and his attempts were ignored.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAt around 3:30 A.M on February 3, 2017, Piazza tried to get up, but once he reached a standing position, fell backward. He continued to stand up only to repeatedly fall back down. Once he was finally able to maintain balance, he staggered toward the lobby area of the house, but fell again headfirst into an iron railing and landed on a stone floor, likely incurring serious head trauma. He got up and tried to reach the front door but fell headfirst into it, knocking himself unconscious again. He later tried once more to ascend the basement stairs and was missing until several of the fraternity brothers discovered him several hours later behind the bar in the basement, cold and breathing rapidly.\n\nIt was at this point that he was carried upstairs. After several minutes of debating on what the next step should be, the conclusion was made that Piazza's injuries were indeed serious and that he would require medical attention. Before emergency assistance arrived, the brothers wiped blood from his face and attempted to dress him in effort to warm him. Soon emergency services arrived and Piazza was brought to [[Mount Nittany Medical Center]], but was quickly transported to [[Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center]] because of the severity of his injuries.\n\nUpon arrival, Piazza was rushed into surgery, where he was discovered to have a [[Splenic injury|ruptured spleen]] and [[Shock (circulatory)#Hypovolemic|class IV hemorrhagic shock]]. His brain had [[Cerebral edema|swollen]] to the point that roughly half of his skull had to be removed to relieve the pressure. The surgeons attempting to save his life deemed the injuries to likely be nonrecoverable, and Piazza was pronounced dead in the early morning of February 4, 2017. He is estimated to have had a [[blood alcohol content]] of nearly 0.40% on the night of the hazing incident.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Stacy Parks|title=Notice 11 FINAL Charges and Presentment|date=5 May 2017|publisher=Office of the District Attorney, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|location=Bellefonte, PA|pages=37\u201361|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/347444538/Notice-11-FINAL-Charges-and-Presentment|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Criminal prosecutions ==\n\nThe Piazza case resulted in one of the largest hazing prosecutions in US history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/Students-charged-with-manslaughter-in-PSU-frat-death.html|title=Students charged with manslaughter in Penn State frat death|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref> On May 5, 2017, following a [[grand jury]] investigation, eighteen members of the fraternity were charged in connection with Piazza's death: eight were charged with [[manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]] and the rest with other offenses, including hazing.\n\nIn addition to the fraternity brothers, the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity itself was also charged.

Hazing resulting in serious bodily injury or death would be a third-degree felony, which could include fines of up to $15,000 and imprisonment up to seven years. Hazing resulting in bodily injury would be a third-degree misdemeanor, which could include fines of up to $2,500 and imprisonment up to one year. Other hazing would be a summary offense.  The bill would also establish \"organizational\" and \"institutional\" hazing categories. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n\"The bill has been carefully crafted because we want this to be a model for changing anti-hazing laws nationwide,\" Corman said. \"My intent with this legislation is clear {{ndash}} to prevent death or serious injury due to hazing so that families, such as Tim's, never experience tragedies like this ever again.\" {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe anti-hazing legislation was subsequently submitted for consideration in the full state Senate.<ref>[http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/article206983444.html Tim Piazza anti-hazing law unanimously approved by Pa.

[[Jake Corman]], who worked with Tim Piazza's family to create the bill. It defines hazing as coercing an individual to participate in any illegal activity in order to join a social group, including the use of drugs and alcohol to inflict physical or emotional harm or the use of other forces such as \"whipping, beating ... or extreme embarrassment\". {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nLawmakers named the anti-hazing legislation after Timothy Piazza.<ref>[https://pittnews.com/article/131114/news/pennsylvania-senate-passes-law/ Pennsylvania Senate passes anti-hazing law]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Beta Theta Pi#Incidents|Beta Theta Pi {{ndash}} Incidents]]\n* [[List of hazing deaths in the United States]]\n* [[Matt's Law]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|90em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite magazine|author=Flanagan, Caitlin|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/a-death-at-penn-state/540657/|title=Death at a Penn State Fraternity|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=November 2017}}\n* [http://abcnews.go.com/US/penn-state-frat-pledges-skin-turned-gray-morning/story?id=47294085 Penn State frat pledge's skin had turned gray by morning after fall, prosecutor says]\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/02/08/a-penn-state-student-fell-down-the-stairs-at-a-fraternity-and-for-nearly-12-hours-no-one-called-for-help/ A Penn State student fell down the stairs at a fraternity \u2014 and for nearly 12 hours, no one called police]\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/fraternity-18-members-charged-in-penn-state-students-death/2017/05/06/b202b0c6-3231-11e7-a335-fa0ae1940305_story.html Fraternity, 18 members charged in Penn State student\u2019s death]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/us/penn-state-fraternity-death-timothy-piazza.html 18 Penn State Students Charged in Fraternity Death]\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{Find a Grave|176131818|Timothy \"Tim\" Piazza}}\n* [http://obits.nj.com/obituaries/starledger/obituary.aspx?pid=184066655 Obituary for Timothy Piazza]\n* [http://kearnsfuneralhome.com/tribute/details/802/Timothy-Piazza/obituary.html#tribute-start In Memory of Timothy Piazza]\n* [https://www.scribd.com/document/347453785/Penn-State-Charges#download&from_embed Charging documents]\n* [https://www.scribd.com/document/347476697/Beta-Theta-Pi-All-Criminal-Complaints#download&from_embed Criminal complaint]{{Dead link|date=April 2019|fix-attempted = yes}}\n* [http://www.hanknuwer.com/hazingdeaths.html Hank Nuwer's List of Deaths by Hazing]\n* [http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2017/images/12/15/penn.state.hazing.grand.jury.report.pdf Grand Jury Report]\n\n{{Abuse}}\n{{Bullying}}\n{{Fraternities and Sororities}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Piazza, Tim}}\n[[Category:2017 crimes in the United States]]\n[[Category:2017 in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Accidental deaths in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Crimes in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Deaths by person in the United States]]\n[[Category:Education issues]]\n[[Category:February 2017 events in the United States]]\n[[Category:Hazing]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania State University]]\n[[Category:People from Hunterdon County, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Rites of passage]]\n[[Category:Beta Theta Pi]]\n[[Category:1997 births]]\n[[Category:2017 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Hazing death}}\n'''Timothy John Piazza''' (September 25, 1997<ref>[https://www.geni.com/people/Timothy-Piazza/304683022420005640 Timothy John Piazza]</ref> {{ndash}} February 4, 2017) died as the result of [[hazing]] at the [[Beta Theta Pi]] [[fraternity]] at [[Pennsylvania State University]] at [[University Park, Pennsylvania|University Park]], [[Pennsylvania]].

On the night of February 2, 2017, while undergoing [[hazing]] activities for the fraternity, Piazza, on an essentially empty stomach, drank large amounts of alcohol in a short time as part of an obstacle course called \"The Gauntlet\", which required each pledge to drink from a bottle of vodka, drink a beer, and finally drink from a bag of wine. It later was revealed that Piazza took prescription anti-depressants, which contributed to his inebriation. The fraternity was supposed to be alcohol-free after a suspension in 2009.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn this state of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]], he fell on the basement stairs of the house and was knocked unconscious. He was carried to a couch, where surveillance cameras captured a conspicuous bruise that bloomed on his left abdomen, however, this was shown to have originated from another one of the alcohol-fueled rush events for fraternities that Piazza had attended a week earlier.\n\nSome time later, Piazza regained consciousness and rolled off the couch. Three brothers picked him up and placed him back on the couch. Security footage shows them poking Piazza in the face, to determine if he was okay, but he remained unconscious and unresponsive.\n\nAt around 3:30 A.M on February 3, 2017, Piazza tried to get up, but once he reached a standing position, fell backward. He continued to stand up only to repeatedly fall back down. Once he was finally able to maintain balance, he staggered toward the lobby area of the house, but fell again headfirst into an iron railing and landed on a stone floor, likely incurring serious head trauma. He got up and tried to reach the front door but fell headfirst into it, knocking himself unconscious again. He later tried once more to ascend the basement stairs and was missing until several of the fraternity brothers discovered him several hours later behind the bar in the basement, cold and breathing rapidly.\n\nIt was at this point that he was carried upstairs. After several minutes of debating on what the next step should be, the conclusion was made that Piazza's injuries were indeed serious and that he would require medical attention. Before emergency assistance arrived, the brothers wiped blood from his face and attempted to dress him in effort to warm him. Soon emergency services arrived and Piazza was brought to [[Mount Nittany Medical Center]], but was quickly transported to [[Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center]] because of the severity of his injuries.\n\nUpon arrival, Piazza was rushed into surgery, where he was discovered to have a [[Splenic injury|ruptured spleen]] and [[Shock (circulatory)#Hypovolemic|class IV hemorrhagic shock]]. His brain had [[Cerebral edema|swollen]] to the point that roughly half of his skull had to be removed to relieve the pressure. The surgeons attempting to save his life deemed the injuries to likely be nonrecoverable, and Piazza was pronounced dead in the early morning of February 4, 2017. He is estimated to have had a [[blood alcohol content]] of nearly 0.40% on the night of the hazing incident.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Stacy Parks|title=Notice 11 FINAL Charges and Presentment|date=5 May 2017|publisher=Office of the District Attorney, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|location=Bellefonte, PA|pages=37\u201361|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/347444538/Notice-11-FINAL-Charges-and-Presentment|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Criminal prosecutions ==\n\nThe Piazza case resulted in one of the largest hazing prosecutions in US history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/Students-charged-with-manslaughter-in-PSU-frat-death.html|title=Students charged with manslaughter in Penn State frat death|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref> On May 5, 2017, following a [[grand jury]] investigation, eighteen members of the fraternity were charged in connection with Piazza's death: eight were charged with [[manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]] and the rest with other offenses, including hazing.\n\nIn addition to the fraternity brothers, the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity itself was also charged.

{"title_page": "Acridine orange", "text_new": "Acridine orange is an [[organic compound]] that serves as a [[nucleic acid]]-selective [[fluorescent]] [[dye]] with cationic properties useful for cell cycle determination. Acridine orange is cell-permeable, which allows the dye to interact with [[DNA]] by [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation]], or [[RNA]] via [[Electrostatic attraction|electrostatic attractions]]. When bound to DNA, acridine orange is very similar spectrally to an organic compound known as fluorescein. Acridine orange and fluorescein have a maximum excitation at 502[[Nanometre|nm]] and 525nm (green). When acridine orange associates with RNA, the fluorescent dye experiences a maximum excitation shift from 525nm (green) to 460nm (blue). The shift in maximum excitation also produces a maximum emission of 650nm (red). Acridine orange is able to withstand low pH environments, allowing the fluorescent dye to penetrate acidic organelles such as [[lysosomes]] and phagolysosomes that are membrane-bound organelles essential for acid hydrolysis or for producing products of [[phagocytosis]] of apoptotic cells. Acridine orange is used in [[Fluorescence microscope|epifluorescence microscopy]] and [[flow cytometry]]. The ability to penetrate the cell membranes of acidic organelles and cationic properties of acridine orange allows the dye to differentiate between various types of cells (i.e., bacterial cells and white blood cells). The shift in maximum excitation and emission wavelengths provides a foundation to predict the wavelength at which the cells will stain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yektaeian|first=Narjes|last2=Mehrabani|first2=Davood|last3=Sepaskhah|first3=Mozhdeh|last4=Zare|first4=Shahrokh|last5=Jamhiri|first5=Iman|last6=Hatam|first6=Gholamreza|date=December 2019|title=Lipophilic tracer Dil and fluorescence labeling of acridine orange used for Leishmania major tracing in the fibroblast cells|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405844019367325|journal=Heliyon|language=en|volume=5|issue=12|pages=e03073|doi=10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e03073|pmc=6928280|pmid=31890980}}</ref> {{Chembox\n| Verifiedfields = changed\n| Watchedfields  = changed\n| verifiedrevid  = 477241097\n| Name           = \n| ImageFile      = Acridine Orange.png\n| ImageSize      = 230\n| ImageName      = Acridine orange\n| ImageFile1     = Acridine-orange-3D-balls.png\n| ImageSize1     = 240\n| ImageAlt1      = Ball-and-stick model of the acridine orange freebase molecule\n| PIN            = ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-Tetramethylacridine-3,6-diamine\n| SystematicName = 3-''N'',3-''N'',6-''N'',6-''N''-Tetramethylacridine-3,6-diamine\n| OtherNames     = 3,6-Acridinediamine<br />\nAcridine Orange Base<br />\nAcridine Orange NO<br />\nBasic Orange 14<br />\nEuchrysine<br />\nRhoduline Orange<br />\nRhoduline Orange N<br />\nRhoduline Orange NO<br />\nSolvent Orange 15<br />\nWaxoline Orange A\n| IUPACName      = \n| Section1       = {{Chembox Identifiers\n| index1_label=hydrochloride\n| index2_label=cation\n| ChEMBL_Ref = {{ebicite|correct|EBI}}\n| ChEMBL = 81880\n| StdInChI_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChI = 1S/C17H19N3/c1-19(2)14-7-5-12-9-13-6-8-15(20(3)4)11-17(13)18-16(12)10-14/h5-11H,1-4H3\n| StdInChIKey_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChIKey = DPKHZNPWBDQZCN-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n| CASNo = \n| CASNo = 494-38-2\n| PubChem = 62344\n| ChemSpiderID = 56136\n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| EINECS = 200-614-0\n| MeSHName = \tAcridine+orange\n| ChEBI_Ref = {{ebicite|changed|EBI}}\n| ChEBI = 87346\n| ChEBI1 = 51739\n| ChEBI2 = 52788\n| RTECS = AR7601000\n| SMILES = n1c3c(cc2c1cc(N(C)C)cc2)ccc(c3)N(C)C\n| InChI = 1/C17H19N3/c1-19(2)14-7-5-12-9-13-6-8-15(20(3)4)11-17(13)18-16(12)10-14/h5-11H,1-4H3\n| InChIKey = DPKHZNPWBDQZCN-UHFFFAOYAJ\n| KEGG_Ref = {{keggcite|changed|kegg}}\n| KEGG = C19315\n}}\n| Section2       = {{Chembox Properties\n| C=17 | H=19 | N=3 \n| Appearance = Orange powder\n  }}\n| Section3       = \n| Section4       = \n| Section5       = \n| Section6       = \n| Section7       = {{Chembox Hazards\n| NFPA-H = 2\n| NFPA-F = 0\n| NFPA-R = 0\n| Hazards_ref = \n| GHSPictograms = {{GHS06}}{{GHS07}}\n| GHSSignalWord = Warning\n| HPhrases = {{H-phrases|302|312|341}}\n| PPhrases = {{P-phrases|281|304+340}}\n  }}\n}}\n\n==Optical properties==\nWhen the [[pH]] of the environment is 3.5, acridine orange becomes excited by blue light (460nm). When acridine orange is excited by blue light, the fluorescent dye can differentially stain human cells green and prokaryotic cells orange (600nm), allowing for rapid detection with a fluorescent microscope. The differential staining capability of acridine orange provides quick scanning of specimen smears at lower magnifications of 400x compared to a [[Gram stain]] that operates at 1000x magnification. The differentiation of cells is aided by a dark background that allows colored organisms to be easily detected. The sharp contrast provides a mechanism for counting the number of organisms present in a sample. When acridine orange binds to DNA, the dye exhibits a maximum excitation at 502nm producing a maximum emission of 525nm. When bound to RNA, acridine orange displays a maximum emission value of 650nm and a maximum excitation value of 460nm. The maximum excitation and emission value that occur when acridine orange is bound to RNA are the result of electrostatic interactions and the intercalation between the acridine molecule and nucleic acid-base pairs present within RNA and DNA.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Supriya|last2=Acharya|first2=Jyoti|last3=Banjara|first3=Megha Raj|last4=Ghimire|first4=Prakash|last5=Singh|first5=Anjana|date=December 2020|title=Comparison of acridine orange fluorescent microscopy and gram stain light microscopy for the rapid detection of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid|url=https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-020-4895-7|journal=BMC Research Notes|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=29|doi=10.1186/s13104-020-4895-7|issn=1756-0500|pmc=6958790|pmid=31931859}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Preparation ==\nAcridine dyes are prepared via the condensation of [[1,3-Diaminobenzene|1,3-diaminobenzene]] with suitable benzaldehydes.

Acridine orange in the mid-twentieth century was used to examine the microbial content found in soil and direct counts of aquatic bacteria. Additionally, the method of acridine orange direct count (AODC) proved useful in the enumeration of bacteria found within landfills. Direct epifluorescent filter technique (DEFT) using acridine orange is a method known for examining the microbial content within food and water. The use of acridine orange in clinical applications has become widely accepted, mainly focusing on highlighting bacteria in blood cultures. Past and present studies comparing acridine orange staining with blind subcultures for the detection of positive blood cultures showed that the acridine orange is a simple, inexpensive, rapid staining procedure that appeared to be more sensitive than the Gram stain for detecting microorganisms in cerebrospinal fluid and other clinical and non-clinical materials.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<br />\n\n==Applications ==\nAcridine orange has been widely accepted and used in many different areas, such as epifluorescence microscopy, and the assessment of [[Spermatozoa|sperm]] [[chromatin]] quality.

Acridine orange is cell-permeable, which allows the dye to interact with [[DNA]] by [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation]], or [[RNA]] via [[Electrostatic attraction|electrostatic attractions]]. When bound to DNA, acridine orange is very similar spectrally to an organic compound known as fluorescein. Acridine orange and fluorescein have a maximum excitation at 502[[Nanometre|nm]] and 525nm (green). When acridine orange associates with RNA, the fluorescent dye experiences a maximum excitation shift from 525nm (green) to 460nm (blue). The shift in maximum excitation also produces a maximum emission of 650nm (red). Acridine orange is able to withstand low pH environments, allowing the fluorescent dye to penetrate acidic organelles such as [[lysosomes]] and phagolysosomes that are membrane-bound organelles essential for acid hydrolysis or for producing products of [[phagocytosis]] of apoptotic cells. Acridine orange is used in [[Fluorescence microscope|epifluorescence microscopy]] and [[flow cytometry]]. The ability to penetrate the cell membranes of acidic organelles and cationic properties of acridine orange allows the dye to differentiate between various types of cells (i.e., bacterial cells and white blood cells). The shift in maximum excitation and emission wavelengths provides a foundation to predict the wavelength at which cells will stain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yektaeian|first=Narjes|last2=Mehrabani|first2=Davood|last3=Sepaskhah|first3=Mozhdeh|last4=Zare|first4=Shahrokh|last5=Jamhiri|first5=Iman|last6=Hatam|first6=Gholamreza|date=December 2019|title=Lipophilic tracer Dil and fluorescence labeling of acridine orange used for Leishmania major tracing in the fibroblast cells|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405844019367325|journal=Heliyon|language=en|volume=5|issue=12|pages=e03073|doi=10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e03073|pmc=6928280|pmid=31890980}}</ref> {{Chembox\n| Verifiedfields = changed\n| Watchedfields  = changed\n| verifiedrevid  = 477241097\n| Name           = \n| ImageFile      = Acridine Orange.png\n| ImageSize      = 230\n| ImageName      = Acridine orange\n| ImageFile1     = Acridine-orange-3D-balls.png\n| ImageSize1     = 240\n| ImageAlt1      = Ball-and-stick model of the acridine orange freebase molecule\n| PIN            = ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-Tetramethylacridine-3,6-diamine\n| SystematicName = 3-''N'',3-''N'',6-''N'',6-''N''-Tetramethylacridine-3,6-diamine\n| OtherNames     = 3,6-Acridinediamine<br />\nAcridine Orange Base<br />\nAcridine Orange NO<br />\nBasic Orange 14<br />\nEuchrysine<br />\nRhoduline Orange<br />\nRhoduline Orange N<br />\nRhoduline Orange NO<br />\nSolvent Orange 15<br />\nWaxoline Orange A\n| IUPACName      = \n| Section1       = {{Chembox Identifiers\n| index1_label=hydrochloride\n| index2_label=cation\n| ChEMBL_Ref = {{ebicite|correct|EBI}}\n| ChEMBL = 81880\n| StdInChI_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChI = 1S/C17H19N3/c1-19(2)14-7-5-12-9-13-6-8-15(20(3)4)11-17(13)18-16(12)10-14/h5-11H,1-4H3\n| StdInChIKey_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChIKey = DPKHZNPWBDQZCN-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n| CASNo = \n| CASNo = 494-38-2\n| PubChem = 62344\n| ChemSpiderID = 56136\n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| EINECS = 200-614-0\n| MeSHName = \tAcridine+orange\n| ChEBI_Ref = {{ebicite|changed|EBI}}\n| ChEBI = 87346\n| ChEBI1 = 51739\n| ChEBI2 = 52788\n| RTECS = AR7601000\n| SMILES = n1c3c(cc2c1cc(N(C)C)cc2)ccc(c3)N(C)C\n| InChI = 1/C17H19N3/c1-19(2)14-7-5-12-9-13-6-8-15(20(3)4)11-17(13)18-16(12)10-14/h5-11H,1-4H3\n| InChIKey = DPKHZNPWBDQZCN-UHFFFAOYAJ\n| KEGG_Ref = {{keggcite|changed|kegg}}\n| KEGG = C19315\n}}\n| Section2       = {{Chembox Properties\n| C=17 | H=19 | N=3 \n| Appearance = Orange powder\n  }}\n| Section3       = \n| Section4       = \n| Section5       = \n| Section6       = \n| Section7       = {{Chembox Hazards\n| NFPA-H = 2\n| NFPA-F = 0\n| NFPA-R = 0\n| Hazards_ref = \n| GHSPictograms = {{GHS06}}{{GHS07}}\n| GHSSignalWord = Warning\n| HPhrases = {{H-phrases|302|312|341}}\n| PPhrases = {{P-phrases|281|304+340}}\n  }}\n}}\n\n==Optical properties==\nWhen the [[pH]] of the environment is 3.5, acridine orange becomes excited by blue light (460nm). When acridine orange is excited by blue light, the fluorescent dye can differentially stain human cells green and prokaryotic cells orange (600nm), allowing for rapid detection with a fluorescent microscope. The differential staining capability of acridine orange provides quick scanning of specimen smears at lower magnifications of 400x compared to a [[Gram stain]] that operates at 1000x magnification. The differentiation of cells is aided by a dark background that allows colored organisms to be easily detected. The sharp contrast provides a mechanism for counting the number of organisms present in a sample. When acridine orange binds to DNA, the dye exhibits a maximum excitation at 502nm producing a maximum emission of 525nm. When bound to RNA, acridine orange displays a maximum emission value of 650nm and a maximum excitation value of 460nm. The maximum excitation and emission value that occur when acridine orange is bound to RNA are the result of electrostatic interactions and the intercalation between the acridine molecule and nucleic acid-base pairs present within RNA and DNA.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Supriya|last2=Acharya|first2=Jyoti|last3=Banjara|first3=Megha Raj|last4=Ghimire|first4=Prakash|last5=Singh|first5=Anjana|date=December 2020|title=Comparison of acridine orange fluorescent microscopy and gram stain light microscopy for the rapid detection of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid|url=https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-020-4895-7|journal=BMC Research Notes|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=29|doi=10.1186/s13104-020-4895-7|issn=1756-0500|pmc=6958790|pmid=31931859}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Preparation ==\nAcridine dyes are prepared via the condensation of [[1,3-Diaminobenzene|1,3-diaminobenzene]] with suitable benzaldehydes.

Acridine orange in the mid-twentieth century was used to examine the microbial content found in soil and direct counts of aquatic bacteria. Additionally, the method of acridine orange direct count (AODC) proved useful in the enumeration of bacteria found within landfills. Direct epifluorescent filter technique (DEFT) using acridine orange is a method known for examining the microbial content within food and water. The use of acridine orange in clinical applications has become widely accepted, mainly focusing on highlighting bacteria in blood cultures. Past and present studies comparing acridine orange staining with blind subcultures for the detection of positive blood cultures showed that the acridine orange is a simple, inexpensive, rapid staining procedure that appeared to be more sensitive than the Gram stain for detecting microorganisms in cerebrospinal fluid and other clinical and non-clinical materials.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<br />\n\n==Applications ==\nAcridine orange has been widely accepted and used in many different areas, such as epifluorescence microscopy, and the assessment of [[Spermatozoa|sperm]] [[chromatin]] quality.

This interaction between engineered T cells with CD28 and CD137 are essential for immunotherapy and show promise for directing T lymphocytes to tumor antigens and altering the tumor microenvironment for mesothelin.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carpenito C, Milone MC, Hassan R, Simonet JC, Lakhal M, Suhoski MM, Varela-Rohena A, Haines KM, Heitjan DF, Albelda SM, Carroll RG, Riley JL, Pastan I, June CH | display-authors = 6 | title = Control of large, established tumor xenografts with genetically retargeted human T cells containing CD28 and CD137 domains | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 9 | pages = 3360\u20135 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19211796 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0813101106 | pmc = 2651342 | bibcode = 2009PNAS..106.3360C }}</ref>\n\n=== HIV ===\n\nThe CD28 pathway is targeted by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the virus infects more normal cells. CD28 has effects on the transcription and stability of interleukin-2 and IFN-\u03b3, which are cytokines that are important for immunity and stimulating NK cells. HIV alters the CD28 signaling as well as CD8 cells. As a result, there are reduced levels of CD8 cells, which express CD28, in individuals with HIV. With regards to subjects with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and HIV, levels of CD8 cells are also reduced. CD28 signaling has a large role in the adaptive response to HCV and can increase morbidity for HCV/HIV coinfection within a subject.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yonkers NL, Rodriguez B, Post AB, Asaad R, Jones L, Lederman MM, Lehmann PV, Anthony DD | display-authors = 6 | title = HIV coinfection impairs CD28-mediated costimulation of hepatitis C virus-specific CD8 cells | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 194 | issue = 3 | pages = 391\u2013400 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16826489 | doi = 10.1086/505582 }}</ref> CD28 induces IL-2 secretion that increases IL-2 mRNA stability.

The club was formed in 2007 as an amalgamation of two teams from the [[National Bank Cup]] \u2013 the [[Northern Force]] and the [[Auckland Diamonds]] \u2013 after the competition was retired that year. In 2008, the Mystics joined four other New Zealand franchises in the new ANZ Championship, representing the New Zealand regions of [[Northland Region|Northland]] and [[Auckland Region|Auckland]]. After the ANZ Championship ended in 2016, the Mystics joined five other teams in the new ANZ Premiership\n\nHome games in the ANZ Premiership are usually played at [[Trusts Stadium]] in Waitakere, although some matches are played at the [[North Shore Events Centre]] and [[Vector Arena]]. The team uniform is primarily blue \u2013 consistent with traditional Auckland sporting colours \u2013 in addition to red and white. In 2018 the Mystics are coached by [[Helene Wilson]] and captained by veteran Silver Ferns defender [[Anna Harrison (netball player)|Anna Harrison]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Background===\nThe ANZ Championship was founded in 2007 as the new elite domestic netball competition in New Zealand and Australia. It replaced the [[National Bank Cup]] in New Zealand and the [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]] in Australia, which both played their final season in 2007. When the new trans-Tasman competition was announced, the competition was reported to feature five teams from each country.

The Auckland team headed to Sydney to face the New South Wales Swifts in the minor semi-final, defeating the hosts in an upset victory. A second victory against the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic earned the Mystics a place in the 2011 grand final against the Queensland Firebirds in Brisbane. The undefeated Firebirds claimed victory on home soil and their first ANZ Championship, defeating the Mystics by 57\u201344.\n\n===2012 season===\n\n2012 saw few changes to the Mystics line-up. Import [[Megan Dehn]] retired from playing, and joined the coaching staff as a specialist coach for all Trans-Tasman games. She was replaced by English captain [[Jade Clarke]]. Ex [[Canterbury Tactix]] defender [[Charlotte Kight]] was signed to cover the loss of international player, [[Joline Henry]], who left to join the [[Central Pulse]]. 2011 temporary replacement player [[Portia Woodman]] was also signed.\n[[Gail Parata]] joined the franchise as an assistant coach.\n\nAfter an up and down round robin, the Northern Mystics finished second on the table, but lost the major semi final, and the preliminary final, to finish in 3rd position overall.

In 2008, the Mystics joined four other New Zealand franchises in the new ANZ Championship, representing the New Zealand regions of [[Northland Region|Northland]] and [[Auckland Region|Auckland]]. After the ANZ Championship ended in 2016, the Mystics joined five other teams in the new ANZ Premiership\n\nHome games in the ANZ Premiership are usually played at [[Trusts Stadium]] in Waitakere, although some matches are played at the [[North Shore Events Centre]] and [[Vector Arena]].

In 2018 the Mystics are coached by [[Helene Wilson]] and captained by veteran Silver Ferns defender [[Anna Harrison (netball player)|Anna Harrison]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Background===\nThe ANZ Championship was founded in 2007 as the new elite domestic netball competition in New Zealand and Australia.

The Auckland team headed to Sydney to face the New South Wales Swifts in the minor semi-final, defeating the hosts in an upset victory. A second victory against the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic earned the Mystics a place in the 2011 grand final against the Queensland Firebirds in Brisbane. The undefeated Firebirds claimed victory on home soil and their first ANZ Championship, defeating the Mystics by 57\u201344.\n\n===2012 season===\n\n2012 saw few changes to the Mystics line-up. Import [[Megan Dehn]] retired from playing, and joined the coaching staff as a specialist coach for all Trans-Tasman games. She was replaced by English captain [[Jade Clarke]]. Ex [[Canterbury Tactix]] defender [[Charlotte Kight]] was signed to cover the loss of international player, [[Joline Henry]], who left to join the [[Central Pulse]]. 2011 temporary replacement player [[Portia Woodman]] was also signed.\n[[Gail Parata]] joined the franchise as an assistant coach.\n\nAfter an up and down round robin, the Northern Mystics finished second on the table, but lost the major semi final, and the preliminary final, to finish in 3rd position overall. In round 8 they beat the [[Melbourne Vixens]] to pick up just their third win on Australian soil. During that game they unveiled the infamous [[Harrison Hoist]].\n\n===2013 season===\n\nThe Mystics made several changes to the roster for the 2013 season, most notable being the signing of ex [[Silver Ferns]] coach, [[Ruth Aitken]], and Australian defender [[Julie Corletto]].<ref>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/7513232/Julie-Corletto-set-to-join-Northern-Mystics</ref> Corletto made to move to be closer to her husband [[Daryl Corletto]], who plays for the [[NZ Breakers]]. The Mystics have lost the services of captain [[Temepara George]] to retirement, and [[Jade Clarke]], as well as Auckland veteran [[Rachel Rasmussen]] to the [[Southern Steel]]. Several young development players have been signed in their place.\n\n===2014 season===\n\nThe Mystics made some quite successful changes to their 2013 lineup with the club signing form [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]] captain and current [[Silver Ferns]] vice-captain [[Laura Langman]] to the center court. From the [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]] they also signed [[Nadia Loveday]] and [[Jodi Tod-Elliot]]. The changes worked for the side moving from 10th place on the 2013 ladder up to 7th place on the 2014 ladder.\n\n'''IN:'''  \n[[Laura Langman]] | [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]]\n\n[[Nadia Loveday]] | [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]]\n\n[[Jodi Tod-Eliot]] | [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]]\n\n[[Temalisi Fakahokotau]]\n\n'''OUT:'''\n[[Hayley Saunders]] | [[Canterbury Tactix]]\n\n[[Jessica Moulds]] | [[Canterbury Tactix]]\n\n[[Malia Paseka]] | [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]]\n\n[[Charlotte Kight]]\n\n== Players ==\n\n=== 2020 team ===\n{{Netball roster header |year=2020 |team=Northern Mystics}}\n\n<!-- List of players --> <!--Conflicting information that is commented out is from 2018 ANZP Media Guide-->\n\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Phoenix Karaka]] |pos=GK, GD |dob=06-11-1993|capt=yes|height=1.86}}\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Grace Nweke]] |pos= GS |dob=06-02-2002 |height=1.93}}\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Bailey Mes]] |pos=GA, GS |dob=26-05-1989|height=1.87}}\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Michaela Sokolich-Beatson]] |pos=GD, WD |dob=02-10-1996 |height=1.84}}\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Elisapeta Toeava]] |pos=C, WA |dob=09-08-1994|height=1.61}}\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Emma Iversen]] |pos=C, WA |dob=21-02-1989|height=1.71}}\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Sulu Tone-Fitzpatrick|Sulu Fitzpatrick]] |pos=GK, GD |dob=20-08-1992 |height=1.87}}\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Danielle Gray]] |pos=GK,GD, WD, C |dob=03-11-1995 |height=1.80}}\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Tayla Earle]] |pos=GD, WD, C, WA |dob=22-04-2000|height=1.74}}\n{{Netball roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Saviour Tui]] |pos=GS |dob=|height=}}\n\n<!-- Coaching staff -->\n{{Netball roster footer\n| head_coach  = {{flagicon|NZL}} [[Helene Wilson]]\n| asst_coach  = \n| manager     = \n| physio      = \n| trainer     = \n| sport_sci   = \n| str_cond    = \n| url_team    = http://www.northernmystics.co.nz/players/\n| updated     = 01 Jul 2019\n}}\n\n=== Notable former players ===\n* [[Althea Byfield]]: 2010\n* [[Jenny-May Coffin]]: 2010\n* [[Leana de Bruin]]: 2008\n* [[Pamela Cookey]]: 2009\n* [[Vilimaina Davu]]: 2008\u201309\n* [[Paula Griffin]]: 2008\n* [[Sheryl Scanlan]]: 2008\n* [[Grace Kara]]: 2008-13\n* [[Cathrine Tuivaiti]]:2008-16\n* [[Debbie White (netball player)|Debbie White]]: 2009\n* [[Joline Henry]]: 2010-11\n* [[Megan Dehn]]: 2011\n* [[Temepara George]]: 2008\u201312, 2014\n* [[Jade Clarke]]: 2012\n* [[Julie Corletto]]: 2013-14\n* [[Camilla Lees]]: 2014\n* [[Laura Langman]]: 2014-15\n* [[Serena Guthrie]]: 2015-16\n* [[Maria Folau]] : 2010-2018\n* [[Anna Harrison (netball player)]]: 2011-2018\n\n== Venues ==\n[[File:Vector court.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Vector Arena configured for netball.]]\nThe Mystics play their home games at three venues in Auckland.
