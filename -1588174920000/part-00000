Born and raised in [[Alabama]], he was a highly regarded quarterback in high school and led his team to the state championship as a junior. Winston played college football for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State Seminoles]] and as a redshirt freshman became the youngest player to win the [[Heisman Trophy]] and helped lead the Seminoles to a victory in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]]. In his sophomore and final year, the Seminoles advanced to the [[2015 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], part of the College Football Playoff. Winston also played on [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State's baseball]] team. Winston was drafted as the [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first overall pick]] by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the [[2015 NFL Draft]].\n\nAfter throwing a pick-six on his first career throw, he set franchise rookie records in several categories, including passing touchdowns, and became just the third rookie in NFL history to throw for over 4,000 yards. Over the next four seasons he continued to set career highs and franchise records, and in 2019 led the league in passing yards, completions, and attempts. However he also led the league in interceptions and total turnovers, and set an NFL record for pick-sixes thrown in a season (seven), including one on his final throw of the year. Following the season the Bucs chose not to re-sign Winston, and he signed a one-year deal with the Saints to be [[Drew Brees]]' backup.\n\n==Early life==\nWinston was born in [[Bessemer, Alabama|Bessemer]], Alabama on January 6, 1994.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.seminoles.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jameis_winston_807027.html|title=Jameis Winston Bio|publisher=Seminoles.com|accessdate=January 23, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102163116/http://www.seminoles.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jameis_winston_807027.html|archivedate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> He attended [[Hueytown High School]], where he played both [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]].<ref name=FamousJameis>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/football/story/_/id/7919785/two-sport-phenom-jameis-winston-bright-future-football-baseball |title=Famous Jameis |publisher=ESPN|date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206040830/http://espn.go.com/high-school/football/story/_/id/7919785/two-sport-phenom-jameis-winston-bright-future-football-baseball |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> Winston was considered the best [[Quarterback#Dual-threat quarterbacks|dual-threat quarterback]] recruit in the nation by [[Rivals.com]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Jameis-Winston-102384 |title=Rivals.com |website=[[Rivals.com]] |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archivedate=December 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209060948/http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Jameis-Winston-102384 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> the best overall quarterback recruit by [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/107569/jameis-winston|title=Jameis Winston ESPN recruiting profile|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> Winston was also named the MVP of the [[ESPN RISE Elite 11]] quarterback camp.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/6794915/trio-share-mvp-honors-elite-11 |title=Trio share MVP honors at Elite 11 |publisher=ESPN |date=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025839/http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/6794915/trio-share-mvp-honors-elite-11 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Winegarner|first=Mark|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9961573/florida-state-quarterback-jameis-winston-stellar-rise-fame-espn-magazine|title=Is this kid serious?|publisher=ESPN|date=November 12, 2013|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, Winston earned the Gatorade Player of the Year recognition for the state of Alabama.<ref name=FamousJameis/> He led Hueytown to a state championship during his junior year.\n\nWinston committed to attend [[Florida State University]] on February 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|author=Coley Harvey |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-02-03/sports/os-jameis-winston-florida-state-signs-0204-20120203_1_taiwan-easterling-jimbo-fisher-fsu |title=Jameis Winston finally signs with FSU |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=February 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022063147/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-02-03/sports/os-jameis-winston-florida-state-signs-0204-20120203_1_taiwan-easterling-jimbo-fisher-fsu |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> The [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] selected Winston in the 15th round of the [[2012 Major League Baseball Draft]] out of high school.

Orleans Saints]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). Born and raised in [[Alabama]], he was a highly regarded quarterback in high school and led his team to the state championship as a junior. Winston played college football for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State Seminoles]] and as a redshirt freshman became the youngest player to win the [[Heisman Trophy]] and helped lead the Seminoles to a victory in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]]. In his sophomore and final year, the Seminoles advanced to the [[2015 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], part of the College Football Playoff. Winston also played on [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State's baseball]] team. Winston was drafted as the [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first overall pick]] by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the [[2015 NFL Draft]].\n\nAfter throwing a pick-six on his first career throw, he set franchise rookie records in several categories, including passing touchdowns, and became just the third rookie in NFL history to throw for over 4,000 yards. Over the next four seasons he continued to set career highs and franchise records, and in 2019 led the league in passing yards, completions, and attempts. However he also led the league in interceptions and total turnovers, and set an NFL record for pick-sixes thrown in a season (seven), including one on his final throw of the year. Following the season the Bucs chose not to re-sign Winston, and he signed a one-year deal with the Saints to be [[Drew Brees]]' backup.\n\n==Early life==\nWinston was born in [[Bessemer, Alabama|Bessemer]], Alabama on January 6, 1994.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.seminoles.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jameis_winston_807027.html|title=Jameis Winston Bio|publisher=Seminoles.com|accessdate=January 23, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102163116/http://www.seminoles.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jameis_winston_807027.html|archivedate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> He attended [[Hueytown High School]], where he played both [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]].<ref name=FamousJameis>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/football/story/_/id/7919785/two-sport-phenom-jameis-winston-bright-future-football-baseball |title=Famous Jameis |publisher=ESPN|date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206040830/http://espn.go.com/high-school/football/story/_/id/7919785/two-sport-phenom-jameis-winston-bright-future-football-baseball |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> Winston was considered the best [[Quarterback#Dual-threat quarterbacks|dual-threat quarterback]] recruit in the nation by [[Rivals.com]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Jameis-Winston-102384 |title=Rivals.com |website=[[Rivals.com]] |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archivedate=December 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209060948/http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Jameis-Winston-102384 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> the best overall quarterback recruit by [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/107569/jameis-winston|title=Jameis Winston ESPN recruiting profile|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> Winston was also named the MVP of the [[ESPN RISE Elite 11]] quarterback camp.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/6794915/trio-share-mvp-honors-elite-11 |title=Trio share MVP honors at Elite 11 |publisher=ESPN |date=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025839/http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/6794915/trio-share-mvp-honors-elite-11 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Winegarner|first=Mark|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9961573/florida-state-quarterback-jameis-winston-stellar-rise-fame-espn-magazine|title=Is this kid serious?|publisher=ESPN|date=November 12, 2013|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, Winston earned the Gatorade Player of the Year recognition for the state of Alabama.<ref name=FamousJameis/> He led Hueytown to a state championship during his junior year.\n\nWinston committed to attend [[Florida State University]] on February 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|author=Coley Harvey |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-02-03/sports/os-jameis-winston-florida-state-signs-0204-20120203_1_taiwan-easterling-jimbo-fisher-fsu |title=Jameis Winston finally signs with FSU |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=February 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022063147/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-02-03/sports/os-jameis-winston-florida-state-signs-0204-20120203_1_taiwan-easterling-jimbo-fisher-fsu |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> The [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] selected Winston in the 15th round of the [[2012 Major League Baseball Draft]] out of high school.

The connection between the two groups is through Brutal Exterminators, who kill and terrorize other \"Brutals\" at the orders of a huge flying stone head called Zardoz, which supplies them with weapons in exchange for the food they collect. Zed ([[Sean Connery]]), a Brutal Exterminator, hides aboard Zardoz during one trip, temporarily \"killing\" its Eternal operator-creator Arthur Frayn ([[Niall Buggy]]).\n\nArriving in the Vortex, Zed meets two Eternals \u2014 Consuella ([[Charlotte Rampling]]) and May ([[Sara Kestelman]]). Overcoming him with [[psychic]] powers, they make him a prisoner and menial worker within their community. Consuella wants Zed destroyed immediately; others, led by May and a subversive Eternal named Friend ([[John Alderton]]), insist on keeping him alive for further study.\n\nIn time, Zed learns the nature of the Vortex. The Eternals are overseen and protected from death by the Tabernacle, an [[artificial intelligence]]. Given their limitless lifespan, the Eternals have grown bored and corrupt. The needlessness of procreation has rendered the men impotent and meditation has replaced sleep. Others fall into [[catatonia]], forming the social stratum the Eternals have named the \"Apathetics.\" The Eternals spend their days stewarding mankind's vast knowledge\u2014through a voice recognition based search engine\u2014baking special bread for themselves from the grain deliveries and participating in communal [[Omphaloskepsis|meditation]] rituals. To give time and life more meaning the Vortex developed complex social rules whose violators are punished with artificial aging. The most extreme offenders are condemned to permanent old age and the status of \"Renegades.\" Eternals who somehow managed to die, usually through some fatal accident, are then reborn into another healthy, synthetically reproduced body that is identical to the one they just lost.\n\nZed is less brutal and far more intelligent than the Eternals think he is. Genetic analysis reveals he is the ultimate result of long-running [[eugenics]] experiments devised by Arthur Frayn\u2014who is Zardoz\u2014who controlled the outlands with the Exterminators, thus coercing the Brutals to supply the Vortices with grain. Zardoz's aim was to breed a superman who would penetrate the Vortex and save mankind from its hopelessly stagnant status quo. The women's analysis of Zed's mental images earlier had revealed that in the ruins of the old world Arthur Frayn first encouraged Zed to learn to read, then led him to the book ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. Zed finally understands the origin of the name ''Zardoz''\u2014Wi'''zard''' of '''Oz'''\u2014bringing him to a true awareness of Zardoz as a skillful manipulator rather than an actual [[deity]]. He becomes infuriated with this realization and decides to plumb the deepest depths of this enormous mystery.\n\nAs Zed divines the nature of the Vortex and its problems, the Eternals use him to fight their [[:wikt:internecine|internecine]] quarrels. Led by Consuela, the Eternals decide to kill Zed and to age Friend. Zed escapes and, aided by May and Friend, absorbs all the Eternals' knowledge, including that of the Vortex's origin, to destroy the Tabernacle. While absorbing their knowledge Zed impregnates May and a few of her followers as he is transformed from a revenge-seeking Exterminator, his subsequent efforts to give the Eternals salvation by bringing them death are in essence acts of mercy. Zed helps the Exterminators invade the Vortex and kill most of the Eternals\u2014who welcome death as a release from their eternal but boring existence.  May and several of her followers do escape the Vortex's destruction, heading out to bear their offspring as enlightened but merely mortal beings among the Brutals.\n\n''Zardoz'' ends in a wordless sequence of images accompanied by the sombre second movement ([[allegretto]]) of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh Symphony]], snatches of which are heard throughout the film. Consuella, having fallen in love with Zed, gives birth to a baby boy within the remains of the giant stone head. In matching green suits, they sit with the boy standing between them, who matures as they age in a series of fades. The youth leaves his parents, who take hands and grow very old, eventually decomposing into skeletons and finally vanishing. Nothing remains in the space but painted handprints on the wall and Zed's [[Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver|Webley-Fosbery]] revolver.\n\n[[Image:Zardoz zed.jpg|right|thumb|237px|Sean Connery as Zed, wearing what the UK's [[Channel 4]] described as \"a red [[nappy]], knee-high leather boots, pony tail and [[Emiliano Zapata|Zapata]] moustache.\"<ref name=\"ch4\">[http://www.film4.com/reviews/1973/zardoz Review of ''Zardoz''] from [[Channel 4]]</ref>]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Zed\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Consuella\n* [[Sara Kestelman]] as May\n* [[Niall Buggy]] as Arthur Frayn / Zardoz\n* [[John Alderton]] as Friend\n* Sally Anne Newton as Avalow\n* [[Bosco Hogan]] as George Saden\n* Jessica Swift as Apathetic\n* Reginald Jarman as voice of Death\n* Bairbre Dowling as Star \n* Christopher Casson as Old Scientist\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBoorman was inspired to write ''Zardoz'' while preparing to adapt ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' for [[United Artists]], but when the studio became hesitant about the cost of producing film versions of Tolkien's books, Boorman continued to be interested in the idea of inventing a strange new world.<ref>CRITIC AT LARGE: Visions of the Future\nChamplin, Charles.

A group of County Wicklow artisans were\u00a0hired to create many of the film's futuristic\u00a0 costumes. The costumes were designed by Boorman's wife Christel, the creations were based\u00a0 on \"pure intuition.\" She decided that, because the Eternals' lives were purely metaphysical and colorless, this should be incorporated in their costumes to. As The Brutals were lower more primitive beings, Christel decided that they would not care much about what they were wearing only what was functional and comfortable.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-056|title=Starlog Magazine Issue 056|language=English}}</ref> As stated in the magazine [http://darkworldsquarterly.gwthomas.org/ Dark Worlds Quarterly] \"functional\" and \"comfortable\" costumes ended up meaning that the costumes were extremely revealing, \u201cIt is the costumes for the Brutal Exterminators, and Zed in particular, that raise the eyebrows.

Some\u00a0interior shots were filmed at [[Ardmore Studios]]\u00a0close to  [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray Ireland]].\n\n<br />\n\n=== '''Soundtrack''' ===\nJohn Boorman controlled all aspects of the film, including the soundtrack. Boorman commissioned [[David Munrow]], director of the Early English Consort, to write the score. While the film is set in the distant future (the 23rd century approximately), Boorman seemed to believe futuristic music would contain a variety of old-world instruments. Boorman instructed Munrow to use a variety of medieval instruments including notch flutes, medieval bells and [[Gemshorn|gemshorns]]. As stated in These instruments, plus snatches of Beethoven's Seventh, gave the movie a truly unusual soundtrack. Although the use of medieval instruments in a sci-fi film seems strange according to many it seems to work. As stated by infamous British conductor [[Anthony Lewis (musician)|Sir Anthony Lewis]] in 1976 \"David Munrow did not just emerge into the field of medieval and renaissance music......he exploded into it. He established a standard that can now never be ignored, and the stimulating shock-waves from his explosion will carry far into the future...\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://earlymusiclegend.blogspot.com/2014/03/david-munrow-and-zardoz-soundtrack-1974.html|title=David Munrow, And The Zardoz Soundtrack (1974)|last=link|first=Get|last2=Facebook|access-date=2020-04-28|last3=Twitter|last4=Pinterest|last5=Email|last6=Apps|first6=Other}}</ref>\n\nAlong with David Munrow's medieval ensemble, the ''Zardoz'' soundtrack features [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven']]<nowiki/>s \"Symphony No.7\" in A, 2nd movement, played by the ''[[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]'' and Conducted by [[Eugen Jochum]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Zardoz (1974) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070948/soundtrack|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>\n<br />\n==Release==\nZardoz was released in theaters on February 6, 1974 in Los Angeles and New York. When the film was released it was immediately met with terrible reviews. Along with the scathing reviews, the public reacted very poorly to the confusing world of ''Zardoz''. According to a ''[[Starlog|Starlog Magazine]]'' article on ''Zardoz'' \"these reviewers (and the general public) failed to understand many of Boorman's analogies and philosophical statements\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-056|title=Starlog Magazine Issue 056|language=English}}</ref> The confusion caused word of mouth spread very quickly that ''Zardoz'' was not worth watching and soon theaters showcasing the bizarre sci-fi were left practically empty.

The connection between the two groups is through Brutal Exterminators, who kill and terrorize other \"Brutals\" at the orders of a huge flying stone head called Zardoz, which supplies them with weapons in exchange for the food they collect. Zed ([[Sean Connery]]), a Brutal Exterminator, hides aboard Zardoz during one trip, temporarily \"killing\" its Eternal operator-creator Arthur Frayn ([[Niall Buggy]]).\n\nArriving in the Vortex, Zed meets two Eternals \u2014 Consuella ([[Charlotte Rampling]]) and May ([[Sara Kestelman]]). Overcoming him with [[psychic]] powers, they make him a prisoner and menial worker within their community. Consuella wants Zed destroyed immediately; others, led by May and a subversive Eternal named Friend ([[John Alderton]]), insist on keeping him alive for further study.\n\nIn time, Zed learns the nature of the Vortex. The Eternals are overseen and protected from death by the Tabernacle, an [[artificial intelligence]]. Given their limitless lifespan, the Eternals have grown bored and corrupt. The needlessness of procreation has rendered the men impotent and meditation has replaced sleep. Others fall into [[catatonia]], forming the social stratum the Eternals have named the \"Apathetics.\" The Eternals spend their days stewarding mankind's vast knowledge\u2014through a voice recognition based search engine\u2014baking special bread for themselves from the grain deliveries and participating in communal [[Omphaloskepsis|meditation]] rituals. To give time and life more meaning the Vortex developed complex social rules whose violators are punished with artificial aging. The most extreme offenders are condemned to permanent old age and the status of \"Renegades.\" Eternals who somehow managed to die, usually through some fatal accident, are then reborn into another healthy, synthetically reproduced body that is identical to the one they just lost.\n\nZed is less brutal and far more intelligent than the Eternals think he is. Genetic analysis reveals he is the ultimate result of long-running [[eugenics]] experiments devised by Arthur Frayn\u2014who is Zardoz\u2014who controlled the outlands with the Exterminators, thus coercing the Brutals to supply the Vortices with grain. Zardoz's aim was to breed a superman who would penetrate the Vortex and save mankind from its hopelessly stagnant status quo. The women's analysis of Zed's mental images earlier had revealed that in the ruins of the old world Arthur Frayn first encouraged Zed to learn to read, then led him to the book ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. Zed finally understands the origin of the name ''Zardoz''\u2014Wi'''zard''' of '''Oz'''\u2014bringing him to a true awareness of Zardoz as a skillful manipulator rather than an actual [[deity]]. He becomes infuriated with this realization and decides to plumb the deepest depths of this enormous mystery.\n\nAs Zed divines the nature of the Vortex and its problems, the Eternals use him to fight their [[:wikt:internecine|internecine]] quarrels. Led by Consuela, the Eternals decide to kill Zed and to age Friend. Zed escapes and, aided by May and Friend, absorbs all the Eternals' knowledge, including that of the Vortex's origin, to destroy the Tabernacle. While absorbing their knowledge Zed impregnates May and a few of her followers as he is transformed from a revenge-seeking Exterminator, his subsequent efforts to give the Eternals salvation by bringing them death are in essence acts of mercy. Zed helps the Exterminators invade the Vortex and kill most of the Eternals\u2014who welcome death as a release from their eternal but boring existence.  May and several of her followers do escape the Vortex's destruction, heading out to bear their offspring as enlightened but merely mortal beings among the Brutals.\n\n''Zardoz'' ends in a wordless sequence of images accompanied by the sombre second movement ([[allegretto]]) of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh Symphony]], snatches of which are heard throughout the film. Consuella, having fallen in love with Zed, gives birth to a baby boy within the remains of the giant stone head. In matching green suits, they sit with the boy standing between them, who matures as they age in a series of fades. The youth leaves his parents, who take hands and grow very old, eventually decomposing into skeletons and finally vanishing. Nothing remains in the space but painted handprints on the wall and Zed's [[Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver|Webley-Fosbery]] revolver.\n\n[[Image:Zardoz zed.jpg|right|thumb|237px|Sean Connery as Zed, wearing what the UK's [[Channel 4]] described as \"a red [[nappy]], knee-high leather boots, pony tail and [[Emiliano Zapata|Zapata]] moustache.\"<ref name=\"ch4\">[http://www.film4.com/reviews/1973/zardoz Review of ''Zardoz''] from [[Channel 4]]</ref>]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Zed\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Consuella\n* [[Sara Kestelman]] as May\n* [[Niall Buggy]] as Arthur Frayn / Zardoz\n* [[John Alderton]] as Friend\n* Sally Anne Newton as Avalow\n* [[Bosco Hogan]] as George Saden\n* Jessica Swift as Apathetic\n* Reginald Jarman as voice of Death\n* Bairbre Dowling as Star \n* Christopher Casson as Old Scientist\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBoorman was inspired to write ''Zardoz'' while preparing to adapt ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' for [[United Artists]], but when the studio became hesitant about the cost of producing film versions of Tolkien's books, Boorman continued to be interested in the idea of inventing a strange new world.<ref>CRITIC AT LARGE: Visions of the Future\nChamplin, Charles.

Boorman commissioned [[David Munrow]], director of the Early English Consort, to write the score. While the film is set in the distant future (the 23rd century approximately), Boorman seemed to believe futuristic music would contain a variety of old-world instruments. Boorman instructed Munrow to use a variety of medieval instruments including notch flutes, medieval bells and [[Gemshorn|gemshorns]]. As stated in These instruments, plus snatches of Beethoven's Seventh, gave the movie a truly unusual soundtrack. Although the use of medieval instruments in a sci-fi film seems strange according to many it seems to work. As stated by infamous British conductor [[Anthony Lewis (musician)|Sir Anthony Lewis]] in 1976 \"David Munrow did not just emerge into the field of medieval and renaissance music......he exploded into it. He established a standard that can now never be ignored, and the stimulating shock-waves from his explosion will carry far into the future...\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://earlymusiclegend.blogspot.com/2014/03/david-munrow-and-zardoz-soundtrack-1974.html|title=David Munrow, And The Zardoz Soundtrack (1974)|last=link|first=Get|last2=Facebook|access-date=2020-04-28|last3=Twitter|last4=Pinterest|last5=Email|last6=Apps|first6=Other}}</ref>\n\nAlong with David Munrow's medieval ensemble, the ''Zardoz'' soundtrack features [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven']]<nowiki/>s \"Symphony No.7\" in A, 2nd movement, played by the ''[[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]'' and Conducted by [[Eugen Jochum]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Zardoz (1974) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070948/soundtrack|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>\n<br />\n==Release==\nZardoz was released in theaters on February 6, 1974 in Los Angeles and New York.

Nasreen and Missy, dressed in [[burqa]]s, purchase cider from the off licence, running away from the owner, and take a large bundle of drug money from Jordan. The staff attend Samir and Maryam's wedding reception at school, but he and Emma are seen kissing by Missy and Nasreen. The next morning, Emma wakes up next to Will, and Missy and Nasreen realise what they did. Kaneez talks to Nasreen about her and Naveed, Nasreen's fianc\u00e9, and how to behave at school. Jordan is hassled about the money by a drug dealer, who is warned off by Emma. Nasreen and Naveed kiss in front of everyone; Nasreen tells Missy she wants an easy life when Missy questions her feelings over the arranged marriage. Kaneez knocks down the new biology teacher Rashid while learning to drive, whilst Year 11 take their mock exam and Nasreen and Alya are sent to isolation for fighting when Alya taunts Nasreen with rumours that she and Naveed are having sex. After Missy walks out of her exam when the words she sees are jumbled up, she and Nasreen run away from a caf\u00e9 when they think the drug dealer's associate is watching them with the money, but the boy, Aaron, catches up with them, explaining that Iqbal is living in Bradford with another family and he is her half-brother. Mandy decides to pull out low achievers from non-core subjects, which infuriates Emma and her Year 11 students. Missy accompanies Nasreen to Bradford to confront Iqbal, and Chloe lends Jordan money to repay the drug dealer. Emma's Year 11 students confront the staff, choosing to stage a protest, but they give up when they realise their future college courses only require core subject qualifications. Nasreen locates Iqbal with his wife Sandra Turner, daughter Amy, and Aaron, discovering that their relationship has been going on since before her birth. Nasreen meets Naveed's family and when Iqbal returns, Nasreen tells Kaneez about his secret family, but after realising Kaneez already knew, Nasreen calls off the engagement. Emma and Samir kiss and Kaneez explains to Nasreen that she knew of Iqbal's marriage shortly after she married Iqbal, and Nasreen persuades Kaneez to let her have a girlfriend. Missy and Nasreen throw the drug money off the roof in burqas and when Jordan gives some money to the drug dealer, he orders \u00a340 a day until the money is paid off. \n|LineColor       = 645348\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Ackley Bridge (series 2)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 8\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n|Title           = Episode 2\n|RTitle          = \n|DirectedBy      = Penny Woolcock\n|WrittenBy       = Perrie Balthazar\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|06|12|df=y}} \n|Viewers         = 1.66\n|ShortSummary    = Jordan gives Cory an invite from Candice to Jamie's christening, while Mandy forces students to remove make up and smarten up at the school entrance as Steve and Will break up Jordan and Cory fighting. Nasreen rejects Aaron when he turns up and during Science, Hayley gets eyebrow pencil on her face when she tries to reapply her make up as Jordan offers for his family to pay half of Jamie's christening to Candice. Simone receives a visit from a loan shark, Linda, demanding money to repay the debt of Simone's ex-boyfriend Craig and Kevin refuses to contribute to Jamie's christening. Jordan is threatened by Candice's brothers for the money towards the christening when he cannot pay their half, so Cory and Jordan steal [[Alpacas]] and attempt to sell them to a butcher. Razia struggles with the revelation of Iqbal having two families, which has an impact on her homework and Missy has to work on a burger van to repay Simone's ex-boyfriend's debt; when Emma finds out, she suggests to Mandy that they organise a school play for the students to change their opinion of Mandy due to her actions. Kevin is called into school when they find out about the Alpacas and he is updated on Jordan's progress, which infuriates Kevin, especially when he fails to secure a job, and a row between Kevin and Jordan results in Kevin beating up Jordan. Missy decides to return to school when Mandy tells her about the play. Rashid informs Kaneez of Razia's struggles and Claire, the mother of Steve's son Zac, turns up at school with him. Missy is unimpressed when Simone reconciles with her ex-boyfriend and Steve finds out about Jordan's beating from Cory when Jordan attacks Will after PE; Cory and Jordan choose to report Kevin. Mandy and Steve start to reconcile and Rashid puts forward to Kaneez the suggestion that Razia has [[dyspraxia]], unintentionally angering Kaneez, and Jordan backs out of reporting Kevin.

At school, Chloe is comforted by Will when she is upset about being dumped by Jordan, which Alya witnesses, and Rashid invites Kaneez to a concert. Alya believes the Muslim students should not participate in the school play due to it not being relevant to their culture and when Emma tries to justify the chosen play, Alya tells Emma about Chloe and Will. Nasreen argues with Missy about her relationship with Aaron and Kaneez is hurt that Emma implies that she does not need a boyfriend. Kaneez rejects Aaron when Missy attempts to introduce him to her, so Kaneez goes to see Sandra, wanting Aaron away and does not want Iqbal anymore, choosing to put herself first. Kaneez has her hair restyled and Aaron tells Kaneez he is in Ackley Bridge for Missy, accepting that his siblings do not want him, but Hayley insists he goes, and at the concert, Rashid is the one performing. Later at Rashid's, he and Kaneez kiss when he opens up about his feelings towards her and they sleep together. Emma confronts Will, demanding to know about him and Chloe, but Will explains Chloe was dumped by Jordan, so he helped Chloe because he loves Emma. Hayley overhears Simone and Aaron talk about Hayley's bond with Missy, so he opts to end things with Missy. Hayley and Razia go to see Aaron and Hayley gives Aaron her blessing for him to be in a relationship with Missy. Emma and Samir have sex, but Samir is unsure of whether to leave his wife. Nasreen and Kaneez also approve of Missy's relationship and Kaneez decides that she needs time before embarking on a relationship with Rashid.

Samir returns home to find Khadim there and Samir warns him not to punish Jordan over the video to save his reputation. Samir introduces boxing to Jordan, and Alya and Sadiq are unimpressed that Will is teaching Science to the 6th form because Rashid is focusing on the Year 11s. Nasreen and Missy join a football team, where Nasreen is asked out by a player, Megan, and when Jordan decides to give up boxing, Samir tells him he has been awarded a government bursary to maintain boxing. The Nawaz family visit Mandy about Rashid not teaching Year 12, but Mandy refuses to back down as Year 11 take priority, and Nasreen is asked out by Megan. Jordan fights with Mo when he is teased about boxing and Emma finds out about the bursary, which is Samir's money; when Jordan finds out, he returns to drug dealing. Nasreen escapes from her date when Megan invites Nasreen to her place and she is surprised by Aaron's accepting reaction to her being lesbian. Sadiq reluctantly agrees to help Samir warn Khadim away. Samir delights Emma by deciding to admit to his affair, and Mandy is against Sadiq's plans to introduce another deputy headteacher.

Nasreen arranges a date with the woman as Kaneez rips down posters from the school with the woman pictured as she is behind the profile, whilst Year 12 discuss Samir's death. The Year 11 girls crush over Riz, and Kaneez continues to talk to Nasreen on the app. Missy comforts Emma when she admits she and Nasreen saw her and Samir kiss at the wedding. Missy finds out about Kaneez pretending to be Sameera from Emma's posters, so Missy urges her to delete the profile, and Cory tells Mandy that Jordan has been kicked out by their dad, so Mandy lets them know she has to inform child services. Prior to the rugby match, Naveed kisses a shocked Cory and during the match, the scout shows more interest in Riz, so Steve encourages Cory to do his best. When the match continues, Steve berates Kevin for chucking Jordan out and Riz is injured by Cory during a tackle, resulting in him being taken to hospital. Nasreen finds out that Kaneez is Sameera and that Missy knew when she sends a nude selfie. Jordan is given a place at a hostel by child services, whilst Steve decides he does not want to apply for the deputy headship. Mandy and Steve decide to let Jordan live with them, but find he has run away from the hostel. Riz is diagnosed with an unstable neck fracture that requires the use of a neck brace, and Missy is hurt when Nasreen meets up with Naveed. Kaneez apologises to Nasreen, but Nasreen warns Kaneez not to interfere as Kaneez warns Nasreen about sending nudes.\n\n'''Note:''' Broadcast on Wednesday instead of Tuesday due to Colombia v England live coverage of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-07-04/why-isnt-ackley-bridge-on-tv-tonight-channel-4/|title=Why isn\u2019t Ackley Bridge on TV tonight?|work=Radio Times|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=3 July 2018|accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref>\n|LineColor       = 645348\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Ackley Bridge (series 2)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 12\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n|Title           = Episode 6\n|RTitle          = \n|DirectedBy      = Joe Stephenson\n|WrittenBy       = Matt Evans\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|07|10|df=y}} \n|Viewers         = 1.36\n|ShortSummary    = Simone goes for a job interview and when she is offered a job, she is recognised as a shoplifter.

In multiple cases, spacecraft have been observed to gain greater speed than scientists had predicted, but thus far no convincing explanation has been found. This anomaly has been observed as shifts in the [[s band|S-band]] and [[x band|X-band]] [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] and ranging [[telemetry]].  The largest discrepancy noticed during a flyby has been 13&nbsp;mm/s.<ref name=\"Rosetta\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=29609 |title=ESA's Rosetta spacecraft may help unravel cosmic mystery |date=November 12, 2009 |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Observations==\n[[gravitational slingshot|Gravitational assists]] are valuable techniques for [[Timeline of Solar System exploration|Solar System exploration]]. Because the success of such flyby maneuvers depends on the exact geometry of the [[trajectory]], the position and velocity of a spacecraft during its encounter with a planet is continually tracked with great precision by the [[Deep Space Network]] (DSN).\n\n[[Image:AntreasianGuinn199803b.jpg|thumb|Range residuals during the Earth flyby of NEAR]]\n[[File:Mdis depart anot.ogv|thumb|During its flyby, MESSENGER did not observe any anomalies]]\n\nThe flyby anomaly was first noticed during a careful inspection of DSN Doppler data shortly after the Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] on 8 December 1990. While the Doppler residuals (observed minus computed data) were expected to remain flat, the analysis revealed an unexpected 66&nbsp;[[millihertz|mHz]] shift, which corresponds to a velocity increase of 3.92&nbsp;mm/s at [[Apsis|perigee]]. Investigations of this effect at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the [[University of Texas]] have not yielded a satisfactory explanation. \n\nNo such anomaly was detected after the second Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] in December 1992, where the measured velocity decrease matched that expected from atmospheric drag at the lower altitude of 303&nbsp;km.  However, the drag estimates had large error bars, and so an anomalous acceleration could not be ruled out.<ref name=\"GAL2\">{{cite journal |title=TRACKING GALILEO AT EARTH-2 PERIGEE USING THE TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITE SYSTEM |author=C, Edwards, J.

The two [measurement] methods yielded similar fits to the data. Within an uncertainty of eight percent, both methods yielded a decrease in velocity along track of \u22125.9\u00b10.2 mm/s. A priori predictions for the drag-induced velocity change, based on the Jacchia\u2013Roberts model, were \u22126.2\u00b14.O mm/s [5], clearly consistent with the observed velocity change. In contrast, DSN data from the December 1990 Earth flyby, at altitude 956 km, indicated an unexplained increase in along-track velocity of 4 mm/s, after accounting for the much smaller drag effects.  Given the uncertainty in drag models, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that a similar increase occurred at Earth 2. For example, an unmodeled increase of 4 mm/s and a drag decrease of \u221210 mm/s would be compatible with our results and our a priori atmospheric model. Significantly larger anomalous velocity increases, however, would appear inconsistent with the drag model.</ref>\n\nOn 23 January 1998 the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ([[NEAR]]) spacecraft experienced an anomalous velocity increase of 13.46&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth encounter. [[Cassini\u2013Huygens]] gained around 0.11&nbsp;mm/s in August 1999, and [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] gained 1.82&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth flyby in March 2005.\n\nAn analysis of the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft (studying [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) did not reveal any significant unexpected velocity increase. This may be because MESSENGER both approached and departed Earth symmetrically about the equator (see data and proposed equation below).  This suggests that the anomaly may be related to Earth's rotation.\n\nIn November 2009, ESA's [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta spacecraft]] was tracked closely during flyby in order to precisely measure its velocity, in an effort to gather further data about the anomaly, but no significant anomaly was found.<ref name=\"ESA\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nav.ei.tum.de/fileadmin/w00bkq/layout/colloquium_biele_slides.pdf |title=Navigation of the interplanetary Rosetta and Philae spacecraft and the determination of the gravitational field of comets and asteroids - (DLR) @ TU M\u00fcnchen, 2012 |author=J.

While the Doppler residuals (observed minus computed data) were expected to remain flat, the analysis revealed an unexpected 66&nbsp;[[millihertz|mHz]] shift, which corresponds to a velocity increase of 3.92&nbsp;mm/s at [[Apsis|perigee]]. Investigations of this effect at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the [[University of Texas]] have not yielded a satisfactory explanation. \n\nNo such anomaly was detected after the second Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] in December 1992, where the measured velocity decrease matched that expected from atmospheric drag at the lower altitude of 303&nbsp;km.  However, the drag estimates had large error bars, and so an anomalous acceleration could not be ruled out.<ref name=\"GAL2\">{{cite journal |title=TRACKING GALILEO AT EARTH-2 PERIGEE USING THE TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITE SYSTEM |author=C, Edwards, J.

The two [measurement] methods yielded similar fits to the data. Within an uncertainty of eight percent, both methods yielded a decrease in velocity along track of \u22125.9\u00b10.2 mm/s. A priori predictions for the drag-induced velocity change, based on the Jacchia\u2013Roberts model, were \u22126.2\u00b14.O mm/s [5], clearly consistent with the observed velocity change. In contrast, DSN data from the December 1990 Earth flyby, at altitude 956 km, indicated an unexplained increase in along-track velocity of 4 mm/s, after accounting for the much smaller drag effects.  Given the uncertainty in drag models, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that a similar increase occurred at Earth 2. For example, an unmodeled increase of 4 mm/s and a drag decrease of \u221210 mm/s would be compatible with our results and our a priori atmospheric model. Significantly larger anomalous velocity increases, however, would appear inconsistent with the drag model.</ref>\n\nOn 23 January 1998 the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ([[NEAR]]) spacecraft experienced an anomalous velocity increase of 13.46&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth encounter. [[Cassini\u2013Huygens]] gained around 0.11&nbsp;mm/s in August 1999, and [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] gained 1.82&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth flyby in March 2005.\n\nAn analysis of the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft (studying [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) did not reveal any significant unexpected velocity increase.

The primary escape for most people is a virtual universe called the OASIS, which is accessed with a visor and [[haptic glove]]s. It functions both as an [[Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game|MMORPG]] and as a virtual society, with its currency being the most stable currency in the world. It was created by James Halliday, who has recently died. His will left a series of clues towards an [[Easter Egg (media)|Easter Egg]] within the OASIS that would grant whoever found it both his fortune and control of the OASIS itself. This has led to an intense interest in all aspects of 80's pop culture, which Halliday made clear would be essential to finding his egg. \n<!-- ch. 0, 1 -->\n\n===Plot ===\nWade Watts is a teenager who lives in a slum with his aunt. He attends school within the OASIS but lacks the virtual currency or XP levels to travel to other locations. He is a 'gunter' (an egg hunter) who spends all of his spare time researching films, songs, TV series and videogames from the 80s and 90s to aid his hunt. The hunt has been going on for five years, yet no one has been able to find the first key. Then, Wade, who goes by the avatar name Parzival, stumbles upon a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' reference in the first clue and after defeating an [[Non-player character|NPC]] character at ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'', is given a key which unlocks a gate. This gate places him in a simulation of the film ''[[WarGames]]'' in which he has to recreate the lines of the lead character. After clearing the gate, he is awarded points and his avatar's name appears on the previously empty Scoreboard. \n\nHis avatar becomes famous within the OASIS, as does his friend Aech and another gunter named Art3mis who clear the gate shortly after him. He takes advantage of his fame, endorsing virtual products for credits, and develops a tentative relationship with Art3mis. He is approached by a corporation (IOI) who want to control the OASIS and after he refuses, they unsuccessfully attempt to assassinate him. \n\nThe hunt for the egg continues and more keys are discovered and gates are cleared. Wade loses both his place at the top of the leaderboard and his friendship with Aech and Art3mis, becoming increasingly isolated. Art3mis opens the second gate and obtains the Jade key, followed by Aech who also gives Parzival a hint about its location. IOI who had been monitoring the locations of Art3mis and Aech using purchased items on the OASIS also discover its location. Shortly after, Parzival, Daito and Shoto also reach the gate's location. Daito is killed by the IOI in real life as he is helping Shoto open the second gate. \n\nEventually the final gate is discovered by IOI who are unable to open it. They barricade the location, so Wade infiltrates the real world headquarters of IOI and hacks their databases. He enlists the help of all the gunters in the OASIS to launch a coordinated assault on the corporate forces, during which all the avatars are killed before Parzival solves the final puzzle with the help of Aech and Art3mis. He clears the gate and claims the egg, awarding him control of the OASIS, including the ability to switch it off.

The primary escape for most people is a virtual universe called the OASIS, which is accessed with a visor and haptic gloves. It functions both as an [[Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game|MMORPG]] and as a virtual society, with its currency being the most stable currency in the world. It was created by James Halliday, who has recently died. His will left a series of clues towards an [[Easter Egg (media)|Easter Egg]] within the OASIS that would grant whoever found it both his fortune and control of the OASIS itself. This has led to an intense interest in all aspects of 80's pop culture, which Halliday made clear would be essential to finding his egg. \n<!-- ch. 0, 1 -->\n\n===Plot ===\nWade Watts is a teenager who lives in a slum with his aunt. He attends school within the OASIS but lacks the virtual currency or XP levels to travel to other locations. He is a 'gunter' (an egg hunter) who spends all of his spare time researching films, songs, TV series and videogames from the 80s and 90s to aid his hunt. The hunt has been going on for five years, yet no one has been able to find the first key. Then, Wade, who goes by the avatar name Parzival, stumbles upon a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' reference in the first clue and after defeating an [[Non-player character|NPC]] character at ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'', is given a key which unlocks a gate. This gate places him in a simulation of the film ''[[WarGames]]'' in which he has to recreate the lines of the lead character. After clearing the gate, he is awarded points and his avatar's name appears on the previously empty Scoreboard. \n\nHis avatar becomes famous within the OASIS, as does his friend Aech and another gunter named Art3mis who clear the gate shortly after him. He takes advantage of his fame, endorsing virtual products for credits, and develops a tentative relationship with Art3mis. He is approached by a corporation (IOI) who want to control the OASIS and after he refuses, they unsuccessfully attempt to assassinate him. \n\nThe hunt for the egg continues and more keys are discovered and gates are cleared. Wade loses both his place at the top of the leaderboard and his friendship with Aech and Art3mis, becoming increasingly isolated. Art3mis opens the second gate and obtains the Jade key, followed by Aech who also gives Parzival a hint about its location. IOI who had been monitoring the locations of Art3mis and Aech using purchased items on the OASIS also discover its location. Shortly after, Parzival, Daito and Shoto also reach the gate's location. Daito is killed by the IOI in real life as he is helping Shoto open the second gate. \n\nEventually the final gate is discovered by IOI who are unable to open it. They barricade the location, so Wade infiltrates the real world headquarters of IOI and hacks their databases. He enlists the help of all the gunters in the OASIS to launch a coordinated assault on the corporate forces, during which all the avatars are killed before Parzival solves the final puzzle with the help of Aech and Art3mis. He clears the gate and claims the egg, awarding him control of the OASIS, including the ability to switch it off. In real life, he and Art3mis finally meet in person and kiss.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''{{vanchor|Wade Owen Watts|Parzival|Wade3}}''' {{aka}} '''Parzival''': The [[viewpoint character]], an orphan from the \"stacks\" surrounding metropolitan [[Oklahoma City]].

'''Anorak''': The creator of OASIS. His avatar's name is based on a British slang term for an obsessive geek. His character was initially inspired by [[Willy Wonka]] who Cline described as a \"rich eccentric holding a fantastic contest\". Cline used the personalities of [[Howard Hughes]] and [[Richard Garriott]], and placed Halliday's birth year around the same as his own so that his pop culture interests would coincide with Cline's \"and the other middle-aged uber geeks I know\".<ref name=\"wired fanboys\">{{cite news| url=http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2011/06/a-few-minutes-with-fanboys-writer-ernest-cline-on-ready-player-one/ | work=Wired | first=Tony | last=Sims | title=A Few Minutes With Fanboys Writer Ernest Cline on Ready Player One | date=June 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"cline 20111019\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ernestcline.com/blog/2011/10/19/how-lord-british-inspired-anorak/ |title=How Lord British Inspired Anorak &#124; Ernie's Blog |publisher=Ernestcline.com |date=October 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>\n* '''{{vanchor|Aech}}''' (pronounced like the [[H (letter)|letter H]]{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 33}}): Wade's best friend, fellow gunter, and rival in the quest to find the egg.

Regarding the abundance of pop culture references, Shager called the book \"an unbearable celebration of nostalgic juvenilia\". He summarized his argument against the book by stating \"It\u2019s a lionization of immature things (and immaturity) as an end to itself, rather than as the building blocks of more mature \u2013 and worthwhile \u2013 creations\". Shager also lamented the book's \"[[Peter Pan]]-ish infatuation with childishness, which comes coated in a stench of stale Doritos, Jolt Cola and lowbrow smugness\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shager |first1=Nick |title=How is Steven Spielberg going to make a great movie out of this god-awful book? |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-is-steven-spielberg-going-to-make-a-great-movie-out-of-this-god-awful-book?ref=scroll |website=The Daily Beast |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael J.

Don was also a prolific author of hobbyist projects for ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Radio-Electronics]]'' magazines. The video project gave Don the inspiration for his most influential project, a low cost video terminal known as the TV Typewriter. The design used [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL digital]] logic and [[shift register]] memory. (Microprocessors and RAM were new and very expensive.) With professional terminals costing over $1000 this $120 kit looked like a bargain. [[SWTPC|Southwest Technical Products]] sold the set of bare circuit boards for $27 and the eight major integrated circuits for $49.50. The hobbyist had to acquire the rest of the components on their own.\n\nIn the November issue, the editors apologized for the delays in shipping the TV Typewriter booklets to the thousands of readers that ordered them. They also listed electronics parts sources for the difficult to find components. Don Lancaster also answered a series of reader questions and gave ideas for additional functions and uses for the TV Typewriter.<ref name = \"RE Nov 1973\">{{cite journal | last = Editors | title = TV Typewriter Notes and Comments | journal =Radio Electronics | volume = 44 | issue = 11 |pages=16, 22 | publisher = Gernsback Publications | location = New York | date = November 1973}}</ref> The December issue had a page of corrections for the TV Typewriter booklet.<ref name = \"RE Dec 1973\">{{cite journal | last = Lancaster | first = Don | title = TV Typewriter Corrections | journal =Radio Electronics | volume = 44 | issue = 12 |pages=16, 22 | publisher = Gernsback Publications | location = New York | date = December 1973}}</ref> Both of the notices were included in later printings of the booklet.\n\nThe compact design and complex circuitry made the TV Typewriter a challenging project for hobbyists. But many finished the project and some even connected it to their [[Intel 8008]] based computers. The April 1975 issue of the ''Micro-8 Newsletter'' has 6 pages of user modifications and interface designs to connect the TV Typewriter to [[Mark-8]] or [[SCELBI]] computers.<ref name = \"Micro-8\">{{cite journal | last =Singer | first =Hal (Editor). | title = Modifications for the TVT-1 | journal = Micro-8 Computer User Group Newsletter | publisher = Cabrillo Computer Center | volume =1 | issue =6 | pages =27\u201333| location = Lompoc, CA | date = April 15, 1975}}</ref> The original TV Typewriter design did not include a serial interface, modem connection, or offline [[Compact Cassette#Data recording|data storage on cassette tape]]. Don Lancaster wrote about these in the September 1975 issue of [[Byte (magazine)|''BYTE'' magazine]] and his TV Typewriter Cookbook. A serial interface board designed by Roger Smith was published in the February 1975 issue of ''Radio Electronics''.<ref name=\"TVT UART\">{{cite magazine | last = Smith | first = Roger | date  = February 1975  | title = UART and Modem for TV Typewriter |magazine= Radio-Electronics | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages =51\u201353 | publisher = Gernsback Publications}}</ref>\n\n== Keyboards ==\n[[Image:SWTPC Keyboard.jpg|thumb|right|Don Lancaster's $40 Keyboard kit produced by SWTPC.]] Today keyboards are readily available and inexpensive, and they have a standard interface. In 1973, new keyboards were only available to computer and terminal manufacturers. Surplus keyboards were available to hobbyists but they often produced codes other than [[ASCII]], such as [[Baudot code|baudot]] or [[EBCDIC]]. The TV Typewriter project and kit did not include a keyboard. The unit on the September cover shows a keyboard project Don Lancaster did in the February 1973 issue.<ref name = \"RE Feb 1973\">{{cite journal | last = Lancaster | first = Don | title = Low-Cost Keyboards | journal =Radio Electronics | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages =54\u201357, 87, 88 | publisher = Gernsback Publications | location = New York | date = February 1973}}</ref> This project involved hand crafting 55 key-switches including fabricating the springs for each key-switch. Most hobbyists chose to use a surplus keyboard and modified it to produce ASCII codes. Don Lancaster's prototype TV Typewriter which is now on display at the [[Computer History Museum]] has a surplus keyboard with an ASCII encoder circuit that was published in the February 1974 issue of Radio-Electronics.<ref name = \"RE Feb 1974\">{{cite magazine | last = Lancaster | first = Don | date  = February 1974  | title = Build Improved ASCII Encoder |magazine= Radio-Electronics | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages =59\u201361, 92\u201396 | publisher = Gernsback Publications | location = New York}}</ref> The plans for this encoder were also included in the TV Typewriter booklet\n\n''Popular Electronics'' (April 1974) featured a complete keyboard kit designed by Don Lancaster and available from Southwest Technical Products for $39.50.<ref name = \"Keyboard\">{{cite magazine | last = Lancaster | first = Don | date = April 1974 | title = ASCII Keyboard and Encoder |magazine= Popular Electronics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages =27\u201331 | publisher = Ziff Davis}}</ref> The first version used simple [[Resistor\u2013transistor logic|RTL]] ICs to decode the key matrix. The design was soon improved to use a full featured keyboard encoder IC.\n\n== TVT II - CT-1024 Terminal ==\n[[Image:CT1024 Monitor.jpg|thumb|left|CT-1024 Terminal with monitor]]\n[[Image:CT1024 Terminal System.jpg|thumb|right|CT-1024 Terminal System]]\nThe original TV Typewriter was difficult to assemble and some of the ICs were going out of production so Southwest Technical Products decided to redesign the kit. The replacement was featured in Radio Electronics as the TV Typewriter II. This time readers did not have to order a set of plans, since the complete design was published in 6 issues starting in February 1975.\n\n[[Daniel Meyer (engineer)|Daniel Meyer]] of [[SWTPC]] enlisted Ed Colle, an engineer who had worked at [[Datapoint]] on terminal design, to design the new TV Typewriter. The SWTPC CT-1024 Terminal displayed 32 characters by 16 lines without scrolling. It used common TTL parts and 2102 static RAMs. The boards were laid out with very loose part spacing and wide traces to make it easy to assemble. A complete set of option boards was offered including a serial interface. The keyboard was based on Don Lancaster\u2019s design. The rest of the terminal was done by Ed Colle.\n\nThe design was finished by late 1974 and the kits were ready for sale by December 1974. The first advertisement for the CT-1024 appeared in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics on the page facing the Altair 8800 computer article.<ref name =\"Altair 8800\">{{cite magazine | last = Roberts | first = H.

The Altair 8800 article started on page 33.</ref> The CT-1024 was very successful because a complete kit with options cost only $275. It was replaced in 1977 by the improved CT-64 that offered scrolling and 64 characters per line of upper and lower case.\n\n==TV Typewriter Cookbook==\n[[Image:TV Typewriter Cookbook.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter Cookbook]]\n\nBy 1975 Don Lancaster had written over 100 articles in magazines such as ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Radio-Electronics]]''. He had also written a digital design book titled the ''RTL Cookbook'' in 1968. [[Resistor\u2013transistor logic]] (RTL) was an early IC technology that was replaced by [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL]], so in 1974 he published the ''TTL Cookbook''. This book was in print for 20 years and sold a million copies.\n\nThe original TV Typewriter was designed before low cost [[random access memory|RAM]] was available and the design was soon obsolete. Don had made many design improvements and published them as the ''TV Typewriter Cookbook'' in 1976. Portions had been serialized in the first issues of [[Byte (magazine)|Byte magazine]]. The book was a guide on how to design a video computer terminal.\n\n# Some Basics\n# Integrated Circuits for TVT use\n# Memory\n# System Timing - Calculation and Circuits\n# Cursor and Update Circuits\n# Keyboards and Encoders\n# Serial Interfaces\n# Television Interfaces\n# Hard Copy and Color Graphics\n\nThis book guided many hobbyist and professionals in designing video displays for home computer systems. The cassette interface design from chapter 7 was the basis for the [[Kansas City standard]]. The circuits in this book did not rely on a microprocessor, just TTL. The ''TV Cheap Video Cookbook'' (1978) showed the TVT 6 5/8 that would work with a [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] or [[Motorola 6800|6800]] microprocessor. The design was targeted at the [[KIM-1]] Microcomputer.\n\nThe original TV Typewriter book cover shows an ASCII keyboard designed by Don Lancaster and sold by Southwest Technical Products. An early computer store chain, the [[Paul Terrell|Byte Shop]], had the publisher add their logo to the covers and sold the ''TTL Cookbook'' and the ''TV Typewriter Cookbook'' in their stores. A later edition cover was designed for [[Radio Shack]] stores. The ninth printing of the first edition was in 1983.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Home computer]]\n* [[Personal computer]]\n* [[History of computing hardware (1960s\u2013present)]]\n* [[Character generator]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n{{refbegin|3}}\n; Books\n* {{cite book | last = Lancaster | first = Don | authorlink = Don Lancaster | title = RTL Cookbook | edition = First | year = 1969 | publisher = Howard W.

Don was also a prolific author of hobbyist projects for ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Radio-Electronics]]'' magazines. The video project gave Don the inspiration for his most influential project, a low cost video terminal known as the TV Typewriter. The design used [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL digital]] logic and [[shift register]] memory. (Microprocessors and RAM were new and very expensive.) With professional terminals costing over $1000 this $120 kit looked like a bargain. [[SWTPC|Southwest Technical Products]] sold the set of bare circuit boards for $27 and the eight major integrated circuits for $49.50. The hobbyist had to acquire the rest of the components on their own.\n\nIn the November issue, the editors apologized for the delays in shipping the TV Typewriter booklets to the thousands of readers that ordered them. They also listed electronics parts sources for the difficult to find components. Don Lancaster also answered a series of reader questions and gave ideas for additional functions and uses for the TV Typewriter.<ref name = \"RE Nov 1973\">{{cite journal | last = Editors | title = TV Typewriter Notes and Comments | journal =Radio Electronics | volume = 44 | issue = 11 |pages=16, 22 | publisher = Gernsback Publications | location = New York | date = November 1973}}</ref> The December issue had a page of corrections for the TV Typewriter booklet.<ref name = \"RE Dec 1973\">{{cite journal | last = Lancaster | first = Don | title = TV Typewriter Corrections | journal =Radio Electronics | volume = 44 | issue = 12 |pages=16, 22 | publisher = Gernsback Publications | location = New York | date = December 1973}}</ref> Both of the notices were included in later printings of the booklet.\n\nThe compact design and complex circuitry made the TV Typewriter a challenging project for hobbyists. But many finished the project and some even connected it to their [[Intel 8008]] based computers. The April 1975 issue of the ''Micro-8 Newsletter'' has 6 pages of user modifications and interface designs to connect the TV Typewriter to [[Mark-8]] or [[SCELBI]] computers.<ref name = \"Micro-8\">{{cite journal | last =Singer | first =Hal (Editor). | title = Modifications for the TVT-1 | journal = Micro-8 Computer User Group Newsletter | publisher = Cabrillo Computer Center | volume =1 | issue =6 | pages =27\u201333| location = Lompoc, CA | date = April 15, 1975}}</ref> The original TV Typewriter design did not include a serial interface, modem connection, or offline [[Compact Cassette#Data recording|data storage on cassette tape]]. Don Lancaster wrote about these in the September 1975 issue of [[Byte (magazine)|''BYTE'' magazine]] and his TV Typewriter Cookbook. A serial interface board designed by Roger Smith was published in the February 1975 issue of ''Radio Electronics''.<ref name=\"TVT UART\">{{cite magazine | last = Smith | first = Roger | date  = February 1975  | title = UART and Modem for TV Typewriter |magazine= Radio-Electronics | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages =51\u201353 | publisher = Gernsback Publications}}</ref>\n\n== Keyboards ==\n[[Image:SWTPC Keyboard.jpg|thumb|right|Don Lancaster's $40 Keyboard kit produced by SWTPC.]] Today keyboards are readily available and inexpensive, and they have a standard interface. In 1973, new keyboards were only available to computer and terminal manufacturers. Surplus keyboards were available to hobbyists but they often produced codes other than [[ASCII]], such as [[Baudot code|baudot]] or [[EBCDIC]]. The TV Typewriter project and kit did not include a keyboard. The unit on the September cover shows a keyboard project Don Lancaster did in the February 1973 issue.<ref name = \"RE Feb 1973\">{{cite journal | last = Lancaster | first = Don | title = Low-Cost Keyboards | journal =Radio Electronics | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages =54\u201357, 87, 88 | publisher = Gernsback Publications | location = New York | date = February 1973}}</ref> This project involved hand crafting 55 key-switches including fabricating the springs for each key-switch. Most hobbyists chose to use a surplus keyboard and modified it to produce ASCII codes. Don Lancaster's prototype TV Typewriter which is now on display at the [[Computer History Museum]] has a surplus keyboard with an ASCII encoder circuit that was published in the February 1974 issue of Radio-Electronics.<ref name = \"RE Feb 1974\">{{cite magazine | last = Lancaster | first = Don | date  = February 1974  | title = Build Improved ASCII Encoder |magazine= Radio-Electronics | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages =59\u201361, 92\u201396 | publisher = Gernsback Publications | location = New York}}</ref> The plans for this encoder were also included in the TV Typewriter booklet\n\n''Popular Electronics'' (April 1974) featured a complete keyboard kit designed by Don Lancaster and available from Southwest Technical Products for $39.50.<ref name = \"Keyboard\">{{cite magazine | last = Lancaster | first = Don | date = April 1974 | title = ASCII Keyboard and Encoder |magazine= Popular Electronics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages =27\u201331 | publisher = Ziff Davis}}</ref> The first version used simple [[Resistor\u2013transistor logic|RTL]] ICs to decode the key matrix. The design was soon improved to use a full featured keyboard encoder IC.\n\n== TVT II - CT-1024 Terminal ==\n[[Image:CT1024 Monitor.jpg|thumb|left|CT-1024 Terminal with monitor]]\n[[Image:CT1024 Terminal System.jpg|thumb|right|CT-1024 Terminal System]]\nThe original TV Typewriter was difficult to assemble and some of the ICs were going out of production so Southwest Technical Products decided to redesign the kit. The replacement was featured in Radio Electronics as the TV Typewriter II. This time readers did not have to order a set of plans, since the complete design was published in 6 issues starting in February 1975.\n\n[[Daniel Meyer (engineer)|Daniel Meyer]] of [[SWTPC]] enlisted Ed Colle, an engineer who had worked at [[Datapoint]] on terminal design, to design the new TV Typewriter. The SWTPC CT-1024 Terminal displayed 32 characters by 16 lines without scrolling. It used common TTL parts and 2102 static RAMs. The boards were laid out with very loose part spacing and wide traces to make it easy to assemble. A complete set of option boards was offered including a serial interface. The keyboard was based on Don Lancaster\u2019s design. The rest of the terminal was done by Ed Colle.\n\nThe design was finished by late 1974 and the kits were ready for sale by December 1974. The first advertisement for the CT-1024 appeared in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics on the page facing the Altair 8800 computer article.<ref name =\"Altair 8800\">{{cite magazine | last = Roberts | first = H. Edward |author2=William Yates  | title = Altair 8800 minicomputer |magazine=Popular Electronics | volume =7 | issue =1 | pages =33\u201338 | publisher =Ziff-Davis | location =New York |  date  = January 1975}} The full page advertisement, \"SWTPC is Proud to Announce the CT-1024 Terminal System\", appeared on page 32. The Altair 8800 article started on page 33.</ref> The CT-1024 was very successful because a complete kit with options cost only $275. It was replaced in 1977 by the improved CT-64 that offered scrolling and 64 characters per line of upper and lower case.\n\n==TV Typewriter Cookbook==\n[[Image:TV Typewriter Cookbook.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter Cookbook]]\n\nBy 1975 Don Lancaster had written over 100 articles in magazines such as ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Radio-Electronics]]''. He had also written a digital design book titled the ''RTL Cookbook'' in 1968. [[Resistor\u2013transistor logic]] (RTL) was an early IC technology that was replaced by [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL]], so in 1974 he published the ''TTL Cookbook''. This book was in print for 20 years and sold a million copies.\n\nThe original TV Typewriter was designed before low cost [[random access memory|RAM]] was available and the design was soon obsolete. Don had made many design improvements and published them as the ''TV Typewriter Cookbook'' in 1976. Portions had been serialized in the first issues of [[Byte (magazine)|Byte magazine]]. The book was a guide on how to design a video computer terminal.\n\n# Some Basics\n# Integrated Circuits for TVT use\n# Memory\n# System Timing - Calculation and Circuits\n# Cursor and Update Circuits\n# Keyboards and Encoders\n# Serial Interfaces\n# Television Interfaces\n# Hard Copy and Color Graphics\n\nThis book guided many hobbyist and professionals in designing video displays for home computer systems. The cassette interface design from chapter 7 was the basis for the [[Kansas City standard]]. The circuits in this book did not rely on a microprocessor, just TTL. The ''TV Cheap Video Cookbook'' (1978) showed the TVT 6 5/8 that would work with a [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] or [[Motorola 6800|6800]] microprocessor. The design was targeted at the [[KIM-1]] Microcomputer.\n\nThe original TV Typewriter book cover shows an ASCII keyboard designed by Don Lancaster and sold by Southwest Technical Products. An early computer store chain, the [[Paul Terrell|Byte Shop]], had the publisher add their logo to the covers and sold the ''TTL Cookbook'' and the ''TV Typewriter Cookbook'' in their stores. A later edition cover was designed for [[Radio Shack]] stores. The ninth printing of the first edition was in 1983.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Home computer]]\n* [[Personal computer]]\n* [[History of computing hardware (1960s\u2013present)]]\n* [[Character generator]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n{{refbegin|3}}\n; Books\n* {{cite book | last = Lancaster | first = Don | authorlink = Don Lancaster | title = RTL Cookbook | edition = First | year = 1969 | publisher = Howard W.
