A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the German Legion, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]]. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th,]] parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the [[Lion's Mound]], a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]].

Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.waterloo-campaign.nl/bestanden/files/preambles/plannen.nap.pdf |title= The campaign of 1815: a study - A fundamental choice: a defensive or offensive war  |publisher= Waterloo Campaign NL | date= | author=  | accessdate= April 8, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nAn additional consideration for Napoleon was that a French victory might cause French-speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]].

The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another).

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}<ref name=\"Simner\"/><ref name=\"Perr2013\">{{cite book|author=Bryan Perrett|title=Why the Germans Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Black Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8o7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78159-197-0|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French. The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.{{sfn|Chesney|1874|p=144}}\n\nCrucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

The French pursued Wellington's retreating army to Waterloo; however, due to bad weather, mud and the head start that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry [[action at Genappe]], there was no substantial engagement.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.co.uk/history-of-the-battle-of-waterloo/waterloo |title= Waterloo - A damned near-run thing.

A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to him, meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington. More importantly, the heavily outnumbered Prussian rear-guard was able to use the River Dyle to enable a savage and prolonged action to delay Grouchy.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}<ref name=\"Waloo\">{{cite book|author=Battle of Waterloo|title=The battle of Waterloo, containing the series of accounts published by authority, British and foreign pp.=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2oUAAAAQAAJ|year=1815}}</ref>{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=64}}\n\nAs 17 June drew to a close, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following.

The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map showing the local geography, with Waterloo defending the approach to [[Brussels]]]]\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|thumb|upright=4|center|A panorama of the Waterloo battlefield in 2012]]\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle bless\u00e9'' (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}}\n\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of [[Genappe]]. Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the [[Brussels Cemetery#The British Waterloo Campaign Monument|British Monument]] in the [[Brussels Cemetery]] in [[Evere]].{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}} The remains of a 23-year-old soldier named Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012.{{sfn|Paton|2015}} He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, {{convert|1.60|m}} tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Peel|2012}}\n\n==Coin controversy==\nAs part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 [[Belgium]] minted a two-[[euro]] coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle. France officially protested against this issue of coins, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo.{{sfn|Torfs|2015}} After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2{{sfrac|1|2}} euros. Legally valid only within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 euros. A ten-euro coin, showing Wellington, Bl\u00fccher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 euros.{{sfn|Kottasova|2015}}\n\n==Recent discovery at Mont St. Jean==\nOn 15 July 2019, archaeologists at [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium]], found evidence of a shooting clash that happened there between attacking French cavalry and defending British infantry, including 58 [[musket ball]]s and 3 amputated human leg bones.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-17/human-remains-and-cannon-ball-unearthed-at-battle-of-waterloo-hospital-site/ |title=Human remains and cannon ball unearthed at Battle of Waterloo hospital site |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |work=[[ITV News]] |publisher=[[ITV plc]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/17/veterans-unearth-amputated-leg-bones-musket-balls-waterloo-field/ |title=Soldier archaeologists unearth musket balls and amputated leg bones at Battle of Waterloo field hospital site |first=James |last=Crisp |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |newspaper=[[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]] |page=16}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n* [[Lord Uxbridge's leg]] was shattered by a [[grape-shot]] at the Battle of Waterloo and removed by a surgeon.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the German Legion, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]]. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th,]] parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army.

Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last.

The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French. The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.{{sfn|Chesney|1874|p=144}}\n\nCrucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to him, meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington.

Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the [[King's German Legion]] (KGL). All of the [[British Army]] troops were regular soldiers, but only 7,000 of them were Peninsular War veterans.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=484}} In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], 6,000 from [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg#Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Brunswick]], and 3,000 from [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced.{{efn|Captain [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer]] [[Royal Horse Artillery|RHA]], thought the Brunswickers \"...perfect children.

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound.

It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day.

This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map showing the local geography, with Waterloo defending the approach to [[Brussels]]]]\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|thumb|upright=4|center|A panorama of the Waterloo battlefield in 2012]]\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west.

He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree...

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence.

Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel.

The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle\u2014a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault; however, Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Anglo-allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre. Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabb\u00e9 to order Ney to adjust, but Crabb\u00e9 was unable to get there in time.\n\nOther troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'\u00c9rlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the Anglo-allied line. Of these, P\u00e9got's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded.

The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back.

Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included the formation of the [[Holy Alliance]] of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former [[Holy Roman Empire]] into a [[German Confederation]] increasingly marked by the political dominance of [[Prussia]].

He also seems to have discounted the presence of B\u00fclow's substantial corps, which had not been in action at Ligny. Had Napoleon retained Grouchy's 30,000 men as a guard for his right flank, it is likely that these troops could have held off the Prussians and allowed the rest of Napoleon's army to attack Wellington's army unmolested.}} the second, was the admirable firmness of the British infantry, joined to the sang-froid and aplomb of its chiefs; the third, was the horrible weather, that had softened the ground, and rendered the offensive movements so toilsome, and retarded till one o'clock the attack that should have been made in the morning; the fourth, was the inconceivable formation of the first corps, in masses very much too deep for the first grand attack.|Antoine-Henri Jomini.{{sfn|Jomini|1864|pp=223, 224}} }}\n\nThe Prussian soldier, historian, and theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]], who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to Thielmann's Prussian III Corps during the Waterloo campaign, expressed the following opinion:\n\n{{quote|\nBonaparte and the authors who support him have always attempted to portray the great catastrophes that befell him as the result of chance.

The operation of General B\u00fclow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded\".<ref name=\"Gazette, 17028\"/>}}\nDespite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of the ''Campaign of 1815'' and ''Wellington's famous 1842 essay'' in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|loc=''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm Campaign of 1815]'' and ''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/six.htm Wellington's famous 1842 essay]''}} Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|pp=144\u2013145 (Chapter 41 of Clausewitz's ''Feldzug'')}}\n\nAn alternative view is that towards the end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help. For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: \"Neither army beat Napoleon alone. But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. ....

Established in 1919, its central focus is on [[entrepreneurship education]]. It was founded by [[Roger Babson|Roger W. Babson]] as an [[Men's colleges in the United States|all-male]] business institute but is now coeducational.\n\n== History ==\n\n===20th century===\n\n====The Babson Institute====\nOn September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Roger Babson]], the founder of the school, set out to distinguish the '''Babson Institute''' from colleges offering mainly instruction in business. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, [[finance]] and distribution in just one academic year, rather than four. The curriculum was divided into four subject areas: practical [[economics]], [[financial management]], business psychology and personal efficiency (which covered topics such as ethics, personal hygiene and interpersonal relationships). The program's pace assumed that students would learn arts and sciences content elsewhere.\n\nBabson favored a combination of class work and actual business training. Seasoned businessmen made up the majority of the faculty. To better prepare students for the realities of the business world, the Institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.\n\nThe institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours (8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday and 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to noon on Saturday) and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with a telephone, typewriter, adding machine, and Dictaphone. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to \"prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |title=Babson College: History |work=babson.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228002014/http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the Babson Institute's three-year bachelor of science in business administration, still for young men only, became a four-year bachelor of science degree, the Institute became a College and women were admitted for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|title=Timeline \u2013 Babson History|first=Babson|last=College|website=www.babson.edu|accessdate=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826071426/http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Three College Collaboration====\nBabson is involved in a three college collaboration with [[Olin College]] and [[Wellesley College]] (a collaboration often referred to as BOW).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centennial.babson.edu/babson100/|title=Babson 100|website=Babson Centennial|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bow3colleges.org/|title=Babson/Olin/Wellesley {{!}} Three College Collaboration|website=bow3colleges.org|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\n===Wellesley Main Campus===\nThe main residential campus of Babson College is {{convert|350|acre|km2}} and located in the \"Babson Park\" section of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], just fifteen miles west of [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/About/ |title=About Babson |work=babson.edu |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101227181958/http://www3.babson.edu/About/| archivedate= December 27, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> It is adjacent to the [[Franklin W.

Established in 1919, its central focus is on [[entrepreneurship education]]. It was founded by [[Roger Babson|Roger W. Babson]] as an [[Men's colleges in the United States|all-male]] business institute but is now coeducational.\n\n== History ==\n\n===20th century===\n\n====The Babson Institute====\nOn September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Roger Babson]], the founder of the school, set out to distinguish the '''Babson Institute''' from colleges offering mainly instruction in business. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, [[finance]] and distribution in just one academic year, rather than four. The curriculum was divided into four subject areas: practical [[economics]], [[financial management]], business psychology and personal efficiency (which covered topics such as ethics, personal hygiene and interpersonal relationships). The program's pace assumed that students would learn arts and sciences content elsewhere.\n\nBabson favored a combination of class work and actual business training. Seasoned businessmen made up the majority of the faculty. To better prepare students for the realities of the business world, the Institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.\n\nThe institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours (8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday and 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to noon on Saturday) and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with a telephone, typewriter, adding machine, and Dictaphone. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to \"prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |title=Babson College: History |work=babson.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228002014/http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the Babson Institute's three-year bachelor of science in business administration, still for young men only, became a four-year bachelor of science degree, the Institute became a College and women were admitted for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|title=Timeline \u2013 Babson History|first=Babson|last=College|website=www.babson.edu|accessdate=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826071426/http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Three College Collaboration====\nBabson is involved in a three college collaboration with [[Olin College]] and [[Wellesley College]] (a collaboration often referred to as BOW).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centennial.babson.edu/babson100/|title=Babson 100|website=Babson Centennial|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bow3colleges.org/|title=Babson/Olin/Wellesley {{!}} Three College Collaboration|website=bow3colleges.org|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\n===Wellesley Main Campus===\nThe main residential campus of Babson College is {{convert|350|acre|km2}} and located in the \"Babson Park\" section of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], just fifteen miles west of [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/About/ |title=About Babson |work=babson.edu |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101227181958/http://www3.babson.edu/About/| archivedate= December 27, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> It is adjacent to the [[Franklin W.
