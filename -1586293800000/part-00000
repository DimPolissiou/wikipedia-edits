It is usually understood for relating to various forms of media, as these technologies are used for the dissemination of information, of which [[journalism]] and [[advertising]] are part of. Mass communication differs from other forms of communication, such as [[interpersonal communication]] and [[organizational communication]], because it focuses on particular resources transmitting information to numerous receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the [[behavior]], the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[opinion]], or [[emotion]] of the people receiving the information.\n\nNormally, transmission of messages to many persons at a time is called mass communication. But in a complete sense, mass communication can be understood as the process of extensive circulation of information within regions and across the globe.\n\nThrough mass communication, information can be transmitted quickly to many people who generally stay far away from the sources of information. Mass communication is practiced multiple mediums, such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[social networking]], [[billboards]], [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], [[film]], and the [[Internet]].\n\n==Field of study==\nIn social science, mass communication is a sub-field of [[communication studies]]. Mass communication is \"the process by which a person, group of people, or organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience.\"<ref>Pearce 2009, p. 624</ref> This implies that the audience of mass communication are mostly made up of different cultures, behavior, and [[belief system]]s. Mass communication is commonly associated with [[media studies]]. \n\nIn the United States, the study of mass communication is often associated with the practical applications of [[journalism]], [[television broadcasting|television]] and [[radio broadcasting]], [[film]], [[public relations]], or [[advertising]]. With the diversification of media forms, the study of mass communication has extended to include [[social media]] and [[new media]], which have stronger [[feedback]] models than traditional media sources.\n\nThe [[history of communication]] stretches from prehistoric forms of art and writing through modern communication methods such as the [[Internet]]. Mass communication began when humans could transmit messages from a single source to multiple receivers. Mass communication has moved from theories such as the [[hypodermic needle model]] (or magic bullet theory) through more modern theories such as [[computer-mediated communication]].\n\n== Types of mass communication ==\n=== Advertising ===\n\n{{Main|Advertising}}\n\n'''Advertising''', in relation to mass communication, is [[marketing]] a product or service in a persuasive manner that encourages the audience to buy the product or use the service. &nbsp;Because advertising generally takes place through some form of [[mass media]], such as [[television]], studying the effects and methods of advertising is relevant to the study of mass communication. Advertising is the paid, impersonal, one-way marketing of persuasive information from a sponsor. Through mass communication channels, the sponsor promotes the adoption of products or ideas. Advertisers have full control of the message being sent to their audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|title=What is Advertising?|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Journalism ===\n\n{{Main|Journalism}}'''Journalism''', is the production and distribution of [[Report|reports]] on events for presentation through the media. &nbsp;The study of journalism involves analyzing the dissemination of information to the public through [[mass media|media outlets]] such as [[newspapers]], [[news channel]], [[radio station]], [[television station]], and more recently, [[e-readers]] and [[smartphones]].\n\n'''Alternative Journalism''' deviates from established or dominant types of media in terms of their content, production, or distribution. Alternative journalism utilizes the same media outlets as mainstream journalism, to advocate the \"interests of those excluded from the mainstream.\n\n'''Civic journalism''' (also known as public journalism) is the idea of integrating journalism into the democratic process. The media not only informs the public, but it also works towards engaging citizens and creating public debate.\n\n'''Citizen journalism''' is based upon public citizens actively producing news and information. Citizen journalism deals with the distribution of news by the public, often through the Internet.\n\n=== Public relations ===\n\n{{Main|Public relations}}'''Public relations''' is the process of providing information to the public in order to present a specific view of a product or [[organization]]. &nbsp;Public relations differs from advertising in that it is less obtrusive, and aimed at providing a more comprehensive opinion to a large audience in order to shape [[public opinion]]. Unlike advertising, public relations professionals only have control until the message is related to media gatekeepers who decide where to pass the information on to the audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|title=What is Advertising?|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Social media &nbsp;===\n\n{{Main|Social media}}\n\n'''Social media''', in its modern use, refers to platforms used on both mobile devices and home computers that allow users to interact through the use of words, images, sounds, and video.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social media includes popular sites such as Facebook and Instagram, as well as sites that can aid in business networking such as LinkedIn.The use and importance of social media in communications and public relations has grown drastically throughout the years and is now a staple in advertisements to mass audiences.

Most commonly, a catfish communicates with another online profile to get them to fall in love with the false persona they created. The MTV reality show [[Catfish: The TV Show]] has brought mainstream attention to this issue.<ref name=\":0\" /> The goal of these episodes is to keep track of people who have fallen in love with someone they interacted with online, but never met in person.

His failure to patent it resulted in two brothers, Louis and Auguste Lumiere creating a portable camera that could process film and project images.<ref name=\":0\" /> The invention quickly gained notoriety when the Lumiere brothers debuted a series of 60 second clips screened outdoors to a Parisian audience. Despite the ever-growing popularity of moving images, the Lumiere Brothers did not seek to revolutionize the style of film, but stuck to documenting daily life in France. This set the grounds for future film revolutionaries, including George Melies, who sought to create narrative sequences in his films through the use of special effects.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Television ====\n\n{{Main|Television}}\n\nIn the 1970s, television began to change to include more complicated and three-dimensional characters and plots. [[PBS]] launched in 1970, and was the home for programming that would not be suitable for network television. It operates on donations and little government funding, rather than having commercials. On January 12, 1971, the sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'' premiered on [[CBS]], and covered the issues of the day and portrayed a bigot named [[Archie Bunker]].<ref name=\":0\" /> By 1972, the sales of color television sets surpassed that of black-and-white sets.

In 1839, [[Louis Daguerre]] introduced the daguerreotype that reduced exposure time to about thirty minutes. As the years progressed so did photography techniques, including creating better image quality, adding color to an imagine and reduced exposure time.\n\n==== Contemporary photography industry====\n\nThe modern industry has dramatically changed with the development of digital, as phones and digital cameras have made film-based cameras a niche product. Kodak discounted making color film in 1999 and declared Bankruptcy in 2012.

A video game genre is defined by a set of game play challenges and are classified independently of when and where the game takes place.\n\n==== Ethics in interactive media ====\n\nInteractive Media is a form of communication technique that refers to services on digital computer-based systems. This requires two or more parties who respond to each other through text, moving images, animation, video, audio, and video games.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Converging Media; A New Introduction to Mass Communication|last=Pavlik|first=John;|year=2017|isbn=|location=New York: Oxford University Press|pages=185}}</ref> The ethics in interactive media mainly focus on the violence of video games, advertising being influenced in different ways and [[behavioral targeting]].\n\nThe violence of video games relates to ethics in interactive media because it brings on aggressive attitude and behavior that impacts the social lives of the people playing these video games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=31654390-234a-4f36-9a4b-4b784bd45139%40pdc-v-sessmgr05&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=132015122&db=a9h|title=Violent Video Games, Externalizing Behavior, and Prosocial Behavior: A Five-Year Longitudinal Study During Adolescence.|last=Coyne|first=Sarah M|website=EBSCO}}</ref> Furthermore, behavioral targeting ties into the ethics of interactive media because these websites and apps on our phones contain our personal information which allow the owners or the ones running the companies to receive it and use them for themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=63353de8-598d-4bf0-9cd0-f6117d0a4e5c%40sdc-v-sessmgr04&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&AN=114334448|title=Protecting Personal Information: Achieving a Balance Between User Privacy and Behavioral Targeting|last=Myers|first=Patrick|website=EBSCO}}</ref> Interactive media influences advertising because by society using social media or any websites, we are able to see that there's advertising in everything we view especially when your scrolling through Instagram or those pop up ads that come up on your screen reading an article on your computer.\n\n=== EBooks ===\n\n{{main|E-book}}\n\neBooks have changed how people read.

In addition, the Kindle has added accessories including games, movies, and music.\n\n==Major theories==\nCommunication researchers have identified several major theories associated with the study of mass communication. [[Communication theory]] addresses the processes and mechanisms that allow communication to take place.\n\n*[[Cultivation theory]], developed by [[George Gerbner]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]], discusses the long-term effects of watching television, and hypothesizes that the more television an individual consumes, the more likely that person is to believe the real world is similar to what they have seen on television.<ref>Gerbner, G., Gross, L., Morgan, M., & Signorielli, N. (1986). \"Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process\" in J. Bryant & D. Zillman (Eds.), Perspectives on media effects (pp. 17\u201340) Hilldale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates</ref> Cultivation is closely related to the idea of the [[mean world syndrome]].\n*[[Agenda setting theory]] centers around the idea that media outlets tell the public \"not what to think, but what to think about.\" Agenda setting hypothesizes that media have the power to influence the public discourse, and tell people what are important issues facing society.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E.; Donald L. Shaw (1972). \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media\". Public Opinion Quarterly 36 (2): 176</ref>\n*[[The spiral of silence]], developed by [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], hypothesizes that people are more likely to reveal their opinion in public if they believe that they are of the [[majority opinion]], for fear that revealing an unpopular opinion would subject them to being a social outcast. This theory is relevant to mass communication because it hypothesizes that mass media have the power to shape people's opinions, as well as relay the opinion that is believed to be the majority opinion.<ref>Noelle-Neumann, E. (1974). The spiral of silence: a theory of public opinion. Journal of Communication, 24, 43-51</ref>\n*[[Media ecology]] hypothesizes that individuals are shaped by their interaction with media,<ref>Postman, Neil. \"The Humanism of Media Ecology\". Retrieved 9 November 2012</ref> and that communication and media profoundly affect how individuals view and interact with their environment.<ref>McLuhan, M.; Fiore Q.; Agel J. (1996).

San Francisco: HardWired. {{ISBN|978-1-888869-02-6}}</ref>\n*According to the [[Semiotic]] theory, communication characteristics such as words, images, gestures, and situations are always interpretive. All sign systems, entitled to be \u201cread\u201d or interpreted, regardless of form, may be referred to as \u201ctexts.\u201d In the study of Semiotics, there is no such thing as a literal reading.<ref>Encyclopedia of Curriculum Studies</ref>\n\n==Methods of study==\n\nCommunication researchers study communication through various methods that have been verified through repetitive, cumulative processes. Both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods have been used in the study of mass communication. The main focus of mass communication research is to learn how the content of mass communication affects the attitudes, opinions, emotions, and ultimately behaviors of the people who receive the message. Several prominent methods of study are as follows:<ref>Babbie, E. (2007). The practice of social research. Thomas Higher Education: Belmont, California. {{ISBN|0-495-09325-4}}</ref>\n\n*Studying cause and effect relationships in communication can only be done through an experiment. This quantitative method regularly involves exposing participants to various media content and recording their reactions. To show causation, mass communication researchers must isolate the variable they are studying, show that it occurs before the observed effect, and that it is the only variable that could cause the observed effect.\n*[[Survey methodology|Survey]], another quantitative method, involves asking individuals to respond to a set of questions in order to generalize their responses to a larger population.\n*[[Content analysis]] (sometimes known as textual analysis) refers to the process of identifying categorial properties of a piece of communication, such as a newspaper [[article (publishing)|article]], book, television program, film, or broadcast news script. This process allows researchers to see what the content of communication looks like.\n*A qualitative method known as [[ethnography]] allows a researcher to immerse themselves into a culture to observe and record the qualities of communication that exist there.\n\n==Professional organizations==\n\nThe [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aejmc.org|title=AEJMC|website=AEJMC}}</ref> is the major membership organization for academics in the field, offering regional and '''national conferences and refereed publications'''. The [[International Communication Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icahdq.org/|title=International Communication Association|website=www.icahdq.org}}</ref> and [[National Communication Association]] (formerly the Speech Communication Association) are also prominent professional organizations. Each of these organizations publishes a different refereed academic journal that reflects the research that is being performed in the field of mass communication.\n\n[https://pradeeplearning.blogspot.com/2020/04/unit-2-models-of-mass-communication.html Model of mass communication]==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[Communication]]\n* [[Communication studies]]\n* [[Communication theory as a field]]\n* [[History of communication]]\n* [[Media influence]]\n* [[Media studies]]\n* [[Social science]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* Pearce, K.J.

It is usually understood for relating to various forms of media, as these technologies are used for the dissemination of information, of which [[journalism]] and [[advertising]] are part of. Mass communication differs from other forms of communication, such as [[interpersonal communication]] and [[organizational communication]], because it focuses on particular resources transmitting information to numerous receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the [[behavior]], the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[opinion]], or [[emotion]] of the people receiving the information.\n\nNormally, transmission of messages to many persons at a time is called mass communication. But in a complete sense, mass communication can be understood as the process of extensive circulation of information within regions and across the globe.\n\nThrough mass communication, information can be transmitted quickly to many people who generally stay far away from the sources of information.

Most commonly, a catfish communicates with another online profile to get them to fall in love with the false persona they created. The MTV reality show [[Catfish: The TV Show]] has brought mainstream attention to this issue.<ref name=\":0\" /> The goal of these episodes is to keep track of people who have fallen in love with someone they interacted with online, but never met in person. As catfishing has become a mainstream term, people have wondered how and why it continues to happen. [[Nev Schulman]], host of the show, has said \"I think people will always be looking to fall in love. People will always hope for things to get better. For better, or worse, there will always be people who may or may not look to take advantage of that.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Lily|date=July 1, 2013|title=The Catfish Came Back|url=|journal=Time|volume=182|pages=59|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref>\n\n=== Audio media ===\n==== Recorded music ====\n\nRecordings, developed in the 1870s, became the first non-print form of mass communication. &nbsp;The invention of the [[phonograph]] by [[Thomas Edison]] in the late 19th century, the [[graphophone]] by Alexander Graham Bell and Charles Tainter, and the gramophone by The [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] were the first competing mass media forms that brought recorded music to the masses.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recording changed again in the 1950s with the invention of the LP (long play) vinyl record, then eight track-tapes, followed by vinyl, and cassettes in 1965.

His failure to patent it resulted in two brothers, Louis and Auguste Lumiere creating a portable camera that could process film and project images.<ref name=\":0\" /> The invention quickly gained notoriety when the Lumiere brothers debuted a series of 60 second clips screened outdoors to a Parisian audience. Despite the ever-growing popularity of moving images, the Lumiere Brothers did not seek to revolutionize the style of film, but stuck to documenting daily life in France. This set the grounds for future film revolutionaries, including George Melies, who sought to create narrative sequences in his films through the use of special effects.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Television ====\n\n{{Main|Television}}\n\nIn the 1970s, television began to change to include more complicated and three-dimensional characters and plots. [[PBS]] launched in 1970, and was the home for programming that would not be suitable for network television. It operates on donations and little government funding, rather than having commercials. On January 12, 1971, the sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'' premiered on [[CBS]], and covered the issues of the day and portrayed a bigot named [[Archie Bunker]].<ref name=\":0\" /> By 1972, the sales of color television sets surpassed that of black-and-white sets.

In 1839, [[Louis Daguerre]] introduced the daguerreotype that reduced exposure time to about thirty minutes. As the years progressed so did photography techniques, including creating better image quality, adding color to an imagine and reduced exposure time.\n\n==== Contemporary photography industry====\n\nThe modern industry has dramatically changed with the development of digital, as phones and digital cameras have made film-based cameras a niche product. Kodak discounted making color film in 1999 and declared Bankruptcy in 2012. Other companies like Fujifilm adapted despite a downturn in sales.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Interactive media ===\n==== Video games ====\n\n{{main|List of video game genres}}\n\nVideo game genres are a classification assigned to a video game based on its game play rather than a visual or storytelling differences.

In addition, the Kindle has added accessories including games, movies, and music.\n\n==Major theories==\nCommunication researchers have identified several major theories associated with the study of mass communication. [[Communication theory]] addresses the processes and mechanisms that allow communication to take place.\n\n*[[Cultivation theory]], developed by [[George Gerbner]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]], discusses the long-term effects of watching television, and hypothesizes that the more television an individual consumes, the more likely that person is to believe the real world is similar to what they have seen on television.<ref>Gerbner, G., Gross, L., Morgan, M., & Signorielli, N. (1986). \"Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process\" in J. Bryant & D. Zillman (Eds.), Perspectives on media effects (pp. 17\u201340) Hilldale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates</ref> Cultivation is closely related to the idea of the [[mean world syndrome]].\n*[[Agenda setting theory]] centers around the idea that media outlets tell the public \"not what to think, but what to think about.\" Agenda setting hypothesizes that media have the power to influence the public discourse, and tell people what are important issues facing society.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E.; Donald L. Shaw (1972). \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media\". Public Opinion Quarterly 36 (2): 176</ref>\n*[[The spiral of silence]], developed by [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], hypothesizes that people are more likely to reveal their opinion in public if they believe that they are of the [[majority opinion]], for fear that revealing an unpopular opinion would subject them to being a social outcast. This theory is relevant to mass communication because it hypothesizes that mass media have the power to shape people's opinions, as well as relay the opinion that is believed to be the majority opinion.<ref>Noelle-Neumann, E. (1974). The spiral of silence: a theory of public opinion. Journal of Communication, 24, 43-51</ref>\n*[[Media ecology]] hypothesizes that individuals are shaped by their interaction with media,<ref>Postman, Neil. \"The Humanism of Media Ecology\". Retrieved 9 November 2012</ref> and that communication and media profoundly affect how individuals view and interact with their environment.<ref>McLuhan, M.; Fiore Q.; Agel J. (1996). The medium is the massage: an inventory of effects. San Francisco: HardWired. {{ISBN|978-1-888869-02-6}}</ref>\n*According to the [[Semiotic]] theory, communication characteristics such as words, images, gestures, and situations are always interpretive. All sign systems, entitled to be \u201cread\u201d or interpreted, regardless of form, may be referred to as \u201ctexts.\u201d In the study of Semiotics, there is no such thing as a literal reading.<ref>Encyclopedia of Curriculum Studies</ref>\n\n==Methods of study==\n\nCommunication researchers study communication through various methods that have been verified through repetitive, cumulative processes. Both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods have been used in the study of mass communication. The main focus of mass communication research is to learn how the content of mass communication affects the attitudes, opinions, emotions, and ultimately behaviors of the people who receive the message. Several prominent methods of study are as follows:<ref>Babbie, E. (2007). The practice of social research. Thomas Higher Education: Belmont, California. {{ISBN|0-495-09325-4}}</ref>\n\n*Studying cause and effect relationships in communication can only be done through an experiment. This quantitative method regularly involves exposing participants to various media content and recording their reactions. To show causation, mass communication researchers must isolate the variable they are studying, show that it occurs before the observed effect, and that it is the only variable that could cause the observed effect.\n*[[Survey methodology|Survey]], another quantitative method, involves asking individuals to respond to a set of questions in order to generalize their responses to a larger population.\n*[[Content analysis]] (sometimes known as textual analysis) refers to the process of identifying categorial properties of a piece of communication, such as a newspaper [[article (publishing)|article]], book, television program, film, or broadcast news script. This process allows researchers to see what the content of communication looks like.\n*A qualitative method known as [[ethnography]] allows a researcher to immerse themselves into a culture to observe and record the qualities of communication that exist there.\n\n==Professional organizations==\n\nThe [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aejmc.org|title=AEJMC|website=AEJMC}}</ref> is the major membership organization for academics in the field, offering regional and '''national conferences and refereed publications'''. The [[International Communication Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icahdq.org/|title=International Communication Association|website=www.icahdq.org}}</ref> and [[National Communication Association]] (formerly the Speech Communication Association) are also prominent professional organizations. Each of these organizations publishes a different refereed academic journal that reflects the research that is being performed in the field of mass communication.\n\n==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[Communication]]\n* [[Communication studies]]\n* [[Communication theory as a field]]\n* [[History of communication]]\n* [[Media influence]]\n* [[Media studies]]\n* [[Social science]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* Pearce, K.J.

Over 19 songs were written, split between an \"A-list\" with songs considered possible hits, such as \"[[Love in an Elevator]]\" and \"[[What It Takes (Aerosmith song)|What It Takes]]\", and the \"B list\" having songs yet to be developed such as \"Voodoo Medicine Man\".

The album was the fourth bestselling album of the year 1990.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1990/the-billboard-200 Billboard.com - Year End Charts - Year-end Albums - The Billboard 200<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the UK, it was the second Aerosmith album to be certified Silver (60,000 units sold) by the [[British Phonographic Industry]], achieving this in September 1989.\n\n''Pump'' was the second of three sequentially recorded Aerosmith albums to feature producer [[Bruce Fairbairn]] and engineers Mike Fraser and Ken Lomas at [[Little Mountain Sound Studios]].\n\nA video documentary on the recording, ''[[The Making of Pump]]'', was released in 1990.\n\n==Production==\nIn December 1988, Aerosmith got together at Rik Tinory Productions in [[Cohasset, Massachusetts]] to rehearse and compose new songs, as the band members thought the isolated nature of the studio would help their creativity. Over 19 songs were written, split between an \"A-list\" with songs considered possible hits, such as \"[[Love in an Elevator]]\" and \"[[What It Takes (Aerosmith song)|What It Takes]]\", and the \"B list\" having songs yet to be developed such as \"Voodoo Medicine Man\". Producer [[Bruce Fairbairn]] focused on getting as many [[Hook (music)|hooks]] on the songs as possible.<ref name=making>{{cite video|title=\n[[The Making of Pump]]|date=1990|publisher=Sony Music}}</ref>\n\nSome songs proposed for the album, though never released, include \"Girl's Got Somethin'\", \"Is Anybody Out There\", \"Guilty Kilt\", \"Rubber Bandit\", \"Sniffin'\", and \"Sedona Sunrise\". Many songs also had alternate titles, for example, \"Voodoo Medicine Man\" was originally titled \"Buried Alive\" and \"News For Ya Baby\". The majority of these songs can be seen in photos of the studio's whiteboard and in footage from \"The Making Of Pump\".\n\nIn January 1989, the band went to [[Vancouver]] to again record at Fairbairn's Little Mountain Sound, where the producer had helmed [[Bon Jovi]]'s ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' and ''[[New Jersey (album)|New Jersey]]''. \"I don't even listen to Bon Jovi,\" [[Steven Tyler]] protested, \"so we didn't say, 'Oh, shit, they had a great album,' and go up there.\"<ref>''[[Rolling Stone]]'' 1989 retrospective, precise date unknown</ref>\n\nThe intention with the album was exploring a rawness that had been glossed over for a commercial sound in ''[[Permanent Vacation (album)|Permanent Vacation]]''.<ref name=Bienstock>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X2Opr3N1X4YC&pg=PA140 Aerosmith: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Boston Bad Boys]</ref> [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] declared that \"When we went to do this album, we knew what we wanted, we wanted to strip off a little fat we felt on our last one.

In [[Belfast]] during the second match, despite a close contest and five goals, Wales managed to beat the Irish 3\u20132 and join England at the top of the table. Wales then beat Scotland in a surprise result, winning 1\u20130 in [[Wrexham]] by a goal from veteran [[Grenville Morris]] to become tournament favourites. Scotland recovered in their second game with a three-goal rout of Ireland, finishing a miserable tournament for the Irish. Wales and England then played, the Welsh needing a win to take the competition undisputed whilst a draw would leave them waiting for the result of the England versus Scotland game.

For the first time ever it was won undisputed by the [[Wales national football team|Welsh]] team, who secured two victories and a draw to take them to the top of the table. They were followed by [[England national football team|England]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], who both played well but could not overhaul the Welsh points advantage. All three teams beat [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]], who finished without a point.\n\nAs usual, England and Ireland began the tournament, England winning a close game by a single goal from [[Harold Hardman]]. In [[Belfast]] during the second match, despite a close contest and five goals, Wales managed to beat the Irish 3\u20132 and join England at the top of the table. Wales then beat Scotland in a surprise result, winning 1\u20130 in [[Wrexham]] by a goal from veteran [[Grenville Morris]] to become tournament favourites. Scotland recovered in their second game with a three-goal rout of Ireland, finishing a miserable tournament for the Irish. Wales and England then played, the Welsh needing a win to take the competition undisputed whilst a draw would leave them waiting for the result of the England versus Scotland game. In the venet the match finished 1\u20131 and England played Scotland in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] needing a win to draw level with Wales. In the event, Scotland proved too good and the game finished with a 2\u20132 draw, handing the trophy to Wales for the first time.\n\n==Table==\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|show_positions=n\n|winpoints=2\n\n|team1=WAL|name_WAL={{fb|WAL|1807}}\n|team2=ENG|name_ENG={{fb|ENG}}\n|team3=SCO|name_SCO={{fb|SCO}}\n|team4=IRE|name_IRE={{fb|IRE}}\n|win_WAL=2|draw_WAL=1|loss_WAL=0|gf_WAL=5|ga_WAL=3|status_WAL=C\n|win_ENG=1|draw_ENG=2|loss_ENG=0|gf_ENG=3|ga_ENG=2\n|win_SCO=1|draw_SCO=1|loss_SCO=1|gf_SCO=4|ga_SCO=2\n|win_IRE=0|draw_IRE=0|loss_IRE=3|gf_IRE=2|ga_IRE=7\n\n|col_C=#ccffcc|text_C=\n|result1=C\n|update=complete|source=<ref name=\"EUF\">{{cite web |title=British Championship 1907 |url=https://eu-football.info/_tournament.php?id=BC-24 |website=EU-Football.Info |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n|class_rules = 1) points.

It is operated by [[S\u00fcdostbahn]] (SOB) and runs every hour between [[St. Gallen]] and [[Lucerne]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first through trains from [[Romanshorn]] to [[Arth-Goldau]] started in 1940 after the electrification of the S\u00fcdostbahn line between [[Rapperswil]] and Arth-Goldau. Romanshorn\u2013Rapperswil had been under wires since 1926/31. The trains were jointly operated by [[Bodensee\u2013Toggenburg railway|Bodensee\u2013Toggenburg-Bahn]] (BT), [[S\u00fcdostbahn]] (SOB) and the [[Swiss Federal Railways]] (SBB). 1944 BT added buffet cars to the trainsets. 1947 some trains continued from Arth-Goldau to Lucerne. In 1960 operation was changed to push-pull operation with very powerful motor coaches. The trainsets were now painted in green an cream. 1982 brought the [[Clock-face scheduling|clock-face timetable]] with a train Romanshorn\u2013Lucerne every two hours but also the end for buffet cars. In 1991 BT and SOB bought EW IV inter-city coaches to replace the push-pull sets. 1995 unnamed trains every two hours were added between Romanshorn and Arth-Goldau, again with push-pull sets. After Revvivo-coaches had been used for these trains from 1997 on, it was decided to sell the EW IV to SBB and buy more Revvivos to allow an hourly push-pull trainset between Romanshorn and Lucerne. 2001 BT and SOB merged into the new SOB, which reduced the number of participating companies to two. VAE ran as an [[InterRegio]] (IR) [[express train]] until 2013.\n\nOn 15 December 2013 the concept changed and SOB became the sole operator. VAE became a distinct train category but the train was limited to St. Gallen\u2013Lucerne. To cope with the increasing number of passengers, trains now generally have seven coaches, which means that two locomotives or motor coaches are needed. This is due to the 50\u2030 (1:20) grades between Pf\u00e4ffikon SZ and Arth-Goldau. Motive power is at each end, allowing a push-pull service without driving trailers.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBesides creating a tangential link on the southern edge of the greater [[Zurich]] area, it is popular for the pre-alpine scenery.  The most important stations with connecting trains and regular boat lines on the lakes are:\n\n* '''Lucerne''': [[GoldenPass Line]], [[Lake Lucerne]] (Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee), [[Pilatus (mountain)|Pilatus mountain]]\n* '''[[Arth-Goldau]]''': trains through the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel]] to [[Ticino]] and [[Italy]]; cog-wheel train to [[Rigi]] mountain\n* '''[[Biberbrugg]]''': to [[Einsiedeln]]\n* '''[[Pf\u00e4ffikon, Schwyz|Pf\u00e4ffikon]]''': line to [[Chur]] ([[Grisons]]), [[Lake Zurich]]\n* '''[[Rapperswil]]''': \"rose town\", [[Lake Zurich]] crossing the [[Seedamm]]\n* '''[[Wattwil]]''': [[Churfirsten]] and [[Toggenburg]]\n* '''[[Herisau]]''': [[Appenzell]] (narrow gauge network of [[Appenzeller Bahnen]])\n* '''St. Gallen''': UNESCO World Heritage abbey library, trains to [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]\n\n== Rolling stock ==\n\nFourteen locomotives and motor coaches form seven pairs of motive power for the Voralpen-Express:\n* 4 Locomotives Re 446: 91 85 4 446 015\u2013018 (as pairs)\n* 6 Locomotives Re 456: 91 85 4 456 091\u2013096 (as pairs)\n* 4 NPZ motor coaches RBDe 561: 94 85 7 561 081\u2013084 (as pairs)\nThe different types cannot be combined. If less than five pairs are available, SOB leases a Re 4/4 II from SBBC (in February 2014 it was Re 421 393) which can be used together with an Re 446.\n\nFive trainsets are needed for the daily operation and a sixth set is in Herisau as a reserve. It allows to exchange the sets in order to clean and maintain them. The six sets are formed from two locomotives with seven coaches:\n* Re\u2013ABt\u2013B\u2013B\u2013BR\u2013A\u2013B\u2013B\u2013Re (4 sets)\nor with two motor coaches and six coaches:\n* RBDe\u2013A\u2013B\u2013B\u2013BR\u2013A\u2013B\u2013RBDe (2 sets)\nThe seventh pair of locomotives is an additional reserve. Thus, if one motor coach RBDe needs maintenance, an additional set with locomotives will be formed.\n\n31 air-conditioned Revvivo coaches, 1997/99 rebuilt from Einheitswagen I coaches, are the backbone of the VAE coaching stock. Ten quite recent NPZ vehicles (1991/95) were added to the stock to allow for enough capacity.

If less than five pairs are available, SOB leases a Re 4/4 II from SBBC (in February 2014 it was Re 421 393) which can be used together with an Re 446.\n\nFive trainsets are needed for the daily operation and a sixth set is in Herisau as a reserve. It allows to exchange the sets in order to clean and maintain them. The six sets are formed from two locomotives with seven coaches:\n* Re\u2013ABt\u2013B\u2013B\u2013BR\u2013A\u2013B\u2013B\u2013Re (4 sets)\nor with two motor coaches and six coaches:\n* RBDe\u2013A\u2013B\u2013B\u2013BR\u2013A\u2013B\u2013RBDe (2 sets)\nThe seventh pair of locomotives is an additional reserve. Thus, if one motor coach RBDe needs maintenance, an additional set with locomotives will be formed.\n\n31 air-conditioned Revvivo coaches, 1997/99 rebuilt from Einheitswagen I coaches, are the backbone of the VAE coaching stock. Ten quite recent NPZ vehicles (1991/95) were added to the stock to allow for enough capacity. Four older coaches are kept as a reserve but the Revvivo prototype of 1995 (BR 748) has been withdrawn.\n\n* 8 Revvivo-A 50 85 18-35 711\u2013718\n* 1 A Bodan 50 85 17-35 719 (ex SBB B 6000 - BT B 350; rebuilt 1991, reserve)\n* 16 Revvivo-B 50 85 20-35 721\u2013736 (735\u2013736 with Schlieren bogies)\n* 7 Revvivo-BR 50 85 20-35 741\u2013747 (741\u2013744 ex BT AB 251\u2013254) (1 reserve)\n* 6 NPZ-B (1991) 50 85 29-35 781\u2013786 (as pairs)\n* 4 NPZ-ABt (1995) 50 85 80-35 181\u2013184 (as intermediate trailer)\n* 3 B EW I ex BT (1967-68) 50 85 20-35 753, 754, 767 (reserve)\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat-inline|Voralpen-Express}}\n*[http://www.voralpen-express.ch/ Voralpen Express website]\n*[http://www.swisstravelsystem.ch/Voralpen_Express.24.0.html?&L=2 Swiss Travel System]\n\n[[Category:Named passenger trains of Switzerland]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voralpen_Express"}

Valley railway to the north of the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] at [[Fritzens]]. Work on the [[New Lower Inn Valley Railway]] is under way next to the line.]]\nThe '''Lower Inn Valley Railway''' ({{lang-de|Unterinntalbahn}}) is a two-track, electrified railway line that is one of the major lines of the [[Rail transport in Austria|Austrian railways]]. It was originally opened as the ''[[Imperial and Royal|k.k.]] Nordtiroler Staatsbahn'' (Imperial and Royal North Tyrolean State Railway). It begins at the German border near the Austrian city of [[Kufstein]] as a continuation of the [[Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein railway|Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein line]] and runs in a generally south-westerly direction through Tyrol along the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] valley to [[Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof|Innsbruck]]. The line is part of the [[Berlin\u2013Palermo railway axis|Line 1]] of [[Trans-European Transport Networks]] (TEN-T). The line is owned and operated by [[Austrian Federal Railways]] (\u00d6BB).\n\n==History==\n\nThe line was the first railway in western Austria, opened on 24 November 1858. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria had ordered its construction in 1853.\n\n==New line==\n[[File:Unterinntalbahn, Galerie Terfens, Rohbau.jpg|thumb|left|Concrete shell for the [[New Lower Inn Valley railway]]]]\n{{main|New Lower Inn Valley railway}}\nIn order to increase the capacity of the track and in preparation for the construction of the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]] a new high-capacity line has been built between [[Kundl]]1 junction and [[Fritzen]]-[[Wattens]] 1 junction (at Baumkirchen). It was opened on 9 December 2012 for scheduled traffic. The great majority of this line has been built in tunnel in order not to increase noise pollution in the Inn valley. The new route is designed for mixed traffic up to 250&nbsp;km/h (160 mph) and is fitted with [[European Train Control System|ETCS]] Level 2 signalling system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Newsletter |

Valley railway to the north of the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] at [[Fritzens]]. Work on the [[New Lower Inn Valley Railway]] is under way next to the line.]]\nThe '''Lower Inn Valley Railway''' ({{lang-de|Unterinntalbahn}}) is a two-track, electrified railway line that is one of the major lines of the [[Rail transport in Austria|Austrian railways]]. It was originally opened as the ''[[Imperial and Royal|k.k.]] Nordtiroler Staatsbahn'' (Imperial and Royal North Tyrolean State Railway). It begins at the German border near the Austrian city of [[Kufstein]] as a continuation of the [[Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein railway|Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein line]] and runs in a generally south-westerly direction through Tyrol along the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] valley to [[Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof|Innsbruck]]. The line is part of the [[Berlin\u2013Palermo railway axis|Line 1]] of [[Trans-European Transport Networks]] (TEN-T). The line is owned and operated by [[Austrian Federal Railways]] (\u00d6BB).\n\n==History==\n\nThe line was the first railway in western Austria, opened on 24 November 1858. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria had ordered its construction in 1853.\n\n==New line==\n[[File:Unterinntalbahn, Galerie Terfens, Rohbau.jpg|thumb|left|Concrete shell for the [[New Lower Inn Valley railway]]]]\n{{main|New Lower Inn Valley railway}}\nIn order to increase the capacity of the track and in preparation for the construction of the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]] a new high-capacity line has been built between [[Kundl]]1 junction and [[Fritzen]]-[[Wattens]] 1 junction (at Baumkirchen). It was opened on 9 December 2012 for scheduled traffic. The great majority of this line has been built in tunnel in order not to increase noise pollution in the Inn valley. The new route is designed for mixed traffic up to 250&nbsp;km/h (160 mph) and is fitted with [[European Train Control System|ETCS]] Level 2 signalling system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Newsletter | publisher=Brenner Eisenbahn GmbH  |language=German |url= http://www.beg.co.at/fileadmin/newsletter/2008/NEWSLETTER_11-12_08.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=11 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Die Neue Unterinntalbahn (the new Lower Inn railway) |publisher=Brenner Eisenbahn GmbH |language=German |url=http://www.beg.co.at/fileadmin/downloads/Beg_AMA.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927173104/http://www.beg.co.at/fileadmin/downloads/Beg_AMA.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2013 }}</ref> An extension of the new line from Kundl/Radfeld to [[Brannenburg]] is in the planning phase.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Berlin\u2013Palermo railway axis}}\n\n{{coord|47.2633|N|11.4010|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Railway lines in Austria]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1858]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Tyrol (state)]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Inn_Valley_Railway"}

In the ballad, Hua Mulan, disguised as a man, takes her aged father's place in the army. Mulan fought for twelve years and gained high merit, but she refused any reward and retired to her hometown. \n\nThe historic setting of ''Ballad of Mulan'' is in the [[Northern Wei]]. Over a thousand years later, [[Xu Wei]]'s play from the [[Ming dynasty]] places her in the Northern Wei, whereas the [[Qing dynasty]] ''Sui Tang Romance'' has her active around the founding of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] c. 620. In 621, the founder of the Tang dynasty emerged victorious over [[Wang Shichong]] and [[Dou Jiande]]. The latter sired Dou Xianniang, another female warrior who became Mulan's [[laotong]] in the ''Sui Tang Romance''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kwa|Idema|2010|p=12n}}</ref>\n\nThe Hua Mulan crater on [[Venus]] is named after her.<ref>{{Cite journal | authors = Russell, Joel F., Schaber, Gerald G. | title = Named Venusian craters | journal = In Lunar and Planetary Inst., Twenty-Fourth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference | date = March 1993 | bibcode = 1993LPI....24.1219R}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/vc/vcinfo/?refnum=269|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute of the [[Universities Space Research Association]]|title=Venus Crater Database|accessdate=2011-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mulan, 18th century, ink and colors on silk.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Hua Mulan, 18th century, housed in the British Museum]]\nThe ''Ballad of Mulan'' was first transcribed in the ''Musical Records of Old and New'' ({{zh|c=\u53e4\u4eca\u6a02\u9304|p=G\u01d4j\u012bn Yu\u00e8l\u00f9}}) in the 6th century. The earliest extant text of the poem comes from an 11th- or 12th-century anthology known as the ''[[Music Bureau]] Collection'' ({{zh|c=\u6a02\u5e9c\u8a69|p=Yu\u00e8f\u01d4sh\u012b}}). Its author, [[Guo Maoqian]], explicitly mentions the ''Musical Records of Old and New'' as his source for the poem. As a [[ballad]], the lines do not necessarily have equal numbers of syllables. The poem consists of 31 [[couplet]]s, and is mostly composed of five-character phrases, with a few extending to seven or nine.\n\nIn the late [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], playwright [[Xu Wei]] (d. 1593) dramatized the tale as \"The Female Mulan\" ({{lang|zh|\u96cc\u6728\u862d|p=C\u00ed-M\u00f9l\u00e1n}} or, more fully, \"The Heroine Mulan Goes to War in Her Father's Place\" ({{zh|c=\u96cc\u6728\u862d\u66ff\u7236\u5f9e\u8ecd|p=C\u00ed-M\u00f9l\u00e1n T\u00ec F\u00f9 C\u00f3ngj\u016bn}}), in two acts.\n\nLater, the character of Mulan was incorporated into the ''{{ill2|Sui-Tang Romance|zh|\u968b\u5510\u6f14\u7fa9}}'', a historical novel written by {{ill2|Chu Renhuo|zh|\u891a\u4eba\u7372}} in the 17th century, early in the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref name=\"Mulan5-SuiTang\">{{Harvnb|Kwa|Idema|2010|pp=xx\u2013xxi, 119\u2013120}}</ref><ref name=\"huang-SuiTang\">{{Harvnb|Huang|2006|pp=120,124\u20135}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the story of Hua Mulan rose in popularity as a folk tale among the Chinese people on the same level as the [[Butterfly Lovers]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Name===\nIn Chinese, ''m\u00f9l\u00e1n'' refers to the [[Magnolia liliiflora|magnolia]].

The poem starts with Mulan sitting worriedly at her loom, as one male from each family is called to serve in the army to defend the [[Tuoba]] realm from [[Rouran]] invaders. Her father is old and weak, and her younger brother is just a child, so she decides to take his place and bids farewell to her parents, who support her. She is already skilled in fighting, having been taught martial arts, sword fighting, and archery by the time she enlists in the army. After twelve years of fighting, the army returns and the warriors are rewarded. Mulan turns down an official post, and asks only for a camel to carry her home. She is greeted with joy by her family.

Its author, [[Guo Maoqian]], explicitly mentions the ''Musical Records of Old and New'' as his source for the poem. As a [[ballad]], the lines do not necessarily have equal numbers of syllables. The poem consists of 31 [[couplet]]s, and is mostly composed of five-character phrases, with a few extending to seven or nine.\n\nIn the late [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], playwright [[Xu Wei]] (d. 1593) dramatized the tale as \"The Female Mulan\" ({{lang|zh|\u96cc\u6728\u862d|p=C\u00ed-M\u00f9l\u00e1n}} or, more fully, \"The Heroine Mulan Goes to War in Her Father's Place\" ({{zh|c=\u96cc\u6728\u862d\u66ff\u7236\u5f9e\u8ecd|p=C\u00ed-M\u00f9l\u00e1n T\u00ec F\u00f9 C\u00f3ngj\u016bn}}), in two acts.\n\nLater, the character of Mulan was incorporated into the ''{{ill2|Sui-Tang Romance|zh|\u968b\u5510\u6f14\u7fa9}}'', a historical novel written by {{ill2|Chu Renhuo|zh|\u891a\u4eba\u7372}} in the 17th century, early in the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref name=\"Mulan5-SuiTang\">{{Harvnb|Kwa|Idema|2010|pp=xx\u2013xxi, 119\u2013120}}</ref><ref name=\"huang-SuiTang\">{{Harvnb|Huang|2006|pp=120,124\u20135}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the story of Hua Mulan rose in popularity as a folk tale among the Chinese people on the same level as the [[Butterfly Lovers]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Name===\nIn Chinese, ''m\u00f9l\u00e1n'' refers to the [[Magnolia liliiflora|magnolia]].

{"title_page": "Barnim Plateau", "text_new": "The '''Barnim Plateau''' is a [[plateau]] which is occupied by the northeastern parts of [[Berlin]] and the surrounding federal state of [[Brandenburg]] in [[Germany]]. [[File:Retsee Hoenow2.JPG|thumb|right|A lake known as '''Retsee''' which is located on the plateau.]]\n[[File:2018 04 Schwaerzesee IMG 1098.JPG|thumb|Lake Schw\u00e4rzesee near Eberswalde, Barnim, Brandenburg]]\n==Boundaries and Subdivision==\n\n===Boundaries===\n\nThe limits of the plateau are easily definable. The southern boundary is marked by the Berlin Valley, through which the [[Spree|River Spree]] flows. To the west, the boundary between Barnim and the [[Glien Plateau]] is marked by a north-south [[U-shaped valley|glacial valley]]. To the north and north east is the boundary with the [[Eberswald Valley]], and in the east, [[Lubusz Land]].\n\n===Subdivision===\n\nTraditionally the plateau is divided into the Upper and Lower Barnim, separated by a line running between [[Strausberg]] and [[Eberswalde]]. Typically, Lower Barnim does not reach higher than 80 metres above mean sea level (AMSL) whereas Upper Barnim is generally more than 100 metres AMSL. The highest point of the plateau is Semmelberg which stands at 157 metres AMSL.\n[[File:Barnim.png|thumb|right|The extent of the Barnim Plateau.]]\n\n===Settlements===\n\nUntil the growth of Berlin in the 19th century, Barnim was only sparsely populated; in the eastern portion this continues to be the case. Excluding Berlin, only [[Bernau bei Berlin|Bernau]] and [[Strausberg]] are the only settlements with more than 10,000 inhabitants. [[Werneuchen]], [[Altlandsberg]] and [[Biesenthal]] are among the smaller towns in the area. Several once-independent towns such as [[Oranienburg]] and [[Wriezen]], which were once independent towns, were incorporated into Berlin as a result of [[urban sprawl]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n==Geological Structure, Landforms and Soils==\n\n===Bedrock Deposits===\nThe southern edge of Barnim in the vicinity of [[R\u00fcdersdorf]] unusually contains widespread deposits of limestone, [[Buntsandstein]] and [[Muschelkalk]]. The relatively high position of the limestone in the bedrock is explained by the presence of a [[salt dome]]; the migrating salt pushed the overlying sedimentary rock closer to the surface. The limestone deposits gave birth to an expansive quarry which provided building materials for the expanding Berlin, an example of which being the tower of [[St. Mary's Church, Berlin|St. Mary's Church]].\n\n===Kansan Glacial Period===\n\nThe deposits of the first glacial motions during the [[Kansan glaciation]] were laid as deep as 100 metres below the surface. They are particularly prominent in [[tunnel valley]]s. Kansan sediment primarily consists of till and deposits in [[proglacial lake]]s. Thanks to [[Law of superposition|superposition]] with [[Wolstonian|Wolstonian Stage]] sediment, it is generally only found at the surface in isolation around the Oderbruchrand area. Generally, present-day Barnim there is very little surface evidence of the Kansan period remaining.\n[[File:Barnim Detail.png|thumbnail|A geological and geomorphological map of Barnim]]\n\n===Wolstonian Stage===\nOnly the two primary glacial motions of the Wolstonian Stage allowed the plateau to clearly emerge. Geologically, Barnim is composed mostly of deposits from the more recent Warthe Motion which extends as far as [[Fl\u00e4ming Heath]]. The till associated with the Wolstonian stage can be found on the surface or within a few metres of it in many places. The deposits of the older Drenthe Motion are much thinner and covered by deposits from younger movements.\n\nThe Wolstonian period also saw the formation of several [[Moraines|terminal moraines]]; for this reason there are numerous places throughout the plateau where the soil consists of [[clay]] made of [[oligocene]] and [[miocene]], which belong to the [[tertiary]] period which predates the Wolstonian Stage by several million years.\n\n===Last Glacial Period===\nIn the [[last glacial period]], more commonly known as the last time the Earth experienced an [[ice age]], glaciers reached 60 kilometres south of Barnim.\n\n==Hydrology and Climate==\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\n==== Watershed ====\nThe principal [[drainage divide]] between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] runs across the Barnim plateau from Northeast to Southwest. It also runs between the [[drainage basin]]s of the [[Elbe]] and [[Oder]] rivers. Its course roughly follows that of the Frankfurt [[push moraine]].  The main features along the divide include the [[Wandlitzer See]] and the [[Liepnitzsee]].\n\n==== Streams ====\n[[File:18-06-12-Fotoflug-Samithsee-77DK MG 2552 1.jpg|thumb|The stream Finow and the lake Gro\u00dfer Samithsee near Finowfurt]]\nThe following streams drain into the [[Havel]] and [[Spree]] drainage basins:\n* [[Briese]], confluence at [[Hohen Neuendorf]]\n* [[Tegeler Flie\u00df]], which flows into [[Lake Tegel]] and onto the Havel\n* [[Panke]], confluence with the Spree in [[Mitte|central Berlin]]\n* [[Wuhle]], confluence with the Spree near [[K\u00f6penick]]\n* [[Neuenhagener Muhlenfliess|Neuenhagener M\u00fchlenflie\u00df]]\n* [[Fredersdorfer M\u00fchlenflie\u00df]]\n* Northern tributaries of the [[L\u00f6cknitz (river)]], for example the [[Lichtenower M\u00fchlenflie\u00df]]\nThe following tributaries flow into the [[Oder]]:\n* [[Finow]], into which flow the [[Schw\u00e4rze]] and [[Nonnenflie\u00df]] tributaries at [[Eberswalde]]\n* [[Batzlower M\u00fchlenflie\u00df]]\n* [[Sophienflie\u00df]], which supplies the [[Scherm\u00fctzelsee]] and [[Stobber]]\n\n==== Lakes ====\nDespite being an area of [[Old and Young Drift#Young Drift|Young Drift]], Barnim has relatively few lakes. At the [[outwash plain]], the deposition of [[glacio-fluvial]] sediment has led to a higher number of lakes, the most well-known of which are [[Wandlitzer See]], [[Gamensee]] and [[Straussee]].\n[[File:Hellersdorf and Kaulsdorf-Nord from Kienberg.jpg|center|thumb|705x705px|The view from [[Kienberg (Berlin)|Kienberg]] towards [[Hellersdorf]] and [[Kaulsdorf (Berlin)|Kaulsdorf]].]]\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAs in the rest of the region, Barnim is located in the transition zone between the oceanic climate of Western Europe and the continental climate of Eastern Europe. Due to the relatively small height differential between Upper and Lower Barnim there is little difference between the climates of the two areas. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of -1&nbsp;\u00b0C and the warmest is July, with an average temperature of 18&nbsp;\u00b0C. The averages for Upper Barnim are marginally lower.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hendl|first=M|year=1994|editor-last=Marcinek|editor-first=Joachim|title=Das Klima des Norddeutschen Tieflandes|url=|journal=Physische Geographie Deutschlands|volume=|pages=559|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe average annual precipitation for Lower Barnim is 550mm whereas in Upper Barnim it is 600mm. Due to the height of Barnim, the [[Oderbruch]], which lies to the east and is on average 100 metres lower than Barnim, is in a [[rain shadow]]. This is compounded by the height of other surrounding areas such as [[Lubusz Land]] and [[Chorin]]. Whereas Barnim receives relatively high amounts of precipitation, the Oderbruch receives less than 500mm annually and is one of the driest regions in Germany. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}[[File:Barnimteltow um 1250.png|thumb|Main settlements in Barnim in 1250.

Further settlement was also carried out under the [[House of Wettin]], part of the [[Margravate of Meissen]]. The Wettiners expanded from the south with castles in [[Mittenwalde]] and [[K\u00f6penick]] in Lower Barnim, whereas the Ascaniers expanded over the northern parts of Upper Barnim from [[Oranienburg]] to [[Strausberg]]. Conflicts over the question of territorial sovereignty contributed to the [[Teltow and Magdeburg Wars]] between 1239 and 1245 which were won by the Ascaniers. In a measure intended to cement Ascanian rule, the House founded the [[Chorin]] monastery and the [[Friedland, Brandenburg|Friedland]] convent, which is now a ruin.

[[File:Retsee Hoenow2.JPG|thumb|right|A lake known as '''Retsee''' which is located on the plateau.]]\n[[File:2018 04 Schwaerzesee IMG 1098.JPG|thumb|Lake Schw\u00e4rzesee near Eberswalde, Barnim, Brandenburg]]\n==Boundaries and Subdivision==\n\n===Boundaries===\n\nThe limits of the plateau are easily definable. The southern boundary is marked by the Berlin Valley, through which the [[Spree|River Spree]] flows. To the west, the boundary between Barnim and the [[Glien Plateau]] is marked by a north-south [[U-shaped valley|glacial valley]]. To the north and north east is the boundary with the [[Eberswald Valley]], and in the east, [[Lubusz Land]].\n\n===Subdivision===\n\nTraditionally the plateau is divided into the Upper and Lower Barnim, separated by a line running between [[Strausberg]] and [[Eberswalde]]. Typically, Lower Barnim does not reach higher than 80 metres above mean sea level (AMSL) whereas Upper Barnim is generally more than 100 metres AMSL. The highest point of the plateau is Semmelberg which stands at 157 metres AMSL.\n[[File:Barnim.png|thumb|right|The extent of the Barnim Plateau.]]\n\n===Settlements===\n\nUntil the growth of Berlin in the 19th century, Barnim was only sparsely populated; in the eastern portion this continues to be the case. Excluding Berlin, only [[Bernau bei Berlin|Bernau]] and [[Strausberg]] are the only settlements with more than 10,000 inhabitants. [[Werneuchen]], [[Altlandsberg]] and [[Biesenthal]] are among the smaller towns in the area. Several once-independent towns such as [[Oranienburg]] and [[Wriezen]], which were once independent towns, were incorporated into Berlin as a result of [[urban sprawl]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n==Geological Structure, Landforms and Soils==\n\n===Bedrock Deposits===\nThe southern edge of Barnim in the vicinity of [[R\u00fcdersdorf]] unusually contains widespread deposits of limestone, [[Buntsandstein]] and [[Muschelkalk]]. The relatively high position of the limestone in the bedrock is explained by the presence of a [[salt dome]]; the migrating salt pushed the overlying sedimentary rock closer to the surface. The limestone deposits gave birth to an expansive quarry which provided building materials for the expanding Berlin, an example of which being the tower of [[St. Mary's Church, Berlin|St. Mary's Church]].\n\n===Kansan Glacial Period===\n\nThe deposits of the first glacial motions during the [[Kansan glaciation]] were laid as deep as 100 metres below the surface. They are particularly prominent in [[tunnel valley]]s. Kansan sediment primarily consists of till and deposits in [[proglacial lake]]s. Thanks to [[Law of superposition|superposition]] with [[Wolstonian|Wolstonian Stage]] sediment, it is generally only found at the surface in isolation around the Oderbruchrand area. Generally, present-day Barnim there is very little surface evidence of the Kansan period remaining.\n[[File:Barnim Detail.png|thumbnail|A geological and geomorphological map of Barnim]]\n\n===Wolstonian Stage===\nOnly the two primary glacial motions of the Wolstonian Stage allowed the plateau to clearly emerge. Geologically, Barnim is composed mostly of deposits from the more recent Warthe Motion which extends as far as [[Fl\u00e4ming Heath]]. The till associated with the Wolstonian stage can be found on the surface or within a few metres of it in many places. The deposits of the older Drenthe Motion are much thinner and covered by deposits from younger movements.\n\nThe Wolstonian period also saw the formation of several [[Moraines|terminal moraines]]; for this reason there are numerous places throughout the plateau where the soil consists of [[clay]] made of [[oligocene]] and [[miocene]], which belong to the [[tertiary]] period which predates the Wolstonian Stage by several million years.\n\n===Last Glacial Period===\nIn the [[last glacial period]], more commonly known as the last time the Earth experienced an [[ice age]], glaciers reached 60 kilometres south of Barnim.\n\n==Hydrology and Climate==\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\n==== Watershed ====\nThe principal [[drainage divide]] between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] runs across the Barnim plateau from Northeast to Southwest. It also runs between the [[drainage basin]]s of the [[Elbe]] and [[Oder]] rivers. Its course roughly follows that of the Frankfurt [[push moraine]].  The main features along the divide include the [[Wandlitzer See]] and the [[Liepnitzsee]].\n\n==== Streams ====\nThe following streams drain into the [[Havel]] and [[Spree]] drainage basins:\n* [[Briese]], confluence at [[Hohen Neuendorf]]\n* [[Tegeler Flie\u00df]], which flows into [[Lake Tegel]] and onto the Havel\n* [[Panke]], confluence with the Spree in [[Mitte|central Berlin]]\n* [[Wuhle]], confluence with the Spree near [[K\u00f6penick]]\n* [[Neuenhagener Muhlenfliess|Neuenhagener M\u00fchlenflie\u00df]]\n* [[Fredersdorfer M\u00fchlenflie\u00df]]\n* Northern tributaries of the [[L\u00f6cknitz (river)]], for example the [[Lichtenower M\u00fchlenflie\u00df]]\nThe following tributaries flow into the [[Oder]]:\n* [[Finow]], into which flow the [[Schw\u00e4rze]] and [[Nonnenflie\u00df]] tributaries at [[Eberswalde]]\n* [[Batzlower M\u00fchlenflie\u00df]]\n* [[Sophienflie\u00df]], which supplies the [[Scherm\u00fctzelsee]] and [[Stobber]]\n[[File:18-06-12-Fotoflug-Samithsee-77DK MG 2552 1.jpg|thumb|The stream Finow and the lake Gro\u00dfer Samithsee near Finowfurt]]\n\n==== Lakes ====\nDespite being an area of [[Old and Young Drift#Young Drift|Young Drift]], Barnim has relatively few lakes.
