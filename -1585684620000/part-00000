Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]''. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note.\n\n=== Fan community ===\nThe game has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.

It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded [[interurban]] railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.

a [[light rail]] system in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States, that is owned and operated by [[TriMet]]. It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded [[interurban]] railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.

The bombardment killed 1,297 French servicemen, sank a [[battleship]] and damaged five other ships for a British loss of five aircraft shot down and two crewmen killed.\n\nThe attack by air and sea was conducted by the [[Royal Navy]] after France had signed armistices with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] that came into effect on 25 June. Of particular significance to the British were the five battleships of the [[Bretagne-class battleship|''Bretagne'']] and [[Richelieu-class battleship|''Richelieu'']] classes and the two [[fast battleship]]s of the [[Dunkerque-class battleship|Dunkerque]] class, the second largest force of [[capital ships]] in Europe after the Royal Navy. The British [[Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]] feared that the ships would fall into Axis hands. Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], commander of the French Navy, promised the British that the fleet would remain under French control but [[Winston Churchill]] and the War Cabinet judged that the fleet was too powerful to risk an Axis take-over.\n\nThe French thought they were acting honourably in terms of their [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|armistice]] with Germany and were convinced they would never turn over their fleet. The British attack was almost universally condemned in France, where grievances festered for years over what they considered a betrayal by their former ally. Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], who had become the prime minister of France on 16 June, [[Foreign relations of Vichy France|severed diplomatic relations]] with the [[United Kingdom]] on 8 July. The next day, six days after the attack, deputies of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]  met at [[Vichy]] and voted to revise the constitution, bringing the [[French Third Republic]] to an end. The following day, Marshal P\u00e9tain was installed with full powers as leader of the new [[Vichy France|French State]]. In retaliation of the attack at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, French aircraft [[Military history of Gibraltar during World War II#Vichy French attacks: 1940|raided Gibraltar]] on 18 July.\n\nOn 27 November 1942, after [[Operation Torch]], the Allied invasion of French North Africa began, the French navy foiled [[Operation Anton]], a German and Italian attempt to capture the rest of the French fleet by the [[scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon]]. The attack at Mers-el K\u00e9bir remains controversial and the motives of the British are still debated but has also been argued to have demonstrated to the world that Britain intended to fight on.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|pp=643\u2013670}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===French\u2013German armistice===\n\n{{main|Armistice of 22 June 1940}}\n\nAfter the [[Fall of France]] in 1940 and the armistice between France and [[Nazi Germany]], the British War Cabinet was apprehensive about control over the French navy. The French and German navies combined could alter the balance of power at sea, threatening British imports over the Atlantic and communications with the rest of the [[British Empire]]. In Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Armistice terms, the German government \"solemnly and firmly declared that it had no intention of making demands regarding the French fleet during the peace negotiations\" and there were similar terms in the armistice with Italy but they were considered by the British to be no guarantee of the neutralisation of the French fleet. On 24 June, Darlan assured [[Winston Churchill]] against such a possibility.{{sfn|Butler|1971|p=218}} Churchill ordered that a demand be made that the [[French Navy]] ({{lang|fr|Marine nationale}}) should either join with the [[Royal Navy]] or be neutralised in a manner guaranteed to prevent the ships falling into Axis hands.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|p=57}}\n\nAt Italian suggestion, the armistice terms were amended to permit the French fleet temporarily to stay in North African ports, where they might be seized by Italian troops from Libya. The British made a contingency plan, Operation Catapult, to eliminate the French fleet in mid-June, when it was clear that [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] was forming a government with a view to ending the war and it seemed likely that the French fleet might be seized by the Germans.{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|pp=246\u2013247}} In a speech to Parliament, Churchill repeated that the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] was a betrayal of the Allied agreement not to make a separate peace. Churchill said, \"What is the value of that? Ask half a dozen countries; what is the value of such a solemn assurance?... Finally, the armistice could be voided at any time on any pretext of non-observance...\".<ref>Hansard, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1940/jun/25/war-situation ''War Situation''], 25 June 1940, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1940/jun/25/war-situation#column_304 304\u201305]</ref>\n\nThe French fleet had seen little fighting during the Battle of France and was mostly intact. By tonnage, about 40 per cent was in [[Toulon]], near [[Marseilles]], 40 per cent in [[French North Africa]] and 20 per cent in Britain, [[Alexandria]] and the [[French West Indies]]. Although Churchill feared the fleet would be used by the Axis, Hitler and Mussolini did not intend to employ a combined Franco\u2013Italian\u2013German force. The {{lang|de|Kriegsmarine}} and [[Benito Mussolini]] made overtures but [[Adolf Hitler]] feared that an attempted take-over would provoke the French fleet into defecting to the British. Churchill and Hitler viewed the fleet as a potential threat; the French leaders used the fleet (and the possibility of its rejoining the Allies) as a bargaining counter against the Germans to keep them out of unoccupied France ({{lang|fr|[[zone libre]]}}) and French North Africa. The armistice was contingent on the French right to man their vessels and the French Navy Minister, Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], had ordered the Atlantic fleet to Toulon to demobilise, with orders to [[scuttling|scuttle]] the ships if the Germans tried to take them.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|p=56}}\n\n===British\u2013French negotiations===\nThe British tried to persuade the French authorities in North Africa to continue the war or to hand over the fleet to British control. A British admiral visited Oran on 24 June, and [[Duff Cooper]], [[Minister of Information]], visited Casablanca on 27 June.{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|p=247}} The French Atlantic ports were in German hands, and the British needed to keep the German surface fleet out of the Mediterranean, confine the Italian fleet to the Mediterranean and to blockade ports still under French control. The Admiralty was against an attack on the French fleet since if not enough damage were done to the ships, France would be provoked into declaring war and the French colonies would be less likely to defect to the Allies. Since the Royal Navy lacked the ships to provide a permanent blockade on the French naval bases in North Africa and keep the Atlantic approaches open, the risk of having the Germans or the Italians seize the French capital ships was deemed too great. Because the fleet in Toulon was well guarded by shore artillery, the Royal Navy decided to attack the base in North Africa.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n==Ultimatum==\n[[File:French-ships-africa.png|thumb|upright=.75|{{centre|French ships based in Africa, June 1940}}]]\nThe most powerful group of French warships was at [[Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]] in [[French Algeria]], comprising the old battleships {{Ship|French battleship|Provence||2}} and {{Ship|French battleship|Bretagne||2}}, the newer ''[[Force de Raid]]'' battleships {{Ship|French battleship|Dunkerque||2}} and {{Ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}}, the [[seaplane tender]] {{Ship|French seaplane carrier|Commandant Teste||2}}, six destroyers and a gunboat, under the command of Admiral [[Marcel-Bruno Gensoul]].

Gensoul was affronted that negotiations were not being conducted by a senior officer and sent his lieutenant, Bernard Dufay, which led to much delay and confusion. As negotiations dragged on, it became clear that neither side was likely to give way. Darlan was at home on 3 July and could not be contacted; Gensoul told the French government that the alternatives were internment or battle but omitted the option of sailing to the French West Indies.{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|p=247}} Removing the fleet to United States waters had formed part of the orders given by Darlan to Gensoul in the event that a foreign power should attempt to seize his ships.{{sfn|Butler|1971|pp=224\u2013225}}\n\n==Operation Catapult==\n===Plymouth and Alexandria===\nAlong with French vessels in metropolitan ports, some had sailed to ports in Britain or to Alexandria in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]].

The main armament of ''Dunkerque'' and ''Strasbourg'' was grouped on their bows and could not immediately be brought to bear. The British capital ships had {{convert|15|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns and fired a heavier [[broadside]] than the French. On 3 July, before negotiations were formally terminated, British [[Fairey Swordfish]] planes escorted by [[Blackburn Skua]]s from ''Ark Royal'' dropped magnetic mines in the harbour exit.

A [[torpedo]] hit the patrol boat ''Terre-Neuve'', moored alongside ''Dunkerque'' and full of [[depth charge]]s.

The [[French Air Force]] ({{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}}) made reprisal raids on Gibraltar, including a half-hearted night attack on 5 July, when many bombs landed in the sea and raids on 24 September by forty aircraft and the next day by more than a hundred bombers.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=142}}{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\n[[File:Mogador 03-07-1940.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The French destroyer [[French destroyer Mogador|''Mogador'']] running aground, after having been hit by a 15-inch shell.}}]]\nChurchill wrote \"This was the most hateful decision, the most unnatural and painful in which I have ever been concerned\".{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|p=246}} Relations between Britain and France were severely strained for some time and the Germans enjoyed a [[propaganda]] coup.

After delicate negotiations, conducted on the part of the British by Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], Godfroy agreed on 7 July to disarm his fleet and stay in port until the end of the war.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=140\u2013141}} Some sailors joined the Free French while others were repatriated to France; ''Surcouf'' and the ships at Alexandria went on to be used by the Free French after May 1943. The British attacks on French vessels in port increased tension between Churchill and [[Charles de Gaulle]], who was recognised by the British as the leader of the Free French Forces on 28 June 1940.{{sfn|Auphan|Mordal|1976|pp=124\u2013126}}{{sfn|Butler|1971|p=230}}\n\nAccording to his [[Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister|principal private secretary]] Eric Seal, \"[Churchill] was convinced that the Americans were impressed by ruthlessness in dealing with a ruthless foe; and in his mind the American reaction to our attack on the French fleet in Oran was of the first importance\". On 4 July, Roosevelt told the French ambassador that he would have done the same.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=92}} De Gaulle's biographer [[Jean Lacouture]] blamed the tragedy mainly on miscommunication; had Darlan been in contact on the day or had Somerville possessed a more diplomatic character, a deal might have been done. Lacouture accepted that there was a danger that the French ships might have been captured by German or more likely Italian troops, as proven by the ease with which the British seized French ships in British ports or the German seizure of French ships in [[Bizerte]] in Tunisia in November 1942.{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|p=249}}{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=404}}\n\n===Casualties===\n[[File:Mers el Kebir Memorial at Toulon, France.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Memorial on the coast path at Toulon to the 1,297 French seamen killed at Mers El Kebir}}]]\n{| align=\"centre\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Numbers killed at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=19}}\n!\n!

Military retaliation was conducted through ineffective [[Military history of Gibraltar during World War II#Vichy French attacks: 1940|air raids on Gibraltar]] but Baudouin noted that \"the attack on our fleet is one thing, war is another\". As sceptics had warned, there were also complications with the French empire; when French colonial forces defeated de Gaulle's Free French Forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] in September 1940, Germany responded by permitting Vichy France to maintain its remaining ships armed, rather than demobilised.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=142\u2013143}}{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=99}}\n\n====Gibraltarian civilians====\n\n{{main|Military history of Gibraltar during World War II|Evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II}}\n\nIn early June 1940, about 13,500 civilians had been evacuated from Gibraltar to Casablanca in French Morocco.  Following the capitulation of the French to the Germans and the attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, the Vichy government found their presence an embarrassment. Later in June, 15 British cargo vessels arrived in Casablanca under Commodore Crichton, repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been rescued from Dunkirk. Once the French troops had disembarked, the ships were interned until the Commodore agreed to take away the evacuees, who, reflecting tensions generated after the attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, were escorted to the ships at bayonet point, minus many of their possessions.{{sfn|Bond|2003|p=98}}\n\n====Case Anton====\n\n{{main|Case Anton}}\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the Germans tried to capture the French fleet based at Toulon, against the armistice terms, as part of Case Anton, the military occupation of Vichy France by Germany. All ships of any military value were [[Scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon|scuttled]] by the French before the arrival of German troops, notably ''Dunkerque'', ''Strasbourg'' and seven (four heavy and three light) modern cruisers.

The bombardment killed 1,297 French servicemen, sank a [[battleship]] and damaged five other ships for a British loss of five aircraft shot down and two crewmen killed.\n\nThe attack by air and sea was conducted by the [[Royal Navy]] after France had signed armistices with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] that came into effect on 25 June. Of particular significance to the British were the five battleships of the [[Bretagne-class battleship|''Bretagne'']] and [[Richelieu-class battleship|''Richelieu'']] classes and the two [[fast battleship]]s of the [[Dunkerque-class battleship|Dunkerque]] class, the second largest force of [[capital ships]] in Europe after the Royal Navy. The British [[Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]] feared that the ships would fall into Axis hands. Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], commander of the French Navy, promised the British that the fleet would remain under French control but [[Winston Churchill]] and the War Cabinet judged that the fleet was too powerful to risk an Axis take-over.\n\nThe French thought they were acting honourably in terms of their [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|armistice]] with Germany and were convinced they would never turn over their fleet. The British attack was almost universally condemned in France, where grievances festered for years over what they considered a betrayal by their former ally. Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], who had become the prime minister of France on 16 June, [[Foreign relations of Vichy France|severed diplomatic relations]] with the [[United Kingdom]] on 8 July. The next day, six days after the attack, deputies of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]  met at [[Vichy]] and voted to revise the constitution, bringing the [[French Third Republic]] to an end. The following day, Marshal P\u00e9tain was installed with full powers as leader of the new [[Vichy France|French State]]. In retaliation of the attack at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, French aircraft [[Military history of Gibraltar during World War II#Vichy French attacks: 1940|raided Gibraltar]] on 18 July.\n\nOn 27 November 1942, after [[Operation Torch]], the Allied invasion of French North Africa began, the French navy foiled [[Operation Anton]], a German and Italian attempt to capture the rest of the French fleet by the [[scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon]]. The attack at Mers-el K\u00e9bir remains controversial and the motives of the British are still debated but has also been argued to have demonstrated to the world that Britain intended to fight on.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|pp=643\u2013670}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===French\u2013German armistice===\n\n{{main|Armistice of 22 June 1940}}\n\nAfter the [[Fall of France]] in 1940 and the armistice between France and [[Nazi Germany]], the British War Cabinet was apprehensive about control over the French navy. The French and German navies combined could alter the balance of power at sea, threatening British imports over the Atlantic and communications with the rest of the [[British Empire]]. In Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Armistice terms, the German government \"solemnly and firmly declared that it had no intention of making demands regarding the French fleet during the peace negotiations\" and there were similar terms in the armistice with Italy but they were considered by the British to be no guarantee of the neutralisation of the French fleet. On 24 June, Darlan assured [[Winston Churchill]] against such a possibility.{{sfn|Butler|1971|p=218}} Churchill ordered that a demand be made that the [[French Navy]] ({{lang|fr|Marine nationale}}) should either join with the [[Royal Navy]] or be neutralised in a manner guaranteed to prevent the ships falling into Axis hands.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|p=57}}\n\nAt Italian suggestion, the armistice terms were amended to permit the French fleet temporarily to stay in North African ports, where they might be seized by Italian troops from Libya. The British made a contingency plan, Operation Catapult, to eliminate the French fleet in mid-June, when it was clear that [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] was forming a government with a view to ending the war and it seemed likely that the French fleet might be seized by the Germans.{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|pp=246\u2013247}} In a speech to Parliament, Churchill repeated that the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] was a betrayal of the Allied agreement not to make a separate peace. Churchill said, \"What is the value of that? Ask half a dozen countries; what is the value of such a solemn assurance?... Finally, the armistice could be voided at any time on any pretext of non-observance...\".<ref>Hansard, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1940/jun/25/war-situation ''War Situation''], 25 June 1940, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1940/jun/25/war-situation#column_304 304\u201305]</ref>\n\nThe French fleet had seen little fighting during the Battle of France and was mostly intact. By tonnage, about 40 per cent was in [[Toulon]], near [[Marseilles]], 40 per cent in [[French North Africa]] and 20 per cent in Britain, [[Alexandria]] and the [[French West Indies]]. Although Churchill feared the fleet would be used by the Axis, Hitler and Mussolini did not intend to employ a combined Franco\u2013Italian\u2013German force. The {{lang|de|Kriegsmarine}} and [[Benito Mussolini]] made overtures but [[Adolf Hitler]] feared that an attempted take-over would provoke the French fleet into defecting to the British. Churchill and Hitler viewed the fleet as a potential threat; the French leaders used the fleet (and the possibility of its rejoining the Allies) as a bargaining counter against the Germans to keep them out of unoccupied France ({{lang|fr|[[zone libre]]}}) and French North Africa. The armistice was contingent on the French right to man their vessels and the French Navy Minister, Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], had ordered the Atlantic fleet to Toulon to demobilise, with orders to [[scuttling|scuttle]] the ships if the Germans tried to take them.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|p=56}}\n\n===British\u2013French negotiations===\nThe British tried to persuade the French authorities in North Africa to continue the war or to hand over the fleet to British control. A British admiral visited Oran on 24 June, and [[Duff Cooper]], [[Minister of Information]], visited Casablanca on 27 June.{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|p=247}} The French Atlantic ports were in German hands, and the British needed to keep the German surface fleet out of the Mediterranean, confine the Italian fleet to the Mediterranean and to blockade ports still under French control. The Admiralty was against an attack on the French fleet since if not enough damage were done to the ships, France would be provoked into declaring war and the French colonies would be less likely to defect to the Allies. Since the Royal Navy lacked the ships to provide a permanent blockade on the French naval bases in North Africa and keep the Atlantic approaches open, the risk of having the Germans or the Italians seize the French capital ships was deemed too great. Because the fleet in Toulon was well guarded by shore artillery, the Royal Navy decided to attack the base in North Africa.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n==Ultimatum==\n[[File:French-ships-africa.png|thumb|upright=.75|{{centre|French ships based in Africa, June 1940}}]]\nThe most powerful group of French warships was at [[Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]] in [[French Algeria]], comprising the old battleships {{Ship|French battleship|Provence||2}} and {{Ship|French battleship|Bretagne||2}}, the newer ''[[Force de Raid]]'' battleships {{Ship|French battleship|Dunkerque||2}} and {{Ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}}, the [[seaplane tender]] {{Ship|French seaplane carrier|Commandant Teste||2}}, six destroyers and a gunboat, under the command of Admiral [[Marcel-Bruno Gensoul]]. Admiral [[James Somerville (admiral)|James Somerville]], commander of [[Force H]], based in [[Gibraltar]], was ordered to deliver an ultimatum to the French whose terms were contrary to the German-French armistice.{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|p=247}}{{efn|{{quote|It is impossible for us, your comrades up to now, to allow your fine ships to fall into the power of the German enemy.

Gensoul was affronted that negotiations were not being conducted by a senior officer and sent his lieutenant, Bernard Dufay, which led to much delay and confusion. As negotiations dragged on, it became clear that neither side was likely to give way. Darlan was at home on 3 July and could not be contacted; Gensoul told the French government that the alternatives were internment or battle but omitted the option of sailing to the French West Indies.{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|p=247}} Removing the fleet to United States waters had formed part of the orders given by Darlan to Gensoul in the event that a foreign power should attempt to seize his ships.{{sfn|Butler|1971|pp=224\u2013225}}\n\n==Operation Catapult==\n===Plymouth and Alexandria===\nAlong with French vessels in metropolitan ports, some had sailed to ports in Britain or to Alexandria in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]]. Operation Catapult was an attempt to take these ships under British control or destroy them and the French ships in [[Plymouth]] and [[Portsmouth]] were boarded without warning on the night of 3 July 1940.{{sfn|Butler|1971|p=222}}{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=240, 242}} The submarine {{Ship|French submarine|Surcouf||2}}, the largest in the world, had been berthed in Plymouth since June 1940.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=48}} The crew resisted a boarding party and three Royal Navy personnel, including two officers, were killed along with a French sailor.

The British had the advantage of being able to manoeuvre, while the French fleet was anchored in a narrow harbour and its crews did not expect an attack. The main armament of ''Dunkerque'' and ''Strasbourg'' was grouped on their bows and could not immediately be brought to bear. The British capital ships had {{convert|15|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns and fired a heavier [[broadside]] than the French. On 3 July, before negotiations were formally terminated, British [[Fairey Swordfish]] planes escorted by [[Blackburn Skua]]s from ''Ark Royal'' dropped magnetic mines in the harbour exit. The force was intercepted by French [[Curtiss H-75]] fighters and a Skua was shot down into the sea with the loss of its two crew, the only British fatalities in the action.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|p=61}} French warships were ordered from [[Algiers]] and Toulon as reinforcements but did not reach Mers-El-Kebir in time.{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|p=247}}\n\n[[File:Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir harbor-EN.svg|thumb|{{centre|Diagram of the British attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir}}]]\nAt {{nowrap|5:54 p.m.,}} Churchill ordered the British ships to open fire and the British commenced from {{convert|17500|yd|mi+km|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Brown|2004|p=198}} The third British salvo scored hits and a magazine aboard ''Bretagne'' exploded, the ship sinking with 977 of her crew at {{nowrap|6:09 p.m.}} After thirty salvoes, the French ships stopped firing; the British force altered course to avoid return fire from the French coastal forts but ''Provence'', ''Dunkerque,'' the destroyer {{Ship|French destroyer|Mogador||2}} and two other destroyers were damaged and run aground by their crews.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|pp=58\u201359}} ''Strasbourg'', three destroyers and one gunboat managed to avoid the magnetic mines and escape to the open sea under attack from a flight of bomb-armed Swordfish from ''Ark Royal''.

As the British believed that the damage inflicted on ''Dunkerque'' and ''Provence'' was not serious, Swordfish aircraft from ''Ark Royal'' raided Mers-el-K\u00e9bir again on the morning of 8 July. A [[torpedo]] hit the patrol boat ''Terre-Neuve'', moored alongside ''Dunkerque'' and full of [[depth charge]]s. ''Terre-Neuve'' quickly sank and the depth charges went off, causing serious damage to ''Dunkerque''.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|pp=60\u201361}}\n\nThe last phase of Operation Catapult was another attack on 8 July, by aircraft from the carrier {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} against the battleship [[French battleship Richelieu#British attack on 8 July 1940|''Richelieu'']] at [[Dakar]], which was seriously damaged. The [[French Air Force]] ({{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}}) made reprisal raids on Gibraltar, including a half-hearted night attack on 5 July, when many bombs landed in the sea and raids on 24 September by forty aircraft and the next day by more than a hundred bombers.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=142}}{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\n[[File:Mogador 03-07-1940.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The French destroyer [[French destroyer Mogador|''Mogador'']] running aground, after having been hit by a 15-inch shell.}}]]\nChurchill wrote \"This was the most hateful decision, the most unnatural and painful in which I have ever been concerned\".{{sfn|Lacouture|1991|p=246}} Relations between Britain and France were severely strained for some time and the Germans enjoyed a [[propaganda]] coup.

The British action showed the world that defeat in France had not reduced the determination of the government to fight on and ambassadors in Mediterranean countries reported favourable reactions.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=142}}\n\nThe French ships in Alexandria under the command of Admiral [[Ren\u00e9-Emile Godfroy]], including the old battleship {{Ship|French battleship|Lorraine||2}} and four [[cruiser]]s, were blockaded by the British on 3 July and offered the same terms as at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir. After delicate negotiations, conducted on the part of the British by Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], Godfroy agreed on 7 July to disarm his fleet and stay in port until the end of the war.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=140\u2013141}} Some sailors joined the Free French while others were repatriated to France; ''Surcouf'' and the ships at Alexandria went on to be used by the Free French after May 1943. The British attacks on French vessels in port increased tension between Churchill and [[Charles de Gaulle]], who was recognised by the British as the leader of the Free French Forces on 28 June 1940.{{sfn|Auphan|Mordal|1976|pp=124\u2013126}}{{sfn|Butler|1971|p=230}}\n\nAccording to his [[Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister|principal private secretary]] Eric Seal, \"[Churchill] was convinced that the Americans were impressed by ruthlessness in dealing with a ruthless foe; and in his mind the American reaction to our attack on the French fleet in Oran was of the first importance\".

Military retaliation was conducted through ineffective [[Military history of Gibraltar during World War II#Vichy French attacks: 1940|air raids on Gibraltar]] but Baudouin noted that \"the attack on our fleet is one thing, war is another\". As sceptics had warned, there were also complications with the French empire; when French colonial forces defeated de Gaulle's Free French Forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] in September 1940, Germany responded by permitting Vichy France to maintain its remaining ships armed, rather than demobilised.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=142\u2013143}}{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=99}}\n\n====Gibraltarian civilians====\n\n{{main|Military history of Gibraltar during World War II|Evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II}}\n\nIn early June 1940, about 13,500 civilians had been evacuated from Gibraltar to Casablanca in French Morocco.  Following the capitulation of the French to the Germans and the attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, the Vichy government found their presence an embarrassment. Later in June, 15 British cargo vessels arrived in Casablanca under Commodore Crichton, repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been rescued from Dunkirk. Once the French troops had disembarked, the ships were interned until the Commodore agreed to take away the evacuees, who, reflecting tensions generated after the attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, were escorted to the ships at bayonet point, minus many of their possessions.{{sfn|Bond|2003|p=98}}\n\n====Case Anton====\n\n{{main|Case Anton}}\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the Germans tried to capture the French fleet based at Toulon, against the armistice terms, as part of Case Anton, the military occupation of Vichy France by Germany. All ships of any military value were [[Scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon|scuttled]] by the French before the arrival of German troops, notably ''Dunkerque'', ''Strasbourg'' and seven (four heavy and three light) modern cruisers. For many in the French Navy this was a final proof that there had never been a question of their ships ending up in German hands and that the British action at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir had been unnecessary.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|2002|p=61}} Darlan was true to his promise in 1940, that French ships would not be allowed to fall into German hands. Godfroy, still in command of the French ships neutralised at Alexandria, remained aloof for a while longer but on 17 May 1943 joined the Allies.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|pp=338, 444}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n'''Royal Navy'''\n* {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} \u2013 battlecruiser \u2013 Flagship\n* {{HMS|Resolution|09|6}} \u2013 battleship\n* {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}} \u2013 battleship\n* {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} \u2013 aircraft carrier\n* {{HMS|Arethusa|26|6}} \u2013 light cruiser\n* {{HMS|Enterprise|D52|6}} \u2013 light cruiser\n* {{HMS|Faulknor|H62|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Foxhound|H69|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Fearless|H67|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Forester|H74|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Foresight|H68|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Escort|H66|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Keppel|D84|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Active|H14|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Wrestler||6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Vidette|D48|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{HMS|Vortigern|D37|6}} \u2013 destroyer\n\n'''French Navy (''Marine Nationale'')'''\n* {{Ship|French battleship|Dunkerque||2}} \u2013 battleship \u2013 Flagship\n* {{Ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}} \u2013 battleship\n* {{Ship|French battleship|Bretagne||2}} \u2013 battleship\n* {{Ship|French battleship|Provence||2}} \u2013 battleship\n* {{Ship|French seaplane carrier|Commandant Teste||2}} \u2013 seaplane tender\n* {{Ship|French destroyer|Mogador||2}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{Ship|French destroyer|Volta||2}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{Ship|French destroyer|Le Terrible||2}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{Ship|French destroyer|Kersaint|1931|2}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{Ship|French destroyer|Lynx||2}} \u2013 destroyer\n* {{Ship|French destroyer|Tigre||2}} \u2013 destroyer\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]\n* [[Battle of Taranto]]\n* [[Naval Battle of Casablanca]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Auphan|Mordal|1976}}\n|last1=Auphan |first1=Gabriel |authorlink1=Gabriel Auphan |last2=Mordal |first2=Jacques |authorlink2=Jacques Mordal |title=The French Navy in World War II |year=1976 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-8371-8660-3 }}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bell|1997}}\n|last=Bell |first=P.

About 8% will recur after first resection, with the recurrence usually cured after additional surgery.<ref name=\"RobinsonLA1\"/>\n\nThe prognosis in malignant SFTs is much more guarded.

The use of names that include \u2018mesothelioma\u2019 for this tumor is discouraged because of potential confusion with diffuse malignant mesothelioma, a much more serious disease.<ref name=\"who2004\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hemangiopericytoma]]\n*[[Myopericytoma]]\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\nImage:Solitary fibrous tumour low mag.jpg|Solitary fibrous tumor - low magnification.

The group is perhaps best known for hit singles such as \"[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]\" and \"[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]\", tracks that ranked on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s top 40 at No. 12 and No. 40, respectively, as well as other songs such as \"[[Wanted Man (Ratt song)|Wanted Man]]\", \"[[You're in Love (Ratt song)|You're in Love]]\" and \"[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]\". Along with groups such as friendly rivals [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], Ratt has been recognized as instrumental in the formation of the early 1980s [[Los Angeles]] [[glam metal]] scene, also known as \"hair metal\" or \"pop metal\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhHJtFnIC_QC&pg=PA12 |page=12 |title=Running with the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music |first=Robert |last=Walser |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780819574213}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxWasD0U6pcC&pg=PA104 |pages=103\u2013104 |title=Studies in Symbolic Interaction |editor=Norman K.

In 1974 the band broke up, with Pearcy forming Crystal Pystal. The name Crystal Pystal turned into Mickey Ratt in 1976.\n\nGuitarist [[Robbin Crosby]] in those same years had been a member of the bands Metropolis with Tommy Asakawa and Parramore McCarty, Xcalibur, Phenomenon, Secret Service and Mac Meda with Asakawa.\n\nMickey Ratt went through various line-up changes. Members included guitarists [[Jake E. Lee]], [[Chris Hager]], and Bob DeLellis, bassists [[Matt Thorr]], Tim Garcia, and Dave Jellison, and drummers John Turner, and Bob Eisenberg. The various Mickey Ratt line-ups released several demos compilations and a live concert recording on Pearcy's indie record label Top Fuel Records.\n\nIn 1980, to increase their chances of landing a recording contract with a major label, the band recorded a single called \"Dr. Rock\" / \"Drivin' on E\", which was given to fans at their early Los Angeles club shows.\n\nIn 1981, the band's name was shortened to Ratt. Crosby played with the band later in the year. Guitarist [[Warren DeMartini]], recommended by Lee, joined the band in January 1982. Bassist Gene Hunter (from Jake E. Lee's Teaser) and drummer Khurt Maier (who played drums on the early \"Tell the World\" written by Pearcy was their first recording that was featured on the compilation ''[[Metal Massacre|Metal Massacre I]]'') temporarily played in Ratt before the arrival of [[Bobby Blotzer]] (ex-Vic Vergeat) and [[Juan Croucier]] (previously with [[Dokken]], and musically active since 1973). DeMartini was only 18 years old when he was called up to Los Angeles to join Ratt. At the time he was attending college in San Diego and was reluctant to drop out to join a band that had, so far, had only limited success. [[Marq Torien]] briefly replaced DeMartini, though he returned in time for the recording of their first EP, later in 1982.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/tags/marq-torien|title=Marq Torien|newspaper=MelodicRock.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref>\n\n===''Ratt EP'' (1983)===\nIn July 1983, Ratt signed with recording label Time Coast Music. Later that same year, Time Coast released in the United States the band's six-track debut [[Extended Play|EP]], simply titled ''[[Ratt (EP)|Ratt]]''. Newly formed independent UK label [[Music for Nations]] released a seven-track version of the EP in Europe, which included the additional track \"You're in Trouble\".\n\nStephen Pearcy wrote four of the six songs that were written back in the Mickey Ratt days circa 1977-81. Pearcy and Robbin Crosby co-wrote the first single, \"You Think You're Tough\", that found its way onto local radio stations KLOS and KMET.\n\n===''Out of the Cellar'' (1984)===\nThe self-titled independent EP was well-received and brought the band to the attention of [[Atlantic Records]] which signed them. Ratt immediately started writing and recording their first full-length album. ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' was released in March 1984 and was praised by both fans and critics. Pearcy's raspy yet bluesy vocals were noted for melding with the pyrotechnic guitar playing of twin leads Crosby and DeMartini, combining the then-prevalent [[Van Halen]] and [[Aerosmith]]-influenced bravado elements with the then-novel muted, [[staccato]] guitar-picking style of [[Judas Priest]]. [[Tawny Kitaen]], who was previously in a relationship with Crosby, agreed to appear on the cover of their debut full-length album. She also appeared in their video for \"Back for More\" and on their EP from the previous year.\n\nThe album scored much radio and [[MTV]] play with songs like \"[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]\" (which peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[Wanted Man (Ratt song)|Wanted Man]]\", \"Back for More\", and \"[[Lack of Communication (song)|Lack of Communication]]\". Their music videos exposed them to an excited teen audience first tuning into the then fledgling MTV cable network. [[Milton Berle]]'s guest appearance, dressed in his [[Uncle Miltie]] drag character, in the video for \"Round and Round\" helped draw even more attention to the band.\n\n''Out of the Cellar'' became a commercial success, going platinum many times over in the United States, as well as making Ratt stars at home and in the Far East. The album release was capped off by a successful world tour that saw the band sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide, sharing the stage with such acts as [[Billy Squier]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Twisted Sister]] and [[Lita Ford]]. ''Out of the Cellar'' is today widely regarded as the band's best work and a definitive moment in 1980s heavy metal, while \"Round and Round\" scored at No.&nbsp;61 on [[VH1]]'s ''Greatest Hard Rock Songs Show''.\n\n===''Invasion of Your Privacy'' (1985\u20131986)===\nThe band's second full-length album ''[[Invasion of Your Privacy]]'' was released July 1985.\nIt peaked at No.&nbsp;7 (which is the same position that ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' peaked). The album met mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. Allmusic.com has called it \"another batch of solid pop-metal tunes\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r16197 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Invasion of Your Privacy - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> It contained the favorites \"[[You're in Love (Ratt song)|You're in Love]]\" and \"[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]\" (which made No.&nbsp;40 on the Hot 100) that assured the band a presence on radio and MTV. Footage from the band's performances at [[Hirsch Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and the [[Mississippi Coast Coliseum]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] were featured in the video to \"You're In Love\".\n\nDeMartini and Crosby's impressive guitar solos and Pearcy's highly sexual lyrics helped to further define the Ratt sound. Although it did not achieve the sales figures or the status of their debut, ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' nonetheless was certified double platinum (selling over two million copies) and remains highly regarded amongst fans.\n\nA couple months after the album release, the band released a home video titled ''[[Ratt: The Video]]''. The video featured the music videos from the Ratt EP, ''Out of the Cellar'' and ''Invasion of Your Privacy''. The video is currently out of print and is very rare and difficult to find. The video was the first commercially available video to certify Gold sales status in the USA and eventually reached Platinum.\n\nThe model on ''Invasion'''s cover is ''Playboy'' [[Playmate]] [[Marianne Gravatte]], who also made an appearance in the \"Lay It Down\" music video. Using a beautiful female model on an album cover later became a trend copied by many glam metal bands of the 1980s, such as [[Great White]], and [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], who coincidentally featured Robbin Crosby's wife on the cover of their debut album. Pearcy himself soon posed for Playgirl (August '86 issue). ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' was also one of the many albums that received the attention of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] since the cover and the album title were a reference to [[voyeurism]].{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}} The [[Tipper Gore]]-led organization presented it at a [[U.S. Congress]]ional hearing on September 19, 1985 dealing with [[parental advisory]] labels on albums that display \"inappropriate\" content.\nThe band toured extensively in the United States and Japan sharing stage with the likes of [[Bon Jovi]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Iron Maiden]]. In August 1985 the band played on the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in Castle Donington, England, along with [[ZZ Top]], Bon Jovi, [[Metallica]] and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\n===''Dancing Undercover'' (1986\u20131987)===\nRatt's next release was ''[[Dancing Undercover]]'' in September 1986. The album was a relative disappointment with most music critics at the time of its release. From a commercial standpoint however, the album kept Ratt's string of consecutive Platinum albums alive. This is the first album as well to see Crosby's lead guitar duties minimized in favor of DeMartini.\n\nIn an effort to be taken more seriously, Ratt broke from the tradition of featuring a girl on the cover. They instead opted for gritty black-and-white photos of each of the five band members. Likewise, the album does not contain a single power ballad amongst its ten tracks and even features experimental forays into [[thrash metal|thrashier]] and [[heavy metal music|heavier]] sounds.\n\nThe song that reflected this most strikingly was \"[[Body Talk (Ratt song)|Body Talk]]\", which was featured on the soundtrack for the 1986 [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[The Golden Child]]''. The more straight-ahead style of the album (especially with this song) led many fans to believe that Ratt was headed in a direction more akin to the [[thrash metal|thrash]] style promulgated by such bands as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]]. However, that proved not to be the case as the slightly [[experimental music|experimental]] undertones of the album were quickly replaced with a [[blues music|bluesier]] sound throughout their next three releases.\n\nOther popular tracks generated by the album included \"[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]\" and \"[[Slip of the Lip]]\".\nThrough 1987, Ratt embarked on a U.S. tour with newcomers [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], and played in Europe as a part of the Monsters Of Rock Tour (widely bootlegged). Their tour with Poison was one of the highest grossing tours of 1987. Ratt also played Madison Square Garden.\n\n===''Reach for the Sky'' (1988\u20131989)===\nThe group's follow-up, ''[[Reach for the Sky (Ratt album)|Reach for the Sky]]'' was released in November 1988. Although the album achieved Platinum sales status and reached No.&nbsp;17 on Billboard's album charts, it was widely panned by critics. Complaints ranged from it being formulaic and sophomoric to the album being uneven and lacking in focus. After this album, the band parted ways with long-time producer [[Beau Hill]]. For all the criticisms, ''Reach for the Sky'' nevertheless contained the popular tracks \"[[Way Cool Jr.]]\" and \"[[I Want a Woman]]\" which received their usual MTV airplay. Those two songs are now regarded as glam metal classics.\n\nThe surreal, Dali-esque album cover featured a statue wearing [[night vision goggles]], a human hand emerging from a bundle of [[twine]], a [[World War II]] fighter plane, and a [[wicker]] chair. The band has remained mum as to what the album cover is supposed to symbolize so as to facilitate the diverse interpretations of their fans. Early pressings of the album cover revealed the [[breast]] part of the statue as requested by lead singer Stephen Pearcy. According to Pearcy, he wanted to use that version of the cover but the other band members feared that this would keep the record out of certain music stores. The revised version of the album contained the same tracks, but in a different order. After the revised version hit the record stores, producer Beau Hill stepped down from producer duties and tensions within the band increased.\nThe band started the new year with a concert at the Tokyo Dome headlined by Bon Jovi The other bands in the bill were Kingdom Come and Britny Fox. Ratt soon played the Tokyo Dome on their own. Both appearances have been widely bootlegged.\nThe tour that followed in the spring of '89 (supported by Kix, Warrant and Britny Fox) was eventually cancelled due to poor ticket sales.\n\n===''Detonator'' (1990\u20131991)===\nRatt's fifth album ''[[Detonator (album)|Detonator]]'' was released in August 1990. Sir Arthur Payson took over as producer for the band following [[Beau Hill]]'s departure after the lackluster results for ''[[Reach for the Sky]]''. The album garnered mixed reactions. Critics claimed it lacked the live sounding energy of the band's earlier work,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hinds |first=Andy |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r87182 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Detonator - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> while some claim the sound more akin to [[hair metal]] (especially when compared to their raw early works), but still showing a band of experienced and refined musicians maturing and striving to expand their sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/ratt/detonator/ |title=Detonator by Ratt : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> ''Detonator'' featured among its tracks, \"[[Givin' Yourself Away]]\" (Ratt's only power ballad, co-written by Pearcy and [[Diane Warren]]) and \"[[Lovin' You's a Dirty Job]]\". The band co-wrote most of the album's songs with [[Desmond Child]] while [[Jon Bon Jovi]] appeared as a guest background vocalist on \"Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\". ''Detonator'''s sales were around 800-900,000. Robbin Crosby played on the album (acknowledged in a KNAC interview), despite rumors to the contrary. (Juan Croucier stated on his message board that Crosby's guitar parts are on the disc but were low in the mix.) Plagued by addiction for some time, Crosby authored just one song, \"Can't Wait on Love\", and contributed notably to another, \"All or Nothing\". Crosby entered a rehab facility during the early stages of recording.\n\nDuring the seven shows of the Japanese leg of the 'Detonator' tour in February 1991, Crosby's substance abuse had reached a point where his playing had become increasingly inconsistent onstage. The band had already removed the acoustic intro to \"Back for More\", which Crosby performed, along with modifying sections of other songs that featured him as lead guitarist. During one particular show, after the band performed two songs using non-standard tunings, Crosby did not properly switch out guitars with his guitar technician. As a result, he was not in tune with the band for the next two songs. The last show of the Japanese tour, in Osaka, turned out to be Crosby's last with Ratt. He would not record or perform with the band again.\n\nWhen the band returned to the United States, Crosby checked again into a rehab facility and Ratt continued on with [[Michael Schenker]], formerly of [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Michael Schenker Group]], and [[McAuley Schenker Group]].\n\n===Downfall of their career (1991\u20131992)===\nRatt was featured on the first season of [[MTV Unplugged]] to promote their most current album and new single, sharing the stage with all-female rock band [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]]. [[Michael Schenker]] performed with Ratt at the time of this taping.\n\nAt the end of 1991, Ratt released the final single of their career, until 2010's [[Best of Me (Ratt song)|Best of Me]]. \"[[Nobody Rides for Free]]\" which appeared on ''[[Point Break]]'''s soundtrack album. The song and video clearly signaled a change in the band. Robbin Crosby did not participate in the recording of the song and was not present for the shooting of the video in which only the four remaining members appeared.\n\nThe band never again recorded or performed with the original five members.\n\nAtlantic Records released a greatest hits compilation entitled ''[[Ratt & Roll 81-91]]'' in September 1991. The album featured five songs from ''Detonator'', more than any other album featured on the compilation. It also featured the aforementioned song \"Nobody Rides for Free\".\n\n===Hiatus (1992\u20131996)===\nIn February 1992, Stephen Pearcy exited the group to form a new hard rock band, with former [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] drummer [[Fred Coury]] called [[Arcade (band)|Arcade]], before moving on to [[Vicious Delite]] in 1995 and the industrial-tinged [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] in 1996.\n\n[[Robbin Crosby]] started Secret Service, which included bassist Krys Baratto ([[Samantha 7]], Juice 13). In 1993, Crosby performed on Rumbledog's self-titled debut album.\n\n[[Warren DeMartini]] (who had left after Pearcy in '92) was in [[Whitesnake]] in 1994 and issued two solo releases: the single \"Surf's Up!\" in 1995 and the album ''[[Crazy Enough to Sing to You]]'' in 1996.\n\nBobby Blotzer started numerous small business endeavors, most notably a carpet cleaning business, and had fill in spots with Montrose. Juan Croucier continued to produce underground bands from his studio called 'The Cellar' and, in 1994, received a lifetime achievement award in Los Angeles. During that year, Crosby was diagnosed with HIV, which later developed into AIDS.\n\n===First reunion and self-titled album (1996\u20132000)===\nIn 1996, the five classic era members of Ratt began discussing a reunion and a subsequent album after their publishing contract had to be renewed. After meeting with Crosby, it was decided that he was not in any physical shape to record or perform with the band. As the talks continued to progress, bassist Juan Croucier made the decision not to participate in the reunion as well. [[Rudy Sarzo]] was first thought as a replacement, but he would end up rejoining [[Quiet Riot]] in January 1997. Ratt eventually moved forward with Pearcy, DeMartini and Blotzer, along with new member, [[Robbie Crane]] (formerly of [[Vince Neil]]'s solo band and Pearcy's [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] tour) on bass. When the band toured in 1997, they were a four-piece; Pearcy occasionally played guitar during this tour.\n\nThe band issued a compilation album called ''[[Collage (Ratt album)|Collage]]'' in July 1997, which consisted of B-sides, alternate recordings, and new versions of songs from the Mickey Ratt period. In 1998, Ratt secured a worldwide record deal with [[Sony]]. The self-titled ''[[Ratt (album)|Ratt]]'' album, released in July 1999, featured new material with a more conventional blues rock feel.\nWith A&R guru [[John Kalodner]] in control over how the album turned out, bringing in outside writers in the process, the album did not come close to the platinum success that Ratt typically achieved, though the album's first single, \"Over the Edge\", did graze the Top 40 Mainstream Rock charts.\n\n===Two versions of Ratt, and death of Robbin Crosby (2000\u20132006)===\nIn 1999 Ratt added [[Keri Kelli]] as a second guitarist. In January 2000, Pearcy left the group again and went on tour with his band Nitronic, which soon after became \"Ratt Featuring Stephen Pearcy\".

The group is perhaps best known for hit singles such as \"[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]\" and \"[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]\", tracks that ranked on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s top 40 at No. 12 and No. 40, respectively, as well as other songs such as \"[[Wanted Man (Ratt song)|Wanted Man]]\", \"[[You're in Love (Ratt song)|You're in Love]]\" and \"[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]\". Along with groups such as friendly rivals [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], Ratt has been recognized as instrumental in the formation of the early 1980s [[Los Angeles]] [[glam metal]] scene, also known as \"hair metal\" or \"pop metal\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhHJtFnIC_QC&pg=PA12 |page=12 |title=Running with the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music |first=Robert |last=Walser |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780819574213}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxWasD0U6pcC&pg=PA104 |pages=103\u2013104 |title=Studies in Symbolic Interaction |editor=Norman K.

In 1974 the band broke up, with Pearcy forming Crystal Pystal. The name Crystal Pystal turned into Mickey Ratt in 1976.\n\nGuitarist [[Robbin Crosby]] in those same years had been a member of the bands Metropolis with Tommy Asakawa and Parramore McCarty, Xcalibur, Phenomenon, Secret Service and Mac Meda with Asakawa.\n\nMickey Ratt went through various line-up changes. Members included guitarists [[Jake E. Lee]], [[Chris Hager]], and Bob DeLellis, bassists [[Matt Thorr]], Tim Garcia, and Dave Jellison, and drummers John Turner, and Bob Eisenberg. The various Mickey Ratt line-ups released several demos compilations and a live concert recording on Pearcy's indie record label Top Fuel Records.\n\nIn 1980, to increase their chances of landing a recording contract with a major label, the band recorded a single called \"Dr. Rock\" / \"Drivin' on E\", which was given to fans at their early Los Angeles club shows.\n\nIn 1981, the band's name was shortened to Ratt. Crosby played with the band later in the year. Guitarist [[Warren DeMartini]], recommended by Lee, joined the band in January 1982. Bassist Gene Hunter (from Jake E. Lee's Teaser) and drummer Khurt Maier (who played drums on the early \"Tell the World\" written by Pearcy was their first recording that was featured on the compilation ''[[Metal Massacre|Metal Massacre I]]'') temporarily played in Ratt before the arrival of [[Bobby Blotzer]] (ex-Vic Vergeat) and [[Juan Croucier]] (previously with [[Dokken]], and musically active since 1973). DeMartini was only 18 years old when he was called up to Los Angeles to join Ratt. At the time he was attending college in San Diego and was reluctant to drop out to join a band that had, so far, had only limited success. [[Marq Torien]] briefly replaced DeMartini, though he returned in time for the recording of their first EP, later in 1982.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/tags/marq-torien|title=Marq Torien|newspaper=MelodicRock.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref>\n\n===''Ratt EP'' (1983)===\nIn July 1983, Ratt signed with recording label Time Coast Music. Later that same year, Time Coast released in the United States the band's six-track debut [[Extended Play|EP]], simply titled ''[[Ratt (EP)|Ratt]]''. Newly formed independent UK label [[Music for Nations]] released a seven-track version of the EP in Europe, which included the additional track \"You're in Trouble\".\n\nStephen Pearcy wrote four of the six songs that were written back in the Mickey Ratt days circa 1977-81. Pearcy and Robbin Crosby co-wrote the first single, \"You Think You're Tough\", that found its way onto local radio stations KLOS and KMET.\n\n===''Out of the Cellar'' (1984)===\nThe self-titled independent EP was well-received and brought the band to the attention of [[Atlantic Records]] which signed them. Ratt immediately started writing and recording their first full-length album. ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' was released in March 1984 and was praised by both fans and critics. Pearcy's raspy yet bluesy vocals were noted for melding with the pyrotechnic guitar playing of twin leads Crosby and DeMartini, combining the then-prevalent [[Van Halen]] and [[Aerosmith]]-influenced bravado elements with the then-novel muted, [[staccato]] guitar-picking style of [[Judas Priest]]. [[Tawny Kitaen]], who was previously in a relationship with Crosby, agreed to appear on the cover of their debut full-length album. She also appeared in their video for \"Back for More\" and on their EP from the previous year.\n\nThe album scored much radio and [[MTV]] play with songs like \"[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]\" (which peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[Wanted Man (Ratt song)|Wanted Man]]\", \"Back for More\", and \"[[Lack of Communication (song)|Lack of Communication]]\". Their music videos exposed them to an excited teen audience first tuning into the then fledgling MTV cable network. [[Milton Berle]]'s guest appearance, dressed in his [[Uncle Miltie]] drag character, in the video for \"Round and Round\" helped draw even more attention to the band.\n\n''Out of the Cellar'' became a commercial success, going platinum many times over in the United States, as well as making Ratt stars at home and in the Far East. The album release was capped off by a successful world tour that saw the band sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide, sharing the stage with such acts as [[Billy Squier]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Twisted Sister]] and [[Lita Ford]]. ''Out of the Cellar'' is today widely regarded as the band's best work and a definitive moment in 1980s heavy metal, while \"Round and Round\" scored at No.&nbsp;61 on [[VH1]]'s ''Greatest Hard Rock Songs Show''.\n\n===''Invasion of Your Privacy'' (1985\u20131986)===\nThe band's second full-length album ''[[Invasion of Your Privacy]]'' was released July 1985.\nIt peaked at No.&nbsp;7 (which is the same position that ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' peaked). The album met mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. Allmusic.com has called it \"another batch of solid pop-metal tunes\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r16197 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Invasion of Your Privacy - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> It contained the favorites \"[[You're in Love (Ratt song)|You're in Love]]\" and \"[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]\" (which made No.&nbsp;40 on the Hot 100) that assured the band a presence on radio and MTV. Footage from the band's performances at [[Hirsch Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and the [[Mississippi Coast Coliseum]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] were featured in the video to \"You're In Love\".\n\nDeMartini and Crosby's impressive guitar solos and Pearcy's highly sexual lyrics helped to further define the Ratt sound. Although it did not achieve the sales figures or the status of their debut, ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' nonetheless was certified double platinum (selling over two million copies) and remains highly regarded amongst fans.\n\nA couple months after the album release, the band released a home video titled ''[[Ratt: The Video]]''. The video featured the music videos from the Ratt EP, ''Out of the Cellar'' and ''Invasion of Your Privacy''. The video is currently out of print and is very rare and difficult to find. The video was the first commercially available video to certify Gold sales status in the USA and eventually reached Platinum.\n\nThe model on ''Invasion'''s cover is ''Playboy'' [[Playmate]] [[Marianne Gravatte]], who also made an appearance in the \"Lay It Down\" music video. Using a beautiful female model on an album cover later became a trend copied by many glam metal bands of the 1980s, such as [[Great White]], and [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], who coincidentally featured Robbin Crosby's wife on the cover of their debut album. Pearcy himself soon posed for Playgirl (August '86 issue). ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' was also one of the many albums that received the attention of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] since the cover and the album title were a reference to [[voyeurism]].{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}} The [[Tipper Gore]]-led organization presented it at a [[U.S. Congress]]ional hearing on September 19, 1985 dealing with [[parental advisory]] labels on albums that display \"inappropriate\" content.\nThe band toured extensively in the United States and Japan sharing stage with the likes of [[Bon Jovi]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Iron Maiden]]. In August 1985 the band played on the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in Castle Donington, England, along with [[ZZ Top]], Bon Jovi, [[Metallica]] and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\n===''Dancing Undercover'' (1986\u20131987)===\nRatt's next release was ''[[Dancing Undercover]]'' in September 1986. The album was a relative disappointment with most music critics at the time of its release. From a commercial standpoint however, the album kept Ratt's string of consecutive Platinum albums alive. This is the first album as well to see Crosby's lead guitar duties minimized in favor of DeMartini.\n\nIn an effort to be taken more seriously, Ratt broke from the tradition of featuring a girl on the cover. They instead opted for gritty black-and-white photos of each of the five band members. Likewise, the album does not contain a single power ballad amongst its ten tracks and even features experimental forays into [[thrash metal|thrashier]] and [[heavy metal music|heavier]] sounds.\n\nThe song that reflected this most strikingly was \"[[Body Talk (Ratt song)|Body Talk]]\", which was featured on the soundtrack for the 1986 [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[The Golden Child]]''. The more straight-ahead style of the album (especially with this song) led many fans to believe that Ratt was headed in a direction more akin to the [[thrash metal|thrash]] style promulgated by such bands as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]]. However, that proved not to be the case as the slightly [[experimental music|experimental]] undertones of the album were quickly replaced with a [[blues music|bluesier]] sound throughout their next three releases.\n\nOther popular tracks generated by the album included \"[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]\" and \"[[Slip of the Lip]]\".\nThrough 1987, Ratt embarked on a U.S. tour with newcomers [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], and played in Europe as a part of the Monsters Of Rock Tour (widely bootlegged). Their tour with Poison was one of the highest grossing tours of 1987. Ratt also played Madison Square Garden.\n\n===''Reach for the Sky'' (1988\u20131989)===\nThe group's follow-up, ''[[Reach for the Sky (Ratt album)|Reach for the Sky]]'' was released in November 1988. Although the album achieved Platinum sales status and reached No.&nbsp;17 on Billboard's album charts, it was widely panned by critics. Complaints ranged from it being formulaic and sophomoric to the album being uneven and lacking in focus. After this album, the band parted ways with long-time producer [[Beau Hill]]. For all the criticisms, ''Reach for the Sky'' nevertheless contained the popular tracks \"[[Way Cool Jr.]]\" and \"[[I Want a Woman]]\" which received their usual MTV airplay. Those two songs are now regarded as glam metal classics.\n\nThe surreal, Dali-esque album cover featured a statue wearing [[night vision goggles]], a human hand emerging from a bundle of [[twine]], a [[World War II]] fighter plane, and a [[wicker]] chair. The band has remained mum as to what the album cover is supposed to symbolize so as to facilitate the diverse interpretations of their fans. Early pressings of the album cover revealed the [[breast]] part of the statue as requested by lead singer Stephen Pearcy. According to Pearcy, he wanted to use that version of the cover but the other band members feared that this would keep the record out of certain music stores. The revised version of the album contained the same tracks, but in a different order. After the revised version hit the record stores, producer Beau Hill stepped down from producer duties and tensions within the band increased.\nThe band started the new year with a concert at the Tokyo Dome headlined by Bon Jovi The other bands in the bill were Kingdom Come and Britny Fox. Ratt soon played the Tokyo Dome on their own. Both appearances have been widely bootlegged.\nThe tour that followed in the spring of '89 (supported by Kix, Warrant and Britny Fox) was eventually cancelled due to poor ticket sales.\n\n===''Detonator'' (1990\u20131991)===\nRatt's fifth album ''[[Detonator (album)|Detonator]]'' was released in August 1990. Sir Arthur Payson took over as producer for the band following [[Beau Hill]]'s departure after the lackluster results for ''[[Reach for the Sky]]''. The album garnered mixed reactions. Critics claimed it lacked the live sounding energy of the band's earlier work,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hinds |first=Andy |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r87182 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Detonator - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> while some claim the sound more akin to [[hair metal]] (especially when compared to their raw early works), but still showing a band of experienced and refined musicians maturing and striving to expand their sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/ratt/detonator/ |title=Detonator by Ratt : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> ''Detonator'' featured among its tracks, \"[[Givin' Yourself Away]]\" (Ratt's only power ballad, co-written by Pearcy and [[Diane Warren]]) and \"[[Lovin' You's a Dirty Job]]\". The band co-wrote most of the album's songs with [[Desmond Child]] while [[Jon Bon Jovi]] appeared as a guest background vocalist on \"Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\". ''Detonator'''s sales were around 800-900,000. Robbin Crosby played on the album (acknowledged in a KNAC interview), despite rumors to the contrary. (Juan Croucier stated on his message board that Crosby's guitar parts are on the disc but were low in the mix.) Plagued by addiction for some time, Crosby authored just one song, \"Can't Wait on Love\", and contributed notably to another, \"All or Nothing\". Crosby entered a rehab facility during the early stages of recording.\n\nDuring the seven shows of the Japanese leg of the 'Detonator' tour in February 1991, Crosby's substance abuse had reached a point where his playing had become increasingly inconsistent onstage. The band had already removed the acoustic intro to \"Back for More\", which Crosby performed, along with modifying sections of other songs that featured him as lead guitarist. During one particular show, after the band performed two songs using non-standard tunings, Crosby did not properly switch out guitars with his guitar technician. As a result, he was not in tune with the band for the next two songs. The last show of the Japanese tour, in Osaka, turned out to be Crosby's last with Ratt. He would not record or perform with the band again.\n\nWhen the band returned to the United States, Crosby checked again into a rehab facility and Ratt continued on with [[Michael Schenker]], formerly of [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Michael Schenker Group]], and [[McAuley Schenker Group]].\n\n===Downfall of their career (1991\u20131992)===\nRatt was featured on the first season of [[MTV Unplugged]] to promote their most current album and new single, sharing the stage with all-female rock band [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]]. [[Michael Schenker]] performed with Ratt at the time of this taping.\n\nAt the end of 1991, Ratt released the final single of their career, until 2010's [[Best of Me (Ratt song)|Best of Me]]. \"[[Nobody Rides for Free]]\" which appeared on ''[[Point Break]]'''s soundtrack album. The song and video clearly signaled a change in the band. Robbin Crosby did not participate in the recording of the song and was not present for the shooting of the video in which only the four remaining members appeared.\n\nThe band never again recorded or performed with the original five members.\n\nAtlantic Records released a greatest hits compilation entitled ''[[Ratt & Roll 81-91]]'' in September 1991. The album featured five songs from ''Detonator'', more than any other album featured on the compilation. It also featured the aforementioned song \"Nobody Rides for Free\".\n\n===Hiatus (1992\u20131996)===\nIn February 1992, Stephen Pearcy exited the group to form a new hard rock band, with former [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] drummer [[Fred Coury]] called [[Arcade (band)|Arcade]], before moving on to [[Vicious Delite]] in 1995 and the industrial-tinged [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] in 1996.\n\n[[Robbin Crosby]] started Secret Service, which included bassist Krys Baratto ([[Samantha 7]], Juice 13). In 1993, Crosby performed on Rumbledog's self-titled debut album.\n\n[[Warren DeMartini]] (who had left after Pearcy in '92) was in [[Whitesnake]] in 1994 and issued two solo releases: the single \"Surf's Up!\" in 1995 and the album ''[[Crazy Enough to Sing to You]]'' in 1996.\n\nBobby Blotzer started numerous small business endeavors, most notably a carpet cleaning business, and had fill in spots with Montrose. Juan Croucier continued to produce underground bands from his studio called 'The Cellar' and, in 1994, received a lifetime achievement award in Los Angeles. During that year, Crosby was diagnosed with HIV, which later developed into AIDS.\n\n===First reunion and self-titled album (1996\u20132000)===\nIn 1996, the five classic era members of Ratt began discussing a reunion and a subsequent album after their publishing contract had to be renewed. After meeting with Crosby, it was decided that he was not in any physical shape to record or perform with the band. As the talks continued to progress, bassist Juan Croucier made the decision not to participate in the reunion as well. [[Rudy Sarzo]] was first thought as a replacement, but he would end up rejoining [[Quiet Riot]] in January 1997. Ratt eventually moved forward with Pearcy, DeMartini and Blotzer, along with new member, [[Robbie Crane]] (formerly of [[Vince Neil]]'s solo band and Pearcy's [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] tour) on bass. When the band toured in 1997, they were a four-piece; Pearcy occasionally played guitar during this tour.\n\nThe band issued a compilation album called ''[[Collage (Ratt album)|Collage]]'' in July 1997, which consisted of B-sides, alternate recordings, and new versions of songs from the Mickey Ratt period. In 1998, Ratt secured a worldwide record deal with [[Sony]]. The self-titled ''[[Ratt (album)|Ratt]]'' album, released in July 1999, featured new material with a more conventional blues rock feel.\nWith A&R guru [[John Kalodner]] in control over how the album turned out, bringing in outside writers in the process, the album did not come close to the platinum success that Ratt typically achieved, though the album's first single, \"Over the Edge\", did graze the Top 40 Mainstream Rock charts.\n\n===Two versions of Ratt, and death of Robbin Crosby (2000\u20132006)===\nIn 1999 Ratt added [[Keri Kelli]] as a second guitarist. In January 2000, Pearcy left the group again and went on tour with his band Nitronic, which soon after became \"Ratt Featuring Stephen Pearcy\". In this period, his record label Top Fuel Records released some archived Ratt material and Pearcy solo work.\n\nIn 2001, former guitarist Robbin Crosby publicly announced that he was [[HIV]]-positive. He died on June 6, 2002 from a heroin overdose. He was 42 years old.<ref name=\"latimes2002\"/>\n\nOn May 11, 2006, Ratt was profiled on VH1's ''[[Behind the Music]]''. In the episode, it was revealed for the first time publicly that former guitarist Robbin Crosby died of a heroin overdose, and not AIDS-related complications as was sometimes erroneously reported.\n\nDuring the group's inactive years, present-day and former members continued to work on their own side projects.  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027123537/http://geocities.com/angelcityoutlaws/bio.html |archivedate=2009-10-27 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> DeMartini and Jizzy Pearl worked on their respective solo careers and continued to record new material. In a surprising turn of events, Croucier (with Liquid Sunday) and Pearcy toured with one another during the summer and fall of 2006. Even further surprising many, Blotzer joined them onstage at a show on October 27, 2006.\n\n2018 the band Ratt reunites with original members Stephen Pearcy and Juan Croucier, with new members Jordan Ziff and Chris Sanders on guitars, and Pete Holmes on drums. the band toured thru 2019 and announced their \"World Infestation\" Tour 2020. www.therattpack.com\n\n===Second reunion (2006\u20132008)===\nOn December 1, 2006 the website \"Metal Sludge\" generated rumors after reporting that Pearcy and Croucier would re-unite with Blotzer and DeMartini.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206015745/http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1454&Itemid=42|title=Wayback Machine|date=December 6, 2006|website=Web.archive.org}}</ref> On December 4, 2006, Jizzy Pearl announced on his message board that he was no longer a member of the band, further increasing speculation and excitement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jizzypearl.com/ |title=home |publisher=jizzypearl.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref> On March 17, 2007, another website stated that Ratt would go on the 2007 tour with [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Great White]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/62399|title=POISON, RATT And GREAT WHITE To Tour Together This Summer|publisher=Bravewords.com}}</ref> On April 12, ''[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|Bravewords]]'' reported that [[White Lion]] would open for Poison and Ratt, while Great White was still \"in talks\" to join the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/64002|title=WHITE LION Confirmed To Open For Upcoming POISON, RATT North American Tour|publisher=Bravewords.com}}</ref>\n\nOn March 20, 2007, the official Ratt website was finally updated with only the band's logo after a year and a half of being dormant.

Launched by [[Mao Zedong]], the [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] (CPC), its stated goal was to preserve [[Ideology of the Communist Party of China|Chinese Communism]] by purging remnants of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Chinese culture|traditional]] elements from [[Culture of the People's Republic of China|Chinese society]], and to re-impose Mao Zedong Thought (known outside China as [[Maoism]]) as the [[dominant ideology]] in the CPC. The Revolution marked Mao's return to the central position of power in China after a period of less radical leadership to recover from the failures of the [[Great Leap Forward]], which led to approximately 30 million deaths in the [[Great Chinese Famine]] only five years earlier. \n\nMao launched the movement in May 1966 with the help of [[Cultural Revolution Group]], soon calling on young people to [[Bombard the Headquarters|\"bombard the headquarters\"]] and proclaiming that \"to rebel is justified\". To eliminate his rivals within the CPC and in schools, factories, and government institutions, Mao charged that [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] elements had infiltrated the government and society and that they aimed to restore capitalism. He insisted that [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]] be removed through violent [[Class conflict|class struggle]]. China's youth responded by forming [[Red Guard]] groups around the country, which split into rival factions and often involved in [[Violent Struggle|violent struggles]] ({{Lang-zh|t=\u6b66\u9b25|s=\u6b66\u6597|p=w\u01d4d\u00f2u}}). Urban workers likewise split into factions, and the [[People's Liberation Army]] had to be sent to restore order. [[Lin Biao]], head of the PLA, was written into the constitution as Mao's successor; Lin had compiled the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]], a selection of Mao's sayings, that became a sacred text for [[Mao Zedong's cult of personality|Mao's personality cult]]. Mao declared the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1969, but the Revolution's active phase lasted until at least 1971, when Lin Biao fled and [[Lin Biao incident|died in a plane crash]], accused of [[Project 571|a botched coup]] against Mao. In 1972, [[Gang of Four]] rose to power and the Cultural Revolution continued. After [[Death of Chairman Mao|Mao's death]] and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976, the Cultural Revolution finally came to an end.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution damaged [[Economy of China|China's economy]] while tens of millions of people were persecuted, with an estimated death toll ranging from hundreds of thousands to 20 million.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pye|first=Lucian W.|date=1986|title=Reassessing the Cultural Revolution|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=108|issue=108|pages=597\u2013612|issn=0305-7410|jstor=653530|doi=10.1017/S0305741000037085}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1017272/remembering-dark-days-chinas-cultural-revolution|title=Remembering the dark days of China's Cultural Revolution|last=|first=|date=2012-08-18|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609084717/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1017272/remembering-dark-days-chinas-cultural-revolution|archive-date=June 9, 2018|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/07/17/how-many-died-new-evidence-suggests-far-higher-numbers-for-the-victims-of-mao-zedongs-era/01044df5-03dd-49f4-a453-a033c5287bce/|title=HOW MANY DIED?

On the other hand, senior officials, most notably [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Peng Dehuai]] and [[He Long]], were purged or exiled. Millions were accused of being members of the [[Five Black Categories]] and were persecuted, suffering [[public humiliation]], imprisonment, torture, hard labor, seizure of property, and sometimes execution or harassment into suicide. Intellectuals were considered the \"[[Stinking Old Ninth]]\" and were widely persecuted; notable scholars and scientists such as [[Lao She]], [[Fu Lei]], [[Yao Tongbin]] and [[Zhao Jiuzhang]] were killed or committed suicides. Schools and universities were closed with the [[National College Entrance Examination|college entrance exams]] cancelled. Over 10 million [[Sent-down youth|urban intellectual youths]] were sent to the countryside in the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]]. Red Guards also destroyed [[Four Olds|historical relics as well as artifacts]], and ransacked cultural and religious sites. \n\nIn 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] became the new [[Paramount Leader of China|paramount leader of China]] and gradually dismantled the Maoist policies associated with the Cultural Revolution.

In this spirit, Mao launched the [[Great Leap Forward]], established [[People's Commune]]s in the countryside, and began the [[mass mobilization]] of the people into [[collectives]]. Many communities were assigned production of a single commodity\u2014steel. Mao vowed to increase agricultural production to twice 1957 levels.<ref name=\"Tang\"/>\n[[File:Iron smelting in 1958 China, from- Backyardfurnace5 (cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|People in the countryside working at night to produce steel during the [[Great Leap Forward]]]]\nThe Great Leap was an economic failure. Many uneducated farmers were pulled from farming and harvesting and instead instructed to produce steel on a massive scale, partially relying on [[backyard furnace]]s to achieve the production targets set by local cadres. The steel produced was of low quality and mostly useless. The Great Leap reduced harvest sizes and led to a decline in the production of most goods except substandard [[pig iron]] and steel. Furthermore, local authorities frequently exaggerated production numbers, hiding and intensifying the problem for several years.<ref name=\"umd\">{{cite web|last=Worden|first=Robert|title=A Country Study:China|url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/prc2.html|publisher=Library of Congress|year=1987|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180625/http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/prc2.html|archive-date=July 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=jin1>{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Qiu|title=The Culture of Power: Lin Biao and the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|pages=25\u201330}}</ref> In the meantime, chaos in the collectives, bad weather, and exports of food necessary to secure hard currency resulted in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. Food was in desperate shortage, and production fell dramatically.

Forced to take major responsibility, in 1959, Mao resigned as the [[President of the People's Republic of China]], China's ''de jure'' head of state, and was succeeded by [[Liu Shaoqi]]. In July, [[Lushan Conference|senior Party leaders convened]] at the scenic [[Mount Lu]] to discuss policy. At the conference, Marshal [[Peng Dehuai]], the Minister of Defence, criticized Great Leap policies in a private letter to Mao, writing that it was plagued by mismanagement and cautioning against elevating political dogma over the laws of economics.<ref name=umd/>\n\nDespite the moderate tone of Peng's letter, Mao took it as a personal attack against his leadership.<ref>Jin Qiu, [[#jin1|p. 55]]</ref> Following the Conference, Mao had Peng removed from his posts, and accused him of being a \"right-opportunist\". Peng was replaced by [[Lin Biao]], another revolutionary army general who became a more staunch Mao supporter later in his career. While the Lushan Conference served as a death knell for Peng, Mao's most vocal critic, it led to a shift of power to moderates led by Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, who took effective control of the economy following 1959.<ref name=umd/>\n\nBy the early 1960s, many of the Great Leap's economic policies were reversed by initiatives spearheaded by Liu, Deng, and [[Zhou Enlai]]. This moderate group of pragmatists were unenthusiastic about Mao's utopian visions. Owing to his loss of esteem within the party, Mao developed a decadent and eccentric lifestyle.<ref>Spence</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2020}} By 1962, while Zhou, Liu and Deng managed affairs of state and the economy, Mao had effectively withdrawn from economic decision-making, and focused much of his time on further contemplating his contributions to Marxist\u2013Leninist social theory, including the idea of \"continuous revolution\".<ref>Jin Qiu, Ch. 2</ref> This theory's ultimate aim was to set the stage for Mao to restore his brand of Communism and his personal prestige within the Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Sino-Soviet split and anti-revisionism===\n{{Main|Sino-Soviet split}}\nIn the early 1950s, the People's Republic of China and the [[Soviet Union]] were the two largest Communist states in the world. Although initially they had been mutually supportive, disagreements arose after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] and the rise of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to power in the Soviet Union. In 1956, Khrushchev [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin and his policies]] and began implementing post-Stalinist economic reforms. Mao and many other members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) opposed these changes, believing that they would have negative repercussions for the worldwide Marxist movement, among whom Stalin was still viewed as a hero.<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. pp. 04-07\">[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. pp. 4\u20137.</ref>\n\nMao believed that Khrushchev did not adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], but was instead a [[revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]], altering his policies from basic Marxist\u2013Leninist concepts, something Mao feared would allow capitalists to regain control of the country. Relations between the two governments soured. The USSR refused to support China's case for joining the United Nations and went back on its pledge to supply China with a [[nuclear weapon]].<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. pp. 04-07\"/>\n\nMao went on to publicly denounce revisionism in April 1960. Without pointing fingers at the Soviet Union, Mao criticized its ideological ally, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]. In turn, the USSR criticized China's ally the [[Party of Labour of Albania]].<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07\">[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 7.</ref> In 1963, the CCP began to denounce the Soviet Union openly, publishing nine polemics against its perceived revisionism, with one of them being titled ''On Khrushchev's Phoney Communism and Historical Lessons for the World'', in which Mao charged that Khrushchev was not only a revisionist but also increased the danger of capitalist restoration.<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07\"/> Khrushchev's downfall from an internal ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' in 1964 also contributed to Mao's fears of his own political vulnerability, mainly because of his declining prestige among his colleagues after the Great Leap Forward.<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07\"/>\n\n===Precursor===\n{{See also|Socialist Education Movement}}\n[[File:Luo Ruiqing.jpg|thumb|upright|The purge of General [[Luo Ruiqing]] solidified the Army's loyalty to Mao]]\nMao set the scene for the Cultural Revolution by \"cleansing\" powerful officials of questionable loyalty who were based in Beijing. His approach was less than transparent, achieving this purge through newspaper articles, internal meetings, and skillfully employing his network of political allies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn late 1959, historian and Beijing Deputy Mayor [[Wu Han (PRC)|Wu Han]] published a historical drama entitled ''[[Hai Rui Dismissed from Office]]''. In the play, an honest civil servant, [[Hai Rui]], is dismissed by a corrupt emperor. While Mao initially praised the play, in February 1965 he secretly commissioned his wife [[Jiang Qing]] and Shanghai propagandist [[Yao Wenyuan]] to publish an article criticizing it.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 15\u201318.</ref> Yao boldly alleged that ''Hai Rui'' was really an allegory attacking Mao; that is, Mao was the corrupt emperor, and Peng Dehuai was the honest civil servant.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 16.</ref>\n\nYao's article put Beijing Mayor [[Peng Zhen]]<ref>No relation to Peng Dehuai</ref> on the defensive. Peng, a powerful official and Wu Han's direct superior, was the head of the \"[[Five Man Group]]\", a committee commissioned by Mao to study the potential for a cultural revolution. Peng Zhen, aware that he would be implicated if Wu indeed wrote an \"anti-Mao\" play, wished to contain Yao's influence. Yao's article was initially only published in select local newspapers. Peng forbade its publication in the nationally distributed ''[[People's Daily]]'' and other major newspapers under his control, instructing them to write exclusively about \"academic discussion\", and not pay heed to Yao's petty politics.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 14\u201319.</ref>\n\nWhile the \"literary battle\" against Peng raged, Mao fired [[Yang Shangkun]]\u2014director of the Party's General Office, an organ that controlled internal communications\u2014on a series of unsubstantiated charges, installing in his stead staunch loyalist [[Wang Dongxing]], head of Mao's security detail.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. Chapter 1.</ref> Yang's dismissal likely emboldened Mao's allies to move against their factional rivals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In December, Defence Minister and Mao loyalist Lin Biao accused General [[Luo Ruiqing]], the chief of staff of the PLA, of being anti-Mao, alleging that Luo put too much emphasis on military training rather than Maoist \"political discussion\". Despite initial skepticism in the Politburo of Luo's guilt, Mao pushed for an 'investigation', after which Luo was denounced, dismissed, and forced to deliver a [[self-criticism]]. Stress from the events led Luo to attempt suicide.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006. pp. 20\u201327.</ref> Luo's removal secured the military command's loyalty to Mao.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 24.</ref>\n\n====February Outline====\nHaving ousted Luo and Yang, Mao returned his attention to Peng Zhen. On February 12, 1966, the \"Five Man Group\" issued a report known as the ''February Outline'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u6708\u63d0\u7eb2}}). The ''Outline'', sanctioned by the Party centre, defined ''Hai Rui'' as a constructive ''academic'' discussion and aimed to distance Peng Zhen formally from any ''political'' implications. However, Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan continued their denunciation of Wu Han and Peng Zhen. Meanwhile, Mao also sacked Propaganda Department director [[Lu Dingyi]], a Peng Zhen ally.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]] Chapter 1.</ref>\n\nLu's removal gave Maoists unrestricted access to the press. Mao would deliver his final blow to Peng Zhen at a high-profile Politburo meeting through loyalists [[Kang Sheng]] and [[Chen Boda]]. They accused Peng Zhen of opposing Mao, labeled the ''February Outline'' \"evidence of Peng Zhen's revisionism\", and grouped him with three other disgraced officials as part of the \"Peng-Luo-Lu-Yang Anti-Party Clique\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> On May 16, the Politburo formalized the decisions by releasing an official document condemning Peng Zhen and his \"anti-party allies\" in the strongest terms, disbanding his \"Five Man Group\", and replacing it with the Maoist [[Cultural Revolution Group]] (CRG).<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 27\u201335.</ref>\n\n==Early stage: mass movement==\n{{anchor|Beginning}}\n\n===May 16 notification===\nIn May 1966, an \"expanded session\" of the Politburo was called in Beijing. The conference, rather than being a joint discussion on policy (as per the usual norms of party operations), was mainly a campaign to mobilize the Politburo into endorsing Mao's political agenda. The conference was heavily laden with Maoist political rhetoric on class struggle and filled with meticulously-prepared 'indictments' on the recently ousted leaders such as Peng Zhen and Luo Ruiqing. One of these documents, released on May 16, was prepared with Mao's personal supervision and was particularly damning:<ref>[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Those representatives of the [[bourgeoisie]] who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists.

On May 25, under the guidance of Cao Yi'ou\u2014wife of Maoist henchman Kang Sheng\u2014[[Nie Yuanzi]], a philosophy lecturer at Peking University, authored a [[big-character poster]] ({{zh|s=\u5927\u5b57\u62a5|p=d\u00e0z\u00ecb\u00e0o}}) along with other leftists and posted it to a public bulletin. Nie attacked the university's party administration and its leader [[Lu Ping]].<ref name=mac57>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 56\u201358</ref> Nie insinuated that the university leadership, much like Peng Zhen, were trying to contain revolutionary fervour in a \"sinister\" attempt to oppose the party and advance revisionism.<ref name=mac57/>\n\nMao promptly endorsed Nie's ''dazibao'' as \"the first Marxist big-character poster in China.\" Nie's call-to-arms, now sealed with Mao's personal stamp of approval, had a lasting ripple effect across all educational institutions in China. Students everywhere began to revolt against their respective schools' party establishment. Classes were promptly cancelled in Beijing primary and secondary schools, followed by a decision on June 13 to expand the class suspension nationwide.<ref name=mac59>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 59\u201361</ref> By early June, throngs of young demonstrators lined the capital's major thoroughfares holding giant portraits of Mao, beating drums, and shouting slogans against his perceived enemies.<ref name=mac59/>\n\nWhen the dismissal of Peng Zhen and the municipal party leadership became public in early June, widespread confusion ensued. The public and foreign missions were kept in the dark on the reason for Peng Zhen's ousting.<ref name=mac62>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 62\u201364</ref> Even the top Party leadership was caught off guard by the sudden anti-establishment wave of protest and struggled with what to do next.<ref name=mac62/> After seeking Mao's guidance in Hangzhou, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping decided to send in \"work teams\" ({{zh|s=\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ec4|p=G\u014dngzu\u00f2 z\u01d4}})\u2014effectively 'ideological-guidance' squads of cadres\u2014to the city's schools and ''People's Daily'' to restore some semblance of order and re-establish party control.<ref name=mac62/>\n\nThe work teams were hastily dispatched and had a poor understanding of student sentiment. Unlike the political movement of the 1950s that squarely targeted intellectuals, the new movement was focused on established party cadres, many of whom were part of the work teams. As a result, the work teams came under increasing suspicion for being yet another group aimed at thwarting revolutionary fervour.<ref name=mac71>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 71</ref> The party leadership subsequently became divided over whether or not work teams should remain in place. Liu Shaoqi insisted on continuing work-team involvement and suppressing the movement's most radical elements, fearing that the movement would spin out of control.<ref name=mac75>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 75</ref>\n\n===\"Bombard the headquarters\"===\n{{multiple image\n| width = \n| header = Mao-Liu conflict\n| footer = In 1966, Mao broke with [[Liu Shaoqi]] (right), then serving as [[President of the People's Republic of China|titular head of state]], over the work-teams issue.

He subsequently returned to Beijing on a mission to criticize the party leadership for its handling of the work-teams issue. Mao accused the work teams of undermining the student movement, calling for their full withdrawal on July 24. Several days later a rally was held at the Great Hall of the People to announce the decision and set the new tone of the movement to university and high school teachers and students. At the rally, Party leaders told the masses assembled to 'not be afraid' and bravely take charge of the movement themselves, free of Party interference.<ref name=mac84>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 84</ref>\n\nThe work-teams issue marked a decisive defeat for President Liu Shaoqi politically; it also signaled that disagreement over how to handle the unfolding events of the Cultural Revolution would break Mao from the established party leadership irreversibly. On August 1, the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was hastily convened to advance Mao's now decidedly radical agenda. At the plenum, Mao showed outright disdain for Liu, repeatedly interrupting Liu as he delivered his opening day speech.<ref name=mac94>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 94</ref> For several days, Mao repeatedly insinuated that the Party's leadership had contravened his revolutionary vision. Mao's line of thinking received a lukewarm reception from the conference attendees. Sensing that the largely obstructive party elite was unwilling to embrace his revolutionary ideology on a full scale, Mao went on the offensive.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = Red Guards in Beijing\n| header_align = center\n| header_background =\n| image1 = 1967-11 1967\u5e74 \u5317\u4eac\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66\u5927\u5b57\u62a5\u6279\u8bc4\u5218\u5c11\u5947.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (160 * 1337 / 913) round 0}}\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = 1967-11 1967\u5e74 \u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u5927\u5b57\u62a5.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (160 * 1204 / 1005) round 0}}\n| caption2 =\n|image5 = 1968-02 1967\u5e74 \u5317\u4eac\u4e8c\u5341\u4e09\u4e2d\u590d\u8bfe\u95f9\u9769\u547d2.jpg\n| width5 = {{#expr: (150 * 1410 / 949) round 0}}\n| caption5 =\n|footer = ''From left:'' (1) Students at [[Beijing Normal University]] writing [[big-character posters]] denouncing [[Liu Shaoqi]]; (2) Big-characters posted on the campus of [[Peking University]]; (3) Red guards at No. 23 Middle School wave the ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book of the Quotations of Chairman Mao]]'' in a classroom revolution rally.

The personnel changes at the Plenum reflected a radical re-design of the party's hierarchy to suit this new ideological landscape. Liu and Deng kept their seats on the Politburo Standing Committee but were in fact sidelined from day-to-day party affairs.

At his birthday party on 26 December 1966, Mao declared an \"All-round civil war\" to resolve the standoff and asked the military forces of PLA to support \"the Left\", which was however not clearly defined. As the PLA commanders had developed close working relations with the party establishment, many military units worked instead to repress Mao's radicals. A total of 18.77 million firearms, 14,828 artillery pieces, 2,719,545 grenades ended up in civilian hands and used in the course of the fighting; in the cities of [[Chongqing]], [[Xiamen]], and [[Changchun]], tanks, armoured vehicles and even warships were deployed in combat.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Song |first1=Yongyi |title=Chronology of Mass Killings during the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976) |journal=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |date=2011 |url=https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/chronology-mass-killings-during-chinese-cultural-revolution-1966-1976 |issn=1961-9898 |access-date=April 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425062821/https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/chronology-mass-killings-during-chinese-cultural-revolution-1966-1976 |archive-date=April 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSpurred by the events in Beijing, \"power seizure\" (''duoquan'') groups formed all over the country and began expanding into factories and the countryside. In Shanghai, a young factory worker named [[Wang Hongwen]] organized a far-reaching revolutionary coalition, one that galvanized and displaced existing Red Guard groups. On January 3, 1967, with support from CRG heavyweights Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, the group of firebrand activists overthrew the Shanghai municipal government under [[Chen Pixian]] in what became known as the \"January Storm,\" and formed in its place the [[Shanghai People's Commune]].<ref>Yan, Jiaqi.  Gao, Gao.  [1996] (1996). Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution. {{ISBN|0-8248-1695-1}}.</ref>\n\nThe events in Shanghai were praised by Mao, who encouraged similar activities across China. Provincial governments and many parts of the state and party bureaucracy were affected, with power seizures taking place in a remarkably different fashion. For example, in Beijing, three separate revolutionary groups declared power seizures on the same day, while in Heilongjiang, the local party secretary [[Pan Fusheng]] managed to \"seize power\" from the party organization under his own leadership. Some leaders even wrote the CRG asking to be overthrown.<ref>MacFaquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 170\u2013172.</ref>\n\nIn Beijing, Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao made a target out of Vice-Premier [[Tao Zhu]]. The power-seizure movement was rearing its head in the military as well. In February, prominent generals [[Ye Jianying]] and [[Chen Yi (general)|Chen Yi]], as well as Vice-Premier [[Tan Zhenlin]], vocally asserted their opposition to the more extreme aspects of the movement, with some party elders insinuating that the CRG's real motives were to remove the revolutionary old guard. Mao, initially ambivalent, took to the Politburo floor on February 18 to denounce the opposition directly, giving a full-throated endorsement to the radicals' activities. This short-lived resistance was branded the \"[[February Countercurrent]]\"<ref>MacFaquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref> \u2013 effectively silencing critics of the movement within the party in the years to come.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Nianyi|title=\u5927\u52a8\u4e71\u7684\u5e74\u4ee3\uff1a1949\u20131989 \u5e74\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd [Great age of turmoil, a history of China 1949\u201389]|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=207\u2013209}}</ref>\n\nWhile revolutionaries dismantled ruling government and party organizations all over the country, because power seizures lacked centralized leadership, it was no longer clear who truly believed in Mao's revolutionary vision and who was opportunistically exploiting the chaos for their own gain. The formation of rival revolutionary groups, some manifestations of long-established local feuds, led to factional violence across the country. Tension grew between mass organizations and the military as well. In response, Lin Biao issued a directive for the army to aid the radicals. At the same time, the army took control of some provinces and locales that were deemed incapable of sorting out their own power transitions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Nianyi|title=\u5927\u52a8\u4e71\u7684\u5e74\u4ee3\uff1a1949\u20131989 \u5e74\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd [Great age of turmoil, a history of China 1949\u201389]|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=219\u2013221}}</ref>\n\nIn the central city of Wuhan, like in many other cities, two major revolutionary organizations emerged, one supporting the conservative establishment and the other opposed to it. The groups fought over the control of the city. [[Chen Zaidao]], the Army general in charge of the area, forcibly repressed the anti-establishment demonstrators who were backed by Mao. However, during the commotion, Mao himself flew to Wuhan with a large entourage of central officials in an attempt to secure military loyalty in the area. In response, local agitators kidnapped Mao's emissary [[Wang Li (politician)|Wang Li]] in what became known as the [[Wuhan Incident]]. Subsequently, Gen. Chen Zaidao was sent to Beijing and tried by Jiang Qing and the rest of the Cultural Revolution Group. Chen's resistance was the last major open display of opposition to the movement within the army.<ref>MacFaquhar and Schoenhals, p. 214.</ref>\n\nZhang Chunqiao, of the Gang of Four, himself admitted that the most crucial factor in the Cultural Revolution was not the Red Guards or the Cultural Revolution Group or the \"rebel worker\" organisations, but the side on which the PLA stood. When the PLA local garrison supported Mao's radicals, they were able to take over the local government successfully, but if they were not cooperative, the seizures of power were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacFarquhar |first1=Roderick |last2=Schoenhals |first2=Michael |title=Mao's Last Revolution |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674040410 |page=175 |edition=illustrated}}</ref> Violent clashes occurred in virtually all cities, according to one historian. In response to the Wuhan Incident, Mao and Jiang Qing began establishing a \"workers' armed self-defence force\", a \"revolutionary armed force of mass character\" to counter what he estimated as rightism in \"75% of the PLA officer corps\". Chongqing city, a center of arms manufacturing, was the site of ferocious armed clashes between the two factions, with one construction site in the city estimated to involve 10,000 combatants with tanks, mobile artillery, anti-aircraft guns and \"virtually every kind of conventional weapon\". Ten thousand artillery shells were fired in Chongqing during August 1967.<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacFarquhar |first1=Roderick |last2=Schoenhals |first2=Michael |title=Mao's Last Revolution |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674040410 |pages=214\u2013215, 217 |edition=illustrated}}</ref>\n\n===1968===\nIn the spring of 1968, a massive campaign began, aimed at enhancing Mao's reputation. On July 27, 1968, the Red Guards' power over the Army was officially ended, and the establishment government sent in units to besiege areas that remained untouched by the Guards. A year later, the Red Guard factions were dismantled entirely; Mao predicted that the chaos might begin running its own agenda and be tempted to turn against revolutionary ideology. Their purpose had been largely fulfilled; Mao and his radical colleagues had largely overturned establishment power.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn early October, Mao began a campaign to purge ruling officials. Many were sent to the countryside to work in reeducation camps. Liu was expelled from the Communist Party at the 12th Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1968, and labelled the \"headquarters of the bourgeoisie\", seemingly alluding to Mao's ''Bombard the Headquarters'' ''dazibao'' written two years earlier.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn December 1968, Mao began the \"[[Down to the Countryside Movement]]\". During this movement, which lasted for the next decade, young bourgeoisie living in cities were ordered to go to the countryside to experience working life. The term \"young intellectuals\" was used to refer to recently graduated college students. In the late 1970s, these students returned to their home cities. Many students who were previously Red Guard members supported the movement and Mao's vision. This movement was thus in part a means of moving Red Guards from the cities to the countryside, where they would cause less social disruption. It also served to spread revolutionary ideology across China geographically.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2PVYI4kAtQC&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Made In China: What Western Managers Can Learn from Trailblazing Chinese Entrepreneurs |author= Donald N.

The friction with the Soviet Union intensified after [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border clashes]] on the [[Ussuri River]] in March 1969 as the Chinese leadership prepared for all-out war.<ref name=m317>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 317.</ref> In October, senior leaders were evacuated from Beijing.<ref name=m317/> Amidst the tension, Lin Biao issued what appeared to be an executive order to prepare for war to the PLA's eleven Military Regions on October 18 without passing through Mao. This drew the ire of the Chairman, who saw it as evidence that his authority was prematurely usurped by his declared successor.<ref name=m317/>\n\nThe prospect of war elevated the PLA to greater prominence in domestic politics, increasing the stature of Lin Biao at the expense of Mao.<ref name=m321>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 321.</ref> There is some evidence to suggest that Mao was pushed to seek closer relations with the United States as a means to avoid PLA dominance in domestic affairs that would result from a military confrontation with the Soviet Union.<ref name=m321/> During his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|meeting]] with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972, Mao hinted that Lin had opposed seeking better relations with the U.S.<ref name=m322>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 322.</ref>\n\nAfter Lin was confirmed as Mao's successor, his supporters focused on the restoration of the position of State Chairman (President),<ref>This position, effectively China's [[head of state]], has been called \"President\" since 1982.</ref> which had been abolished by Mao after the purge of Liu Shaoqi. They hoped that by allowing Lin to ease into a constitutionally sanctioned role, whether Chairman or Vice-Chairman, Lin's succession would be institutionalized. The consensus within the Politburo was that Mao should assume the office with Lin becoming Vice-Chairman; but for unknown reasons, Mao had voiced his explicit opposition to the recreation of the position and his assuming it.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 327.</ref>\n\nFactional rivalries intensified at the Second Plenum of the Ninth Congress in Lushan held in late August 1970. Chen Boda, now aligned with the PLA faction loyal to Lin, galvanized support for the restoration of the office of President of China, despite Mao's wishes to the contrary.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 331.</ref> Moreover, Chen launched an assault on Zhang Chunqiao, a staunch Maoist who embodied the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, over the evaluation of Mao's legacy.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 328.</ref>\n\nThe attacks on Zhang found favour with many attendees at the Plenum and may have been construed by Mao as an indirect attack on the Cultural Revolution itself. Mao confronted Chen openly, denouncing him as a \"false Marxist\",<ref name=m332>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 332.</ref> and removed him from the Politburo Standing Committee. In addition to the purge of Chen, Mao asked Lin's principal generals to write self-criticisms on their political positions as a warning to Lin. Mao also inducted several of his supporters to the Central Military Commission and placed his loyalists in leadership roles of the [[Beijing Military Region]].<ref name=m332/>\n\n===Flight of Lin Biao===\n{{Main|Lin Biao incident}}\n[[File:Huayangpalace layers 2007 09.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Graffiti with Lin Biao's foreword to Mao's Little Red Book, Lin's name (lower right) was later scratched out, presumably after his death.]]\n\nBy 1971, diverging interests between the civilian and military wings of the leadership were apparent. Mao was troubled by the PLA's newfound prominence, and the purge of Chen Boda marked the beginning of a gradual scaling-down of the PLA's political involvement.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 353.</ref> According to official sources, sensing the reduction of Lin's power base and his declining health, Lin's supporters plotted to use the military power still at their disposal to oust Mao in a coup.<ref name=jin>{{cite book|last=Qiu|first=Jin|title=The Culture of Power: The Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Standard University Press|location=Stanford, California}}</ref>\n\nLin's son, [[Lin Liguo]], and other high-ranking military conspirators formed a coup apparatus in Shanghai and dubbed the plan to oust Mao by force ''[[Project 571 Outline|Outline for Project 571]]'', which sounds similar to \"Military Uprising\" in Mandarin. It is disputed whether Lin Biao was involved in this process. While official sources maintain that Lin planned and executed the alleged coup attempt, scholars such as Jin Qiu portray Lin as a passive character manipulated by members of his family and his supporters.<ref name=\"jin\"/> Qiu contests that Lin Biao was never personally involved in drafting the ''Outline'' and evidence suggests that Lin Liguo drafted the coup.<ref name=jin/>\n\nThe ''Outline'' allegedly consisted mainly of plans for aerial bombardments through use of the Air Force. It initially targeted Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, but would later involve Mao himself. If the plan succeeded, Lin would arrest his political rivals and assume power. Assassination attempts were alleged to have been made against Mao in Shanghai, from September 8 to September 10, 1971. Perceived risks to Mao's safety were allegedly relayed to the Chairman. One internal report alleged that Lin had planned to bomb a bridge that Mao was to cross to reach Beijing; Mao reportedly avoided this bridge after receiving intelligence reports.\n\nIn the official narrative, on September 13, 1971, Lin Biao, his wife [[Ye Qun]], Lin Liguo, and members of his staff attempted to flee to the Soviet Union ostensibly to seek asylum. En route, Lin's plane crashed in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], killing all on board. The plane apparently ran out of fuel en route to the Soviet Union. A Soviet team investigating the incident was not able to determine the cause of the crash but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude.\n\nThe official account has been put to question by foreign scholars, who have raised doubts over Lin's choice of the Soviet Union as a destination, the plane's route, the identity of the passengers, and whether or not a coup was actually taking place.<ref name=\"jin\"/><ref>Hannam and Lawrence 3\u20134</ref>\n\nOn September 13, the Politburo met in an emergency session to discuss Lin Biao. Only on September 30 was Lin's death confirmed in Beijing, which led to the cancellation of the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]] celebration events the following day. The Central Committee kept information under wraps, and news of Lin's death was not released to the public until two months following the incident.<ref name=\"jin\"/> Many of Lin's supporters sought refuge in Hong Kong; those who remained on the mainland were purged. The event caught the party leadership off guard: the concept that Lin could betray Mao de-legitimized a vast body of Cultural Revolution political rhetoric, as Lin was already enshrined into the Party Constitution as Mao's \"closest comrade-in-arms\" and \"successor\". For several months following the incident, the party information apparatus struggled to find a \"correct way\" to frame the incident for public consumption.<ref name=\"jin\"/>\n\n==\"Gang of Four\" and their downfall==\n{{Main|Gang of Four}}\n\n===Antagonism towards Zhou and Deng===\nMao became depressed and reclusive after the Lin Biao incident. With Lin gone, Mao had no ready answers for who would succeed him. Sensing a sudden loss of direction, Mao attempted reaching out to old comrades whom he had denounced in the past. Meanwhile, in September 1972, Mao transferred a thirty-eight-year-old cadre from Shanghai, Wang Hongwen, to Beijing and made him Vice-Chairman of the Party.<ref name=\"mac357\">MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 357.</ref> Wang, a former factory worker from a peasant background,<ref name=\"mac357\" /> was seemingly being groomed for succession.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 364.</ref> Jiang Qing's position also strengthened after Lin's flight. She held tremendous influence with the radical camp. With Mao's health on the decline, it was clear that Jiang Qing had political ambitions of her own. She allied herself with Wang Hongwen and propaganda specialists Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, forming a political clique later pejoratively dubbed as the \"[[Gang of Four]]\".{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBy 1973, round after round of political struggles had left many lower-level institutions, including local government, factories, and railways, short of competent staff needed to carry out basic functions.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 340.</ref> The country's economy had fallen into disarray, which necessitated the rehabilitation of purged lower-level officials. However, the party's core became heavily dominated by Cultural Revolution beneficiaries and leftist radicals, whose focus remained to uphold ideological purity over economic productivity. The economy remained the domain of Zhou Enlai mostly, one of the few moderates 'left standing'. Zhou attempted to restore a viable economy but was resented by the Gang of Four, who identified him as their primary political threat in post-Mao era succession.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn late 1973, to weaken Zhou's political position and to distance themselves from Lin's apparent betrayal, the \"[[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius]]\" campaign began under Jiang Qing's leadership.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 366.</ref> Its stated goals were to purge China of [[New Confucianism|new Confucianist]] thinking and denounce Lin Biao's actions as traitorous and regressive.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 372.</ref> Reminiscent of the first years of the Cultural Revolution, the battle was carried out through historical [[allegory]], and although Zhou Enlai's name was never mentioned during this campaign, the Premier's historical namesake, the [[Duke of Zhou]], was a frequent target.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nWith a fragile economy and Zhou falling ill to cancer, Deng Xiaoping returned to the political scene, taking up the post of Vice-Premier in March 1973, in the first of a series of promotions approved by Mao. After Zhou withdrew from active politics in January 1975, Deng was effectively put in charge of the government, party, and military, earning the additional titles of [[People's Liberation Army General Staff Department|PLA General Chief of Staff]], Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party, and Vice-Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] in a short time span.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 381.</ref>\n\nThe speed of Deng's rehabilitation took the radical camp, who saw themselves as Mao's 'rightful' political and ideological heirs, by surprise. Mao wanted to use Deng as a counterweight to the military faction in government to suppress any remaining influence of those formerly loyal to Lin Biao. In addition, Mao had also lost confidence in the ability of the Gang of Four to manage the economy and saw Deng as a competent and effective leader. Leaving the country in grinding poverty would do no favours to the positive legacy of the Cultural Revolution, which Mao worked hard to protect. Deng's return set the scene for a protracted factional struggle between the radical Gang of Four and moderates led by Zhou and Deng.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAt the time, Jiang Qing and associates held effective control of mass media and the party's propaganda network, while Zhou and Deng held control of most government organs. On some decisions, Mao sought to mitigate the Gang's influence, but on others, he acquiesced to their demands. The Gang of Four's heavy hand in political and media control did not prevent Deng from reinstating his economic policies. Deng emphatically opposed Party factionalism, and his policies aimed to promote unity as the first step to restoring economic productivity.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, Chapter 22</ref>\n\nMuch like the post-Great Leap restructuring led by Liu Shaoqi, Deng streamlined the railway system, steel production, and other vital areas of the economy. By late 1975 however, Mao saw that Deng's economic restructuring might negate the legacy of the Cultural Revolution, and launched a campaign to oppose \"rehabilitating the case for the rightists\", alluding to Deng as the country's foremost \"rightist\". Mao directed Deng to write self-criticisms in November 1975, a move lauded by the Gang of Four.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n===Death of Zhou Enlai===\nOn January 8, 1976, Zhou Enlai died of [[bladder cancer]]. On January 15 Deng Xiaoping delivered Zhou's official eulogy in a funeral attended by all of China's most senior leaders with the notable absence of Mao himself, who had grown increasingly critical of Zhou.<ref>Teiwes and Sun 217\u2013218</ref><ref>Spence 610</ref>  After Zhou's death, Mao selected neither a member of the Gang of Four nor Deng to become Premier, instead choosing the relatively unknown [[Hua Guofeng]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tprrCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT490&lpg=PT490&dq=after+Zhou's+death,+Mao+selected+neither+a+member+of+the+Gang+of+Four+nor+Deng+Xiaoping+to+become+Premier,+instead+choosing+the+relatively+unknown+Hua+Guofeng.#v=onepage&q=after%20Zhou's%20death,%20Mao%20selected%20neither%20a%20member%20of%20the%20Gang%20of%20Four%20nor%20Deng%20Xiaoping%20to%20become%20Premier,%20instead%20choosing%20the%20relatively%20unknown%20Hua%20Guofeng.&f=false|title=The Life/Death Rhythms of Capitalist Regimes - Debt Before Dishonour: Timetable of World Dominance 1400-2100|last=Slatyer|first=Will|date=2015-02-20|publisher=Partridge Publishing Singapore|isbn=9781482829617|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Gang of Four grew apprehensive that spontaneous, large-scale popular support for Zhou could turn the political tide against them. They acted through the media to impose a set of restrictions on overt public displays of mourning for Zhou. Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (seen as Zhou's ally), and the prohibition against public mourning led to a rise in popular discontent against Mao and the Gang of Four.<ref name=\"TS1\">Tiewes and Sun, 213</ref>\n\nOfficial attempts to enforce the mourning restrictions included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating Zhou's achievements.  On March 25, 1976, Shanghai's ''[[Wen Hui Bao]]'' published an article calling Zhou \"the capitalist roader inside the Party [who] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [Deng] regain his power\". These propaganda efforts at smearing Zhou's image, however, only strengthened public attachment to Zhou's memory.<ref>Teiwes and Sun 214</ref>\n\n===Tiananmen Incident===\n{{Main|Tiananmen Incident}}\nOn April 4, 1976, on the eve of China's annual [[Qingming Festival]], a traditional day of mourning, thousands of people gathered around the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] in Tiananmen Square to commemorate Zhou Enlai. The people of Beijing honored Zhou by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument.<ref name=\"Tiananmen1\" /> The most apparent purpose of this memorial was to eulogize Zhou, but the Gang of Four were also attacked for their actions against the Premier. A small number of slogans left at Tiananmen even attacked Mao himself, and his Cultural Revolution.<ref name=\"TS2\">Teiwes and Sun 218</ref>\n\nUp to two million people may have visited Tiananmen Square on April 4.<ref name=\"TS2\"/> All levels of society, from the most impoverished peasants to high-ranking PLA officers and the children of high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over the treatment of Zhou, revolt against the Cultural Revolution and apprehension for China's future. The event did not appear to have coordinated leadership but rather seemed to be a reflection of public sentiment.<ref>Teiwes and Sun 119\u2013220</ref>\n\nThe Central Committee, under the leadership of Jiang Qing, labelled the event 'counter-revolutionary' and cleared the square of memorial items shortly after midnight on April 6. Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a violent riot. Police cars were set on fire, and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square.<ref name=\"Tiananmen1\">Spence, 612</ref> Many of those arrested were later sentenced to prison work camps. Similar incidents occurred in other major cities. Jiang Qing and her allies pinned Deng Xiaoping as the incident's 'mastermind', and issued reports on official media to that effect. Deng was formally stripped of all positions \"inside and outside the Party\" on April 7. This marked Deng's second purge in ten years.<ref name=\"Tiananmen1\" />\n\n===Death of Mao and Arrest of the Gang of Four===\nOn September 9, 1976, Mao Zedong died. To Mao's supporters, his death symbolized the loss of the revolutionary foundation of Communist China.

Hua Guofeng chaired the Funeral Committee.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nShortly before dying, Mao had allegedly written the message \"With you in charge, I'm at ease\", to Hua. Hua used this message to substantiate his position as successor. Hua had been widely considered to be lacking in political skill and ambitions, and seemingly posed no serious threat to the Gang of Four in the race for succession. However, the Gang's radical ideas also clashed with influential elders and a large segment of party reformers. With army backing and the support of Marshal Ye Jianying, on October 6, the [[Central Security Bureau|Special Unit 8341]] had all members of the Gang of Four arrested in a bloodless coup.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 189334|title = China's Coup of October 1976|journal = Modern China|volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 263\u2013303|last1 = Forster|first1 = Keith|year = 1992|doi = 10.1177/009770049201800302}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n=== Transition period ===\nAlthough Hua Guofeng publicly denounced the Gang of Four in 1976, he continued to invoke Mao's name to justify Mao-era policies.  Hua spearheaded what became known as the [[Two Whatevers]],<ref name = \"Harding\"/> namely, \"Whatever policy originated from Chairman Mao, we must continue to support,\" and \"Whatever directions were given to us from Chairman Mao, we must continue to follow.\"  Like Deng, Hua wanted to reverse the damage of the Cultural Revolution; but unlike Deng, who wanted to propose new economic models for China, Hua intended to move the Chinese economic and political system towards Soviet-style planning of the early 1950s.<ref>Gilbert Rozman, ''The Chinese Debate about Soviet Socialism, 1978-1985'' (Princeton University Press, 2014), 63-68. {{ISBN|1400858593}}, 9781400858590; and Peter Ferdinand, \"China\", in ''Leadership and Succession in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China'', ed.

Sharpe, 1986), 194-204.\n</ref>\n\nIt became increasingly clear to Hua that, without Deng Xiaoping, it was difficult to continue daily affairs of state. On October 10, Deng Xiaoping personally wrote a letter to Hua asking to be transferred back to state and party affairs; party elders also called for Deng's return. With increasing pressure from all sides, Hua named Deng Vice-Premier in July 1977, and later promoted him to various other positions, effectively catapulting Deng to China's second-most powerful figure. In August, the Party's [[Eleventh Congress of the CPC|Eleventh Congress]] was held in Beijing, officially naming (in ranking order) Hua Guofeng, Ye Jianying, Deng Xiaoping, [[Li Xiannian]] and Wang Dongxing as new members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.nihaotw.com/zhuanti/16da/pages/ghls_11.htm Basic Knowledge about the Communist Party of China: The Eleventh Congress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624082411/http://www.nihaotw.com/zhuanti/16da/pages/ghls_11.htm |date=June 24, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== Deng Xiaoping seized power ===\n{{See also|Reforms and Opening Up}}\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Deng Xiaoping]] became the [[Paramount Leader of China|paramount leader of China]] in 1978.

Following this article, Hua began to shift his tone in support of Deng. On July 1, Deng publicized Mao's self-criticism report of 1962 regarding the failure of the Great Leap Forward. With an expanding power base, in September 1978, Deng began openly attacking Hua Guofeng's \"Two Whatevers\".<ref name=\"Harding\">Harding, Harry. [1987] (1987).

Because of the chaotic political environment, local governments lacked organization and stability, if they existed at all. Members of different factions often fought on the streets, and political assassinations, particularly in predominantly rural provinces, were frequent. The masses spontaneously involved themselves in factions and took part in open warfare against other factions. The ideology that drove these factions was vague and sometimes non-existent, with the struggle for local authority being the only motivation for mass involvement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn addition, millions of people in China were violently persecuted, especially in the [[struggle sessions]]. Those identified as spies, \"running dogs\", \"revisionists\", or coming from a suspect class (including those related to former landlords or rich peasants) were subject to beating, imprisonment, rape, torture, sustained and systematic harassment and abuse, seizure of property, denial of medical attention, and erasure of social identity. Intellectuals were also targeted; many survivors and observers suggest that almost anyone with skills over that of the average person was made the target of political \"struggle\" in some way. At least hundreds of thousands of people were murdered, starved, or worked to death. Millions more were forcibly displaced. Young people from the cities were forcibly moved to the countryside, where they were forced to abandon all forms of standard education in place of the propaganda teachings of the CPC.<ref name=\"Harding\" /> Some people were not able to stand the torture and, losing hope for the future, committed suicide. Researchers have pointed out that at least 100-200 thousand people committed suicides during early Cultural Revolution.<ref name=\":7\" /> One of the most famous cases of attempted suicide due to political persecution involved Deng Xiaoping's son, [[Deng Pufang]], who jumped (or was thrown) from a four-story building after being \"interrogated\" by Red Guards. Instead of dying, he developed [[paraplegia]].

For example, the slogan \"to rebel is justified\" (\u9020\u53cd\u6709\u7406, z\u00e0of\u01cen y\u01d2ul\u01d0) became a unitary theme.<ref name=huang/>\n\nHuang asserts that political slogans were ubiquitous in every aspect of people's lives, being printed onto everyday items such as bus tickets, cigarette packets, and mirror tables.<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 14.</ref> Workers were supposed to \"grasp revolution and promote productions\", while peasants were supposed to raise more pigs because \"more pigs means more manure, and more manure means more grain\". Even a casual remark by Mao, \"Sweet potato tastes good; I like it\" became a slogan everywhere in the countryside.<ref name=huang/>\n\nPolitical slogans of the time had three sources: Mao, official Party media such as ''People's Daily'', and the Red Guards.<ref name=huang/>  Mao often offered vague, yet powerful directives that led to the factionalization of the Red Guards.<ref>Chan</ref> These directives could be interpreted to suit personal interests, in turn aiding factions' goals in being most loyal to Mao Zedong.

(1981) \"Ethics and rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution,\" Studies in Chinese Terminology, 19, p. 108</ref> This changed during the Cultural Revolution. Since Mao wanted an army of bellicose people in his crusade, rhetoric at the time was reduced to militant and violent vocabulary.<ref name=huang/> These slogans were a powerful and effective method of \"thought reform\", mobilizing millions in a concerted attack upon the subjective world, \"while at the same time reforming their objective world.\"<ref name=huang/><ref name=\"Dittmer and Chen 1981, p. 12\">Dittmer and Chen 1981, p. 12.</ref>\n\nDittmer and Chen argue that the emphasis on politics made language a very effective form of propaganda, but \"also transformed it into a jargon of stereotypes\u2014pompous, repetitive, and boring\".<ref name=\"Dittmer and Chen 1981, p. 12\"/> To distance itself from the era, Deng Xiaoping's government cut back heavily on the use of political slogans.

It was felt that pushing minority groups too hard would compromise China's border defences. This was especially important as minorities make up a large percentage of the population that live along China's borders. In the late 1960s, China experienced a period of strained relations with some of its neighbours, notably with the Soviet Union and India.<ref>See [[Sino-Soviet split]] and [[Sino-Indian relations]]</ref>  Many of the Cultural Revolution's goals in minority areas were simply too unreasonable to be implemented.

On June 27, 1981, the Central Committee adopted the \"''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China'',\" an official assessment of major historical events since 1949.<ref name=\"marxists.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/cpc/history/01.htm|title=Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China (Chinese Communism Subject Archive)|publisher=|access-date=December 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213182749/http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/cpc/history/01.htm|archive-date=December 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Resolution frankly noted Mao's leadership role in the movement, stating that \"chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'Cultural Revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong.\" It diluted blame on Mao himself by asserting that the movement was \"manipulated by the counterrevolutionary groups of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing,\" who caused its worst excesses. The Resolution affirmed that the Cultural Revolution \"brought serious disaster and turmoil to the Communist Party and the Chinese people.\"<ref name=\"marxists.org\"/>\n\nThe official view aimed to separate Mao's actions during the Cultural Revolution from his \"heroic\" revolutionary activities during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It also separated Mao's personal mistakes from the correctness of the theory that he created, going as far as to rationalize that the Cultural Revolution contravened the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought, which remains an official guiding ideology of the Party.

Following the Cultural Revolution, a new genre of literature known as \"[[Scar literature]]\" (''Shanghen Wenxue'') emerged, being encouraged by the post-Mao government. Written mainly by educated youth such as Liu Xinhua, [[Zhang Xianliang]], and [[Liu Xinwu]], scar literature depicted the Revolution from a negative viewpoint, using their own perspectives and experiences as a basis.<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 32.</ref>\n\nAfter the suppression of the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]], both liberals and conservatives within the Party accused each other of excesses that they claimed were reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. [[Li Peng]], who promoted the use of military force, cited that the student movement had taken inspiration from the grassroots populism of the Cultural Revolution and that if it is left unchecked, would eventually lead to a similar degree of mass chaos.<ref>''AsiaNews.it''</ref> Zhao Ziyang, who was sympathetic to the protestors, later accused his political opponents of illegally removing him from office by using \"Cultural Revolution-style\" tactics, including \"reversing black and white, exaggerating personal offenses, taking quotes out of context, issuing slander and lies... inundating the newspapers with critical articles making me out to be an enemy, and casual disregard for my personal freedoms.\"<ref>Zhao 43\u201344</ref>\n\n====Alternative opinions====\nAlthough the Chinese Communist Party officially condemns the Cultural Revolution, there are many Chinese people who hold more positive views of it, particularly amongst the working class, who benefited most from its policies.<ref name=\"Gao 2008\">[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]].</ref> Since Deng's ascendancy to power, the government has arrested and imprisoned figures who have taken a strongly pro-Cultural Revolution stance. For instance, in 1985, a young shoe-factory worker put up a poster on a factory wall in [[Xianyang]], Shaanxi, which declared that \"The Cultural Revolution was Good\" and led to achievements such as \"the building of the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], the creation of hybrid rice crops and the rise of people's consciousness.\" The factory worker was eventually sentenced to ten years in prison, where he died soon after \"without any apparent cause.\"<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nOne of the student leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, [[Shen Tong]], author of ''Almost a Revolution'', has a positive view of some aspects of the Cultural Revolution. According to Shen, the trigger for the famous Tiananmen hunger-strikes of 1989 was a big-character poster (''dazibao''), a form of public political discussion that gained prominence during the Cultural Revolution. Shen remarked that the congregation of students from across the country to Beijing on trains and the hospitality they received from residents was reminiscent of the experiences of Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=\"Tang\"/>\n\nSince the advent of the Internet, people inside and outside China have argued online that the Cultural Revolution had many beneficial qualities for China that have been denied by both the post-Mao Chinese Communist Party and Western media. Some hold that the Cultural Revolution 'cleansed' China from superstitions, religious dogma, and outdated traditions in a 'modernist transformation' that later made Deng's economic reforms possible. These sentiments increased following the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] in 1999 when a segment of the population began to associate anti-Maoist viewpoints with the United States.<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 117.</ref>\n\n[[Chinese New Left|Contemporary Maoists]] have also become more organized in the internet era, partially as a response to criticisms of Mao from academics and scholars. One Maoist website managed to collect thousands of signatures demanding punishment for those who publicly criticize Mao. Along with the call for legal action, this movement demands the establishment of agencies similar to Cultural Revolution-era \"neighborhood committees\", in which \"citizens\" would report anti-Maoists to local public security bureaus. Maoist rhetoric and mass mobilization methods were resurgent in the interior city of Chongqing during the political career of [[Bo Xilai]].<ref>Ewing</ref>\n\n====Contemporary China====\nPublic discussion of the Cultural Revolution is still limited in China. The Chinese government continues to prohibit news organizations from mentioning details of the Cultural Revolution, and online discussions and books about the topic are subject to official scrutiny. Textbooks on the subject continue to abide by the \"official view\" (see above) of the events.

The government is apprehensive that academic probing and popular discussions will lead to ideological conflict and increase social instability. It may threaten the foundations of Communist rule. The focus of the Chinese government on maintaining political and social stability has been a top priority since the Tiananmen crackdown on reformers on June 4, 1989, and the current government has no interest in re-evaluating any issue that might lead to a split in the Chinese leadership, or which might polarize the Party on ideological grounds.<ref name=\"Fong\" /> In 2018, it was reported that one practice typical of the Cultural Revolution, ''Fengqiao'', or public criticism of supposed counter-revolutionaries by a whole village, was experiencing an unexpected revival: but it is unclear whether this was an isolated incident or a sign of a renewed interest for cultural styles typical of the Revolution.<ref>Jiang Tao, [https://bitterwinter.org/fengqiao-a-maoist-revival-to-attack-religion/ Fengqiao \u2013 a Maoist Revival to Attack Religion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229031748/https://bitterwinter.org/fengqiao-a-maoist-revival-to-attack-religion/ |date=December 29, 2018 }}, ''[[Bitter Winter]]'', December 27, 2018, accessed December 28, 2018.</ref>\n\n===Outside mainland China===\nIn Hong Kong, a [[Hong Kong 1967 riots|pro-Communist anti-colonial strike]] inspired by the Cultural Revolution was launched in 1967.

These debates have changed over the decades as researchers explored new sources.\n\nIn the 1960s, while many scholars dismissed Mao's initiatives as ideological and destructive, others sympathized with his concern for equality, opposition to bureaucratism and corruption, and individual selfishness. They saw Maoism as a populist insistence on mass participation, mass criticism and the right to rebel, and a determination to wipe out a new ruling class.  By the 1980s, however, Harvard University sociologist [[Andrew Walder]] wrote that the \u201cpublic opinion in the field had changed markedly\u201d. Most in the field now \u201cseem convinced that that the Cultural Revolution was a human disaster, even a historical crime, something on the order of Hitler\u2019s holocaust and Stalin\u2019s great terror\u201d. Walder argued that the failures of the Cultural Revolution did not come from poor implementation, bureaucratic sabotage, disloyalty, or lingering class antagonisms. If things turned out differently from what Mao expected, Walder concluded, this was \u201cprobably due to the fact that Mao did not know what he wanted, or that he did know what he was doing, or both.... the outcomes are what one should have expected, given the Maoist doctrine and aims.\u201d\n<ref>{{cite journal |last =Walder|first =Andrew |authorlink = |title =Actually Existing Maoism |journal =Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs |volume =18 |issue = 18|pages =155\u2013166 |date =1987|url = |jstor = 2158588|issn = |doi = 10.2307/2158588|accessdate = |ref= harv}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the debate continues because the movement contains many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven by a series of grassroots popular uprisings against the Communist establishment. Virtually all English-language books published since the 1980s paint a negative picture of the movement. Historian Anne F. Thurston wrote that it \"led to loss of culture, and of spiritual values; loss of hope and ideals; loss of time, truth and of life\".<ref>[[#Thu84-85|Thurston 1984\u201385]]. pp. 605\u201306.</ref> Barnouin and Yu summarized the Cultural Revolution as \"a political movement that produced unprecedented social divisions, mass mobilization, hysteria, upheavals, arbitrary cruelty, torture, killings, and even civil war\", calling Mao \"one of the most tyrannical despots of the twentieth century\".<ref>Barnouin and Yu 217</ref>\nSome scholars challenge the mainstream portrayals of the Cultural Revolution and offer to understand it in a more positive light. Mobo Gao, writing in ''The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution'',<ref name=about>Pluto Press, [http://www.plutobooks.com/about.asp About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101121337/http://www.plutobooks.com/about.asp |date=January 1, 2011 }}</ref> argues that the movement benefited millions of Chinese citizens, particularly agricultural and industrial workers,<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 1.</ref> and sees it as egalitarian and genuinely populist, citing continued Maoist nostalgia in China today as remnants of its positive legacy.<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 3.</ref> Some draw a distinction between intention and performance. {{sfnb|Walder|1987| p = 159}} While Mao's leadership was pivotal at the beginning of the movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed, it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision.<ref name=jinqiu>{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Qiu|title=The Culture of Power the Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Standard University Press|location=Palo Alto, California|isbn=0-8047-3529-8|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a much more decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning many 'local revolutions' which differed in their nature and goals.<ref name=jinqiu/>\n\nAcademic interest has also focused on the movement's relationship with Mao's personality. Mao envisioned himself as a wartime guerrilla leader, which made him wary of the bureaucratic nature of peacetime governance. With the Cultural Revolution Mao was simply \"returning to form\", once again taking on the role of a guerrilla leader fighting against an institutionalized party bureaucracy. Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals, paint the movement as neither a ''bona fide'' war over ideological purity ''nor'' a mere power struggle to remove Mao's political rivals.<ref name=rmms>{{cite book|last=MacFaquhar|first=Roderick|title=Mao's Last Revolution|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-02332-3|first2=Michael|last2=Schoenhals|url=https://archive.org/details/maoslastrevoluti00macf}}</ref> While Mao's personal motivations were undoubtedly pivotal to the Cultural Revolution, they reasoned that other complex factors contributed to the way events unfolded. These include China's relationship with the global Communist movement, geopolitical concerns, the [[Sino-Soviet Split|ideological rift between China and the Soviet Union]], Khrushchev's ouster, and the failures of the Great Leap Forward.<ref name=rmms/> They conclude that the movement was, at least in part, a legacy project to cement Mao's place in history, aimed to boost his prestige while he was alive ''and'' preserve the invulnerability of his ideas after his death.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, ''Mao's Last Revolution'', Introduction</ref>\n\nThe mass hysteria surrounding the Cultural Revolution was also unprecedented.

Launched by [[Mao Zedong]], the [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] (CPC), its stated goal was to preserve [[Ideology of the Communist Party of China|Chinese Communism]] by purging remnants of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Chinese culture|traditional]] elements from [[Culture of the People's Republic of China|Chinese society]], and to re-impose Mao Zedong Thought (known outside China as [[Maoism]]) as the [[dominant ideology]] in the CPC. The Revolution marked Mao's return to the central position of power in China after a period of less radical leadership to recover from the failures of the [[Great Leap Forward]], which led to approximately 30 million deaths in the [[Great Chinese Famine]] only five years earlier. \n\nMao launched the movement in May 1966 with the help of [[Cultural Revolution Group]], soon calling on young people to [[Bombard the Headquarters|\"bombard the headquarters\"]] and proclaiming that \"to rebel is justified\". To eliminate his rivals within the CPC and in schools, factories, and government institutions, Mao charged that [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] elements had infiltrated the government and society and that they aimed to restore capitalism. He insisted that [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]] be removed through violent [[Class conflict|class struggle]]. China's youth responded by forming [[Red Guard]] groups around the country, which split into rival factions and often involved in [[Violent Struggle|violent struggles]] ({{Lang-zh|t=\u6b66\u9b25|s=\u6b66\u6597|p=w\u01d4d\u00f2u}}). Urban workers likewise split into factions, and the [[People's Liberation Army]] had to be sent to restore order. [[Lin Biao]], head of the PLA, was written into the constitution as Mao's successor; Lin had compiled the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]], a selection of Mao's sayings, that became a sacred text for [[Mao Zedong's cult of personality|Mao's personality cult]]. Mao declared the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1969, but the Revolution's active phase lasted until at least 1971, when Lin Biao fled and [[Lin Biao incident|died in a plane crash]], accused of [[Project 571|a botched coup]] against Mao.

On the other hand, senior officials, most notably [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Peng Dehuai]] and [[He Long]], were purged or exiled. Millions were accused of being members of the [[Five Black Categories]] and were persecuted, suffering [[public humiliation]], imprisonment, torture, hard labor, seizure of property, and sometimes execution or harassment into suicide. Intellectuals were considered the \"[[Stinking Old Ninth]]\" and were widely persecuted; notable scholars and scientists such as [[Lao She]], [[Fu Lei]], [[Yao Tongbin]] and [[Zhao Jiuzhang]] were killed or committed suicides.

In this spirit, Mao launched the [[Great Leap Forward]], established [[People's Commune]]s in the countryside, and began the [[mass mobilization]] of the people into [[collectives]]. Many communities were assigned production of a single commodity\u2014steel. Mao vowed to increase agricultural production to twice 1957 levels.<ref name=\"Tang\"/>\n[[File:Iron smelting in 1958 China, from- Backyardfurnace5 (cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|People in the countryside working at night to produce steel during the [[Great Leap Forward]]]]\nThe Great Leap was an economic failure. Many uneducated farmers were pulled from farming and harvesting and instead instructed to produce steel on a massive scale, partially relying on [[backyard furnace]]s to achieve the production targets set by local cadres. The steel produced was of low quality and mostly useless. The Great Leap reduced harvest sizes and led to a decline in the production of most goods except substandard [[pig iron]] and steel. Furthermore, local authorities frequently exaggerated production numbers, hiding and intensifying the problem for several years.<ref name=\"umd\">{{cite web|last=Worden|first=Robert|title=A Country Study:China|url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/prc2.html|publisher=Library of Congress|year=1987|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180625/http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/prc2.html|archive-date=July 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=jin1>{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Qiu|title=The Culture of Power: Lin Biao and the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|pages=25\u201330}}</ref> In the meantime, chaos in the collectives, bad weather, and exports of food necessary to secure hard currency resulted in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. Food was in desperate shortage, and production fell dramatically. The famine caused the deaths of more than 30 million people, particularly in the more impoverished inland regions.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm#Mao|title=Historical Atlas of the 20th century|publisher=|access-date=October 23, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301071401/http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm#Mao|archive-date=March 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Leap's failure reduced Mao's prestige within the Party. Forced to take major responsibility, in 1959, Mao resigned as the [[President of the People's Republic of China]], China's ''de jure'' head of state, and was succeeded by [[Liu Shaoqi]]. In July, [[Lushan Conference|senior Party leaders convened]] at the scenic [[Mount Lu]] to discuss policy. At the conference, Marshal [[Peng Dehuai]], the Minister of Defence, criticized Great Leap policies in a private letter to Mao, writing that it was plagued by mismanagement and cautioning against elevating political dogma over the laws of economics.<ref name=umd/>\n\nDespite the moderate tone of Peng's letter, Mao took it as a personal attack against his leadership.<ref>Jin Qiu, [[#jin1|p. 55]]</ref> Following the Conference, Mao had Peng removed from his posts, and accused him of being a \"right-opportunist\". Peng was replaced by [[Lin Biao]], another revolutionary army general who became a more staunch Mao supporter later in his career. While the Lushan Conference served as a death knell for Peng, Mao's most vocal critic, it led to a shift of power to moderates led by Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, who took effective control of the economy following 1959.<ref name=umd/>\n\nBy the early 1960s, many of the Great Leap's economic policies were reversed by initiatives spearheaded by Liu, Deng, and [[Zhou Enlai]]. This moderate group of pragmatists were unenthusiastic about Mao's utopian visions. Owing to his loss of esteem within the party, Mao developed a decadent and eccentric lifestyle.<ref>Spence</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2020}} By 1962, while Zhou, Liu and Deng managed affairs of state and the economy, Mao had effectively withdrawn from economic decision-making, and focused much of his time on further contemplating his contributions to Marxist\u2013Leninist social theory, including the idea of \"continuous revolution\".<ref>Jin Qiu, Ch. 2</ref> This theory's ultimate aim was to set the stage for Mao to restore his brand of Communism and his personal prestige within the Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Sino-Soviet split and anti-revisionism===\n{{Main|Sino-Soviet split}}\nIn the early 1950s, the People's Republic of China and the [[Soviet Union]] were the two largest Communist states in the world. Although initially they had been mutually supportive, disagreements arose after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] and the rise of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to power in the Soviet Union. In 1956, Khrushchev [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin and his policies]] and began implementing post-Stalinist economic reforms. Mao and many other members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) opposed these changes, believing that they would have negative repercussions for the worldwide Marxist movement, among whom Stalin was still viewed as a hero.<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. pp. 04-07\">[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. pp. 4\u20137.</ref>\n\nMao believed that Khrushchev did not adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], but was instead a [[revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]], altering his policies from basic Marxist\u2013Leninist concepts, something Mao feared would allow capitalists to regain control of the country. Relations between the two governments soured. The USSR refused to support China's case for joining the United Nations and went back on its pledge to supply China with a [[nuclear weapon]].<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. pp. 04-07\"/>\n\nMao went on to publicly denounce revisionism in April 1960. Without pointing fingers at the Soviet Union, Mao criticized its ideological ally, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]. In turn, the USSR criticized China's ally the [[Party of Labour of Albania]].<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07\">[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 7.</ref> In 1963, the CCP began to denounce the Soviet Union openly, publishing nine polemics against its perceived revisionism, with one of them being titled ''On Khrushchev's Phoney Communism and Historical Lessons for the World'', in which Mao charged that Khrushchev was not only a revisionist but also increased the danger of capitalist restoration.<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07\"/> Khrushchev's downfall from an internal ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' in 1964 also contributed to Mao's fears of his own political vulnerability, mainly because of his declining prestige among his colleagues after the Great Leap Forward.<ref name=\"MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07\"/>\n\n===Precursor===\n{{See also|Socialist Education Movement}}\n[[File:Luo Ruiqing.jpg|thumb|upright|The purge of General [[Luo Ruiqing]] solidified the Army's loyalty to Mao]]\nMao set the scene for the Cultural Revolution by \"cleansing\" powerful officials of questionable loyalty who were based in Beijing. His approach was less than transparent, achieving this purge through newspaper articles, internal meetings, and skillfully employing his network of political allies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn late 1959, historian and Beijing Deputy Mayor [[Wu Han (PRC)|Wu Han]] published a historical drama entitled ''[[Hai Rui Dismissed from Office]]''. In the play, an honest civil servant, [[Hai Rui]], is dismissed by a corrupt emperor. While Mao initially praised the play, in February 1965 he secretly commissioned his wife [[Jiang Qing]] and Shanghai propagandist [[Yao Wenyuan]] to publish an article criticizing it.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 15\u201318.</ref> Yao boldly alleged that ''Hai Rui'' was really an allegory attacking Mao; that is, Mao was the corrupt emperor, and Peng Dehuai was the honest civil servant.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 16.</ref>\n\nYao's article put Beijing Mayor [[Peng Zhen]]<ref>No relation to Peng Dehuai</ref> on the defensive. Peng, a powerful official and Wu Han's direct superior, was the head of the \"[[Five Man Group]]\", a committee commissioned by Mao to study the potential for a cultural revolution. Peng Zhen, aware that he would be implicated if Wu indeed wrote an \"anti-Mao\" play, wished to contain Yao's influence. Yao's article was initially only published in select local newspapers. Peng forbade its publication in the nationally distributed ''[[People's Daily]]'' and other major newspapers under his control, instructing them to write exclusively about \"academic discussion\", and not pay heed to Yao's petty politics.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 14\u201319.</ref>\n\nWhile the \"literary battle\" against Peng raged, Mao fired [[Yang Shangkun]]\u2014director of the Party's General Office, an organ that controlled internal communications\u2014on a series of unsubstantiated charges, installing in his stead staunch loyalist [[Wang Dongxing]], head of Mao's security detail.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. Chapter 1.</ref> Yang's dismissal likely emboldened Mao's allies to move against their factional rivals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In December, Defence Minister and Mao loyalist Lin Biao accused General [[Luo Ruiqing]], the chief of staff of the PLA, of being anti-Mao, alleging that Luo put too much emphasis on military training rather than Maoist \"political discussion\". Despite initial skepticism in the Politburo of Luo's guilt, Mao pushed for an 'investigation', after which Luo was denounced, dismissed, and forced to deliver a [[self-criticism]]. Stress from the events led Luo to attempt suicide.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006. pp. 20\u201327.</ref> Luo's removal secured the military command's loyalty to Mao.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 24.</ref>\n\n====February Outline====\nHaving ousted Luo and Yang, Mao returned his attention to Peng Zhen. On February 12, 1966, the \"Five Man Group\" issued a report known as the ''February Outline'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u6708\u63d0\u7eb2}}). The ''Outline'', sanctioned by the Party centre, defined ''Hai Rui'' as a constructive ''academic'' discussion and aimed to distance Peng Zhen formally from any ''political'' implications. However, Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan continued their denunciation of Wu Han and Peng Zhen. Meanwhile, Mao also sacked Propaganda Department director [[Lu Dingyi]], a Peng Zhen ally.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]] Chapter 1.</ref>\n\nLu's removal gave Maoists unrestricted access to the press. Mao would deliver his final blow to Peng Zhen at a high-profile Politburo meeting through loyalists [[Kang Sheng]] and [[Chen Boda]]. They accused Peng Zhen of opposing Mao, labeled the ''February Outline'' \"evidence of Peng Zhen's revisionism\", and grouped him with three other disgraced officials as part of the \"Peng-Luo-Lu-Yang Anti-Party Clique\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> On May 16, the Politburo formalized the decisions by releasing an official document condemning Peng Zhen and his \"anti-party allies\" in the strongest terms, disbanding his \"Five Man Group\", and replacing it with the Maoist [[Cultural Revolution Group]] (CRG).<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 27\u201335.</ref>\n\n==Early stage: mass movement==\n{{anchor|Beginning}}\n\n===May 16 notification===\nIn May 1966, an \"expanded session\" of the Politburo was called in Beijing. The conference, rather than being a joint discussion on policy (as per the usual norms of party operations), was mainly a campaign to mobilize the Politburo into endorsing Mao's political agenda. The conference was heavily laden with Maoist political rhetoric on class struggle and filled with meticulously-prepared 'indictments' on the recently ousted leaders such as Peng Zhen and Luo Ruiqing. One of these documents, released on May 16, was prepared with Mao's personal supervision and was particularly damning:<ref>[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Those representatives of the [[bourgeoisie]] who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists.

Some of them we have already seen through; others we have not.

On May 25, under the guidance of Cao Yi'ou\u2014wife of Maoist henchman Kang Sheng\u2014[[Nie Yuanzi]], a philosophy lecturer at Peking University, authored a [[big-character poster]] ({{zh|s=\u5927\u5b57\u62a5|p=d\u00e0z\u00ecb\u00e0o}}) along with other leftists and posted it to a public bulletin. Nie attacked the university's party administration and its leader [[Lu Ping]].<ref name=mac57>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 56\u201358</ref> Nie insinuated that the university leadership, much like Peng Zhen, were trying to contain revolutionary fervour in a \"sinister\" attempt to oppose the party and advance revisionism.<ref name=mac57/>\n\nMao promptly endorsed Nie's ''dazibao'' as \"the first Marxist big-character poster in China.\" Nie's call-to-arms, now sealed with Mao's personal stamp of approval, had a lasting ripple effect across all educational institutions in China. Students everywhere began to revolt against their respective schools' party establishment. Classes were promptly cancelled in Beijing primary and secondary schools, followed by a decision on June 13 to expand the class suspension nationwide.<ref name=mac59>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 59\u201361</ref> By early June, throngs of young demonstrators lined the capital's major thoroughfares holding giant portraits of Mao, beating drums, and shouting slogans against his perceived enemies.<ref name=mac59/>\n\nWhen the dismissal of Peng Zhen and the municipal party leadership became public in early June, widespread confusion ensued. The public and foreign missions were kept in the dark on the reason for Peng Zhen's ousting.<ref name=mac62>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 62\u201364</ref> Even the top Party leadership was caught off guard by the sudden anti-establishment wave of protest and struggled with what to do next.<ref name=mac62/> After seeking Mao's guidance in Hangzhou, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping decided to send in \"work teams\" ({{zh|s=\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ec4|p=G\u014dngzu\u00f2 z\u01d4}})\u2014effectively 'ideological-guidance' squads of cadres\u2014to the city's schools and ''People's Daily'' to restore some semblance of order and re-establish party control.<ref name=mac62/>\n\nThe work teams were hastily dispatched and had a poor understanding of student sentiment. Unlike the political movement of the 1950s that squarely targeted intellectuals, the new movement was focused on established party cadres, many of whom were part of the work teams. As a result, the work teams came under increasing suspicion for being yet another group aimed at thwarting revolutionary fervour.<ref name=mac71>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 71</ref> The party leadership subsequently became divided over whether or not work teams should remain in place. Liu Shaoqi insisted on continuing work-team involvement and suppressing the movement's most radical elements, fearing that the movement would spin out of control.<ref name=mac75>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 75</ref>\n\n===\"Bombard the headquarters\"===\n{{multiple image\n| width = \n| header = Mao-Liu conflict\n| footer = In 1966, Mao broke with [[Liu Shaoqi]] (right), then serving as [[President of the People's Republic of China|titular head of state]], over the work-teams issue.

He subsequently returned to Beijing on a mission to criticize the party leadership for its handling of the work-teams issue. Mao accused the work teams of undermining the student movement, calling for their full withdrawal on July 24. Several days later a rally was held at the Great Hall of the People to announce the decision and set the new tone of the movement to university and high school teachers and students. At the rally, Party leaders told the masses assembled to 'not be afraid' and bravely take charge of the movement themselves, free of Party interference.<ref name=mac84>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 84</ref>\n\nThe work-teams issue marked a decisive defeat for President Liu Shaoqi politically; it also signaled that disagreement over how to handle the unfolding events of the Cultural Revolution would break Mao from the established party leadership irreversibly. On August 1, the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was hastily convened to advance Mao's now decidedly radical agenda. At the plenum, Mao showed outright disdain for Liu, repeatedly interrupting Liu as he delivered his opening day speech.<ref name=mac94>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 94</ref> For several days, Mao repeatedly insinuated that the Party's leadership had contravened his revolutionary vision. Mao's line of thinking received a lukewarm reception from the conference attendees. Sensing that the largely obstructive party elite was unwilling to embrace his revolutionary ideology on a full scale, Mao went on the offensive.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = Red Guards in Beijing\n| header_align = center\n| header_background =\n| image1 = 1967-11 1967\u5e74 \u5317\u4eac\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66\u5927\u5b57\u62a5\u6279\u8bc4\u5218\u5c11\u5947.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (160 * 1337 / 913) round 0}}\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = 1967-11 1967\u5e74 \u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u5927\u5b57\u62a5.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (160 * 1204 / 1005) round 0}}\n| caption2 =\n|image5 = 1968-02 1967\u5e74 \u5317\u4eac\u4e8c\u5341\u4e09\u4e2d\u590d\u8bfe\u95f9\u9769\u547d2.jpg\n| width5 = {{#expr: (150 * 1410 / 949) round 0}}\n| caption5 =\n|footer = ''From left:'' (1) Students at [[Beijing Normal University]] writing [[big-character posters]] denouncing [[Liu Shaoqi]]; (2) Big-characters posted on the campus of [[Peking University]]; (3) Red guards at No. 23 Middle School wave the ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book of the Quotations of Chairman Mao]]'' in a classroom revolution rally.

The personnel changes at the Plenum reflected a radical re-design of the party's hierarchy to suit this new ideological landscape. Liu and Deng kept their seats on the Politburo Standing Committee but were in fact sidelined from day-to-day party affairs.

At his birthday party on 26 December 1966, Mao declared an \"All-round civil war\" to resolve the standoff and asked the military forces of PLA to support \"the Left\", which was however not clearly defined. As the PLA commanders had developed close working relations with the party establishment, many military units worked instead to repress Mao's radicals. A total of 18.77 million firearms, 14,828 artillery pieces, 2,719,545 grenades ended up in civilian hands and used in the course of the fighting; in the cities of [[Chongqing]], [[Xiamen]], and [[Changchun]], tanks, armoured vehicles and even warships were deployed in combat.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Song |first1=Yongyi |title=Chronology of Mass Killings during the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976) |journal=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |date=2011 |url=https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/chronology-mass-killings-during-chinese-cultural-revolution-1966-1976 |issn=1961-9898 |access-date=April 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425062821/https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/chronology-mass-killings-during-chinese-cultural-revolution-1966-1976 |archive-date=April 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSpurred by the events in Beijing, \"power seizure\" (''duoquan'') groups formed all over the country and began expanding into factories and the countryside. In Shanghai, a young factory worker named [[Wang Hongwen]] organized a far-reaching revolutionary coalition, one that galvanized and displaced existing Red Guard groups. On January 3, 1967, with support from CRG heavyweights Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, the group of firebrand activists overthrew the Shanghai municipal government under [[Chen Pixian]] in what became known as the \"January Storm,\" and formed in its place the [[Shanghai People's Commune]].<ref>Yan, Jiaqi.  Gao, Gao.  [1996] (1996). Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution. {{ISBN|0-8248-1695-1}}.</ref>\n\nThe events in Shanghai were praised by Mao, who encouraged similar activities across China. Provincial governments and many parts of the state and party bureaucracy were affected, with power seizures taking place in a remarkably different fashion. For example, in Beijing, three separate revolutionary groups declared power seizures on the same day, while in Heilongjiang, the local party secretary [[Pan Fusheng]] managed to \"seize power\" from the party organization under his own leadership. Some leaders even wrote the CRG asking to be overthrown.<ref>MacFaquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 170\u2013172.</ref>\n\nIn Beijing, Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao made a target out of Vice-Premier [[Tao Zhu]]. The power-seizure movement was rearing its head in the military as well. In February, prominent generals [[Ye Jianying]] and [[Chen Yi (general)|Chen Yi]], as well as Vice-Premier [[Tan Zhenlin]], vocally asserted their opposition to the more extreme aspects of the movement, with some party elders insinuating that the CRG's real motives were to remove the revolutionary old guard. Mao, initially ambivalent, took to the Politburo floor on February 18 to denounce the opposition directly, giving a full-throated endorsement to the radicals' activities. This short-lived resistance was branded the \"[[February Countercurrent]]\"<ref>MacFaquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref> \u2013 effectively silencing critics of the movement within the party in the years to come.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Nianyi|title=\u5927\u52a8\u4e71\u7684\u5e74\u4ee3\uff1a1949\u20131989 \u5e74\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd [Great age of turmoil, a history of China 1949\u201389]|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=207\u2013209}}</ref>\n\nWhile revolutionaries dismantled ruling government and party organizations all over the country, because power seizures lacked centralized leadership, it was no longer clear who truly believed in Mao's revolutionary vision and who was opportunistically exploiting the chaos for their own gain. The formation of rival revolutionary groups, some manifestations of long-established local feuds, led to factional violence across the country. Tension grew between mass organizations and the military as well. In response, Lin Biao issued a directive for the army to aid the radicals. At the same time, the army took control of some provinces and locales that were deemed incapable of sorting out their own power transitions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Nianyi|title=\u5927\u52a8\u4e71\u7684\u5e74\u4ee3\uff1a1949\u20131989 \u5e74\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd [Great age of turmoil, a history of China 1949\u201389]|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=219\u2013221}}</ref>\n\nIn the central city of Wuhan, like in many other cities, two major revolutionary organizations emerged, one supporting the conservative establishment and the other opposed to it. The groups fought over the control of the city. [[Chen Zaidao]], the Army general in charge of the area, forcibly repressed the anti-establishment demonstrators who were backed by Mao. However, during the commotion, Mao himself flew to Wuhan with a large entourage of central officials in an attempt to secure military loyalty in the area. In response, local agitators kidnapped Mao's emissary [[Wang Li (politician)|Wang Li]] in what became known as the [[Wuhan Incident]]. Subsequently, Gen. Chen Zaidao was sent to Beijing and tried by Jiang Qing and the rest of the Cultural Revolution Group. Chen's resistance was the last major open display of opposition to the movement within the army.<ref>MacFaquhar and Schoenhals, p. 214.</ref>\n\nZhang Chunqiao, of the Gang of Four, himself admitted that the most crucial factor in the Cultural Revolution was not the Red Guards or the Cultural Revolution Group or the \"rebel worker\" organisations, but the side on which the PLA stood. When the PLA local garrison supported Mao's radicals, they were able to take over the local government successfully, but if they were not cooperative, the seizures of power were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacFarquhar |first1=Roderick |last2=Schoenhals |first2=Michael |title=Mao's Last Revolution |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674040410 |page=175 |edition=illustrated}}</ref> Violent clashes occurred in virtually all cities, according to one historian. In response to the Wuhan Incident, Mao and Jiang Qing began establishing a \"workers' armed self-defence force\", a \"revolutionary armed force of mass character\" to counter what he estimated as rightism in \"75% of the PLA officer corps\". Chongqing city, a center of arms manufacturing, was the site of ferocious armed clashes between the two factions, with one construction site in the city estimated to involve 10,000 combatants with tanks, mobile artillery, anti-aircraft guns and \"virtually every kind of conventional weapon\". Ten thousand artillery shells were fired in Chongqing during August 1967.<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacFarquhar |first1=Roderick |last2=Schoenhals |first2=Michael |title=Mao's Last Revolution |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674040410 |pages=214\u2013215, 217 |edition=illustrated}}</ref>\n\n===1968===\nIn the spring of 1968, a massive campaign began, aimed at enhancing Mao's reputation. On July 27, 1968, the Red Guards' power over the Army was officially ended, and the establishment government sent in units to besiege areas that remained untouched by the Guards. A year later, the Red Guard factions were dismantled entirely; Mao predicted that the chaos might begin running its own agenda and be tempted to turn against revolutionary ideology. Their purpose had been largely fulfilled; Mao and his radical colleagues had largely overturned establishment power.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn early October, Mao began a campaign to purge ruling officials. Many were sent to the countryside to work in reeducation camps. Liu was expelled from the Communist Party at the 12th Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1968, and labelled the \"headquarters of the bourgeoisie\", seemingly alluding to Mao's ''Bombard the Headquarters'' ''dazibao'' written two years earlier.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn December 1968, Mao began the \"[[Down to the Countryside Movement]]\". During this movement, which lasted for the next decade, young bourgeoisie living in cities were ordered to go to the countryside to experience working life. The term \"young intellectuals\" was used to refer to recently graduated college students. In the late 1970s, these students returned to their home cities. Many students who were previously Red Guard members supported the movement and Mao's vision. This movement was thus in part a means of moving Red Guards from the cities to the countryside, where they would cause less social disruption. It also served to spread revolutionary ideology across China geographically.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2PVYI4kAtQC&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Made In China: What Western Managers Can Learn from Trailblazing Chinese Entrepreneurs |author= Donald N.

There followed several months of \"mango fever\", as the fruit became a focus of a \"boundless loyalty\" campaign for Chairman Mao. More replica mangoes were created, and the replicas were sent on tour around Beijing and elsewhere in China. Many revolutionary committees visited the mangoes in Beijing from outlying provinces; approximately half a million people greeted the replicas when they arrived in [[Chengdu]]. Badges and wall posters featuring the mangoes and Mao were produced in the millions.<ref name=\"Walder2015\" /> The fruit was shared among all institutions that had been a part of the propaganda team, and large processions were organised in support of the ''zhengui lipin'' (\"precious gift\"), as the mangoes were known as.<ref name=\"Leese2011\">{{citation|author=Daniel Leese|title=Mao Cult: Rhetoric and Ritual in China's Cultural Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqjviY6aFloC&pg=PA221|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49811-1|pages=221\u201322|access-date=September 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228032642/https://books.google.com/books?id=iqjviY6aFloC&pg=PA221|archive-date=February 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> One dentist in a small town, Dr. Han, saw the mango and said it was nothing special and looked just like sweet potato; he was put on trial for malicious slander, found guilty, paraded publicly throughout the town, and then executed with one shot to the head.<ref name=Moore2013 /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/the-mao-mango-cult-of-1968/|title=The Mao Mango Cult of 1968 and the Rise of China's Working Class|last=Marks|first=Ben|website=Collectors Weekly|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105161815/https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/the-mao-mango-cult-of-1968/|archive-date=November 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that Mao used the mangoes to express support for the workers who would go to whatever lengths necessary to end the factional fighting among students, and a \"prime example of Mao's strategy of symbolic support\".<ref name=\"Schrift2001\" /> Even up until early 1969, participants of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Beijing would return with mass-produced mango [[facsimiles]] and still gain media attention in the provinces.<ref name=\"Leese2011\" />\n\n==Lin Biao phase==\n\n===Transition of power===\nThe [[Ninth Congress of the CPC|Ninth Party Congress]] was held on April 1969 and served as a means to \"revitalize\" the party with fresh thinking and new cadres after much of the old guard had been destroyed in the struggles of preceding years.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 285.</ref> The institutional framework of the Party established two decades earlier had broken down almost entirely: delegates for this Congress were effectively selected by Revolutionary Committees rather than through election by party members.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 288.</ref> Representation of the military increased by a large margin from the previous Congress (28% of the delegates were PLA members), and the election of more PLA members to the new Central Committee reflected this increase.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 292.</ref> Many military officers elevated to senior positions were loyal to PLA Marshal Lin Biao, opening a new factional divide between the military and civilian leadership.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals.

Lastly, the Congress elected a new Politburo with Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, Chen Boda, Zhou Enlai, and Kang Sheng as the members of the new [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]]. Lin, Chen, and Kang were all beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution.

Many far-flung provinces remained volatile as the political situation in Beijing stabilized. Factional struggles, many of which were violent, continued at the local level despite the declaration that the Ninth Congress marked a temporary \"victory\" for the Cultural Revolution.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 316.</ref> Furthermore, despite Mao's efforts to put on a show of unity at the Congress, the factional divide between Lin Biao's PLA camp and the Jiang Qing\u2013led radical camp was intensifying. Indeed, a personal dislike of Jiang Qing drew many civilian leaders, including prominent theoretician Chen Boda, closer to Lin Biao.<ref>Qiu, p. 115</ref>\n\nBetween 1966 and 1968, China was isolated internationally, having declared its enmity towards both the Soviet Union and the United States. The friction with the Soviet Union intensified after [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border clashes]] on the [[Ussuri River]] in March 1969 as the Chinese leadership prepared for all-out war.<ref name=m317>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 317.</ref> In October, senior leaders were evacuated from Beijing.<ref name=m317/> Amidst the tension, Lin Biao issued what appeared to be an executive order to prepare for war to the PLA's eleven Military Regions on October 18 without passing through Mao. This drew the ire of the Chairman, who saw it as evidence that his authority was prematurely usurped by his declared successor.<ref name=m317/>\n\nThe prospect of war elevated the PLA to greater prominence in domestic politics, increasing the stature of Lin Biao at the expense of Mao.<ref name=m321>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 321.</ref> There is some evidence to suggest that Mao was pushed to seek closer relations with the United States as a means to avoid PLA dominance in domestic affairs that would result from a military confrontation with the Soviet Union.<ref name=m321/> During his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|meeting]] with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972, Mao hinted that Lin had opposed seeking better relations with the U.S.<ref name=m322>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 322.</ref>\n\nAfter Lin was confirmed as Mao's successor, his supporters focused on the restoration of the position of State Chairman (President),<ref>This position, effectively China's [[head of state]], has been called \"President\" since 1982.</ref> which had been abolished by Mao after the purge of Liu Shaoqi. They hoped that by allowing Lin to ease into a constitutionally sanctioned role, whether Chairman or Vice-Chairman, Lin's succession would be institutionalized. The consensus within the Politburo was that Mao should assume the office with Lin becoming Vice-Chairman; but for unknown reasons, Mao had voiced his explicit opposition to the recreation of the position and his assuming it.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 327.</ref>\n\nFactional rivalries intensified at the Second Plenum of the Ninth Congress in Lushan held in late August 1970. Chen Boda, now aligned with the PLA faction loyal to Lin, galvanized support for the restoration of the office of President of China, despite Mao's wishes to the contrary.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 331.</ref> Moreover, Chen launched an assault on Zhang Chunqiao, a staunch Maoist who embodied the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, over the evaluation of Mao's legacy.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 328.</ref>\n\nThe attacks on Zhang found favour with many attendees at the Plenum and may have been construed by Mao as an indirect attack on the Cultural Revolution itself. Mao confronted Chen openly, denouncing him as a \"false Marxist\",<ref name=m332>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 332.</ref> and removed him from the Politburo Standing Committee. In addition to the purge of Chen, Mao asked Lin's principal generals to write self-criticisms on their political positions as a warning to Lin. Mao also inducted several of his supporters to the Central Military Commission and placed his loyalists in leadership roles of the [[Beijing Military Region]].<ref name=m332/>\n\n===Flight of Lin Biao===\n{{Main|Lin Biao incident}}\n[[File:Huayangpalace layers 2007 09.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Graffiti with Lin Biao's foreword to Mao's Little Red Book, Lin's name (lower right) was later scratched out, presumably after his death.]]\n\nBy 1971, diverging interests between the civilian and military wings of the leadership were apparent. Mao was troubled by the PLA's newfound prominence, and the purge of Chen Boda marked the beginning of a gradual scaling-down of the PLA's political involvement.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 353.</ref> According to official sources, sensing the reduction of Lin's power base and his declining health, Lin's supporters plotted to use the military power still at their disposal to oust Mao in a coup.<ref name=jin>{{cite book|last=Qiu|first=Jin|title=The Culture of Power: The Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Standard University Press|location=Stanford, California}}</ref>\n\nLin's son, [[Lin Liguo]], and other high-ranking military conspirators formed a coup apparatus in Shanghai and dubbed the plan to oust Mao by force ''[[Project 571 Outline|Outline for Project 571]]'', which sounds similar to \"Military Uprising\" in Mandarin. It is disputed whether Lin Biao was involved in this process. While official sources maintain that Lin planned and executed the alleged coup attempt, scholars such as Jin Qiu portray Lin as a passive character manipulated by members of his family and his supporters.<ref name=\"jin\"/> Qiu contests that Lin Biao was never personally involved in drafting the ''Outline'' and evidence suggests that Lin Liguo drafted the coup.<ref name=jin/>\n\nThe ''Outline'' allegedly consisted mainly of plans for aerial bombardments through use of the Air Force. It initially targeted Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, but would later involve Mao himself. If the plan succeeded, Lin would arrest his political rivals and assume power. Assassination attempts were alleged to have been made against Mao in Shanghai, from September 8 to September 10, 1971. Perceived risks to Mao's safety were allegedly relayed to the Chairman. One internal report alleged that Lin had planned to bomb a bridge that Mao was to cross to reach Beijing; Mao reportedly avoided this bridge after receiving intelligence reports.\n\nIn the official narrative, on September 13, 1971, Lin Biao, his wife [[Ye Qun]], Lin Liguo, and members of his staff attempted to flee to the Soviet Union ostensibly to seek asylum. En route, Lin's plane crashed in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], killing all on board. The plane apparently ran out of fuel en route to the Soviet Union. A Soviet team investigating the incident was not able to determine the cause of the crash but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude.\n\nThe official account has been put to question by foreign scholars, who have raised doubts over Lin's choice of the Soviet Union as a destination, the plane's route, the identity of the passengers, and whether or not a coup was actually taking place.<ref name=\"jin\"/><ref>Hannam and Lawrence 3\u20134</ref>\n\nOn September 13, the Politburo met in an emergency session to discuss Lin Biao. Only on September 30 was Lin's death confirmed in Beijing, which led to the cancellation of the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]] celebration events the following day. The Central Committee kept information under wraps, and news of Lin's death was not released to the public until two months following the incident.<ref name=\"jin\"/> Many of Lin's supporters sought refuge in Hong Kong; those who remained on the mainland were purged. The event caught the party leadership off guard: the concept that Lin could betray Mao de-legitimized a vast body of Cultural Revolution political rhetoric, as Lin was already enshrined into the Party Constitution as Mao's \"closest comrade-in-arms\" and \"successor\". For several months following the incident, the party information apparatus struggled to find a \"correct way\" to frame the incident for public consumption.<ref name=\"jin\"/>\n\n==\"Gang of Four\" and their downfall==\n{{Main|Gang of Four}}\n\n===Antagonism towards Zhou and Deng===\nMao became depressed and reclusive after the Lin Biao incident. With Lin gone, Mao had no ready answers for who would succeed him. Sensing a sudden loss of direction, Mao attempted reaching out to old comrades whom he had denounced in the past. Meanwhile, in September 1972, Mao transferred a thirty-eight-year-old cadre from Shanghai, Wang Hongwen, to Beijing and made him Vice-Chairman of the Party.<ref name=\"mac357\">MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 357.</ref> Wang, a former factory worker from a peasant background,<ref name=\"mac357\" /> was seemingly being groomed for succession.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 364.</ref> Jiang Qing's position also strengthened after Lin's flight. She held tremendous influence with the radical camp. With Mao's health on the decline, it was clear that Jiang Qing had political ambitions of her own. She allied herself with Wang Hongwen and propaganda specialists Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, forming a political clique later pejoratively dubbed as the \"[[Gang of Four]]\".{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBy 1973, round after round of political struggles had left many lower-level institutions, including local government, factories, and railways, short of competent staff needed to carry out basic functions.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 340.</ref> The country's economy had fallen into disarray, which necessitated the rehabilitation of purged lower-level officials. However, the party's core became heavily dominated by Cultural Revolution beneficiaries and leftist radicals, whose focus remained to uphold ideological purity over economic productivity. The economy remained the domain of Zhou Enlai mostly, one of the few moderates 'left standing'. Zhou attempted to restore a viable economy but was resented by the Gang of Four, who identified him as their primary political threat in post-Mao era succession.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn late 1973, to weaken Zhou's political position and to distance themselves from Lin's apparent betrayal, the \"[[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius]]\" campaign began under Jiang Qing's leadership.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 366.</ref> Its stated goals were to purge China of [[New Confucianism|new Confucianist]] thinking and denounce Lin Biao's actions as traitorous and regressive.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 372.</ref> Reminiscent of the first years of the Cultural Revolution, the battle was carried out through historical [[allegory]], and although Zhou Enlai's name was never mentioned during this campaign, the Premier's historical namesake, the [[Duke of Zhou]], was a frequent target.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nWith a fragile economy and Zhou falling ill to cancer, Deng Xiaoping returned to the political scene, taking up the post of Vice-Premier in March 1973, in the first of a series of promotions approved by Mao. After Zhou withdrew from active politics in January 1975, Deng was effectively put in charge of the government, party, and military, earning the additional titles of [[People's Liberation Army General Staff Department|PLA General Chief of Staff]], Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party, and Vice-Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] in a short time span.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 381.</ref>\n\nThe speed of Deng's rehabilitation took the radical camp, who saw themselves as Mao's 'rightful' political and ideological heirs, by surprise. Mao wanted to use Deng as a counterweight to the military faction in government to suppress any remaining influence of those formerly loyal to Lin Biao. In addition, Mao had also lost confidence in the ability of the Gang of Four to manage the economy and saw Deng as a competent and effective leader. Leaving the country in grinding poverty would do no favours to the positive legacy of the Cultural Revolution, which Mao worked hard to protect. Deng's return set the scene for a protracted factional struggle between the radical Gang of Four and moderates led by Zhou and Deng.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAt the time, Jiang Qing and associates held effective control of mass media and the party's propaganda network, while Zhou and Deng held control of most government organs. On some decisions, Mao sought to mitigate the Gang's influence, but on others, he acquiesced to their demands. The Gang of Four's heavy hand in political and media control did not prevent Deng from reinstating his economic policies. Deng emphatically opposed Party factionalism, and his policies aimed to promote unity as the first step to restoring economic productivity.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, Chapter 22</ref>\n\nMuch like the post-Great Leap restructuring led by Liu Shaoqi, Deng streamlined the railway system, steel production, and other vital areas of the economy. By late 1975 however, Mao saw that Deng's economic restructuring might negate the legacy of the Cultural Revolution, and launched a campaign to oppose \"rehabilitating the case for the rightists\", alluding to Deng as the country's foremost \"rightist\". Mao directed Deng to write self-criticisms in November 1975, a move lauded by the Gang of Four.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n===Death of Zhou Enlai===\nOn January 8, 1976, Zhou Enlai died of [[bladder cancer]]. On January 15 Deng Xiaoping delivered Zhou's official eulogy in a funeral attended by all of China's most senior leaders with the notable absence of Mao himself, who had grown increasingly critical of Zhou.<ref>Teiwes and Sun 217\u2013218</ref><ref>Spence 610</ref>  After Zhou's death, Mao selected neither a member of the Gang of Four nor Deng to become Premier, instead choosing the relatively unknown [[Hua Guofeng]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tprrCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT490&lpg=PT490&dq=after+Zhou's+death,+Mao+selected+neither+a+member+of+the+Gang+of+Four+nor+Deng+Xiaoping+to+become+Premier,+instead+choosing+the+relatively+unknown+Hua+Guofeng.#v=onepage&q=after%20Zhou's%20death,%20Mao%20selected%20neither%20a%20member%20of%20the%20Gang%20of%20Four%20nor%20Deng%20Xiaoping%20to%20become%20Premier,%20instead%20choosing%20the%20relatively%20unknown%20Hua%20Guofeng.&f=false|title=The Life/Death Rhythms of Capitalist Regimes - Debt Before Dishonour: Timetable of World Dominance 1400-2100|last=Slatyer|first=Will|date=2015-02-20|publisher=Partridge Publishing Singapore|isbn=9781482829617|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Gang of Four grew apprehensive that spontaneous, large-scale popular support for Zhou could turn the political tide against them. They acted through the media to impose a set of restrictions on overt public displays of mourning for Zhou. Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (seen as Zhou's ally), and the prohibition against public mourning led to a rise in popular discontent against Mao and the Gang of Four.<ref name=\"TS1\">Tiewes and Sun, 213</ref>\n\nOfficial attempts to enforce the mourning restrictions included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating Zhou's achievements.  On March 25, 1976, Shanghai's ''[[Wen Hui Bao]]'' published an article calling Zhou \"the capitalist roader inside the Party [who] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [Deng] regain his power\". These propaganda efforts at smearing Zhou's image, however, only strengthened public attachment to Zhou's memory.<ref>Teiwes and Sun 214</ref>\n\n===Tiananmen Incident===\n{{Main|Tiananmen Incident}}\nOn April 4, 1976, on the eve of China's annual [[Qingming Festival]], a traditional day of mourning, thousands of people gathered around the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] in Tiananmen Square to commemorate Zhou Enlai. The people of Beijing honored Zhou by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument.<ref name=\"Tiananmen1\" /> The most apparent purpose of this memorial was to eulogize Zhou, but the Gang of Four were also attacked for their actions against the Premier. A small number of slogans left at Tiananmen even attacked Mao himself, and his Cultural Revolution.<ref name=\"TS2\">Teiwes and Sun 218</ref>\n\nUp to two million people may have visited Tiananmen Square on April 4.<ref name=\"TS2\"/> All levels of society, from the most impoverished peasants to high-ranking PLA officers and the children of high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over the treatment of Zhou, revolt against the Cultural Revolution and apprehension for China's future. The event did not appear to have coordinated leadership but rather seemed to be a reflection of public sentiment.<ref>Teiwes and Sun 119\u2013220</ref>\n\nThe Central Committee, under the leadership of Jiang Qing, labelled the event 'counter-revolutionary' and cleared the square of memorial items shortly after midnight on April 6. Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a violent riot. Police cars were set on fire, and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square.<ref name=\"Tiananmen1\">Spence, 612</ref> Many of those arrested were later sentenced to prison work camps. Similar incidents occurred in other major cities. Jiang Qing and her allies pinned Deng Xiaoping as the incident's 'mastermind', and issued reports on official media to that effect. Deng was formally stripped of all positions \"inside and outside the Party\" on April 7. This marked Deng's second purge in ten years.<ref name=\"Tiananmen1\" />\n\n===Death of Mao and Arrest of the Gang of Four===\nOn September 9, 1976, Mao Zedong died. To Mao's supporters, his death symbolized the loss of the revolutionary foundation of Communist China.

Hua Guofeng chaired the Funeral Committee.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nShortly before dying, Mao had allegedly written the message \"With you in charge, I'm at ease\", to Hua. Hua used this message to substantiate his position as successor. Hua had been widely considered to be lacking in political skill and ambitions, and seemingly posed no serious threat to the Gang of Four in the race for succession. However, the Gang's radical ideas also clashed with influential elders and a large segment of party reformers. With army backing and the support of Marshal Ye Jianying, on October 6, the [[Central Security Bureau|Special Unit 8341]] had all members of the Gang of Four arrested in a bloodless coup.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 189334|title = China's Coup of October 1976|journal = Modern China|volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 263\u2013303|last1 = Forster|first1 = Keith|year = 1992|doi = 10.1177/009770049201800302}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n=== Transition period ===\nAlthough Hua Guofeng publicly denounced the Gang of Four in 1976, he continued to invoke Mao's name to justify Mao-era policies.  Hua spearheaded what became known as the [[Two Whatevers]],<ref name = \"Harding\"/> namely, \"Whatever policy originated from Chairman Mao, we must continue to support,\" and \"Whatever directions were given to us from Chairman Mao, we must continue to follow.\"  Like Deng, Hua wanted to reverse the damage of the Cultural Revolution; but unlike Deng, who wanted to propose new economic models for China, Hua intended to move the Chinese economic and political system towards Soviet-style planning of the early 1950s.<ref>Gilbert Rozman, ''The Chinese Debate about Soviet Socialism, 1978-1985'' (Princeton University Press, 2014), 63-68. {{ISBN|1400858593}}, 9781400858590; and Peter Ferdinand, \"China\", in ''Leadership and Succession in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China'', ed.

On October 10, Deng Xiaoping personally wrote a letter to Hua asking to be transferred back to state and party affairs; party elders also called for Deng's return. With increasing pressure from all sides, Hua named Deng Vice-Premier in July 1977, and later promoted him to various other positions, effectively catapulting Deng to China's second-most powerful figure. In August, the Party's [[Eleventh Congress of the CPC|Eleventh Congress]] was held in Beijing, officially naming (in ranking order) Hua Guofeng, Ye Jianying, Deng Xiaoping, [[Li Xiannian]] and Wang Dongxing as new members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.nihaotw.com/zhuanti/16da/pages/ghls_11.htm Basic Knowledge about the Communist Party of China: The Eleventh Congress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624082411/http://www.nihaotw.com/zhuanti/16da/pages/ghls_11.htm |date=June 24, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== Deng Xiaoping seized power ===\n{{See also|Reforms and Opening Up}}\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Deng Xiaoping]] became the [[Paramount Leader of China|paramount leader of China]] in 1978.

Hu published an article in the ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]'', making clever use of Mao's quotations while lauding Deng's ideas. Following this article, Hua began to shift his tone in support of Deng. On July 1, Deng publicized Mao's self-criticism report of 1962 regarding the failure of the Great Leap Forward. With an expanding power base, in September 1978, Deng began openly attacking Hua Guofeng's \"Two Whatevers\".<ref name=\"Harding\">Harding, Harry. [1987] (1987).

Those identified as spies, \"running dogs\", \"revisionists\", or coming from a suspect class (including those related to former landlords or rich peasants) were subject to beating, imprisonment, rape, torture, sustained and systematic harassment and abuse, seizure of property, denial of medical attention, and erasure of social identity. Intellectuals were also targeted; many survivors and observers suggest that almost anyone with skills over that of the average person was made the target of political \"struggle\" in some way. At least hundreds of thousands of people were murdered, starved, or worked to death. Millions more were forcibly displaced. Young people from the cities were forcibly moved to the countryside, where they were forced to abandon all forms of standard education in place of the propaganda teachings of the CPC.<ref name=\"Harding\" /> Some people were not able to stand the torture and, losing hope for the future, committed suicide. Researchers have pointed out that at least 100-200 thousand people committed suicides during early Cultural Revolution.<ref name=\":7\" /> One of the most famous cases of attempted suicide due to political persecution involved Deng Xiaoping's son, [[Deng Pufang]], who jumped (or was thrown) from a four-story building after being \"interrogated\" by Red Guards.

In the trial of the so-called Gang of Four, a Chinese court stated that 729,511 people had been persecuted, of whom 34,800 were said to have died.<ref>James P.

For example, the slogan \"to rebel is justified\" (\u9020\u53cd\u6709\u7406, z\u00e0of\u01cen y\u01d2ul\u01d0) became a unitary theme.<ref name=huang/>\n\nHuang asserts that political slogans were ubiquitous in every aspect of people's lives, being printed onto everyday items such as bus tickets, cigarette packets, and mirror tables.<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 14.</ref> Workers were supposed to \"grasp revolution and promote productions\", while peasants were supposed to raise more pigs because \"more pigs means more manure, and more manure means more grain\".

It was felt that pushing minority groups too hard would compromise China's border defences. This was especially important as minorities make up a large percentage of the population that live along China's borders. In the late 1960s, China experienced a period of strained relations with some of its neighbours, notably with the Soviet Union and India.<ref>See [[Sino-Soviet split]] and [[Sino-Indian relations]]</ref>  Many of the Cultural Revolution's goals in minority areas were simply too unreasonable to be implemented.

On June 27, 1981, the Central Committee adopted the \"''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China'',\" an official assessment of major historical events since 1949.<ref name=\"marxists.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/cpc/history/01.htm|title=Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China (Chinese Communism Subject Archive)|publisher=|access-date=December 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213182749/http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/cpc/history/01.htm|archive-date=December 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Resolution frankly noted Mao's leadership role in the movement, stating that \"chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'Cultural Revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong.\" It diluted blame on Mao himself by asserting that the movement was \"manipulated by the counterrevolutionary groups of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing,\" who caused its worst excesses. The Resolution affirmed that the Cultural Revolution \"brought serious disaster and turmoil to the Communist Party and the Chinese people.\"<ref name=\"marxists.org\"/>\n\nThe official view aimed to separate Mao's actions during the Cultural Revolution from his \"heroic\" revolutionary activities during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It also separated Mao's personal mistakes from the correctness of the theory that he created, going as far as to rationalize that the Cultural Revolution contravened the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought, which remains an official guiding ideology of the Party.

Following the Cultural Revolution, a new genre of literature known as \"[[Scar literature]]\" (''Shanghen Wenxue'') emerged, being encouraged by the post-Mao government. Written mainly by educated youth such as Liu Xinhua, [[Zhang Xianliang]], and [[Liu Xinwu]], scar literature depicted the Revolution from a negative viewpoint, using their own perspectives and experiences as a basis.<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 32.</ref>\n\nAfter the suppression of the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]], both liberals and conservatives within the Party accused each other of excesses that they claimed were reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. [[Li Peng]], who promoted the use of military force, cited that the student movement had taken inspiration from the grassroots populism of the Cultural Revolution and that if it is left unchecked, would eventually lead to a similar degree of mass chaos.<ref>''AsiaNews.it''</ref> Zhao Ziyang, who was sympathetic to the protestors, later accused his political opponents of illegally removing him from office by using \"Cultural Revolution-style\" tactics, including \"reversing black and white, exaggerating personal offenses, taking quotes out of context, issuing slander and lies... inundating the newspapers with critical articles making me out to be an enemy, and casual disregard for my personal freedoms.\"<ref>Zhao 43\u201344</ref>\n\n====Alternative opinions====\nAlthough the Chinese Communist Party officially condemns the Cultural Revolution, there are many Chinese people who hold more positive views of it, particularly amongst the working class, who benefited most from its policies.<ref name=\"Gao 2008\">[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]].</ref> Since Deng's ascendancy to power, the government has arrested and imprisoned figures who have taken a strongly pro-Cultural Revolution stance. For instance, in 1985, a young shoe-factory worker put up a poster on a factory wall in [[Xianyang]], Shaanxi, which declared that \"The Cultural Revolution was Good\" and led to achievements such as \"the building of the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], the creation of hybrid rice crops and the rise of people's consciousness.\" The factory worker was eventually sentenced to ten years in prison, where he died soon after \"without any apparent cause.\"<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nOne of the student leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, [[Shen Tong]], author of ''Almost a Revolution'', has a positive view of some aspects of the Cultural Revolution. According to Shen, the trigger for the famous Tiananmen hunger-strikes of 1989 was a big-character poster (''dazibao''), a form of public political discussion that gained prominence during the Cultural Revolution. Shen remarked that the congregation of students from across the country to Beijing on trains and the hospitality they received from residents was reminiscent of the experiences of Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=\"Tang\"/>\n\nSince the advent of the Internet, people inside and outside China have argued online that the Cultural Revolution had many beneficial qualities for China that have been denied by both the post-Mao Chinese Communist Party and Western media. Some hold that the Cultural Revolution 'cleansed' China from superstitions, religious dogma, and outdated traditions in a 'modernist transformation' that later made Deng's economic reforms possible. These sentiments increased following the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] in 1999 when a segment of the population began to associate anti-Maoist viewpoints with the United States.<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 117.</ref>\n\n[[Chinese New Left|Contemporary Maoists]] have also become more organized in the internet era, partially as a response to criticisms of Mao from academics and scholars. One Maoist website managed to collect thousands of signatures demanding punishment for those who publicly criticize Mao. Along with the call for legal action, this movement demands the establishment of agencies similar to Cultural Revolution-era \"neighborhood committees\", in which \"citizens\" would report anti-Maoists to local public security bureaus. Maoist rhetoric and mass mobilization methods were resurgent in the interior city of Chongqing during the political career of [[Bo Xilai]].<ref>Ewing</ref>\n\n====Contemporary China====\nPublic discussion of the Cultural Revolution is still limited in China. The Chinese government continues to prohibit news organizations from mentioning details of the Cultural Revolution, and online discussions and books about the topic are subject to official scrutiny. Textbooks on the subject continue to abide by the \"official view\" (see above) of the events.

The government is apprehensive that academic probing and popular discussions will lead to ideological conflict and increase social instability. It may threaten the foundations of Communist rule. The focus of the Chinese government on maintaining political and social stability has been a top priority since the Tiananmen crackdown on reformers on June 4, 1989, and the current government has no interest in re-evaluating any issue that might lead to a split in the Chinese leadership, or which might polarize the Party on ideological grounds.<ref name=\"Fong\" /> In 2018, it was reported that one practice typical of the Cultural Revolution, ''Fengqiao'', or public criticism of supposed counter-revolutionaries by a whole village, was experiencing an unexpected revival: but it is unclear whether this was an isolated incident or a sign of a renewed interest for cultural styles typical of the Revolution.<ref>Jiang Tao, [https://bitterwinter.org/fengqiao-a-maoist-revival-to-attack-religion/ Fengqiao \u2013 a Maoist Revival to Attack Religion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229031748/https://bitterwinter.org/fengqiao-a-maoist-revival-to-attack-religion/ |date=December 29, 2018 }}, ''[[Bitter Winter]]'', December 27, 2018, accessed December 28, 2018.</ref>\n\n===Outside mainland China===\nIn Hong Kong, a [[Hong Kong 1967 riots|pro-Communist anti-colonial strike]] inspired by the Cultural Revolution was launched in 1967.

These debates have changed over the decades as researchers explored new sources.\n\nIn the 1960s, while many scholars dismissed Mao's initiatives as ideological and destructive, others sympathized with his concern for equality, opposition to bureaucratism and corruption, and individual selfishness. They saw Maoism as a populist insistence on mass participation, mass criticism and the right to rebel, and a determination to wipe out a new ruling class.  By the 1980s, however, Harvard University sociologist [[Andrew Walder]] wrote that the \u201cpublic opinion in the field had changed markedly\u201d. Most in the field now \u201cseem convinced that that the Cultural Revolution was a human disaster, even a historical crime, something on the order of Hitler\u2019s holocaust and Stalin\u2019s great terror\u201d. Walder argued that the failures of the Cultural Revolution did not come from poor implementation, bureaucratic sabotage, disloyalty, or lingering class antagonisms. If things turned out differently from what Mao expected, Walder concluded, this was \u201cprobably due to the fact that Mao did not know what he wanted, or that he did know what he was doing, or both.... the outcomes are what one should have expected, given the Maoist doctrine and aims.\u201d\n<ref>{{cite journal |last =Walder|first =Andrew |authorlink = |title =Actually Existing Maoism |journal =Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs |volume =18 |issue = 18|pages =155\u2013166 |date =1987|url = |jstor = 2158588|issn = |doi = 10.2307/2158588|accessdate = |ref= harv}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the debate continues because the movement contains many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven by a series of grassroots popular uprisings against the Communist establishment. Virtually all English-language books published since the 1980s paint a negative picture of the movement. Historian Anne F. Thurston wrote that it \"led to loss of culture, and of spiritual values; loss of hope and ideals; loss of time, truth and of life\".<ref>[[#Thu84-85|Thurston 1984\u201385]]. pp. 605\u201306.</ref> Barnouin and Yu summarized the Cultural Revolution as \"a political movement that produced unprecedented social divisions, mass mobilization, hysteria, upheavals, arbitrary cruelty, torture, killings, and even civil war\", calling Mao \"one of the most tyrannical despots of the twentieth century\".<ref>Barnouin and Yu 217</ref>\nSome scholars challenge the mainstream portrayals of the Cultural Revolution and offer to understand it in a more positive light. Mobo Gao, writing in ''The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution'',<ref name=about>Pluto Press, [http://www.plutobooks.com/about.asp About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101121337/http://www.plutobooks.com/about.asp |date=January 1, 2011 }}</ref> argues that the movement benefited millions of Chinese citizens, particularly agricultural and industrial workers,<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 1.</ref> and sees it as egalitarian and genuinely populist, citing continued Maoist nostalgia in China today as remnants of its positive legacy.<ref>[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 3.</ref> Some draw a distinction between intention and performance. {{sfnb|Walder|1987| p = 159}} While Mao's leadership was pivotal at the beginning of the movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed, it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision.<ref name=jinqiu>{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Qiu|title=The Culture of Power the Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Standard University Press|location=Palo Alto, California|isbn=0-8047-3529-8|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a much more decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning many 'local revolutions' which differed in their nature and goals.<ref name=jinqiu/>\n\nAcademic interest has also focused on the movement's relationship with Mao's personality. Mao envisioned himself as a wartime guerrilla leader, which made him wary of the bureaucratic nature of peacetime governance. With the Cultural Revolution Mao was simply \"returning to form\", once again taking on the role of a guerrilla leader fighting against an institutionalized party bureaucracy. Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals, paint the movement as neither a ''bona fide'' war over ideological purity ''nor'' a mere power struggle to remove Mao's political rivals.<ref name=rmms>{{cite book|last=MacFaquhar|first=Roderick|title=Mao's Last Revolution|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-02332-3|first2=Michael|last2=Schoenhals|url=https://archive.org/details/maoslastrevoluti00macf}}</ref> While Mao's personal motivations were undoubtedly pivotal to the Cultural Revolution, they reasoned that other complex factors contributed to the way events unfolded. These include China's relationship with the global Communist movement, geopolitical concerns, the [[Sino-Soviet Split|ideological rift between China and the Soviet Union]], Khrushchev's ouster, and the failures of the Great Leap Forward.<ref name=rmms/> They conclude that the movement was, at least in part, a legacy project to cement Mao's place in history, aimed to boost his prestige while he was alive ''and'' preserve the invulnerability of his ideas after his death.<ref>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, ''Mao's Last Revolution'', Introduction</ref>\n\nThe mass hysteria surrounding the Cultural Revolution was also unprecedented.

Described as a \"Sega simulation\", the player takes control of Tar\u014d Sega, who must help save a struggling Sega from losing the console market to its rival DOGMA, who owns 97%. Gameplay involves battling employees and other characters throughout various Sega development studios, some being taken from older Sega game franchises. It features many tongue-in-cheek references to Sega and the video game industry, particularly Sony and its [[PlayStation 2]] console.\n\nDevelopment was directed by Tez Okano, who developed the game in secret for two years before presenting it to Sega. The company misconstrued the game as a joke at first and dismissed it, however a second presentation impressed them and allowed development to continue. Okano marketed the game himself with a small budget of $200, half of which he spent on a wrestling mask to promote the game. Several characters, such as [[Segata Sanshiro]] and a [[Ferrari]] from ''[[Out Run]]'', had to be cut for licensing issues. [[Toei Animation]] produced the game's animated cutscenes. The game was initially exclusive to the Sega Direct online service, its popularity eventually warranting a physical release. The budget was small, with Okano claiming it was \"less than a hundredth\" of ''[[Shenmue]]''.\n\n''Segagaga'' received a favorable reception from critics, being commended for its humor, gameplay and bizarre nature, alongside its usage of various Sega franchises and for poking fun at the industry itself. One critic labeled the game as the \"swan song\" of the Dreamcast. It is one of the last games released for the system, published two days before its discontinuation on March 31.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:SegagagaBattle.jpg|thumb|left|In-game screenshot, showing the player fighting Amigo from ''[[Samba de Amigo]]''.]]\n''Segagaga'' is a role-playing simulation video game, described as a \"Sega simulation\".<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Controlling the young Sega Tar\u014d, the player is tasked with saving a struggling Sega from losing the console market to their rival DOGMA.<ref name=\"Edge Interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/story-sega%C3%ADs-oddest-game-ever |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813160653/http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/the-story-sega%E2%80%99s-oddest-game-ever?page=0%2C0 |title=The Story of Sega\u2019s Oddest Game Ever |author=Edge Staff |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |date=21 July 2008 |archivedate=August 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref> The player must progress through various Sega development studios and fight various employees, who due to the stress and pressure brought on by tight work constraints have turned into mutants.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Unlike other role-playing games, Tar\u014d \"attacks\" by shouting verbal abuses and insults, such as telling them their game is terrible or they will never get a girlfriend.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Enemies have a \"will meter\" that weakens as the player deals more insults towards them, and will win the fight once it fully drains.

Described as a \"Sega simulation\", the player takes control of Tar\u014d Sega, who must help save a struggling Sega from losing the console market to its rival DOGMA, who owns 97%. Gameplay involves battling employees and other characters throughout various Sega development studios, some being taken from older Sega game franchises. It features many tongue-in-cheek references to Sega and the video game industry, particularly Sony and its [[PlayStation 2]] console.\n\nDevelopment was directed by Tez Okano, who developed the game in secret for two years before presenting it to Sega. The company misconstrued the game as a joke at first and dismissed it, however a second presentation impressed them and allowed development to continue. Okano marketed the game himself with a small budget of $200, half of which he spent on a wrestling mask to promote the game. Several characters, such as [[Segata Sanshiro]] and a [[Ferrari]] from ''[[Out Run]]'', had to be cut for licensing issues. [[Toei Animation]] produced the game's animated cutscenes. The game was initially exclusive to the Sega Direct online service, its popularity eventually warranting a physical release. The budget was small, with Okano claiming it was \"less than a hundredth\" of ''[[Shenmue]]''.\n\n''Segagaga'' received a favorable reception from critics, being commended for its humor, gameplay and bizarre nature, alongside its usage of various Sega franchises and for poking fun at the industry itself. One critic labeled the game as the \"swan song\" of the Dreamcast.
