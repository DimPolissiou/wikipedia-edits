In the early 19th century, researchers in Hungary, the Netherlands, and the United States began exploring the idea of battery-powered vehicles. There had previously been progress with an electric carriage, a horseless carriage that was powered by an electric motor. However, as people wanted to get around more easily and quickly, cars became a faster and more reasonable alternative to horse-drawn carriages.\n\nIn 1835, American [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]] is credited with building the first practical electric vehicle, a small locomotive. He developed a battery-powered electric motor which he used to operate a small model car on a short section of track.\n\nThe first successful electric car was made in the United States in 1890. William Morrison of Des Moines, Iowa, built an electric vehicle that could hold up to six passengers and could reach from 6 to 12 miles per hour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.american-automobiles.com/Electric-Cars/Morrison-Electric.html|title=The Morrison Electric Automobile & The William Morrison Co.|website=american-automobiles.com|access-date=2017-10-09}}</ref> Specifications for the 1890 Morrison Electric included 24 storage battery cells mounted under the front seat. The vehicle could travel for a range of 100 miles before needing to be recharged.\n\nThis initial invention helped spark interest in electric cars, and automakers started building their own versions around the globe. Due to the extreme sudden interest, electric cars reached their peak popularity by 1900 and made up a majority of all vehicles on the road.\n\nAt this time electric cars were the preferred vehicles. Gasoline-powered vehicles required a lot of effort to drive, from changing gears to starting the engine with a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], as well as other cons like strong and unpleasant exhaust fumes.\n\nHowever, improvements were made to the gasoline-powered car that caused the electric car to lose some momentum. The hand crank was soon replaced with an electric starter and gasoline-powered vehicles became more affordable. Gasoline cars soon overcame the popularity of electric powered vehicles.\n\nBy 1935, electric cars practically disappeared. It was not until the 1970s when a gas shortage hit, causing gas prices to soar, that electric cars entered back into the marketplace. Gasoline-powered cars still remained more popular due to better performance and reliability.\n\nThe 1990s saw electric cars made more popular as societal concern for the environment began to rise. At the start of the 21st century, the technology of electric cars looked more promising than ever with the release of the Toyota Prius, the first majorly manufactured electric vehicle. Today, electric vehicles are on the rise and continue to advance as more Americans demand a more efficient and eco-friendly vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gogocharters.com/blog/electric-buses-future-transportation/|title=Are Electric Buses the Future of Transportation? - GOGO Charters|date=16 August 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Principles==\n===Battery===\n{{Main|Battery electric bus}}\nOne of the most popular types of electric buses nowadays are [[battery electric bus]]es. Battery electric buses have the electricity stored on board the vehicle in a battery. {{As of|2018}} such buses can have a range of over 280&nbsp;km with just one charge, however extreme temperatures and hills may reduce range.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Verdict's Still Out on Battery-Electric Buses |url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/01/electric-bus-battery-recharge-new-flyer-byd-proterra-beb/577954/ |agency=Citylab |date=17 January 2019}}</ref> These buses are usually used as city buses due to particularities in limited range.\n\nCity driving involves a great deal of accelerating and braking. Due to this, the battery electric bus is superior to diesel bus as it can recharge most of the kinetic energy back into batteries in braking situations. This reduces brake wear on the buses and the use of electric over diesel reduces noise, air and greenhouse gas pollution in cities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Shenzhen's silent revolution: world's first fully electric bus fleet quietens Chinese megacity |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/dec/12/silence-shenzhen-world-first-electric-bus-fleet |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen operating within a city, it is important to minimize the unloaded and rolling weight of the bus. This can be accomplished by using aluminium as the main construction material for a bus. Composite paneling and other lightweight materials can also be used. According to Linkkebus their fully aluminium bus construction is about 3000&nbsp;kg lighter than comparably-sized modern steel buses (curb weight 9500&nbsp;kg). Reducing weight allows for a greater payload and reduces wear to components such as brakes, tires, and joints bringing cost savings to the operator annually.<ref name=\"linkkerbus.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.linkkerbus.com/naytasivu/Lightweight+bus+construction/5 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304212617/http://www.linkkerbus.com/naytasivu/Lightweight+bus+construction/5 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Charging ===\nBuses may be charged at plug in stations, or on special [[Charging station|wireless]] charging pads.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/12/electric-buses-charge-up-quickly-using-new-wireless-systems/|title=Electric buses charge up quickly using new wireless systems|last=Kennedy|first=Sarah|date=2019-12-05|website=Yale Climate Connections|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Capacitors ===\n{{Main|Capabus}}\nBuses can use capacitors instead of batteries to store their energy.\nUltracapacitors can only store about 5 percent of the energy that lithium-ion batteries hold for the same weight, limiting them to a couple of miles per charge.\nHowever ultracapacitors can charge and discharge much more rapidly than conventional batteries.\nIn vehicles that have to stop frequently and predictably as part of normal operation, energy storage based exclusively on [[ultracapacitor]]s can be a solution.<ref name=\"technologyreview.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/23754/?a=f |title=Next Stop: Ultracapacitor Buses |publisher=Technology Review |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>\n\nChina is experimenting with a new form of electric bus, known as ''Capabus'', which runs without continuous [[overhead lines]] by using power stored in large on-board electric double-layer capacitors, which are quickly recharged whenever the vehicle stops at any bus stop (under so-called '''electric umbrellas'''), and fully charged in the [[bus terminus|terminus]].\n\nA few prototypes were being tested in [[Shanghai]] in early 2005.  In 2006, two commercial bus routes began to use electric double-layer capacitor buses; one of them is route 11 in Shanghai.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070105022719/http://www.52bus.com/article/special/200608/special_6.html] (in Chinese, archived page)</ref>  In 2009, [[Sinautec Automobile Technologies]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinautecus.com |title=SINAUTEC, Automobile Technology, LLC |publisher=Sinautecus.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> based in [[Arlington, VA]], and its Chinese partner, [[Shanghai Aowei Technology Development Company]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aowei.com/english/index.htm |title=Aowei Technology |publisher=Aowei.com |accessdate=2010-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125014115/http://www.aowei.com/english/index.htm |archivedate=2010-01-25 }}</ref> are testing with 17 forty-one seat [[Ultracap Bus]]es serving the Greater Shanghai area since 2006 without any major technical problems.<ref name=\"treehugger.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/10/ultracapacitor-electric-buses-china.php |title=Ultracapacitor Buses Work...

At these stations, a collector on the top of the bus rises a few feet and touches an overhead charging line.  Within a couple of minutes, the ultracapacitor banks stored under the bus seats are fully charged.  The buses can also capture energy from braking, and the company says that recharging stations can be equipped with solar panels.  A third generation of the product, will give {{convert|20|mi}} of range per charge or better.\n<ref name=\"technologyreview.com\"/> Such a bus was delivered in Sofia, Bulgaria in May 2014 for 9 months' test. It covers 23&nbsp;km in 2 charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chariot-electricbus.com/pilot-projects/sofia/|title=Sofia \u2013 Chariot Motors|website=chariot-electricbus.com}}</ref>\n\nSinautec estimates that one of its buses has one-tenth the energy cost of a diesel bus and can achieve lifetime fuel savings of $200,000.  Also, the buses use 40 percent less electricity compared to an electric [[trolley bus]], mainly because they are lighter and have the [[regenerative braking]] benefits.  The ultracapacitors are made of activated carbon, and have an [[energy density]] of six watt-hours per kilogram (for comparison, a high-performance lithium-ion battery can achieve 200 watt-hours per kilogram), but the ultracapacitor bus is also cheaper than lithium-ion battery buses, about 40 percent less expensive, with a far superior reliability rating.<ref name=\"technologyreview.com\"/><ref name=\"treehugger.com\"/>\n\nThere is also a [[plug-in hybrid]] version, which also uses ultracaps.\n\n====Future developments====\n\nSinautec is in discussions with [[MIT]]'s Schindall about developing ultracapacitors of higher energy density using vertically aligned [[carbon nanotube]] structures that give the devices more surface area for holding a charge.  So far, they are able to get twice the energy density of an existing ultracapacitor, but they are trying to get about five times.  This would create an ultracapacitor with one-quarter of the energy density of a lithium-ion battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/23754/page2/ |title=Next Stop: Ultracapacitor Buses |publisher=Technology Review |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>\n\nFuture developments includes the use of [[inductive charging]] under the street, to avoid overhead wiring.  A pad under each [[bus stop]] and at each [[stop light]] along the way would be used.\n\n===Drawbacks===\nAs with other electric vehicles, climate control and extremely cold weather will weaken the performance of electric buses. In addition, terrain may pose a challenge to the adoption of electric vehicles that carry stored energy compared to trolleybuses, which draw power from overhead lines. Even when conditions are favorable, internal combustion engine buses are frequently diesel powered, and diesel is relatively inexpensive per mile. High local utility rates (especially during periods of peak demand) and proprietary charging systems pose barriers to adoption.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-transportation-buses-electric-analysi/u-s-transit-agencies-cautious-on-electric-buses-despite-bold-forecasts-idUSKBN1E60GS |title=U.S. transit agencies cautious on electric buses despite bold forecasts |author=Groom, Nichola |date=11 December 2017 |work=Reuters |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Makers and models==\n{{Main|List of electric bus makers and models}}\n\n==School use==\nIn 2014, the first production-model all-electric school bus was delivered<ref>{{cite web|last=Dechert|first=Sandy|title=New All-Electric School Bus Saves California District $10,000+ Per Year|date=March 5, 2014|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/03/05/new-electric-school-bus-saves-california-district-10000-per-year/|accessdate=2018-08-20}}</ref> to the [[Kings Canyon Unified School District]] in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley.

For example, overhead wires, as in the [[trolleybus]], or with non-contact conductors on the ground, as in [[online electric vehicle]]s.<ref name=\"kaist\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kaist.edu/english/01_about/06_news_01.php?req_P=bv&req_BIDX=10&req_BNM=ed_news&pt=17&req_VI=4404|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231161652/http://www.kaist.edu/english/01_about/06_news_01.php?req_P=bv&req_BIDX=10&req_BNM=ed_news&pt=17&req_VI=4404|url-status=dead|title=OLEV|archivedate=December 31, 2013}}</ref>\nThis article mostly deals with buses storing the electricity on board.\n\nAs of 2019, 99% of the battery electric buses in the world have been deployed in China, with more than 421,000 buses on the road, which is 17% of China's total bus fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/electric-buses-are-hurting-the-oil-industry|title=Electric Buses Are Hurting the Oil Industry|date=23 April 2018|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> For comparison, the US had 300, and Europe had 2,250.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-05-15/in-shift-to-electric-bus-it-s-china-ahead-of-u-s-421-000-to-300</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2017}}\nElectric vehicles have been around since the 19th century. In the early 19th century, researchers in Hungary, the Netherlands, and the United States began exploring the idea of battery-powered vehicles. There had previously been progress with an electric carriage, a horseless carriage that was powered by an electric motor. However, as people wanted to get around more easily and quickly, cars became a faster and more reasonable alternative to horse-drawn carriages.\n\nIn 1835, American [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]] is credited with building the first practical electric vehicle, a small locomotive. He developed a battery-powered electric motor which he used to operate a small model car on a short section of track.\n\nThe first successful electric car was made in the United States in 1890. William Morrison of Des Moines, Iowa, built an electric vehicle that could hold up to six passengers and could reach from 6 to 12 miles per hour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.american-automobiles.com/Electric-Cars/Morrison-Electric.html|title=The Morrison Electric Automobile & The William Morrison Co.|website=www.american-automobiles.com|access-date=2017-10-09}}</ref> Specifications for the 1890 Morrison Electric included 24 storage battery cells mounted under the front seat. The vehicle could travel for a range of 100 miles before needing to be recharged.\n\nThis initial invention helped spark interest in electric cars, and automakers started building their own versions around the globe. Due to the extreme sudden interest, electric cars reached their peak popularity by 1900 and made up a majority of all vehicles on the road.\n\nAt this time electric cars were the preferred vehicles. Gasoline-powered vehicles required a lot of effort to drive, from changing gears to starting the engine with a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], as well as other cons like strong and unpleasant exhaust fumes.\n\nHowever, improvements were made to the gasoline-powered car that caused the electric car to lose some momentum. The hand crank was soon replaced with an electric starter and gasoline-powered vehicles became more affordable. Gasoline cars soon overcame the popularity of electric powered vehicles.\n\nBy 1935, electric cars practically disappeared. It was not until the 1970s when a gas shortage hit, causing gas prices to soar, that electric cars entered back into the marketplace. Gasoline-powered cars still remained more popular due to better performance and reliability.\n\nThe 1990s saw electric cars made more popular as societal concern for the environment began to rise. At the start of the 21st century, the technology of electric cars looked more promising than ever with the release of the Toyota Prius, the first majorly manufactured electric vehicle. Today, electric vehicles are on the rise and continue to advance as more Americans demand a more efficient and eco-friendly vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gogocharters.com/blog/electric-buses-future-transportation/|title=Are Electric Buses the Future of Transportation? - GOGO Charters|date=16 August 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Principles==\n===Battery===\n{{Main|Battery electric bus}}\nOne of the most popular types of electric buses nowadays are [[battery electric bus]]es. Battery electric buses have the electricity stored on board the vehicle in a battery. {{As of|2018}} such buses can have a range of over 280&nbsp;km with just one charge, however extreme temperatures and hills may reduce range.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Verdict's Still Out on Battery-Electric Buses |url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/01/electric-bus-battery-recharge-new-flyer-byd-proterra-beb/577954/ |agency=Citylab |date=17 January 2019}}</ref> These buses are usually used as city buses due to particularities in limited range.\n\nCity driving involves a great deal of accelerating and braking. Due to this, the battery electric bus is superior to diesel bus as it can recharge most of the kinetic energy back into batteries in braking situations. This reduces brake wear on the buses and the use of electric over diesel reduces noise, air and greenhouse gas pollution in cities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Shenzhen's silent revolution: world's first fully electric bus fleet quietens Chinese megacity |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/dec/12/silence-shenzhen-world-first-electric-bus-fleet |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen operating within a city, it is important to minimize the unloaded and rolling weight of the bus. This can be accomplished by using aluminium as the main construction material for a bus. Composite paneling and other lightweight materials can also be used. According to Linkkebus their fully aluminium bus construction is about 3000&nbsp;kg lighter than comparably-sized modern steel buses (curb weight 9500&nbsp;kg). Reducing weight allows for a greater payload and reduces wear to components such as brakes, tires, and joints bringing cost savings to the operator annually.<ref name=\"linkkerbus.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.linkkerbus.com/naytasivu/Lightweight+bus+construction/5 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304212617/http://www.linkkerbus.com/naytasivu/Lightweight+bus+construction/5 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Charging ===\nBuses may be charged at plug in stations, or on special [[Charging station|wireless]] charging pads.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/12/electric-buses-charge-up-quickly-using-new-wireless-systems/|title=Electric buses charge up quickly using new wireless systems|last=Kennedy|first=Sarah|date=2019-12-05|website=Yale Climate Connections|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Capacitors ===\n{{Main|Capabus}}\nBuses can use capacitors instead of batteries to store their energy.\nUltracapacitors can only store about 5 percent of the energy that lithium-ion batteries hold for the same weight, limiting them to a couple of miles per charge.\nHowever ultracapacitors can charge and discharge much more rapidly than conventional batteries.\nIn vehicles that have to stop frequently and predictably as part of normal operation, energy storage based exclusively on [[ultracapacitor]]s can be a solution.<ref name=\"technologyreview.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/23754/?a=f |title=Next Stop: Ultracapacitor Buses |publisher=Technology Review |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>\n\nChina is experimenting with a new form of electric bus, known as ''Capabus'', which runs without continuous [[overhead lines]] by using power stored in large on-board electric double-layer capacitors, which are quickly recharged whenever the vehicle stops at any bus stop (under so-called '''electric umbrellas'''), and fully charged in the [[bus terminus|terminus]].\n\nA few prototypes were being tested in [[Shanghai]] in early 2005.  In 2006, two commercial bus routes began to use electric double-layer capacitor buses; one of them is route 11 in Shanghai.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070105022719/http://www.52bus.com/article/special/200608/special_6.html] (in Chinese, archived page)</ref>  In 2009, [[Sinautec Automobile Technologies]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinautecus.com |title=SINAUTEC, Automobile Technology, LLC |publisher=Sinautecus.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> based in [[Arlington, VA]], and its Chinese partner, [[Shanghai Aowei Technology Development Company]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aowei.com/english/index.htm |title=Aowei Technology |publisher=Aowei.com |accessdate=2010-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125014115/http://www.aowei.com/english/index.htm |archivedate=2010-01-25 }}</ref> are testing with 17 forty-one seat [[Ultracap Bus]]es serving the Greater Shanghai area since 2006 without any major technical problems.<ref name=\"treehugger.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/10/ultracapacitor-electric-buses-china.php |title=Ultracapacitor Buses Work...

At these stations, a collector on the top of the bus rises a few feet and touches an overhead charging line.  Within a couple of minutes, the ultracapacitor banks stored under the bus seats are fully charged.  The buses can also capture energy from braking, and the company says that recharging stations can be equipped with solar panels.  A third generation of the product, will give {{convert|20|mi}} of range per charge or better.\n<ref name=\"technologyreview.com\"/> Such a bus was delivered in Sofia, Bulgaria in May 2014 for 9 months' test. It covers 23&nbsp;km in 2 charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chariot-electricbus.com/pilot-projects/sofia/|title=Sofia \u2013 Chariot Motors|website=www.chariot-electricbus.com}}</ref>\n\nSinautec estimates that one of its buses has one-tenth the energy cost of a diesel bus and can achieve lifetime fuel savings of $200,000.  Also, the buses use 40 percent less electricity compared to an electric [[trolley bus]], mainly because they are lighter and have the [[regenerative braking]] benefits.  The ultracapacitors are made of activated carbon, and have an [[energy density]] of six watt-hours per kilogram (for comparison, a high-performance lithium-ion battery can achieve 200 watt-hours per kilogram), but the ultracapacitor bus is also cheaper than lithium-ion battery buses, about 40 percent less expensive, with a far superior reliability rating.<ref name=\"technologyreview.com\"/><ref name=\"treehugger.com\"/>\n\nThere is also a [[plug-in hybrid]] version, which also uses ultracaps.\n\n====Future developments====\n\nSinautec is in discussions with [[MIT]]'s Schindall about developing ultracapacitors of higher energy density using vertically aligned [[carbon nanotube]] structures that give the devices more surface area for holding a charge.  So far, they are able to get twice the energy density of an existing ultracapacitor, but they are trying to get about five times.  This would create an ultracapacitor with one-quarter of the energy density of a lithium-ion battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/23754/page2/ |title=Next Stop: Ultracapacitor Buses |publisher=Technology Review |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>\n\nFuture developments includes the use of [[inductive charging]] under the street, to avoid overhead wiring.  A pad under each [[bus stop]] and at each [[stop light]] along the way would be used.\n\n===Drawbacks===\nAs with other electric vehicles, climate control and extremely cold weather will weaken the performance of electric buses. In addition, terrain may pose a challenge to the adoption of electric vehicles that carry stored energy compared to trolleybuses, which draw power from overhead lines. Even when conditions are favorable, internal combustion engine buses are frequently diesel powered, and diesel is relatively inexpensive per mile. High local utility rates (especially during periods of peak demand) and proprietary charging systems pose barriers to adoption.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-transportation-buses-electric-analysi/u-s-transit-agencies-cautious-on-electric-buses-despite-bold-forecasts-idUSKBN1E60GS |title=U.S. transit agencies cautious on electric buses despite bold forecasts |author=Groom, Nichola |date=11 December 2017 |work=Reuters |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Makers and models==\n{{Main|List of electric bus makers and models}}\n\n==School use==\nIn 2014, the first production-model all-electric school bus was delivered<ref>{{cite web|last=Dechert|first=Sandy|title=New All-Electric School Bus Saves California District $10,000+ Per Year|date=March 5, 2014|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/03/05/new-electric-school-bus-saves-california-district-10000-per-year/|accessdate=2018-08-20}}</ref> to the [[Kings Canyon Unified School District]] in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley.

Sinking of Shotton Grange Colliery began in 1840 and, once in production, it was linked to the southbound H&DR route by the ''[[Shotton Wagonway]]'' which had been extended northwards<ref name=\":1\" /> to link to a branch of the [[South Hetton Railway]] by 1898.\n\n=== The NER and the opening of the station ===\nIn 1846, the newly formed [[York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway|York & Newcastle Railway (Y&NR)]] took out a lease on the HD&R which was ratified by an Act of 22 July 1848,<ref name=\":3\" /> from which point the line was operated by the [[York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway|York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway (YN&BR)]] (the successor to the Y&NR).

Sinking of Shotton Grange Colliery began in 1840 and, once in production, it was linked to the southbound H&DR route by the ''[[Shotton Wagonway]]'' which had been extended northwards<ref name=\":1\" /> to link to a branch of the [[South Hetton Railway]] by 1898.\n\n=== The NER and the opening of the station ===\nIn 1846, the newly formed [[York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway|York & Newcastle Railway (Y&NR)]] took out a lease on the HD&R which was ratified by an Act of 22 July 1848,<ref name=\":3\" /> from which point the line was operated by the [[York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway|York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway (YN&BR)]] (the successor to the Y&NR).

By this time, passenger and goods traffic across the country was in decline and this was also the case for the route from West Hartlepool to Sunderland through Shotton Bridge.

Its coloration is mainly dark brown. On its sternum is a lighter marking, with three light spots on each side. The [[opisthosoma]] features a lighter middle line with six \"spots\" on each side. The giant house spider has the same coloration as the domestic house spider, ''[[Tegenaria domestica]]''; it has earthy tones of brown and muddy red or yellow. They also have conspicuously hairy legs, palps and abdomen. Despite its English name, this species is not the largest species in the genus (that being ''[[Tegenaria parietina]]''). The female body size can reach {{convert|18.5|mm}} in length, with males having a slightly smaller body at around {{convert|12|to|15|mm}} in length. The female leg span is typically around {{convert|45|mm}}. The leg span of the male is highly variable, with spans between {{convert|25|to|75|mm}} being common.\n\nIts eight eyes are of equal size and are arranged in two rows. As the eyes contain fewer than 400 visual cells, ''E.&nbsp;atrica'' can probably only distinguish light and dark.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe first description of a spider now assigned to this species was by [[Carl Ludwig Koch]] in 1843, under the name ''Tegenaria atrica''. Other supposedly different species were described later, including ''Tegenaria saeva''  by [[John Blackwall]] in 1844, ''Tegenaria duellica'' by [[Eug\u00e8ne Simon]] in 1875 and ''Tegenaria gigantea'' by [[Ralph Vary Chamberlin]] and [[Wilton Ivie]] in 1935. ''T.&nbsp;gigantea'' was [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] with ''T.&nbsp;duellica'' in 1978. The three remaining taxa have been regarded as distinct species, particularly in Britain.<ref name=Bolzern/> Thus Roberts (1995) provides distinguishing characters for ''T.&nbsp;atrica'', ''T.&nbsp;duellica'' and ''T.&nbsp;saeva'',<ref name=Robe95>{{Cite book |last=Roberts |first=Michael J. |year=1995 |title=Spiders of Britain & Northern Europe |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-00-219981-0 |pp=243\u2013245}}</ref> as does Oxford (2008) for ''T.&nbsp;duellica'' (as ''T.&nbsp;gigantea'') and ''T.&nbsp;saeva''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Oxford |first=G. |date=2008 |title=Identification of ''Tegenaria gigantea'' and ''T. saeva'' |journal=Newsletter of the British Arachnological Society |volume=113 |pp=21\u201323 }}</ref> Others consider these three as part of a single morphologically variable species, for which the oldest name, and hence the senior synonym, is ''T.&nbsp;atrica''.<ref name=Bolzern/>\n\nA [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic study]] in 2013 concluded that ''Tegenaria'', as then defined, was not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]], and split off some species, including ''T.&nbsp;atrica'', into the newly created segregate genus ''[[Eratigena]]''. The study also consolidated the various giant house spider species into one species, ''E. atrica''.<ref name=Bolzern/> A subsequent genetic study of ''E. atrica'' specimens determined that there were three distinct morphological groups, leading to the restoration of three separate species: ''E. atrica'', ''E. duellica'', and ''E. saeva''.<ref name=Oxford2018/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''E. atrica'' is found in [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Northern Africa]]. It was unwittingly introduced to the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]] circa 1900 due to human activity and has strongly increased in numbers for the last century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn the last few years the spider has been found in several European countries in which it was previously not recorded, like [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]. It is recorded in the checklist of Danish spider species,<ref>Checklist of Danish Spiders (Araneae). Version 26-10-2011 ([http://www.zmuc.dk/EntoWeb/arachnology/dkchecklist.htm list])</ref> and is also found in [[Iceland]].<ref name=IINH/>\n\nThe giant house spider's original habitat consists mostly of [[cave]]s, or dry forests where it is found under rocks, but it is a common spider in people's homes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Biology and behavior==\n[[Image:Tegenaria.atrica.spiderlings.on.egg.sac.jpg|thumb|200px|Spiderlings]]\nThe [[spider web|webs]] built by the giant house spider are flat and messy with a funnel at one end. They do not contain sticky threads. The spider lurks in the funnel until a small invertebrate happens to get trapped in the web, at which point the spider runs out and attacks it. They usually build their webs in corners (on both the floor and ceiling), between boxes in basements, behind cupboards, in attics, or any other area that is rarely disturbed by large animals or humans. Often found near window openings.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n''E. atrica'' normally lives for two or three years, but lifetimes of up to six years have been observed. While the female only leaves its nest to feed, males can often be seen wandering around houses during the late summer and early autumn looking for a mate. Males can be found from July to October, adult females occur all year.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAt least 60 spiderlings emerge from an egg sac. Unusual for spiders, they are subsocial at this stage: they remain together for about a month, but do not cooperate in prey capture.

The leg span of the male is highly variable, with spans between {{convert|25|to|75|mm}} being common.\n\nIts eight eyes are of equal size and are arranged in two rows. As the eyes contain fewer than 400 visual cells, ''E.&nbsp;atrica'' can probably only distinguish light and dark.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe first description of a spider now assigned to this species was by [[Carl Ludwig Koch]] in 1843, under the name ''Tegenaria atrica''. Other supposedly different species were described later, including ''Tegenaria saeva''  by [[John Blackwall]] in 1844, ''Tegenaria duellica'' by [[Eug\u00e8ne Simon]] in 1875 and ''Tegenaria gigantea'' by [[Ralph Vary Chamberlin]] and [[Wilton Ivie]] in 1935. ''T.&nbsp;gigantea'' was [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] with ''T.&nbsp;duellica'' in 1978. The three remaining taxa have been regarded as distinct species, particularly in Britain.<ref name=Bolzern/> Thus Roberts (1995) provides distinguishing characters for ''T.&nbsp;atrica'', ''T.&nbsp;duellica'' and ''T.&nbsp;saeva'',<ref name=Robe95>{{Cite book |last=Roberts |first=Michael J. |year=1995 |title=Spiders of Britain & Northern Europe |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-00-219981-0 |pp=243\u2013245}}</ref> as does Oxford (2008) for ''T.&nbsp;duellica'' (as ''T.&nbsp;gigantea'') and ''T.&nbsp;saeva''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Oxford |first=G. |date=2008 |title=Identification of ''Tegenaria gigantea'' and ''T. saeva'' |journal=Newsletter of the British Arachnological Society |volume=113 |pp=21\u201323 }}</ref> Others consider these three as part of a single morphologically variable species, for which the oldest name, and hence the senior synonym, is ''T.&nbsp;atrica''.<ref name=Bolzern/>\n\nA [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic study]] in 2013 concluded that ''Tegenaria'', as then defined, was not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]], and split off some species, including ''T.&nbsp;atrica'', into the newly created segregate genus ''[[Eratigena]]''. The study also consolidated the various giant house spider species into one species, ''E. atrica''.<ref name=Bolzern/> A subsequent genetic study of ''E. atrica'' specimens determined that there were three distinct morphological groups, leading to the restoration of three separate species: ''E. atrica'', ''E. duellica'', and ''E. saeva''.<ref name=Oxford2018/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''E. atrica'' is found in [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Northern Africa]]. It was unwittingly introduced to the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]] circa 1900 due to human activity and has strongly increased in numbers for the last century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn the last few years the spider has been found in several European countries in which it was previously not recorded, like [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]. It is recorded in the checklist of Danish spider species,<ref>Checklist of Danish Spiders (Araneae). Version 26-10-2011 ([http://www.zmuc.dk/EntoWeb/arachnology/dkchecklist.htm list])</ref> and is also found in [[Iceland]].<ref name=IINH/>\n\nThe giant house spider's original habitat consists mostly of [[cave]]s, or dry forests where it is found under rocks, but it is a common spider in people's homes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Biology and behavior==\n[[Image:Tegenaria.atrica.spiderlings.on.egg.sac.jpg|thumb|200px|Spiderlings]]\nThe [[spider web|webs]] built by the giant house spider are flat and messy with a funnel at one end. They do not contain sticky threads. The spider lurks in the funnel until a small invertebrate happens to get trapped in the web, at which point the spider runs out and attacks it. They usually build their webs in corners (on both the floor and ceiling), between boxes in basements, behind cupboards, in attics, or any other area that is rarely disturbed by large animals or humans. Often found near window openings.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n''E. atrica'' normally lives for two or three years, but lifetimes of up to six years have been observed. While the female only leaves its nest to feed, males can often be seen wandering around houses during the late summer and early autumn looking for a mate. Males can be found from July to October, adult females occur all year.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAt least 60 spiderlings emerge from an egg sac. Unusual for spiders, they are subsocial at this stage: they remain together for about a month, but do not cooperate in prey capture. The amount of cannibalism correlates with the amount of available food.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pouri\u00e9 |first1=Gr\u00e9gory |last2=Trabalon |first2=Marie |date=1999 |title=Relationships Among Food and Contact Signals in Experimental Group-Living Young of ''Tegenaria atrica'' |journal=Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=188\u2013197 |lastauthoramp=yes |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6327(199911)42:3<188::AID-ARCH3>3.0.CO;2-M }}</ref> ''E. atrica'' molts seven or eight times before reaching the immature adult state, and after a final molt reaches maturity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Collatz |first1=K.G. |last2=Mommsen |first2=T. |date=1975 |title=Physiological conditions and variations of body constituents during the moulting of the spider ''Tegenaria atrica'' C.L.
