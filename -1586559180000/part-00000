To this day dela Cruz starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) is the most successful film export of the [[Philippines]], making him their first international celebrity. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first short person to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role,  and to get international recognition with a streak of films. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[Primordial dwarfism]] and underdeveloped intellectual capacities, dela Cruz started exercising with everything he could find, and went on to study martial arts at a nearby dojo. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes. With their production company Liliw Productions, received his billing name Weng Weng and played supporting roles in their films. In 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''. By the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Dela Cruz started to collaborate with [[Dolphy]], a major local comic, and appeared in three of his films. Between all this dela Cruz started playing of the role of Agent OO as the lead in the film ''Agent OO'' (1981). \n\nIt was the sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), that launched him to brief but international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world. Major entertainment figures were present including [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Jeremy Irons]], among many other. It is written that dela Cruz stole the spotlight from all the regular action stars, and Art House film directors, who are usually front and center in these kind of events. Dela Cruz hyped as a new superstar, was the talk of the town and ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales. The film was a success worldwide, establishing dela Cruz under the pseudonym Weng Weng as the first small person with leading roles in films to reach a peak of success. Finally, dela Cruz is still the only small person who made a name for himself in the action genre performing all of his stunts.\n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more film ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. The first two were distributed internationally without the same success as ''For Your Height Only'', and shortly after the Caballes had a professional change of heart. Dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry and spent the rest of his living in poverty in with his family in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque|Baclaran]]. During his last two year dela Cruz was paralyzed and bed stricken because of a stroke and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nDela Cruz became a cult film icon with the passing of time, and with the arrival of the internet dela Cruz became an online sensation, with people from all over the world looking at the mark he left behind. At that time a lot of information published about dela Cruz was hyperbolic mythos, while mostly false some of it was true. Research about his life led to the making of two successful widely release documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013), who also published a book by the same name.\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor.

Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Rez Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality.

Anderson found dela Cruz brave, while wanting to be prudent with him de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. According to him, a man once provoked dela Cruz by tapping his hand on his head and dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch.

She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy.

To this day dela Cruz starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) is the most successful film export of the [[Philippines]], making him their first international celebrity. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first short person to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role,  and to get international recognition with a streak of films. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[Primordial dwarfism]] and underdeveloped intellectual capacities, dela Cruz started exercising with everything he could find, and went on to study martial arts at a nearby dojo. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes. With their production company Liliw Productions, received his billing name Weng Weng and played supporting roles in their films. In 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''. By the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Dela Cruz started to collaborate with [[Dolphy]], a major local comic, and appeared in three of his films. Between all this dela Cruz started playing of the role of Agent OO as the lead in the film ''Agent OO'' (1981). \n\nIt was the sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), that launched him to brief but international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world. Major entertainment figures were present including [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Jeremy Irons]], among many other. It is written that dela Cruz stole the spotlight from all the regular action stars, and Art House film directors, who are usually front and center in these kind of events. Dela Cruz hyped as a new superstar, was the talk of the town and ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales. The film was a success worldwide, establishing dela Cruz under the pseudonym Weng Weng as the first small person with leading roles in films to reach a peak of success. Finally, dela Cruz is still the only small person who made a name for himself in the action genre performing all of his stunts.\n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more film ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. The first two were distributed internationally without the same success as ''For Your Height Only'', and shortly after the Caballes had a professional change of heart. Dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry and spent the rest of his living in poverty in with his family in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque|Baclaran]]. During his last two year dela Cruz was paralyzed and bed stricken because of a stroke and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nDela Cruz became a cult film icon with the passing of time, and with the arrival of the internet dela Cruz became an online sensation, with people from all over the world looking at the mark he left behind. At that time a lot of information published about dela Cruz was hyperbolic mythos, while mostly false some of it was true. Research about his life led to the making of two successful widely release documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013), who also published a book by the same name.\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor.

As described by his brother on that morning dela Cruz, who was already bedstricken due to a previous heart attack, fell from his bed and was found unconscious. Dela Cruz was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The official cause is heart attack due to hypertension.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Personal ==\nCeling and Filipino actor Franco Guerrero said that dela Cruz never had any romantic relationships. Guerrero said that dela Cruz said he would brag about sexual exploit but never saw his actual girlfriends. Director Dante Pangilinan said that dela Cruz had his first kiss on the set of ''Sila... Sa bawat bangketa'' (1977) after he asked Pangilinan if he could get an onscreen kiss, who said yes. According to him dela Cruz was delighted and nervous at the same time. Actress and common collaborator Yehlen Catral, who played the damsel-in-distress a dela Cruz film, said she helped dela Cruz approach women to introduce himself.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=219-239|chapter=An interview with Yehlen Catral}}</ref> According to director Eddie Nicart if dela Cruz would get free from the set, he would immediately go where there is drinks and women, and would always ask about where they could be.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nProducer Peter and Cora Caballes published account of their relationship with dela Cruz at the time of his prime went as followed. They said that they adopted dela Cruz ten years prior to the release of ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) to help him. Contemporary action film star [[Rez Cortez]], Franco Guerrero, and Nelson Anderson, who are critical of the couple, have asserted that with the Caballes dela Cruz was provided shelter, received a per diem that was higher than most salaries considering where dela Cruz from and travelled the world. Countries visited by dela Cruz includes [[France]], and [[United States]]. Film editor Edgardo \"Boy\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince.<ref name=\":0\" /> Aside from Vinarao's account, those of Cortez, Guerrero, Anderson, as well as [[Roland Dantes]], Busty Santos, and director Eddie Nicard found the financial treatment of dela Cruz's by the Caballes appalling. According to the filmmakers of the documentary ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]],'' by the time they tracked down the couple down to be interviewed that Peter had passed away in 2007, while Cora said they would have to travel [[California]] to conduct one. When they arrived she was nowhere to be found, and since never responded on the matter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=205-217|chapter=The search continues}}</ref>\n\nCeling denies Peter and Cora Caballes's account on his adoption and said that they just borrowed him when needed as if dela Cruz would go on a holiday with them. Celing added that dela Cruz was abandoned by the Caballes when they had a career change, became completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed after his first stroke and the only thing that was provided beyond this point was dela Cruz's casket paid by Peter, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother, and that [[Lotis Key]] was the only celebrity to attend.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Celing said he was never fully paid what he was owed as according to him the Caballes promised their mother that they buy them a house. Nicart went on to say that the Caballes treated dela Cruz like a dog, would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting, and that gave him the equivalent of $ 500 per film, while they were wealthy owning several mansions. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes too possessive. Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing and considering the fact that the dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, Cortez suspected that at the time he wasn't well compensated. Cortez said he saw dela Cruz arrive on set not in his private car but utility vehicle, he went on to say that it is unacceptable to do so with a leading man. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, who was a former actor and stuntman for a company named SOS Daredevils, had doubt due to dela Cruz's limitations and went on to say that dela Cruz didn't know how to read a script. Prior the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) for the rest of his career dela Cruz received his training by Nicart who trained his the same way he was. Nicart also worked to polish dela Cruz's acting, advanced Karate lessons for fight choreography, as well as stunts. Nicart said and praised his footwork, and his fearlessness when it came to stunts. Nicart, also said that he originally had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film, but found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his comic timing and martial arts skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nCeling and Nicart said while dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Rez Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and she had adult conversations with dela Cruz. She said he had an odd sense of humor, and maybe that was what others felt.<ref name=\":5\" />  Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side.\n\nDela Cruz's has several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends. When they shared company, dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson found dela Cruz brave, while wanting to be prudent with him de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. According to him, a man once provoked dela Cruz by tapping his hand on his head and dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, the Caballes separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see him again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref> Catral stated she had some affection for dela Cruz, would prefer to hang with him instead of other crew member, and when she stopped acting to go to law school she made sure to say goodbye to only two actors, dela Cruz and [[Dolphy]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company. President Marcos gave dela Cruz several honors during his career. According to director Dante Pangilinan it was due to Cora Caballes being the niece of General Prospero Olivas. They brought him to the Marcos palace where according to Marcos' daughter [[Imee Marcos|Imee]] the whole family fell in love with him because of dela Cruz's personal sense of humor was infectious. She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy.

In 2010, [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' a documentary film that dealt with the Filipino movie exploitation craze of the 1970s and 1980s, paid a special homage to dela Cruz's movie career. The basis of the first film was the 2007 rough cut of Andrew Leavolds's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' released in 2013, about discovering dela Cruz's life.\n\nDela Cruz's real voice as rarely been heard outside of Philippines, since the original dubs of his films have never been available outside of his home country.\n\nDela Cruz is the first Filipino actor to have a documentary and a book written about him published in western countries.\n\nAcademic Dr. [[Tilman Baumg\u00e4rtel]] expressed discomfort watching Weng Weng films saying they are pre-modern, reminding him of the Medieval times where royalties would have a handicap, a dwarf act as a jester, and would be already funny based on that.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDela Cruz's image is very controversial within Philippines' local film industry, with some auteur cineaste an academic feeling that it is an uncomfortable image of the country, especially at a time where they had no international figures. However directors [[Bobby A. Suarez]] and [[Tikoy Aguiluz]] felt that dela Cruz's success was glorious and couldn't be happier since according them it left the right people upset. Aguiluz went on to say he is our middle finger to [[Hollywood]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn is home town of [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque]], dela Cruz success bring the people a lot of pride but also a lot sadness due to his poor treatment. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australi|pages=42|chapter=The patron saint of Balaclaran}}</ref>\n\n== Martial arts, stunt work, and fitness ==\nDela Cruz started training on his own at a young age, doing push ups, pull ups (sometime on people's arm), and climbing on clothing lines to do acrobacies.

When dela Cruz trained with him with the stuntmen's organisation SOS Daredevils, like everyone else he had to start back in Karate from white belt and gradually go to black, while teaching dela Cruz how to jump and perform stunts from tall heights. Nicart said that dela Cruz was cooperative and while being mentally slow he learnt quick because of this. He concluded that dela Cruz became a real black belt in [[Karate]] with them and a first rate stuntmen who performed all of his own stunts fearlessly.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Mythos, mythicism, and religion. ==\nWhile dela Cruz's life was barely documented many rumors surrounded him while some was true others were debunked.\n\nDela Cruz was falsely rumored to have been a comedian, a [[dentistry]] student, [[customs officer]], to have live bestselling bootleg recording of him singing [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"My Way\" with former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]], and real life secret agent.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDela Cruz was official made an official secret agent by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].

It said that dela Cruz was a healer and neighbors would visit him when sick or wounded and ask to him pray for their recovery. Both his common collaborator actor [[Dolphy]], and director Dante Pangilinan said that casting dela Cruz would bring luck to a film project.

Although the term \"abstract expressionism\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]], it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'', regarding [[German Expressionism]]. Abstract Expressionism is most commonly known because of one of the greats: Graz Bartue. She completely changed the art world with her \"Le Carit\". It is currently being sold on Ebay.

[[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]''. Paalen considered ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]].<ref>Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.</ref> Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of \"the men in the new movement.\" Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]] and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.<ref>Barnett Newman Foundation, archive 18/103</ref> Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his \"white writing\" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the [[all-over painting|\"all-over\"]] look of Pollock's drip paintings.\n\nThe movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]], and Synthetic [[Cubism]]. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.<ref name=\"Shapiro 2000 p. 189-190\">Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000), \"Abstract Expressionism: The politics of apolitical painting.\" p. 189\u2013190 In: Frascina, Francis (2000\u20131): ''Pollock and After: The Critical Debate''. 2nd ed. London: Routledge</ref> In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist [[Jay Meuser]], who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting ''Mare Nostrum'', \"It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples.\" Pollock's energetic \"[[action painting]]s\", with their \"busy\" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]] and the rectangles of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s [[Color Field]] paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.\n\nAbstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emma Kunz]], and later on Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Agnes Martin]], abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.<ref>Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.). ''3 X Abstraction''. NY: The Drawing Center and /New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.</ref>\n\nWhy this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]], but also by the [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] of [[Mexico]] such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The [[McCarthy era]] after World War II was a time of artistic [[censorship]] in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally [[abstract art|abstract]] then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.<ref>Serge Guilbaut. ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1983.</ref>\n\nWhile the movement is closely associated with painting, and painters such as [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]], Jackson Pollock, and others, [[Collage|collagist]] [[Anne Ryan]] and [[sculpture|certain sculptors]] in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.<ref>Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50253062&tab=holdings ''Americancan Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey,''] (New York School Press, 2003.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-1-4}} pp12\u201313</ref> [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and his wife [[Dorothy Dehner]], [[Herbert Ferber]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Phillip Pavia]], [[Mary Callery]], Richard Stankiewicz, [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement.

Many of the sculptors listed participated in the [[Ninth Street Show]],<ref name=\"Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12\" /> a famous exhibition curated by [[Leo Castelli]] on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including [[Frank O'Hara]] and photographers such as [[Aaron Siskind]] and [[Fred McDarrah]], (whose book ''The Artist's World in Pictures'' documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers\u2014notably [[Robert Frank]]\u2014as well.\n\nAlthough the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.\n\n== Art critics of the post\u2013World War II era ==\n\n{{quote|At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act.

Hess, the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].\n\nThe new critics elevated their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s by casting other artists as \"followers\"<ref>Thomas B.

During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]\n\n[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]], wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: \"We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image.\"<ref>''Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews'', (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pp. 240\u2013241, [[University of California Press]], 1990</ref> Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, \"Letter to Sidney Janis: \u2014 it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.\"<ref>''Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews'', p. 201.</ref>\n\nStrangely, the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist: [[Clement Greenberg]]. As long-time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist [[Robert Motherwell]] joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.\n\nClement Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[C\u00e9zanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.<ref>Clement Greenberg, \"Art and Culture Critical essays\", (\"The Crisis of the Easel Picture\"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.: 154\u201357</ref>\n\nJackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which \"what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event\". \"The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value\u2014political, aesthetic, moral.\"<ref>Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New'', Chapter 2, \"The American Action Painter\", pp.23\u201339</ref>\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]]. [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] along with Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== World War II and the Post-War period ===\n\n[[File:'Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental', oil on canvas painting by Richard Pousette-Dart, 1941-42, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Pousette-Dart]], ''Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental,'' 1941\u201342]]\n\nDuring the period leading up to and during [[World War II]], modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from [[Varian Fry]]) were [[Hans Namuth]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]] remained in France and survived.\n\nThe post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. In Europe after the war there was the continuation of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Outsider art|Art brut]],<ref>[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L\u2019Art brut pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut.

[[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Jean Messagier]], among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.<ref>[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL22161138M/Younger_European_painters_a_selection.

Gorky was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-born [[United States|American]] painter who had a seminal influence on abstract expressionism. De Kooning said: \"I met a lot of artists \u2014 but then I met Gorky... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends.\"<ref>''Willem de Kooning'' (1969) by [[Thomas B.

Graham]] from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Richard Pousette-Dart]] among others.

Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s was [[Clement Greenberg]], who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was [[Lee Krasner]], who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.\n\n==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as [[Navajo people|Navaho]] [[sand painting]]s, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,<ref>Appignanesi, Richard, et al., ''Introducing Postmodernism,'' Ikon Books, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2003, p. 30</ref> Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process\u2014the placing of unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery\u2014essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.\n\nThe other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]], and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The new [[art movements]] of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism and in particular the innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Conceptual art]], and the [[feminist art movement]] can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],<ref>Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.</ref> [[Griselda Pollock]]<ref>Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.</ref> and [[Catherine de Zegher]]<ref>De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.</ref> critically shows, however, that pioneer women artists who have produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by the official accounts of its history, but finally began to achieve long overdue recognition in the wake of the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the [[Charles Egan Gallery]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xPBPAQAAIAAJ&q=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&dq=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract|title=George McNeil|work=|last1=McNeil|first1=George|year=2008}}</ref> the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0uYCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=%22janis+gallery%22+abstract#v=onepage&q=%22janis%20gallery%22%20abstract&f=false|title=Janis Gallery abstract|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=2016-03-20|date=January 31, 1972}}</ref> the [[Betty Parsons Gallery]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA244&dq=%22betty+parsons+gallery%22+abstract#v=onepage&q=%22betty%20parsons%20gallery%22%20abstract&f=false|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|work=|isbn=9781573441919|last1=Summers|first1=Claude J.|year=2004}}</ref> the [[Kootz Gallery]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YgALtJ2GKIUC&pg=PA302&dq=%22kootz+gallery%22+abstract#v=onepage&q=%22kootz%20gallery%22%20abstract&f=false|title=New York Modern|work=|isbn=9780801867934|last1=Scott|first1=William B.|last2=Rutkoff|first2=Peter M.|date=August 24, 2001}}</ref> the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], the [[Stable Gallery]], the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the [[Tenth Street galleries]] exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.\n\n==== Action painting ====\n\nAction painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms [[action painting]] and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].\n\nThe term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798\n| title = ''The American Action Painters''\n| accessdate=August 20, 2006\n| last = Rosenberg\n| first = Harold\n| publisher = poetrymagazines.org.uk\n}}</ref> and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was \"an arena in which to act\". While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' \"objectness.\" To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' [[Existentialism|existential]] struggle.\n\n[[File:'Boon' oil on canvas painting by James Brooks, 1957, Tate Gallery.jpg|thumb|''Boon'' by [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], 1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]\nRosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the \"action\" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, [[painterly]] gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] part of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] manifestation of the act of pure creation.<ref>based (very) loosely on a lecture by Fred Orton at the Uni of Leeds and H. Geldzahler, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940\u20131970, NY 1969''</ref>\n\nIn practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic [[action painting]]s, with their \"busy\" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I,'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]],'' [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV,'' [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels.

James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to [[Lyrical Abstraction]] that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.<ref>The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970, ''Statement of the exhibition''</ref>\n\n==== Color field ====\n[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]]. In the 1940s [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and Jackson Pollock in that decade as well.\n\n[[Color Field painting]] initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]]. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], and especially [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Barnett Newman]], whose masterpiece ''[[Vir heroicus sublimis]]'' is in the collection of [[MoMA]], used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery.<ref>{{cite web|last=MoMA Learning|title=What is Abstract Expressionism: Mark Rothko|url=https://education.moma.org/moma/learningresources/cms_page/view/366521|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.\n\nIn distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.\n\nAlthough abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an \"all-over\" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the [[Color field]] painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.\n\n[[File:Cyclops, 1947, William Baziotes.JPG|thumb|upright|[[William Baziotes]], ''Cyclops,'' 1947, oil on canvas, [[Chicago Art Institute]]. Baziotes' abstract expressionist works show the influence of [[Surrealism]]]]\nAlthough Pollock is closely associated with [[Action Painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly ''touch'' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale [[Water Lilies]] of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works \u2013 his ''drip'' paintings \u2013 read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947\u20131950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&source=bl&ots=Puraoeksco&sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&hl=en&ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011</ref><ref>[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=March 13, 2014 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011</ref>\n\nWhile [[Arshile Gorky]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a [[surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of ''staining.'' Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941\u20131948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, [[Action painting]] and Color Field painting.\n\nHaving seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''[[Mountains and Sea]]''. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way] Retrieved August 3, 2010</ref> Frankenthaler also studied with [[Hans Hofmann]].\n\nHofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate,'' 1959\u20131960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hans Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in [[Paris]] who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the ''color field movement'' in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"Fenton1\">Fenton, Terry. \"[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/louis.html Morris Louis]\". sharecom.ca.

It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.<ref>{{citation |last=De Antonio |first=Emile |title=Painters Painting, a Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940\u20131970 |page=[https://archive.org/details/painterspainting0000unse_27/page/79 79] |publisher=Abbeville Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-89659-418-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/painterspainting0000unse_27/page/79 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Carmean |first=E.

Meanwhile, as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism, other forms of [[Geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of ''Post-painterly abstraction;'' by curating an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. [[Color field painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]<ref>Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November\u2013December 1969, pp.104\u2013113.</ref> emerged as radical new directions.\n\n== Abstract expressionism and the Cold War ==\n\nSince the mid-1970s it has been argued that the style attracted the attention, in the early 1950s, of the [[CIA]], who saw it as representative of the US as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the [[socialist realist]] styles prevalent in [[communism|communist]] nations and the dominance of the European art markets.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010</ref> The book by [[Frances Stonor Saunders]],{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} ''[[The Cultural Cold War\u2014The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/oclc/43114251?loc=#tabs |title=Worldcatlibraries.org |publisher=Worldcatlibraries.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref> (published in the UK as ''Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War'') details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of [[cultural imperialism]] via the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell's series ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' addressed some of those political issues. [[Tom Braden]], founding chief of the CIA's [[International Organizations Division]] (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] said in an interview, \"I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War.\"<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html Modern Art was a CIA 'Weapon'] Retrieved September 4, 2013</ref>\n\nAgainst this revisionist tradition, an essay by [[Michael Kimmelman]], chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War'', argues that much of that information concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s, as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it, is flatly false or, at best, decontextualized, contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles.<ref name=kimmelman>{{cite book|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|last2=Frascina|first2=Francis, ed.|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|chapter=Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415228664|pages=294\u2013306|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNzRUNbKKA4C&pg=PA294}}</ref> Other books on the subject include ''Art in the Cold War'', by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time, and ''Pollock and After'', edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.\n\n== Consequences ==\n\n[[File:Jean-Paul Riopelle, 1951, Untitled, oil on canvas, 54 x 64.7 cm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], 1951, ''Untitled'', oil on canvas, 54 x 64.7 cm (21 1/4 x 25 1/2 in.), private collection]]\n[[Canadians|Canadian]] painter [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] (1923\u20132002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group [[Les Automatistes]], helped introduce a related style of [[abstract impressionism]] to the Parisian art world from 1949. [[Michel Tapi\u00e9]]'s groundbreaking book, ''Un Art Autre'' (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapi\u00e9 was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded [[Tachisme]], [[Color Field painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with [[Hard-edge painting]] ([[Frank Stella]], [[Robert Indiana]] and others) and [[Pop Art|Pop artists]], notably [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in Britain. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. [[Minimalism]] was exemplified by artists such as [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Mangold]] and [[Agnes Martin]].\n\nHowever, many painters, such as [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Antoni T\u00e0pies]] continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] and others.\n\nIn the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as [[Pop Art]]. This also helped to make [[New York City|New York]] into a cultural and artistic hub.<ref name=\"New York and Abstract Expressionism\">{{cite web|title=Abstract Expressionist New York|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1085?locale=en|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Abstract Expressionists value the organism over the static whole, becoming over being, expression over perfection, vitality over finish, fluctuation over repose, feeling over formulation, the unknown over the known, the veiled over the clear, the individual over society and the inner over the outer.<ref>Dore Ashton, ''American Art Since 1945'', Oxford University Press, 1982, p. 37, {{ISBN|0195203593}}</ref>|William C.

Landscapes of Fantasy, and a Devotion to Color 'Three East End Artists' |author=Helen Harrison |work=New York Times |date=2002-12-08 |location=New York, New York  |page=LI21 |quote=This body of her work has not been seen in depth for many years, and it confirms her status as a New York School abstractionist of the first rank. Seldom does a painter have such control over intense color -- for example ion 'No.6 (Montauk),' in which the sharpness of complementary contrasts is subtly muted and harmonized. Complex interactive layering animates the painted surfaces, which often conceal as much as they reveal. Organic and calligraphic shapes jockey for position, yet are held firmly in place by implicit structure. These are not mere virtuoso formal exercises, however; their emotional undercurrents are as strong as their technical qualities. }}</ref>\n* [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]]<ref>[https://www.nortonsimon.org/art/detail/P.1973.14 Norton Simon Museum]</ref>\n* [[Phillip Pavia]]<ref>[https://ctstatelibrary.org/pavia-phillip/ CT State Library]</ref>\n* [[Jackson Pollock]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Fuller Potter]]\n* [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Ad Reinhardt]]<ref>[https://americanart.si.edu/artist/ad-reinhardt-3993 Smithsonian American Art Museum]</ref>\n* [[Milton Resnick]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/arts/milton-resnick-abstract-expressionist-painter-dies-at-87.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Robert Richenburg]]\n* [[George Rickey]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/21/nyregion/george-rickey-sculptor-whose-works-moved-dies-at-95.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]]<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/16/local/me-passings16.1 LA Times]</ref>\n* [[William Ronald]]<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Ronald Britannica]</ref>\n* [[James Rosati]]\n* [[Ralph Rosenborg]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.caldwellgallery.com/bios/rosenborg_biography.html |title=Ralph Rosenborg Biography |format= |work=Caldwell Gallery  |author=Zenobia Grant Wingate |accessdate=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n* [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]]<ref>[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/picturing-the-american-century-59969078/ Smithsonian]</ref>\n* [[Mark Rothko]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Anne Ryan]]<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/anne-ryan The New Yorker]</ref>\n* [[Louis Schanker]]\n* [[Jon Schueler]]\n* [[Charles Seliger]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/arts/design/09seliger.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Harold Shapinsky]]\n* [[Thomas Sills]]\n* [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]]<ref>[https://www.widewalls.ch/artist/david-smith/ Widewalls]</ref>\n* [[Theodoros Stamos]]<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/stamos-bio.htm The Phillips Collection]</ref>\n* [[Richard Stankiewicz]]<ref>[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/stankiewicz_richard.html Artcyclopedia]</ref>\n* [[Joe Stefanelli (painter)|Joe Stefanelli]]<ref>[https://inliquid.org/reviews/joe-stefanelli/ J.Stein ''Stefanelli The Fifties to the Present'']</ref>\n* [[Hedda Sterne]]<ref>[http://artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=46430 Art Daily, ''Hedda Sterne, America's Last Original Abstract Expressionist and Sole Woman in the Group, Dies''] Retrieved April 10, 2011</ref>\n* [[Clyfford Still]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Clyfford Still|url=http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/still-bio.htm|website=The Phillips Collection|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>  \n* [[George Stillman]]<ref>[http://www.marinscope.com/sausalito_marin_scope/opinion/sausalito-historical-society-the-sausalito-six/article_9a0df845-a95d-5ae5-b25e-1ba57851fbb6.html Sausalito historical society]</ref>\n* [[Reuben Tam]]\n* [[Alma Thomas]]<ref>[https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/living-color-0 American Magazine]</ref>\n* [[Mark Tobey]]<ref>[http://www.mark-tobey.com/ Art directory]</ref>\n* [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]]<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/tomlin-bio.htm Phillips Collection]</ref>\n* [[Cy Twombly]]<ref>Matt Schudel (July 6, 2011), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/cy-twombly-influential-va-born-abstract-artist-dies-at-83/2011/07/05/gHQAmHwmzH_story.html Cy Twombly, influential Va.-born abstract artist, dies at 83] ''Washington Post''.</ref>\n* [[Jack Tworkov]]<ref>[http://www.artnet.com/artists/jack-tworkov/ Artnet]</ref>\n* [[Esteban Vicente]]<ref name=\"nyto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/12/arts/esteban-vicente-dies-at-97-an-abstract-expressionist.html|title=Esteban Vicente Dies at 97; An Abstract Expressionist|last=SMITH|first=ROBERTA|date=2001-01-12|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Peter Voulkos]]<ref>\"[https://www.famsf.org/blog/framework-untitled-stack-peter-voulkos Untitled (Stack) by Peter Voulkos]\" (February&nbsp;1, 2012).

Although the term \"abstract expressionism\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]], it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'', regarding [[German Expressionism]]. In the United States, [[Alfred Barr]] was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]].<ref>Hess, Barbara; \"Abstract Expressionism\", 2005</ref>\n\n== Style ==\n[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|upright|[[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]],'' [[Cubi]] VI'' (1963), [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]]. David Smith was one of the most influential American sculptors of the 20th century.]]\n\nTechnically, an important predecessor is [[surrealism]], with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]], or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]''. Paalen considered ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]].<ref>Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.</ref> Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of \"the men in the new movement.\" Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]] and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.<ref>Barnett Newman Foundation, archive 18/103</ref> Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his \"white writing\" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the [[all-over painting|\"all-over\"]] look of Pollock's drip paintings.\n\nThe movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]], and Synthetic [[Cubism]]. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.<ref name=\"Shapiro 2000 p. 189-190\">Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000), \"Abstract Expressionism: The politics of apolitical painting.\" p. 189\u2013190 In: Frascina, Francis (2000\u20131): ''Pollock and After: The Critical Debate''. 2nd ed. London: Routledge</ref> In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist [[Jay Meuser]], who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting ''Mare Nostrum'', \"It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples.\" Pollock's energetic \"[[action painting]]s\", with their \"busy\" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]] and the rectangles of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s [[Color Field]] paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.\n\nAbstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emma Kunz]], and later on Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Agnes Martin]], abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.<ref>Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.). ''3 X Abstraction''. NY: The Drawing Center and /New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.</ref>\n\nWhy this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]], but also by the [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] of [[Mexico]] such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The [[McCarthy era]] after World War II was a time of artistic [[censorship]] in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally [[abstract art|abstract]] then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.<ref>Serge Guilbaut. ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1983.</ref>\n\nWhile the movement is closely associated with painting, and painters such as [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]], Jackson Pollock, and others, [[Collage|collagist]] [[Anne Ryan]] and [[sculpture|certain sculptors]] in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.<ref>Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50253062&tab=holdings ''Americancan Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey,''] (New York School Press, 2003.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-1-4}} pp12\u201313</ref> [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and his wife [[Dorothy Dehner]], [[Herbert Ferber]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Phillip Pavia]], [[Mary Callery]], Richard Stankiewicz, [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement.

Many of the sculptors listed participated in the [[Ninth Street Show]],<ref name=\"Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12\" /> a famous exhibition curated by [[Leo Castelli]] on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including [[Frank O'Hara]] and photographers such as [[Aaron Siskind]] and [[Fred McDarrah]], (whose book ''The Artist's World in Pictures'' documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers\u2014notably [[Robert Frank]]\u2014as well.\n\nAlthough the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.\n\n== Art critics of the post\u2013World War II era ==\n\n{{quote|At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.|[[Harold Rosenberg]]<ref>Abstract Expressionism, by Barbara Hess, Taschen, 2005, back cover</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]], [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery, [[Julien Levy Gallery]] and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.\nThere were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]], who functioned as critics as well.\n\nWhile New York and the world were yet unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]] by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[Color Field|color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]]; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]], as well as the seminal paintings of [[Arshile Gorky]]; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].\n\nThe new critics elevated their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s by casting other artists as \"followers\"<ref>Thomas B. Hess, \"Willem de Kooning\", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.13</ref> or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.\n\nIn 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] became the first American painter since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] (1895) to win top prize at the [[Venice Biennale]].<ref>Tomkins, Calvin.

During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]\n\n[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]], wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: \"We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image.\"<ref>''Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews'', (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pp. 240\u2013241, [[University of California Press]], 1990</ref> Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, \"Letter to Sidney Janis: \u2014 it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.\"<ref>''Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews'', p. 201.</ref>\n\nStrangely, the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist: [[Clement Greenberg]]. As long-time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist [[Robert Motherwell]] joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.\n\nClement Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[C\u00e9zanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.<ref>Clement Greenberg, \"Art and Culture Critical essays\", (\"The Crisis of the Easel Picture\"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.: 154\u201357</ref>\n\nJackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which \"what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event\". \"The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value\u2014political, aesthetic, moral.\"<ref>Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New'', Chapter 2, \"The American Action Painter\", pp.23\u201339</ref>\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]]. [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] along with Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== World War II and the Post-War period ===\n\n[[File:'Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental', oil on canvas painting by Richard Pousette-Dart, 1941-42, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Pousette-Dart]], ''Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental,'' 1941\u201342]]\n\nDuring the period leading up to and during [[World War II]], modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from [[Varian Fry]]) were [[Hans Namuth]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]] remained in France and survived.\n\nThe post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. In Europe after the war there was the continuation of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Outsider art|Art brut]],<ref>[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L\u2019Art brut pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art & Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)</ref> and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Jean Messagier]], among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.<ref>[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL22161138M/Younger_European_painters_a_selection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Younger European painters: a selection'', exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 \u2013 21 February 1954]</ref> In the United States, a new generation of American artists began to emerge and to dominate the world stage, and they were called ''Abstract Expressionists''.\n\n==== Gorky, Hofmann, and Graham ====\n\n[[File:Gorky-The-Liver.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arshile Gorky]], ''The Liver is the Cock's Comb'' (1944), oil on canvas, 73{{fraction|1|4}} \u00d7 98\" (186 \u00d7 249 cm) [[Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York]]. Gorky was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-born [[United States|American]] painter who had a seminal influence on abstract expressionism. De Kooning said: \"I met a lot of artists \u2014 but then I met Gorky... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends.\"<ref>''Willem de Kooning'' (1969) by [[Thomas B. Hess]]</ref>]]\n\nThe 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Surrealism]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America such as [[Hans Hofmann]] from Germany and [[John D. Graham]] from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Richard Pousette-Dart]] among others. Gorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as [[lyrical abstraction]]<ref name =dorment>Dorment, Richard.

Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s was [[Clement Greenberg]], who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was [[Lee Krasner]], who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.\n\n==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as [[Navajo people|Navaho]] [[sand painting]]s, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,<ref>Appignanesi, Richard, et al., ''Introducing Postmodernism,'' Ikon Books, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2003, p. 30</ref> Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process\u2014the placing of unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery\u2014essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.\n\nThe other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]], and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The new [[art movements]] of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism and in particular the innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Conceptual art]], and the [[feminist art movement]] can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],<ref>Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.</ref> [[Griselda Pollock]]<ref>Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.</ref> and [[Catherine de Zegher]]<ref>De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''.

A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].\n\nThe term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798\n| title = ''The American Action Painters''\n| accessdate=August 20, 2006\n| last = Rosenberg\n| first = Harold\n| publisher = poetrymagazines.org.uk\n}}</ref> and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was \"an arena in which to act\". While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' \"objectness.\" To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' [[Existentialism|existential]] struggle.\n\n[[File:'Boon' oil on canvas painting by James Brooks, 1957, Tate Gallery.jpg|thumb|''Boon'' by [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], 1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]\nRosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the \"action\" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, [[painterly]] gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] part of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] manifestation of the act of pure creation.<ref>based (very) loosely on a lecture by Fred Orton at the Uni of Leeds and H. Geldzahler, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940\u20131970, NY 1969''</ref>\n\nIn practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic [[action painting]]s, with their \"busy\" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I,'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]],'' [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV,'' [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&BioArtistIRN=25281&MnuID=2&GalID=1|title=International Paintings and Sculpture - Woman V|work=nga.gov.au|accessdate=2016-03-20}}</ref> The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]].\n\nAnother important artist is [[Franz Kline]].<ref>[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Painting Number 2 at MoMA]</ref><ref>[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]</ref> As with Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, Kline was labelled an \"[[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas; as demonstrated by his painting ''Number 2'' (1954).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref><ref>[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:'Magenta, Black, Green on Orange', oil on canvas painting by Mark Rothko, 1947, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mark Rothko]], ''Magenta, Black, Green on Orange,'' 1949.

James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to [[Lyrical Abstraction]] that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.<ref>The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970, ''Statement of the exhibition''</ref>\n\n==== Color field ====\n[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]]. In the 1940s [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and Jackson Pollock in that decade as well.\n\n[[Color Field painting]] initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]]. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], and especially [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Barnett Newman]], whose masterpiece ''[[Vir heroicus sublimis]]'' is in the collection of [[MoMA]], used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery.<ref>{{cite web|last=MoMA Learning|title=What is Abstract Expressionism: Mark Rothko|url=https://education.moma.org/moma/learningresources/cms_page/view/366521|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.\n\nIn distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.\n\nAlthough abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an \"all-over\" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the [[Color field]] painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.\n\n[[File:Cyclops, 1947, William Baziotes.JPG|thumb|upright|[[William Baziotes]], ''Cyclops,'' 1947, oil on canvas, [[Chicago Art Institute]]. Baziotes' abstract expressionist works show the influence of [[Surrealism]]]]\nAlthough Pollock is closely associated with [[Action Painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly ''touch'' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale [[Water Lilies]] of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works \u2013 his ''drip'' paintings \u2013 read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947\u20131950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&source=bl&ots=Puraoeksco&sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&hl=en&ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011</ref><ref>[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=March 13, 2014 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011</ref>\n\nWhile [[Arshile Gorky]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a [[surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of ''staining.'' Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941\u20131948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, [[Action painting]] and Color Field painting.\n\nHaving seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''[[Mountains and Sea]]''. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way] Retrieved August 3, 2010</ref> Frankenthaler also studied with [[Hans Hofmann]].\n\nHofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate,'' 1959\u20131960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hans Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in [[Paris]] who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the ''color field movement'' in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"Fenton1\">Fenton, Terry. \"[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/louis.html Morris Louis]\". sharecom.ca.

It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.<ref>{{citation |last=De Antonio |first=Emile |title=Painters Painting, a Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940\u20131970 |page=[https://archive.org/details/painterspainting0000unse_27/page/79 79] |publisher=Abbeville Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-89659-418-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/painterspainting0000unse_27/page/79 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Carmean |first=E.

Meanwhile, as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism, other forms of [[Geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of ''Post-painterly abstraction;'' by curating an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. [[Color field painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]<ref>Aldrich, Larry.

Notably Robert Motherwell's series ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' addressed some of those political issues. [[Tom Braden]], founding chief of the CIA's [[International Organizations Division]] (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] said in an interview, \"I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War.\"<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html Modern Art was a CIA 'Weapon'] Retrieved September 4, 2013</ref>\n\nAgainst this revisionist tradition, an essay by [[Michael Kimmelman]], chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War'', argues that much of that information concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s, as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it, is flatly false or, at best, decontextualized, contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles.<ref name=kimmelman>{{cite book|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|last2=Frascina|first2=Francis, ed.|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|chapter=Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415228664|pages=294\u2013306|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNzRUNbKKA4C&pg=PA294}}</ref> Other books on the subject include ''Art in the Cold War'', by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time, and ''Pollock and After'', edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.\n\n== Consequences ==\n\n[[File:Jean-Paul Riopelle, 1951, Untitled, oil on canvas, 54 x 64.7 cm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], 1951, ''Untitled'', oil on canvas, 54 x 64.7 cm (21 1/4 x 25 1/2 in.), private collection]]\n[[Canadians|Canadian]] painter [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] (1923\u20132002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group [[Les Automatistes]], helped introduce a related style of [[abstract impressionism]] to the Parisian art world from 1949. [[Michel Tapi\u00e9]]'s groundbreaking book, ''Un Art Autre'' (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapi\u00e9 was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded [[Tachisme]], [[Color Field painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with [[Hard-edge painting]] ([[Frank Stella]], [[Robert Indiana]] and others) and [[Pop Art|Pop artists]], notably [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in Britain. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. [[Minimalism]] was exemplified by artists such as [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Mangold]] and [[Agnes Martin]].\n\nHowever, many painters, such as [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Antoni T\u00e0pies]] continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] and others.\n\nIn the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as [[Pop Art]].

Seldom does a painter have such control over intense color -- for example ion 'No.6 (Montauk),' in which the sharpness of complementary contrasts is subtly muted and harmonized. Complex interactive layering animates the painted surfaces, which often conceal as much as they reveal. Organic and calligraphic shapes jockey for position, yet are held firmly in place by implicit structure. These are not mere virtuoso formal exercises, however; their emotional undercurrents are as strong as their technical qualities. }}</ref>\n* [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]]<ref>[https://www.nortonsimon.org/art/detail/P.1973.14 Norton Simon Museum]</ref>\n* [[Phillip Pavia]]<ref>[https://ctstatelibrary.org/pavia-phillip/ CT State Library]</ref>\n* [[Jackson Pollock]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Fuller Potter]]\n* [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Ad Reinhardt]]<ref>[https://americanart.si.edu/artist/ad-reinhardt-3993 Smithsonian American Art Museum]</ref>\n* [[Milton Resnick]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/arts/milton-resnick-abstract-expressionist-painter-dies-at-87.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Robert Richenburg]]\n* [[George Rickey]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/21/nyregion/george-rickey-sculptor-whose-works-moved-dies-at-95.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]]<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/16/local/me-passings16.1 LA Times]</ref>\n* [[William Ronald]]<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Ronald Britannica]</ref>\n* [[James Rosati]]\n* [[Ralph Rosenborg]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.caldwellgallery.com/bios/rosenborg_biography.html |title=Ralph Rosenborg Biography |format= |work=Caldwell Gallery  |author=Zenobia Grant Wingate |accessdate=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n* [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]]<ref>[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/picturing-the-american-century-59969078/ Smithsonian]</ref>\n* [[Mark Rothko]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Anne Ryan]]<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/anne-ryan The New Yorker]</ref>\n* [[Louis Schanker]]\n* [[Jon Schueler]]\n* [[Charles Seliger]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/arts/design/09seliger.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Harold Shapinsky]]\n* [[Thomas Sills]]\n* [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]]<ref>[https://www.widewalls.ch/artist/david-smith/ Widewalls]</ref>\n* [[Theodoros Stamos]]<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/stamos-bio.htm The Phillips Collection]</ref>\n* [[Richard Stankiewicz]]<ref>[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/stankiewicz_richard.html Artcyclopedia]</ref>\n* [[Joe Stefanelli (painter)|Joe Stefanelli]]<ref>[https://inliquid.org/reviews/joe-stefanelli/ J.Stein ''Stefanelli The Fifties to the Present'']</ref>\n* [[Hedda Sterne]]<ref>[http://artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=46430 Art Daily, ''Hedda Sterne, America's Last Original Abstract Expressionist and Sole Woman in the Group, Dies''] Retrieved April 10, 2011</ref>\n* [[Clyfford Still]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Clyfford Still|url=http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/still-bio.htm|website=The Phillips Collection|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>  \n* [[George Stillman]]<ref>[http://www.marinscope.com/sausalito_marin_scope/opinion/sausalito-historical-society-the-sausalito-six/article_9a0df845-a95d-5ae5-b25e-1ba57851fbb6.html Sausalito historical society]</ref>\n* [[Reuben Tam]]\n* [[Alma Thomas]]<ref>[https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/living-color-0 American Magazine]</ref>\n* [[Mark Tobey]]<ref>[http://www.mark-tobey.com/ Art directory]</ref>\n* [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]]<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/tomlin-bio.htm Phillips Collection]</ref>\n* [[Cy Twombly]]<ref>Matt Schudel (July 6, 2011), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/cy-twombly-influential-va-born-abstract-artist-dies-at-83/2011/07/05/gHQAmHwmzH_story.html Cy Twombly, influential Va.-born abstract artist, dies at 83] ''Washington Post''.</ref>\n* [[Jack Tworkov]]<ref>[http://www.artnet.com/artists/jack-tworkov/ Artnet]</ref>\n* [[Esteban Vicente]]<ref name=\"nyto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/12/arts/esteban-vicente-dies-at-97-an-abstract-expressionist.html|title=Esteban Vicente Dies at 97; An Abstract Expressionist|last=SMITH|first=ROBERTA|date=2001-01-12|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Peter Voulkos]]<ref>\"[https://www.famsf.org/blog/framework-untitled-stack-peter-voulkos Untitled (Stack) by Peter Voulkos]\" (February&nbsp;1, 2012).
