{"title_page": "Piano Variations (Copland)", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=April 2017}}\nThe '''Piano Variations''' of [[United States|American]] [[composer]] [[Aaron Copland]] were written for [[piano solo]] from January to October 1930. They were dedicated to American writer and literary critic [[Gerald Sykes]] (c. 1904\u20131984) {{harv|Anon.|1984}}, and were originally published in 1932 by Cos Cob Press, which merged with Arrow Music Press in 1938 and was taken over by [[Boosey & Hawkes]] in 1956. The approximate performance time is 11 minutes.\n\n==Background==\nThe Piano Variations were a product of Copland's second-style period, also called the abstract period, which comprised only instrumental (non-vocal) compositions. During this time, the composer moved away from the jazzy idioms he experimented with in the 1920s and started working more in the direction of [[absolute music]]. The influence of composition pedagogue [[Nadia Boulanger]], with whom Copland studied in Paris at [[the Fontainebleau School of Music]] for Americans, is prevalent in the formal style, logic, patterns, and attention to detail in the Piano Variations and other works in this period.\n\nCopland stated that he worked on the [[variation (music)|variations]] individually without an agenda for fitting them together or sequencing them, which seems to contradict the piece's highly ordered construction and seemingly inevitable development. Copland acknowledged this contradiction but maintained that, in fact, \"One fine day when the time was right, the order of the variations fell into place\" {{harv|Butterworth|1985|loc=203}}. Copland had ambitious plans for this \"serious piano piece\"\u2014the first of three including the Piano Variations (1930), the Piano Sonata (1939\u201341), and the Piano Fantasy (1957); he worked painstakingly and thought at epic proportions, saying he \"should like to call them like [[Bach]] did the ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''\u2014but thus far haven't been able to think up a good one\" {{harv|Perlis|2002|loc=62}}.\n\n==Transcription as Orchestral Variations (1957)==\n\nCopland transcribed the Piano Variations for orchestra in 1957 after a commission from the [[Louisville Orchestra]]. These Orchestral Variations were premiered the following year under conductor [[Robert Whitney (conductor)|Robert Whitney]]. Copland regarded the \"lean, percussive and rather harmonically severe\" quality of the piano {{harv|Johnson|2005}} as essential to the Piano Variations in 1930, but after 27 years, reinvented the work to take advantage of a full orchestral palette. The Orchestral Variations offer a new perspective on the work, focusing instead on the contrasts of its multifarious moods and colors.\n\nThe Orchestral Variations are scored for the following instrumentation.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Woodwind]]s:\n:2 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (both doubling [[piccolo]])\n:[[Oboe]]\n:[[English horn]]\n:2 B-flat [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[bass clarinet]])\n:2 [[bassoon]]s\n;[[Brass instrument|Brass]]:\n:4 [[French horn|horn]]s in F\n:2 [[trumpet]]s in B-flat\n:3 [[trombone]]s\n:[[Tuba]]\n\n;[[Harp]]\n;[[String section|Strings]]\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Percussion]]:\n:[[Timpani]]\n\n:2 Percussionists playing:\n::[[Snare drum]]\n::[[Tenor drum]]\n::[[Bass drum]]\n::[[Bongo drums]]\n::[[Conga drum]]\n::[[Cymbal]]s\n::[[Tam-tam]]\n::[[Woodblock (instrument)|Wood block]]\n::[[Glockenspiel]]\n::[[Xylophone]]\n::[[Tubular bell]]s\n::[[Antique cymbal]]s\n::[[Cow bell]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reception==\nCopland regarded pianist [[Walter Gieseking]] very highly for his refined tone and subtle coloration, especially in the performance of [[Debussy]], and insisted that no one else could give a satisfactory premiere of his masterpiece. Unfortunately, Gieseking (who had performed in the premiere of the piano trio ''Vitebsk'' in New York in 1929) turned down Copland's request for a premiere due to the piece's \"crude dissonances\" and \"severity of style\" {{harv|Pollack|1999|loc=151, 561}}. Copland thus premiered the piece himself at a [[League of Composers]] Concert in New York on January 4, 1931.\n\nThe Piano Variations were praised in some esoteric circles, but the public was generally courteous but lukewarm in its reception. The work was variously described as new, strange, dissonant, stark, bare, and disconcerting. Critic [[Paul Rosenfeld]] contemplated its \"flinty, metallic sonorities.\"{{Cite quote|date=October 2011}} American composer [[Marc Blitzstein]] called it \"Lithic.\"{{Cite quote|date=October 2011}} The cold, hard tone of Copland's playing at the premiere, far from that of a concert pianist, lent a sharper edge to an already austere work. [[Leonard Bernstein]] later reported that he adored the piece, which was \"hard as nails,\" and also used it at parties to \"empty the room, guaranteed, in two minutes.\" It was to him a \"synonym for modern music\u2014so prophetic, harsh and wonderful, and so full of modern feeling and thinking\" {{harv|Greenfield, March, and Layton|1996|loc=103}}.\n\nDespite the wide spectrum of opinion, the Piano Variations were immediately recognized for their originality and made a lasting impression. The New York ''Herald Tribune'' reported that, in the piece, Copland \"sardonically thumbed his nose at all those esthetic attributes which have hitherto been considered essential to the creation of music\" {{harv|Sales and Steinberg|2001|loc=47}}. The work is now regarded{{by whom|date=October 2011}} as one of the most significant in contemporary piano literature.\n\nDancer-choreographer [[Martha Graham]] requested permission to choreograph a solo piece on the Piano Variations. With Copland's consent, she produced ''Dithyrambic'', an evocation of [[Dionysus]] that was received with the highest enthusiasm {{harv|Pollock|1999|loc=154}}. Copland admitted to being \"utterly astonished that anyone could consider this kind of music suitable for dance&nbsp;... although her choreography was considered as complex and abstruse as my music\" {{harv|Soares|1992|loc=104}}.\n\n==The Variations==\n\n===Overview===\nUnlike a traditional theme and variations, Copland's Piano Variations are not episodic {{harv|Rapp|1949|loc=81}}. They are continuously played through, in an undisrupted development of the seven-note \"row\" in the theme from which Copland builds the rest of the piece, \"in what I hope is a consistently logical way\" {{harv|Copland|2004|loc=354}}. All of the content can be traced back to this or transpositions of this seven-note [[motif (music)|motif]], suggesting the [[serialism|serialist]] techniques of [[Schoenberg]]. The concision, rigor, and lack of ornamentation have been compared to that of the style of [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Oja|2000|loc=246}}. The [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonances]] (ubiquitous minor seconds, major sevenths and ninths) are precisely chosen for their degree of \"shock value\".

They were dedicated to American writer and literary critic [[Gerald Sykes]] (c. 1904\u20131984) {{harv|Anon.|1984}}, and were originally published in 1932 by Cos Cob Press, which merged with Arrow Music Press in 1938 and was taken over by [[Boosey & Hawkes]] in 1956. The approximate performance time is 11 minutes.\n\n==Background==\nThe Piano Variations were a product of Copland's second-style period, also called the abstract period, which comprised only instrumental (non-vocal) compositions. During this time, the composer moved away from the jazzy idioms he experimented with in the 1920s and started working more in the direction of [[absolute music]]. The influence of composition pedagogue [[Nadia Boulanger]], with whom Copland studied in Paris at [[the Fontainebleau School of Music]] for Americans, is prevalent in the formal style, logic, patterns, and attention to detail in the Piano Variations and other works in this period.\n\nCopland stated that he worked on the [[variation (music)|variations]] individually without an agenda for fitting them together or sequencing them, which seems to contradict the piece's highly ordered construction and seemingly inevitable development. Copland acknowledged this contradiction but maintained that, in fact, \"One fine day when the time was right, the order of the variations fell into place\" {{harv|Butterworth|1985|loc=203}}. Copland had ambitious plans for this \"serious piano piece\"\u2014the first of three including the Piano Variations (1930), the Piano Sonata (1939\u201341), and the Piano Fantasy (1957); he worked painstakingly and thought at epic proportions, saying he \"should like to call them like [[Bach]] did the ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''\u2014but thus far haven't been able to think up a good one\" {{harv|Perlis|2002|loc=62}}.\n\n==Transcription as Orchestral Variations (1957)==\n\nCopland transcribed the Piano Variations for orchestra in 1957 after a commission from the [[Louisville Orchestra]]. These Orchestral Variations were premiered the following year under conductor [[Robert Whitney (conductor)|Robert Whitney]]. Copland regarded the \"lean, percussive and rather harmonically severe\" quality of the piano {{harv|Johnson|2005}} as essential to the Piano Variations in 1930, but after 27 years, reinvented the work to take advantage of a full orchestral palette. The Orchestral Variations offer a new perspective on the work, focusing instead on the contrasts of its multifarious moods and colors.\n\nThe Orchestral Variations are scored for the following instrumentation.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Woodwind]]s:\n:2 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (both doubling [[piccolo]])\n:[[Oboe]]\n:[[English horn]]\n:2 B-flat [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[bass clarinet]])\n:2 [[bassoon]]s\n;[[Brass instrument|Brass]]:\n:4 [[French horn|horn]]s in F\n:2 [[trumpet]]s in B-flat\n:3 [[trombone]]s\n:[[Tuba]]\n\n;[[Harp]]\n;[[String section|Strings]]\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Percussion]]:\n:[[Timpani]]\n\n:2 Percussionists playing:\n::[[Snare drum]]\n::[[Tenor drum]]\n::[[Bass drum]]\n::[[Bongo drums]]\n::[[Conga drum]]\n::[[Cymbal]]s\n::[[Tam-tam]]\n::[[Woodblock (instrument)|Wood block]]\n::[[Glockenspiel]]\n::[[Xylophone]]\n::[[Tubular bell]]s\n::[[Antique cymbal]]s\n::[[Cow bell]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reception==\nCopland regarded pianist [[Walter Gieseking]] very highly for his refined tone and subtle coloration, especially in the performance of [[Debussy]], and insisted that no one else could give a satisfactory premiere of his masterpiece. Unfortunately, Gieseking (who had performed in the premiere of the piano trio ''Vitebsk'' in New York in 1929) turned down Copland's request for a premiere due to the piece's \"crude dissonances\" and \"severity of style\" {{harv|Pollock|1999|loc=151, 561}}. Copland thus premiered the piece himself at a [[League of Composers]] Concert in New York on January 4, 1931.\n\nThe Piano Variations were praised in some esoteric circles, but the public was generally courteous but lukewarm in its reception. The work was variously described as new, strange, dissonant, stark, bare, and disconcerting. Critic [[Paul Rosenfeld]] contemplated its \"flinty, metallic sonorities.\"{{Cite quote|date=October 2011}} American composer [[Marc Blitzstein]] called it \"Lithic.\"{{Cite quote|date=October 2011}} The cold, hard tone of Copland's playing at the premiere, far from that of a concert pianist, lent a sharper edge to an already austere work. [[Leonard Bernstein]] later reported that he adored the piece, which was \"hard as nails,\" and also used it at parties to \"empty the room, guaranteed, in two minutes.\" It was to him a \"synonym for modern music\u2014so prophetic, harsh and wonderful, and so full of modern feeling and thinking\" {{harv|Greenfield, March, and Layton|1996|loc=103}}.\n\nDespite the wide spectrum of opinion, the Piano Variations were immediately recognized for their originality and made a lasting impression. The New York ''Herald Tribune'' reported that, in the piece, Copland \"sardonically thumbed his nose at all those esthetic attributes which have hitherto been considered essential to the creation of music\" {{harv|Sales and Steinberg|2001|loc=47}}. The work is now regarded{{by whom|date=October 2011}} as one of the most significant in contemporary piano literature.\n\nDancer-choreographer [[Martha Graham]] requested permission to choreograph a solo piece on the Piano Variations. With Copland's consent, she produced ''Dithyrambic'', an evocation of [[Dionysus]] that was received with the highest enthusiasm {{harv|Pollock|1999|loc=154}}. Copland admitted to being \"utterly astonished that anyone could consider this kind of music suitable for dance&nbsp;... although her choreography was considered as complex and abstruse as my music\" {{harv|Soares|1992|loc=104}}.\n\n==The Variations==\n\n===Overview===\nUnlike a traditional theme and variations, Copland's Piano Variations are not episodic {{harv|Rapp|1949|loc=81}}. They are continuously played through, in an undisrupted development of the seven-note \"row\" in the theme from which Copland builds the rest of the piece, \"in what I hope is a consistently logical way\" {{harv|Copland|2004|loc=354}}. All of the content can be traced back to this or transpositions of this seven-note [[motif (music)|motif]], suggesting the [[serialism|serialist]] techniques of [[Schoenberg]]. The concision, rigor, and lack of ornamentation have been compared to that of the style of [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Oja|2000|loc=246}}. The [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonances]] (ubiquitous minor seconds, major sevenths and ninths) are precisely chosen for their degree of \"shock value\". While working on the Piano Variations, Copland cultivated a tautness and clarity of form and texture that became a precursor to the style of his other works.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nCopland also experimented with the potential of the physical instrument, as he did with [[microtones]] on the stringed instruments in ''[[Vitebsk (Copland)|Vitebsk]]''. In the Piano Variations, some notes are held down silently while pitches selected from their [[overtone series]] are struck, which produces an effect of ringing resonances without hammering the tones directly.\n\nAnother prominent characteristic is the piece's rhythmic irregularity. The meters change constantly within an essentially 4/4 framework.\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|1984}}|reference=Anon. 1984. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/16/obituaries/gerald-sykes-80-dies-was-author-and-critic.html Gerald Sykes, 80, Dies; Was Author and Critic]\".

The crack is growing from left to right.]]\n\n'''Striations''' are marks produced on the fracture surface that show the incremental growth of a [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] crack. A striation marks the position of the crack tip at the time it was made. Striations are typically rounded bands on the fracture surface separated by depressions or fissures. The term ''striation'' generally refers to ''ductile striations'' which are rounded striations and can have the same appearance on both sides of the mating surfaces of the fatigue crack.  Although some research has suggested that many loading cycles are required to form a single striation, it is now generally thought that each striation is the result of a single loading cycle.<ref name=\"mcevily\">{{cite journal |first1=A. J. |last1=McEvily |first2=H. |last2=Matsunaga |title=On fatigue striations |journal=Transaction B: Mechanical Engineering |date=2010 |volume=17 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of striations is used in [[failure analysis]] as an indication that a fatigue crack has been growing. Striations are generally not seen when a crack is small even though it is growing by fatigue, but will begin to appear as the crack becomes larger. Not all periodic marks on the fracture surface are striations. The size of a striation for a particular material is typically related to the magnitude of the loading characterised by [[stress intensity factor]] range, the mean stress and the environment. The width of a striation is indicative of the overall crack growth rate but can be locally faster or slower on the fracture surface. \nPalmqvist method \n== Striation features ==\nThe study of the fracture surface is known as [[fractography]]. Images of the crack can be used to reveal features and understand the mechanisms of crack growth. While striations are fairly straight, they tend to curve at the ends allowing the direction of crack growth to be determined from an image. Striations generally form at different levels in metals and are separated by a ''tear band'' between them. Tear bands are approximately parallel to the direction of crack growth and produce what is known as a ''river pattern'', so called, because it looks like the diverging pattern seen with river flows. The source of the river pattern converges to a single point that is typically the origin of the fatigue failure.<ref>{{cite book |first=Derek |last=Hull |title=Fractography: observing, measuring and interpreting fracture structure topography |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nStriations can appear on both sides of the mating fracture surface. There is some dispute as to whether striations produced on both sides of the fracture surface match peak-to-peak or peak-to-valley. The shape of striations may also be different on each side of the fracture surface.<ref name=\"nix\"/> Striations do not occur uniformly over all of the fracture surface and many areas of a fatigue crack may be devoid of striations. Striations are most often observed in metals but also occur in plastics such as [[Poly(methyl_methacrylate)]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fatigue Fracture of Polymethylmethacrylate  |first=T.

The rate of growth can be predicted with a [[crack growth equation]] such as the [[Paris' law|Paris-Erdogan equation]]. Defects such as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] and [[grain boundary| grain boundaries]] may locally slow down the rate of growth. \n\n''Variable amplitude'' loads produce striations of different widths and the study of these striation patterns has been used to understand fatigue.<ref name=\"mcmillan\" /><ref> {{cite journal |title=The significance of fractography for investigations of fatigue crack growth under variable-amplitude loading |first=J. |last=Schijve |journal=Fatigue and Fracture of Engineering Materials and Structures |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=87\u201399 |year=1999|doi=10.1046/j.1460-2695.1999.00147.x |url=http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:00bbcb0b-fe18-4adc-9a4c-2eda539a0c92 }} </ref> Although various cycle counting methods can be used to extract the equivalent constant amplitude cycles from a variable amplitude sequence, the striation pattern differs from the cycles extracted using the [[rainflow-counting algorithm| rainflow counting method]]. \n\nThe height of a striation has been related to the ''stress ratio'' <math>R</math> of the applied loading cycle, where <math>R = K_\\text{min}/K_\\text{max}</math> and is thus a function of the minimum <math>K_\\text{min}</math>  and maximum <math>K_\\text{max}</math> stress intensity of the applied loading cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Uchida |first1=Y. |last2=Shomojop |first2=M. |last3=Higo |first3=Y. |title=Relationship between fatigue striation height and stress ratio |journal=Journal of Materials Science |year=1999 |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=2411\u20132419|doi=10.1023/A:1004510615621 }}</ref>\n\nThe striation profile depends on the degree of loading and unloading in each cycle.

When a number of constant amplitude cycles are applied they may produce a plateau of growth on the fracture surface. Marker bands (also known as ''progression marks'' or ''beach marks'') may be produced and readily identified on the fracture surface even though the magnitude of the loads may too small to produce individual striations.<ref name=\"lynch\"> {{cite journal |title=Progression markings, striations, and crack-arrest markings on fracture surfaces |first=S.

Fast fracture can produce a region of rapid extension before blunting of the crack tip stops the growth and further growth occurs during fatigue. Fast fracture occurs through a process of [[microvoid coalescence]] where failures initiate around inter-metallic particles. The [[General_Dynamics_F-111C|F111]] aircraft was subjected to periodic proof testing to ensure any cracks present were smaller than a certain critical size. These loads left marks on the fracture surface that could be identified, allowing the rate of intermediate growth occurring in service to be measured.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Marker loads for quantitative fractography of fatigue cracks in aerospace alloys |first=S.

They are produced instead of regular striations when there is insufficient atmospheric moisture to form hydrogen on the surface of the crack tip in aluminium alloys, thereby preventing the slip planes activation. The wrinkles in the surface cross over and so do not represent the position of the crack tip.\n\n== Striation formation in aluminium ==\n=== Environmental influence ===\nStriations are often produced in high strength aluminium alloys. In these alloys, the presence of ''water vapour'' is necessary to produce ductile striations, although too much water vapour will produce ''brittle striations'' also known as ''cleavage striations''. Brittle striations are flatter and larger than ductile striations produced with the same load. There is sufficient water vapour present in the atmosphere to generate ductile striations.

The crack is growing from left to right.]]\n\n'''Striations''' are marks produced on the fracture surface that show the incremental growth of a [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] crack. A striation marks the position of the crack tip at the time it was made. Striations are typically rounded bands on the fracture surface separated by depressions or fissures. The term ''striation'' generally refers to ''ductile striations'' which are rounded striations and can have the same appearance on both sides of the mating surfaces of the fatigue crack.  Although some research has suggested that many loading cycles are required to form a single striation, it is now generally thought that each striation is the result of a single loading cycle.<ref name=\"mcevily\">{{cite journal |first1=A. J. |last1=McEvily |first2=H. |last2=Matsunaga |title=On fatigue striations |journal=Transaction B: Mechanical Engineering |date=2010 |volume=17 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of striations is used in [[failure analysis]] as an indication that a fatigue crack has been growing. Striations are generally not seen when a crack is small even though it is growing by fatigue, but will begin to appear as the crack becomes larger. Not all periodic marks on the fracture surface are striations. The size of a striation for a particular material is typically related to the magnitude of the loading characterised by [[stress intensity factor]] range, the mean stress and the environment. The width of a striation is indicative of the overall crack growth rate but can be locally faster or slower on the fracture surface. \n\n== Striation features ==\nThe study of the fracture surface is known as [[fractography]]. Images of the crack can be used to reveal features and understand the mechanisms of crack growth. While striations are fairly straight, they tend to curve at the ends allowing the direction of crack growth to be determined from an image. Striations generally form at different levels in metals and are separated by a ''tear band'' between them. Tear bands are approximately parallel to the direction of crack growth and produce what is known as a ''river pattern'', so called, because it looks like the diverging pattern seen with river flows. The source of the river pattern converges to a single point that is typically the origin of the fatigue failure.<ref>{{cite book |first=Derek |last=Hull |title=Fractography: observing, measuring and interpreting fracture structure topography |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nStriations can appear on both sides of the mating fracture surface. There is some dispute as to whether striations produced on both sides of the fracture surface match peak-to-peak or peak-to-valley. The shape of striations may also be different on each side of the fracture surface.<ref name=\"nix\"/> Striations do not occur uniformly over all of the fracture surface and many areas of a fatigue crack may be devoid of striations. Striations are most often observed in metals but also occur in plastics such as [[Poly(methyl_methacrylate)]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fatigue Fracture of Polymethylmethacrylate  |first=T.

The rate of growth can be predicted with a [[crack growth equation]] such as the [[Paris' law|Paris-Erdogan equation]]. Defects such as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] and [[grain boundary| grain boundaries]] may locally slow down the rate of growth. \n\n''Variable amplitude'' loads produce striations of different widths and the study of these striation patterns has been used to understand fatigue.<ref name=\"mcmillan\" /><ref> {{cite journal |title=The significance of fractography for investigations of fatigue crack growth under variable-amplitude loading |first=J. |last=Schijve |journal=Fatigue and Fracture of Engineering Materials and Structures |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=87\u201399 |year=1999|doi=10.1046/j.1460-2695.1999.00147.x |url=http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:00bbcb0b-fe18-4adc-9a4c-2eda539a0c92 }} </ref> Although various cycle counting methods can be used to extract the equivalent constant amplitude cycles from a variable amplitude sequence, the striation pattern differs from the cycles extracted using the [[rainflow-counting algorithm| rainflow counting method]]. \n\nThe height of a striation has been related to the ''stress ratio'' <math>R</math> of the applied loading cycle, where <math>R = K_\\text{min}/K_\\text{max}</math> and is thus a function of the minimum <math>K_\\text{min}</math>  and maximum <math>K_\\text{max}</math> stress intensity of the applied loading cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Uchida |first1=Y. |last2=Shomojop |first2=M. |last3=Higo |first3=Y. |title=Relationship between fatigue striation height and stress ratio |journal=Journal of Materials Science |year=1999 |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=2411\u20132419|doi=10.1023/A:1004510615621 }}</ref>\n\nThe striation profile depends on the degree of loading and unloading in each cycle.

When a number of constant amplitude cycles are applied they may produce a plateau of growth on the fracture surface.

Fast fracture can produce a region of rapid extension before blunting of the crack tip stops the growth and further growth occurs during fatigue. Fast fracture occurs through a process of [[microvoid coalescence]] where failures initiate around inter-metallic particles. The [[General_Dynamics_F-111C|F111]] aircraft was subjected to periodic proof testing to ensure any cracks present were smaller than a certain critical size. These loads left marks on the fracture surface that could be identified, allowing the rate of intermediate growth occurring in service to be measured.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Marker loads for quantitative fractography of fatigue cracks in aerospace alloys |first=S.

The book was first published on September 4, 2018 by Neal Porter books under Holiday House publishers. It chronicles Yuyi Morales' journey from Mexico to the United States with her young son, Kelly. Morales explores the importance of literacy and the function of libraries in society.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nMorales describes crossing a \"bridge to the other side\" at which point she and Kelly became immigrants. She describes the difficult transition period in which she was surrounded by an unfamiliar language and has trouble assimilating, which she referred to as making \"mistakes.\" During this time she and Kelly discover a local library, where they learned to \"read, speak, write,\" and books became their \"life.\"\n\nAfter the book finishes, Morales takes an opportunity to repeat the story in a personal narrative form, expanding on the details of the broader plot she just finished presenting. She clarifies that that bridge connected Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, and they crossed when Kelly was two months old. She explains her reasoning for her migration, which was to marry her son's father and allow her son to meet her ill grandfather. Her mother-in-law introduced Morales and Kelly to the library where she relied on illustrations to convey they meaning of books. Morales and Kelly frequented the Western Addition Branch, Richmond Branch, Presidio Branch, Mission Branch, and the San Francisco Main Library. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Morales, Yuyi, author, illustrator.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1114903862|title=Dreamers|isbn=978-1-0942-5461-6|oclc=1114903862}}</ref>\n\n==Main characters==\nYuyi Morales is narrator and describes her experiences in first person. She references her son Kelly in both written and illustrated detail. \n\n==Background==\n=== Significance of the Title ===\n\"Dreamers\" is explained by Morales as being descriptive of her and her son: \"Kelly and I were Dreamers in the sense that all immigrants, regardless of our status, are Dreamers: we enter a new country carried by hopes and dreams, and carrying our own special gifts, to build a better future.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rhapsodyinbooks.wordpress.com/2018/11/24/kid-lit-review-of-dreamers-by-yuyi-morales/|title=Kid Lit Review of \u201cDreamers\u201d by Yuyi Morales|last=rhapsodyinbooks|date=2018-11-24|website=Rhapsody in Books Weblog|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>  \n\n==== Dual-Meaning of \"Dreamers\" ====\nA \"dreamer\" is an undocumented immigrant child who came to the United States at a young age who was protected from deportation under President Obama's executive order DACA, \"Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals\" which occurred after the \"Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act\" did not pass through Congress.

Morales was quoted: \n\n\"How could children relate to my experience as an adult? Charlotte, my agent, had been insisting this was the time; it is right now, she insisted, when anybody who is an immigrant should be telling their story. Elections had happened, and the USA had elected a man who ran his campaign over the backs of immigrants, calling them words meant to take away their humanity.

The book was first published on September 4, 2018 by Neal Porter books under Holiday House publishers. It chronicles Yuyi Morales' journey from Mexico to the United States with her young son, Kelly. Morales explores the importance of literacy and the function of libraries in society.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nMorales describes crossing a \"bridge to the other side\" at which point she and Kelly became immigrants. She describes the difficult transition period in which she was surrounded by an unfamiliar language and has trouble assimilating, which she referred to as making \"mistakes.\" During this time she and Kelly discover a local library, where they learned to \"read, speak, write,\" and books became their \"life.\"\n\nAfter the book finishes, Morales takes an opportunity to repeat the story in a personal narrative form, expanding on the details of the broader plot she just finished presenting. She clarifies that that bridge connected Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, and they crossed when Kelly was two months old. She explains her reasoning for her migration, which was to marry her son's father and allow her son to meet her ill grandfather. Her mother-in-law introduced Morales and Kelly to the library where she relied on illustrations to convey they meaning of books. Morales and Kelly frequented the Western Addition Branch, Richmond Branch, Presidio Branch, Mission Branch, and the San Fransisco Main Library. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Morales, Yuyi, author, illustrator.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1114903862|title=Dreamers|isbn=978-1-0942-5461-6|oclc=1114903862}}</ref>\n\n==Main characters==\nYuyi Morales is narrator and describes her experiences in first person. She references her son Kelly in both written and illustrated detail. \n\n==Background==\n=== Significance of the Title ===\n\"Dreamers\" is explained by Morales as being descriptive of her and her son: \"Kelly and I were Dreamers in the sense that all immigrants, regardless of our status, are Dreamers: we enter a new country carried by hopes and dreams, and carrying our own special gifts, to build a better future.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rhapsodyinbooks.wordpress.com/2018/11/24/kid-lit-review-of-dreamers-by-yuyi-morales/|title=Kid Lit Review of \u201cDreamers\u201d by Yuyi Morales|last=rhapsodyinbooks|date=2018-11-24|website=Rhapsody in Books Weblog|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>  \n\n==== Dual-Meaning of \"Dreamers\" ====\nA \"dreamer\" is an undocumented immigrant child who came to the United States at a young age who was protected from deportation under President Obama's executive order DACA, \"Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals\" which occurred after the \"Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act\" did not pass through Congress. President Trump ordered an end to the DACA program on September 5, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/tools-and-strategies/table-talk/what-is-daca-and-who-are-the-dreamers|title=What is DACA and Who Are the DREAMers?|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Immigration ===\n''Dreamers'' was in response to the political climate surrounding immigration to the United States. Morales was quoted: \n\n\"How could children relate to my experience as an adult? Charlotte, my agent, had been insisting this was the time; it is right now, she insisted, when anybody who is an immigrant should be telling their story. Elections had happened, and the USA had elected a man who ran his campaign over the backs of immigrants, calling them words meant to take away their humanity. Neal, my editor, said, \"We need your story now, Yuyi.\" But I was unsure that I could come up with the right words, in a story for children, to counteract the prejudice, discrimination, and hate exuding in the country.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n==Reception==\nIn a review for [[Teaching for Change]]'s Social Justice Books website, Debbie Reese wrote that the book \"is a celebration of what migrantes bring with them when they leave their homes.

He died of wounds sustained during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Spanish explorer [[Jacinto Caama\u00f1o]] named the [[Gravina Island]] in [[Alaska]] in his honor.\n\n== Origins and military career ==\nThe [[House of Gravina|Gravinas]] were part of the Sicilian [[aristocracy]], as they were directly descended from the [[Normans]] who conquered Sicily. He was the son of Juan Gravina y Moncada, Duke of San Miguel, [[Grandee|Grandee of Spain]], and Do\u00f1a Leonor N\u00e1poli y Monteaporto, daughter of the Prince of Resetena, also Grandee of Spain.<ref>http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/11283/federico-carlos-gravina-y-napoli</ref> His maternal family originated in [[Sicily]], which was then part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and ruled by a [[Spanish Bourbons#Spain|Spanish Bourbon dynasty]]. With the help of his uncle, the Neapolitan Ambassador to Spain, he entered the [[Spanish Navy]], as a naval cadet aged 12. He then served as Midshipman on board the frigate ''Santa Clara'' in Brazil. In the course of this voyage, he carried out his first command when obtaining the surrender of the castle of the Ascensi\u00f3n, located in a small barren island near Santa Catalina. In 1777 he survived a boat accident in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]] in which most of the crew drowned. In 1778, on returning to Spain, he served as a lieutenant aboard a ship suppressing Algerian pirates. He then obtained his first command \u2013 the polacre-rigged [[xebec]] ''San Luis'' \u2013 in which he participated in the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] between 1779 and 1782, [[Capture of HMS St. Fermin|capturing]] the British corvette {{HMS|St Fermin|1780|6}}.\n\n[[File:FedericoDeGravinaYN\u00e1poli-1799.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Gravina, [[Naval Museum of Madrid]]]]\n\nAfter promotion to Commander he participated in the expedition against [[Menorca]] (then under British control), distinguishing himself in the attack on the [[St. Philip's Castle|fortress of San Felipe]]. After this, and for other actions, he was promoted to Captain. In 1785 he commanded a squadron operating against Algerian corsairs. In 1788 he travelled to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] returning the Ambassador Jussuf Efendi. While there he made and published various astronomical observations. After the death of [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]], Gravina took the news to the colonies, where his frigate ''Paz'' recorded one of the fastest-ever times for passages from Cadiz to the Spanish possessions in Central America.\n\nIn 1790 he was given command of a ship-of-the line, the ''Paula'', in which he took part in the evacuation of Oran. The same year saw him demonstrate his administrative talents for the first time. During the [[Nootka Convention|Nootka Sound Crisis]], Gravina organised the formation of a Spanish fleet, the largest in 200 years. However, the crisis was eventually solved by diplomatic means.\n\nIn 1793 Gravina, now second in command of the Spanish fleet, served alongside [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Admiral Hood]] in the [[Siege of Toulon]]. During this period of the alliance with England he also visited Portsmouth to study British methods and tactics. On his return to Spain he was appointed to command a squadron of four ships, with which he served in the Mediterranean taking an active part in the war against Revolutionary France. His flagship was the ''Hermenegildo'' (112).\n\nIn 1796 Spain signed the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|treaty of San Ildefonso]] with France, making peace and later entering the war against Britain. Gravina fought in a squadron under Don [[Jose de Mazarredo y Salazar|Jose de Mazarredo]]. In 1801 he was sent to [[Saint-Domingue|San Domingo]] in the West Indies in command of the Spanish fleet during the [[Saint-Domingue expedition|Haiti expedition]] under the French General [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]].\n\nIn 1804 he was appointed Ambassador to France in Paris. He accepted this position on one condition: if war should break out he would immediately return to the military.\n\nWhile in Paris he attended [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s coronation as Emperor, and established good relations with [[Denis Decres]], the French Naval Minister. Gravina played a major part in the negotiations of the Franco-Spanish pact which put the Spanish Navy at Napoleon's disposal. For his services [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]] appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Navy, and Gravina returned to Cadiz to hoist his flag in the ship ''Argonauta'' (80) in February 1805.\n\n== Trafalgar ==\n[[File:Nelson. Ilustraci\u00f3n de \"Trafalgar\" de Gald\u00f3s.jpg|thumb|Gravina (left) and [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] (right) in an illustration by [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]], 1882]]\nWhen Napoleon proposed to invade Great Britain, following the orders of the government of [[Manuel de Godoy|Godoy]], Gravina was placed under the command of French Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]], who took the Franco-Spanish fleet into Caribbean waters to confuse the British fleet. The objective was to allow the crossing of the English Channel by 180,000 men that Napoleon had waiting around [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]. The deception did not have desired effect. On its return the Franco-Spanish fleet was intercepted by a fleet under Sir [[Robert Calder]] at the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]], losing the Spanish ships ''Firme'' and ''San Rafael''. After this they took refuge in [[C\u00e1diz]] by order of Villeneuve, contradicting the original plan of Napoleon. The French soldiers never embarked, and were moved to the interior of Europe, freeing many of them to take part in the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. He later moved his flag to ''[[Spanish ship Principe de Asturias (1784)|Principe de Asturias]]''.\n\nIn Cadiz relations between the supposed allies were poor. Gravina and other Spanish commanders argued strongly with the French, who wanted to sail immediately, whereas the Spaniards recommended waiting for more favourable conditions. Gravina was also concerned about the yellow fever epidemic that had left his ships short of men, as well as the lingering resentment against the French, for their perceived lack of support at the Battle of Cape Finisterre.  The fleet finally left Cadiz on 20 October 1805, leading to the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] the next day.\n\nDuring the battle Gravina, in his flagship ''Principe de Asturias'', found himself attacked by three British ships at once.

He died of wounds sustained during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Spanish explorer [[Jacinto Caama\u00f1o]] named the [[Gravina Island]] in [[Alaska]] in his honor.\n\n== Origins and military career ==\nThe [[House of Gravina|Gravinas]] were part of the Sicilian [[aristocracy]], as they were directly descended from the [[Normans]] who conquered Sicily. He was the son of Juan Gravina y Moncada, Duke of San Miguel, [[Grandee|Grandee of Spain]], and Do\u00f1a Leonor N\u00e1poli y Monteaporto, daughter of the Prince of Resetena, also Grandee of Spain.<ref>http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/11283/federico-carlos-gravina-y-napoli</ref> His maternal family originated in [[Sicily]], which was then part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and ruled by a [[Spanish Bourbons#Spain|Spanish Bourbon dynasty]]. With the help of his uncle, the Neapolitan Ambassador to Spain, he entered the [[Spanish Navy]], as a naval cadet aged 12. He then served as Midshipman on board the frigate ''Santa Clara'' in Brazil. In the course of this voyage, he carried out his first command when obtaining the surrender of the castle of the Ascensi\u00f3n, located in a small barren island near Santa Catalina. In 1777 he survived a boat accident in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]] in which most of the crew drowned. In 1778, on returning to Spain, he served as a lieutenant aboard a ship suppressing Algerian pirates. He then obtained his first command \u2013 the polacre-rigged [[xebec]] ''San Luis'' \u2013 in which he participated in the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] between 1779 and 1782, [[Capture of HMS St. Fermin|capturing]] the British corvette {{HMS|St Fermin|1780|6}}.\n\n[[File:FedericoDeGravinaYN\u00e1poli-1799.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Gravina, [[Naval Museum of Madrid]]]]\n\nAfter promotion to Commander he participated in the expedition against [[Menorca]] (then under British control), distinguishing himself in the attack on the [[St. Philip's Castle|fortress of San Felipe]]. After this, and for other actions, he was promoted to Captain. In 1785 he commanded a squadron operating against Algerian corsairs. In 1788 he travelled to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] returning the Ambassador Jussuf Efendi. While there he made and published various astronomical observations. After the death of [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]], Gravina took the news to the colonies, where his frigate ''Paz'' recorded one of the fastest-ever times for passages from Cadiz to the Spanish possessions in Central America.\n\nIn 1790 he was given command of a ship-of-the line, the ''Paula'', in which he took part in the evacuation of Oran. The same year saw him demonstrate his administrative talents for the first time. During the [[Nootka Convention|Nootka Sound Crisis]], Gravina organised the formation of a Spanish fleet, the largest in 200 years. However, the crisis was eventually solved by diplomatic means.\n\nIn 1793 Gravina, now second in command of the Spanish fleet, served alongside [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Admiral Hood]] in the [[Siege of Toulon]]. During this period of the alliance with England he also visited Portsmouth to study British methods and tactics. On his return to Spain he was appointed to command a squadron of four ships, with which he served in the Mediterranean taking an active part in the war against Revolutionary France. His flagship was the ''Hermenegildo'' (112).\n\nIn 1796 Spain signed the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|treaty of San Ildefonso]] with France, making peace and later entering the war against Britain. Gravina fought in a squadron under Don [[Jose de Mazarredo y Salazar|Jose de Mazarredo]]. In 1801 he was sent to [[Saint-Domingue|San Domingo]] in the West Indies in command of the Spanish fleet during the [[Saint-Domingue expedition|Haiti expedition]] under the French General [[Charles Leclerc (general)|Charles Leclerc]].\n\nIn 1804 he was appointed Ambassador to France in Paris. He accepted this position on one condition: if war should break out he would immediately return to the military.\n\nWhile in Paris he attended [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s coronation as Emperor, and established good relations with [[Denis Decres]], the French Naval Minister. Gravina played a major part in the negotiations of the Franco-Spanish pact which put the Spanish Navy at Napoleon's disposal. For his services [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]] appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Navy, and Gravina returned to Cadiz to hoist his flag in the ship ''Argonauta'' (80) in February 1805.\n\n== Trafalgar ==\n[[File:Nelson. Ilustraci\u00f3n de \"Trafalgar\" de Gald\u00f3s.jpg|thumb|Gravina (left) and [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] (right) in an illustration by [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]], 1882]]\nWhen Napoleon proposed to invade Great Britain, following the orders of the government of [[Manuel de Godoy|Godoy]], Gravina was placed under the command of French Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]], who took the Franco-Spanish fleet into Caribbean waters to confuse the British fleet. The objective was to allow the crossing of the English Channel by 180,000 men that Napoleon had waiting around [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]. The deception did not have desired effect. On its return the Franco-Spanish fleet was intercepted by a fleet under Sir [[Robert Calder]] at the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]], losing the Spanish ships ''Firme'' and ''San Rafael''. After this they took refuge in [[C\u00e1diz]] by order of Villeneuve, contradicting the original plan of Napoleon. The French soldiers never embarked, and were moved to the interior of Europe, freeing many of them to take part in the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. He later moved his flag to ''[[Spanish ship Principe de Asturias (1784)|Principe de Asturias]]''.\n\nIn Cadiz relations between the supposed allies were poor. Gravina and other Spanish commanders argued strongly with the French, who wanted to sail immediately, whereas the Spaniards recommended waiting for more favourable conditions. Gravina was also concerned about the yellow fever epidemic that had left his ships short of men, as well as the lingering resentment against the French, for their perceived lack of support at the Battle of Cape Finisterre.  The fleet finally left Cadiz on 20 October 1805, leading to the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] the next day.\n\nDuring the battle Gravina, in his flagship ''Principe de Asturias'', found himself attacked by three British ships at once. The main mast and mizzen were shot through, rigging and sails shot to pieces. At about half past three in the afternoon Gravina's left arm was shattered by grapeshot, and seeing a looming defeat, he managed to gather ten ships around his flagship and fell back to Cadiz under tow.\n\nDespite this Gravina was promoted to the highest military rank of Capit\u00e1n-General de la Armada (Admiral of the Fleet), but he never fully recovered from his wounds and finally succumbed on 9 May 1806, aged 49.\n\nOn his deathbed he said, \"I am a dying man, but I die happy; I am going, I hope and trust, to join [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]], the greatest hero that the world perhaps has produced.\"\n\n[[File:Exequias f\u00fanebres a la memoria de Gravina, verificadas en la iglesia de San Francisco el Grande en Madrid, el 23 de octubre de 1870, de SEM.jpg|thumb|[[Memorial service]] in remembrance of Gravina at the [[Basilica of San Francisco el Grande, Madrid|Basilica of San Francisco el Grande]], 1870]]\n\nIn turn the ''[[Gibraltar Chronicle]]'' paid the following tribute, ''\"Spain loses in Gravina the most distinguished officer in her navy; one under whose command her fleets, though sometimes beaten, always fought in such a manner as to merit the encomiums of their conquerors.\"''\n\nAs Napoleon wrote in a letter of 11 August 1805: ''\"Gravina is all genius and decision in combat.
