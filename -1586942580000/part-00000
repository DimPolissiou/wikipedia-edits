This switch later proved extremely useful since Walton learned to play and arrange for various instruments, a talent he would hone with [[Art Blakey|Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers]].\n\nWalton was tempted by the promise of New York City through his associations with [[John Coltrane]], [[Charlie Parker]], and [[Richie Powell]], whom he met at various after-hours sessions around the city of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. In 1955, he decided to leave school and drove with a friend to New York City. He quickly got recognition from Johnny Garry, who ran [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] at that time.\n\n==Later life and career==\nWalton was drafted into the U.S. Army, and stationed in Germany, cutting short his rising status in the after-hours scene. While in the Army, he played with musicians [[Leo Wright]], [[Don Ellis]], and [[Eddie Harris]]. Upon his discharge after two years, Walton picked up where he left off, playing as a sideman with [[Kenny Dorham]] (on whose 1958 album ''[[This Is the Moment!]]'' Walton made his recording debut),<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/10255554/Cedar-Walton.html \"Cedar Walton\" (obituary)], ''The Telegraph'', August 20, 2013.</ref> [[J.

In this group, which also featured [[Wayne Shorter]], he demonstrated a keen sense of arranging in originals such as \"Ugetsu\" and \"Mosaic\". He left the Messengers in 1964 and by the late 1960s was part of the house [[rhythm section]] at [[Prestige Records]], where in addition to releasing his own recordings, he recorded with [[Sonny Criss]], [[Pat Martino]], [[Eric Kloss]], and [[Charles McPherson (musician)|Charles McPherson]].

This switch later proved extremely useful since Walton learned to play and arrange for various instruments, a talent he would hone with [[Art Blakey|Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers]].\n\nWalton was tempted by the promise of New York City through his associations with [[John Coltrane]], [[Charlie Parker]], and [[Richie Powell]], whom he met at various after-hours sessions around the city of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. In 1955, he decided to leave school and drove with a friend to New York City. He quickly got recognition from Johnny Garry, who ran [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] at that time.\n\n==Later life and career==\nWalton was drafted into the U.S. Army, and stationed in Germany, cutting short his rising status in the after-hours scene. While in the Army, he played with musicians [[Leo Wright]], [[Don Ellis]], and [[Eddie Harris]]. Upon his discharge after two years, Walton picked up where he left off, playing as a sideman with [[Kenny Dorham]] (on whose 1958 album ''[[This Is the Moment!]]'' Walton made his recording debut),<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/10255554/Cedar-Walton.html \"Cedar Walton\" (obituary)], ''The Telegraph'', August 20, 2013.</ref> [[J.

In April 1959, he recorded an alternate take of \"[[Giant Steps (composition)|Giant Steps]]\" with John Coltrane, though he did not solo.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Walton joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers as a pianist-[[Arrangement|arranger]] for three years, on the same day as [[Freddie Hubbard]]. In this group, which also featured [[Wayne Shorter]], he demonstrated a keen sense of arranging in originals such as \"Ugetsu\" and \"Mosaic\". He left the Messengers in 1964 and by the late 1960s was part of the house [[rhythm section]] at [[Prestige Records]], where in addition to releasing his own recordings, he recorded with [[Sonny Criss]], [[Pat Martino]], [[Eric Kloss]], and [[Charles McPherson (musician)|Charles McPherson]].

Trumpeter Lee Katzman, former sideman with [[Stan Kenton]], recommended that he begin studying at the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music (now the Jordan College of the Arts at [[Butler University]]) with Max Woodbury, the principal trumpeter of the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]]. In his teens, Hubbard worked locally with brothers [[Wes Montgomery|Wes]] and [[Monk Montgomery]] and worked with bassist [[Larry Ridley]] and saxophonist [[James Spaulding]]. In 1958, at the age of 20, he moved to New York and began playing with some of the best jazz players of the era, including [[Philly Joe Jones]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Slide Hampton]], [[Eric Dolphy]], [[J. J. Johnson]], and [[Quincy Jones]]. On 19 June 1960 Hubbard made his first record as a leader, ''[[Open Sesame (Freddie Hubbard album)|Open Sesame]]'' at the beginning of his contract with [[Blue Note Records]], with saxophonist [[Tina Brooks]], pianist [[McCoy Tyner]], bassist [[Sam Jones (musician)|Sam Jones]], and drummer [[Clifford Jarvis]]. Six days later he returned the favor to Brooks and recorded with him on ''[[True Blue (Tina Brooks album)|True Blue]]''.\n\n==1960s==\nIn December 1960, Hubbard was invited to play on [[Ornette Coleman]]'s ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation|Free Jazz]]'' after Coleman had heard him performing with [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]].<ref>Martin Williams, sleeve notes to ''Free Jazz'' (1960)</ref>\n\nThen in May 1961, Hubbard played on ''[[Ol\u00e9 Coltrane]]'', [[John Coltrane]]'s final recording session for [[Atlantic Records]]. Together with [[Eric Dolphy]] and [[Art Davis]], Hubbard was the only sideman who appeared on both ''Ol\u00e9'' and ''[[Africa/Brass]]'', Coltrane's first album with [[Impulse! Records|Impulse!]]. Later, in August 1961, Hubbard recorded ''[[Ready for Freddie]]'' (Blue Note), which was also his first collaboration with saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]]. Hubbard joined Shorter later in 1961 when he replaced [[Lee Morgan]] in [[Art Blakey]]'s [[The Jazz Messengers|Jazz Messengers]]. He played on several Blakey recordings, including ''[[Caravan (Art Blakey album)|Caravan]]'', ''[[Ugetsu (album)|Ugetsu]]'', ''[[Mosaic (Art Blakey album)|Mosaic]]'', and ''[[Free for All (album)|Free for All]]''. In all, during the 1960s, he recorded eight studio albums as a bandleader for Blue Note,<!-- \"Night of the Cookers\" (BLP 42017/8) is two live albums with Lee Morgan - the source's count is out for FH as leader. The two Blakey 3 Blind Mice albums were not originally BN, they were recorded for United Artists Records. --> and more than two dozen as a sideman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danmillerjazz.com/hubbard.html |title=Freddie Hubbard ''The Blue Note Years 1960\u20131965'' |publisher=Dan Miller Jazz |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Hubbard remained with Blakey until 1966, leaving to form the first of several small groups of his own, which featured, among others, his Blue note associate [[James Spaulding]], pianist [[Kenny Barron]] and drummer [[Louis Hayes]]. This group recorded for Atlantic.\n\nIt was during this time that he began to develop his own sound, distancing himself from the early influences of [[Clifford Brown]] and Morgan, and won the ''[[DownBeat]]'' jazz magazine \"New Star\" award on trumpet.<ref name=NEA>[http://arts.gov/honors/jazz/freddie-hubbard \"Freddie Hubbard\"], NEA Jazz Masters, 2006.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s Hubbard played as a sideman on some of the most important albums from that era, including [[Oliver Nelson]]'s ''[[The Blues and the Abstract Truth]]'', [[Eric Dolphy]]'s ''[[Out to Lunch!]]'', [[Herbie Hancock]]'s ''[[Maiden Voyage (Herbie Hancock album)|Maiden Voyage]]'', and [[Wayne Shorter]]'s ''[[Speak No Evil]]''.<ref>Larkin, Colin.

The track ends with a fade during Hubbard's performance. An \"unfaded\" version was released on the 2004 Billy Joel box set ''[[My Lives]]''.\n\n==Later life==\n\nIn the 1980s Hubbard was again leading his own jazz group \u2013 this time with [[Billy Childs]] and [[Larry Klein]], among others, as members \u2013 attracting favorable reviews, playing at concerts and festivals in the US and Europe, often in the company of [[Joe Henderson]], playing a repertory of [[hard bop]] and [[modal jazz]] pieces. Hubbard played at the [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] in 1980 and in 1989 (with [[Bobby Hutcherson]]). He played with [[Woody Shaw]], recording with him in 1985, and two years later recorded ''Stardust'' with [[Benny Golson]]. In 1988 he teamed up once more with Blakey at an engagement in the Netherlands, from which came ''Feel the Wind''. In 1988, Hubbard played with [[Elton John]], contributing trumpet and flugelhorn and trumpet solos on the track \"[[Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (Part Two)]]\" for John's ''[[Reg Strikes Back]]'' album.

Trumpeter Lee Katzman, former sideman with [[Stan Kenton]], recommended that he begin studying at the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music (now the Jordan College of the Arts at [[Butler University]]) with Max Woodbury, the principal trumpeter of the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]]. In his teens, Hubbard worked locally with brothers [[Wes Montgomery|Wes]] and [[Monk Montgomery]] and worked with bassist [[Larry Ridley]] and saxophonist [[James Spaulding]]. In 1958, at the age of 20, he moved to New York and began playing with some of the best jazz players of the era, including [[Philly Joe Jones]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Slide Hampton]], [[Eric Dolphy]], [[J. J. Johnson]], and [[Quincy Jones]]. On 19 June 1960 Hubbard made his first record as a leader, ''[[Open Sesame (Freddie Hubbard album)|Open Sesame]]'' at the beginning of his contract with [[Blue Note Records]], with saxophonist [[Tina Brooks]], pianist [[McCoy Tyner]], bassist [[Sam Jones (musician)|Sam Jones]], and drummer [[Clifford Jarvis]]. Six days later he returned the favor to Brooks and recorded with him on ''[[True Blue (Tina Brooks album)|True Blue]]''.\n\n==1960s==\nIn December 1960, Hubbard was invited to play on [[Ornette Coleman]]'s ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation|Free Jazz]]'' after Coleman had heard him performing with [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]].<ref>Martin Williams, sleeve notes to ''Free Jazz'' (1960)</ref>\n\nThen in May 1961, Hubbard played on ''[[Ol\u00e9 Coltrane]]'', [[John Coltrane]]'s final recording session for [[Atlantic Records]]. Together with [[Eric Dolphy]] and [[Art Davis]], Hubbard was the only sideman who appeared on both ''Ol\u00e9'' and ''[[Africa/Brass]]'', Coltrane's first album with [[Impulse! Records|Impulse!]]. Later, in August 1961, Hubbard recorded ''[[Ready for Freddie]]'' (Blue Note), which was also his first collaboration with saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]]. Hubbard joined Shorter later in 1961 when he replaced [[Lee Morgan]] in [[Art Blakey]]'s [[The Jazz Messengers|Jazz Messengers]]. He played on several Blakey recordings, including ''[[Caravan (Art Blakey album)|Caravan]]'', ''[[Ugetsu (album)|Ugetsu]]'', ''[[Mosaic (Art Blakey album)|Mosaic]]'', and ''[[Free for All (album)|Free for All]]''. In all, during the 1960s, he recorded eight studio albums as a bandleader for Blue Note,<!-- \"Night of the Cookers\" (BLP 42017/8) is two live albums with Lee Morgan - the source's count is out for FH as leader. The two Blakey 3 Blind Mice albums were not originally BN, they were recorded for United Artists Records. --> and more than two dozen as a sideman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danmillerjazz.com/hubbard.html |title=Freddie Hubbard ''The Blue Note Years 1960\u20131965'' |publisher=Dan Miller Jazz |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Hubbard remained with Blakey until 1966, leaving to form the first of several small groups of his own, which featured, among others, his Blue note associate [[James Spaulding]], pianist [[Kenny Barron]] and drummer [[Louis Hayes]]. This group recorded for Atlantic.\n\nIt was during this time that he began to develop his own sound, distancing himself from the early influences of [[Clifford Brown]] and Morgan, and won the ''[[DownBeat]]'' jazz magazine \"New Star\" award on trumpet.<ref name=NEA>[http://arts.gov/honors/jazz/freddie-hubbard \"Freddie Hubbard\"], NEA Jazz Masters, 2006.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s Hubbard played as a sideman on some of the most important albums from that era, including [[Oliver Nelson]]'s ''[[The Blues and the Abstract Truth]]'', [[Eric Dolphy]]'s ''[[Out to Lunch!]]'', [[Herbie Hancock]]'s ''[[Maiden Voyage (Herbie Hancock album)|Maiden Voyage]]'', and [[Wayne Shorter]]'s ''[[Speak No Evil]]''.<ref>Larkin, Colin.

The track ends with a fade during Hubbard's performance. An \"unfaded\" version was released on the 2004 Billy Joel box set ''[[My Lives]]''.\n\n==Later life==\n\nIn the 1980s Hubbard was again leading his own jazz group \u2013 this time with [[Billy Childs]] and [[Larry Klein]], among others, as members \u2013 attracting favorable reviews, playing at concerts and festivals in the US and Europe, often in the company of [[Joe Henderson]], playing a repertory of [[hard bop]] and [[modal jazz]] pieces. Hubbard played at the [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] in 1980 and in 1989 (with [[Bobby Hutcherson]]). He played with [[Woody Shaw]], recording with him in 1985, and two years later recorded ''Stardust'' with [[Benny Golson]]. In 1988 he teamed up once more with Blakey at an engagement in the Netherlands, from which came ''Feel the Wind''. In 1988, Hubbard played with [[Elton John]], contributing trumpet and flugelhorn and trumpet solos on the track \"[[Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (Part Two)]]\" for John's ''[[Reg Strikes Back]]'' album. In 1990 he appeared in Japan headlining an American-Japanese concert package which also featured [[Elvin Jones]], [[Sonny Fortune]], pianists [[George Duke]] and [[Benny Green (pianist)|Benny Green]], bass players [[Ron Carter]], and [[Rufus Reid]], with jazz and vocalist [[Salena Jones]].

{"title_page": "Flying junction", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}\n[[Image:Flying-junction-both-tracks.svg|thumb|right|Flying junction: with a bridge, trains do not block each other]]\n\nA '''flying junction''' or '''flyover''' is a [[railway junction]] at which one or more diverging or converging tracks in a multiple-track route cross other tracks on the route by bridge to avoid conflict with other train movements. A more technical term is \"[[grade separation|grade-separated junction]]\". A '''burrowing junction''' or '''dive-under''' occurs where the diverging line passes below the main line.\n\nThe alternative to grade separation is a [[level junction]] or flat junction, where tracks cross [[At-grade intersection|at grade]], and conflicting routes must be protected by interlocked [[railway signal|signal]]s.\n\n==Complexity==\n[[File:Fretin-triangle-diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Fretin triangle in France: Each side is over {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long. A grade-separated [[Wye (rail)|wye]]. [[TGV]] and [[Eurostar]] trains cross the junction at {{convert|300|km/h|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}]]\nSimple flying junctions may have a single track pass over or under other tracks to avoid conflict, while complex flying junctions may have an elaborate [[infrastructure]] to allow multiple routings without trains coming into conflict, in the manner of a highway [[stack interchange]].\n\n==Flying junction without crossings==\nWhere two lines each of two tracks merge with a flying junction, they can become a four-track railway together. This happens regularly in the Netherlands (see [[#Examples|Examples]] below).\n\n==High-speed rail==\nNearly all junctions with [[high-speed rail]]ways are grade-separated.  On the French [[TGV#Tracks|LGV]] high-speed network, the principal junction on the [[LGV Sud-Est]], at Pasilly where the line to Dijon diverges, and on the [[LGV Atlantique]] at Courtalain where the line to Le Mans diverges, are fully grade separated with special high-speed switches (''points'' in British terminology) that permit the normal line speed of {{convert|300|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} on the main line, and a diverging speed of {{convert|220|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref group=note>See \"[[:fr:Courtalain|Courtalain]]\" on the French language Wikipedia.</ref> \n\nThe [[TGV|LGV (Lignes \u00e0 Grande Vitesse)]] network has four grade-separated high-speed triangles: Fretin (near Lille), Coubert (south-east Paris), Claye-Souilly (north-east Paris) and Angles (Avignon).

A more technical term is \"[[grade separation|grade-separated junction]]\". A '''burrowing junction''' or '''dive-under''' occurs where the diverging line passes below the main line.\n\nThe alternative to grade separation is a [[level junction]] or flat junction, where tracks cross [[At-grade intersection|at grade]], and conflicting routes must be protected by interlocked [[railway signal|signal]]s.\n\n==Complexity==\n[[File:Fretin-triangle-diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Fretin triangle in France: Each side is over {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long.

He is a locus of village wisdom and imparts philosophical guidances from a variety of sources in his effort to explain the vagaries and iniquities of daily life and toil in the village, set in West Bengal.\n\nYet mystery surrounds his beginnings, and it is Dadathakur\u2019s past that film director Banerjee explores in this upcoming indie production. Long before becoming known for village wisdom, Dadathakur was an impoverished writer by the name of Rishob who was married to a young beautiful woman named Manoshi. Due to the dire circumstances and poverty of their early lives, Manoshi dies unexpectedly, leaving Rishob itinerant and without purpose in life. This event scars his soul and causes him to question the material struggle of existence and the importance of life and death in the face of such injustice and complacency on the part of the universe to his sadness.\n\nTo rediscover himself and his purpose in this world, Rishob becomes Dadathakur, and moves to Jibanpur village where he learns and perfects his craft and life\u2019s wisdom. The film \"In Search of Light\" (Ektu aalor khonje) begins thirty years into Dadathakur\u2019s ministry in the village. Rishob\u2019s new life as a holy man is complicated when his son Sourjyo, long lost to him and time, arrives in the village of Jibanpur after receiving reliable word from a family friend that his father Rishob is alive and well, dwelling somewhere in disguise. Dadathakur is once again forced to face questions of life and death as well as the meaning of it all as he confronts his son from a previous life and reveals the secrets of Rishob\u2019s past to a man he only has just met, shedding the pretense of Dadathakur to once again become the hobbled man that led him on the path to spiritual enlightenment in the first place.\n\n==Cast and crew==\nThe entire film was done by a group of ten people who actually played every role from cast to crew. Though the main cast of Dadathakur is performed by Mahendra Daan, a passionate theatre personality who had been performing on stage for more than sixteen years. His passion and fondness towards acting made him grab the role owing to the brilliance of screenplay. For others namely Debraj Sengupta, Ipsita Moitra, Susmita Bhattacharya, Riya Singh it was more like a learning experience considering that this was their debut feature project.\n\n* Mahendra Daan as Dadathakur\n* Pavel Dutta as Rishob\n* Ipsita Moitra as Manoshi\n* Debraj Sengupta as Sourjyo\n* Susmita Bhattacharya as Indrani\n* Rana Banerjee as Manik Sarkar\n* Kakoli Daan as Manju\n* Riya Singh as Komli\n* Rohan Banerjee as Kajol\n* Prabir Halder as Sonaton\n\n==Filming and production==\nThe first phase of shooting started in a village named Belun in Katwa, West Bengal. As for a first time production unit working on such a project in a shoe string budget the entire shoot went more than perfect with all the cooperation and excitement from the entire village and local people. But things turned around and shooting came to a halt after this phase as one of the prominent actor was diagnosed of cancer, a few days later. The actor, Pavel Dutta was a promising exponent in the field and the entire unit lost the zeal as he succumbed to the disease a few months later. The team only regrouped quite sometime later with the motto of leading the project to success with the inclusion of another promising actor in Mahendra Daan. The story and plot had to be modified then to accustom necessary changes in casting. And after some severe and dedicated effort from the entire crew, the second phase of shooting started in Purulia after more than a year. Since then it all went through at regular breaks owing to shortage of funds for shooting. Considering the plot of the story which is mainly set in a remote village it was highly difficult to arrange for traditional village houses where the shoot can be performed. Since the entire filming is preferably done in locations it was a difficult and uphill task of location scouting. Finally the spot was selected in a village in Arambagh which became the destination of Dadathakur the protagonist of the film.\n\nCurrently the film is under post production expecting to be released by December 2020.<ref>[http://www.pressnews.biz/news-dreams-entertainment-announces-the-trailer-launch-of-its-upcoming-bengali-film-titled-in-search-of-light-190829.html Dreams Entertainment Announces the Trailer Launch of its Upcoming Bengali Film Titled \"In Search Of Light\"] PressNews.biz </ref> The trailer of the film is expected to be released very shortly.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n", "text_old": "{{moresources|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2019}}\n{{Orphan|date=September 2017}}\n\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Ektu Aalor Khonje\n| image          =\n| caption        = Official poster\n| alt            = Official Poster of the Film\n| director       = [[Bhaskar Banerjee]]\n| screenplay     = Bhaskar Banerjee\n| starring       = Mahendra Dan<br />Ipsita Moitra<br />Pavel Dutta<br />Debraj Sengupta<br />Kakali Dan<br />Prabir Halder\n| cinematography = [[Bhaskar Banerjee]]\n| editing        = [[Bhaskar Banerjee]]\n| studio         = [[Curlyvine Films & Productions Pvt Ltd]]\n| country        = [[India]]\n| language       = Bengali\n| budget         = {{Indian Rupee|link=Indian rupee}}6,50,000 (US$10,500)\n| gross          =\n}}\n\n'''''Ektu Aalor Khonje''''' (''In Search of Light'')<ref>[https://article.wn.com/view/2017/07/19/Debut_Film_from_Bhaskar_Banerjee_In_Search_of_Light_Explores/ Debut Film from Bhaskar Banerjee \"In Search of Light\" Explores the Hidden Mysteries of the Human Soul] WN.com </ref> is an upcoming Indian [[Bengali language|Bengali-language]] [[Drama (modern genre)|drama film]] directed by Bhaskar Banerjee and produced by Curlyvine Films & Productions Pvt Ltd.

Dadathakur is once again forced to face questions of life and death as well as the meaning of it all as he confronts his son from a previous life and reveals the secrets of Rishob\u2019s past to a man he only has just met, shedding the pretense of Dadathakur to once again become the hobbled man that led him on the path to spiritual enlightenment in the first place.\n\n==Cast and crew==\nThe entire film was done by a group of ten people who actually played every role from cast to crew. Though the main cast of Dadathakur is performed by Mahendra Daan, a passionate theatre personality who had been performing on stage for more than sixteen years. His passion and fondness towards acting made him grab the role owing to the brilliance of screenplay. For others namely Debraj Sengupta, Ipsita Moitra, Susmita Bhattacharya, Riya Singh it was more like a learning experience considering that this was their debut feature project.\n\n* Mahendra Daan as Dadathakur\n* Pavel Dutta as Rishob\n* Ipsita Moitra as Manoshi\n* Debraj Sengupta as Sourjyo\n* Susmita Bhattacharya as Indrani\n* Rana Banerjee as Manik Sarkar\n* Kakoli Daan as Manju\n* Riya Singh as Komli\n* Rohan Banerjee as Kajol\n* Prabir Halder as Sonaton\n\n==Filming and production==\nThe first phase of shooting started in a village named Belun in Katwa, West Bengal. As for a first time production unit working on such a project in a shoe string budget the entire shoot went more than perfect with all the cooperation and excitement from the entire village and local people. But things turned around and shooting came to a halt after this phase as one of the prominent actor was diagonised of cancer, a few days later. The actor, Pavel Dutta was a promising exponent in the field and the entire unit lost the zeal as he succumbed to the disease a few months later. The team only regrouped quite sometime later with the motto of leading the project to success with the inclusion of another promising actor in Mahendra Daan. The story and plot had to be modified then to accustom necessary changes in casting. And after some severe and dedicated effort from the entire crew, the second phase of shooting started in Purulia after more than an year. Since then it all went through at regular breaks owing to shortage of funds for shooting. Considering the plot of the story which is mainly set in a remote village it was highly difficult to arrange for traditional village houses where the shoot can be performed. Since the entire filming is preferably done in locations it was a difficult and uphill task of location scouting. Finally the spot was selected in a village in Arambagh which became the destination of Dadathakur the protagonist of the film.\n\nCurrently the film is under post production expecting to be released by December 2020.<ref>[http://www.pressnews.biz/news-dreams-entertainment-announces-the-trailer-launch-of-its-upcoming-bengali-film-titled-in-search-of-light-190829.html Dreams Entertainment Announces the Trailer Launch of its Upcoming Bengali Film Titled \"In Search Of Light\"] PressNews.biz </ref> The trailer of the film is expected to be released very shortly.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n", "name_user": "CamWass", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ektu_Aalor_Khonje"}

The black is commonly thought{{By whom|date=August 2017}} to represent [[Black Sea|the Black Sea]] or the coal industry in the [[Donets Basin|Donbass region]]. The red is thought to represent freedom and the blue is thought to represent water. However, there is no proof that such flag was used by the original republic, which used the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] as symbol. The flag also features the coat of arms of the republic in the centre. The flag carries the words \"''Donetsk People's Republic''\" (\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430) in [[Russian Language|Russian]].

Following the 18-year rule of [[Leonid Brezhnev]], Andropov served in the post from November 1982 until his death in February 1984.\n\nEarlier in his career, Andropov served as the Soviet ambassador to Hungary from 1954 to 1957, during which time he was involved in the suppression of the [[1956 Hungarian Uprising]]. He was named Chairman of the KGB on 10 May 1967. In this position,  he oversaw a massive crackdown on dissent that was carried out via mass arrests and the wholesale application of involuntary psychiatric [[Involuntary commitment|commitment]] of people deemed \"socially undesirable\". As Brezhnev's health declined during the latter years of his leadership, Andropov formed a [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union#List of troikas|troika]] alongside Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] and Defense Minister [[Dmitry Ustinov]] that ultimately came to dominate Soviet policy.\n\nUpon Brezhnev's death on 10 November 1982, Yuri Andropov succeeded him as General Secretary and (by extension) [[leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]]. During his short tenure, Andropov sought to eliminate corruption and inefficiency within the Soviet system by investigating longtime officials for violations of party discipline and criminalizing truancy in the workplace. The Cold War intensified,  and he was at a loss for how to handle the growing crisis in the Soviet economy. His major long-term impact was bringing to the fore a new generation of young reformers, as energetic as himself,  including [[Yegor Ligachyov]], [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and, most important, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>Mauricio Borrero, \"Andropov, Yuri Vladimirovich 1914\u20131984.\" ''Encyclopedia of Modern Dictators'' (2006), pp. 7\u201310.</ref>  However, upon suffering [[kidney failure]] in February 1983, Andropov's health began to deteriorate rapidly.

In his memoirs, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] recalled that when Andropov was the leader, Gorbachev and [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], the chairman of [[Gosplan]], asked him for access to real budget figures. \"You are asking too much,\" Andropov responded. \"The budget is off limits to you.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Gorbachev, Mikhail|title=Memoirs|date=1996|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0385480192|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsgorb00gorb/page/147 147]|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsgorb00gorb/page/147}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-corruption campaign====\nIn contrast to Brezhnev's policy of avoiding conflicts and dismissals, he began to fight violations of party, state and labour discipline, which led to significant personnel changes during an anti-corruption campaign against many of Brezhnev's cronies.<ref name=\"Century Communism 2010\"/> During 15 months in office, Andropov dismissed 18 ministers and 37 first secretaries of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|obkoms]], kraikoms and Central Committees of Communist Parties of Soviet Republics, and [[criminal case]]s against high level party and state officials were started. Biographers including Solovyov and Klepikova (1983) and Zhores Medvedev (1983) have discussed the complex possibilities underlying the motivations of anti-corruption campaigning in the Soviet Union during the 1970s and early 1980s: at the same time that it is true that Andropov fought corruption for moral, ethical, ascetic, and ideological reasons, it is also true that it was an effective way for party members from the police and security organizations to defeat competitors for power at the senior levels of the party. Thus Andropov himself, as well as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s including [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], could advance their own power by the same efforts that also promised to be better for the country in terms of justice, economic performance, and even defense readiness (which depended on economic performance). Thus there was a certain inevitable amount of \"what's better for the country also happens to align with what's best for my own power.\" It is not possible to measure the exact balance of self-interest versus selfless altruism and patriotism in this equation. Part of the complexity is that in the Brezhnev era, much corruption was implicitly tolerated and was pervasive (although officially denied), and many a member of the police and security organizations themselves participated in it to various degrees, but only those organizations had access to the power to measure it and monitor its details. In such an environment, anti-corruption campaigning is inherently a path by which police and security people have the potential or opportunity to appear to be white-hat heroes cleaning up the malfeasance of black-hat villains and 'coincidentally' increasing their own power, whereas there may be an underlying reality of one set of gray-hat [[antihero]]es defeating another set of gray-hat antiheroes in a [[wikt:grey area|morally gray]] power struggle. This complex dynamic is perennial; 21st-century anti-corruption campaigns are just as subject to its possibilities as were 20th-century instances.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Anti kernwapendemonstratie in Den Haag ( 550 duizend deelnemers ) overzichten m, Bestanddeelnr 253-8819.jpg|thumb|Protest against the [[nuclear arms race]] between the U.S./NATO and the Soviet Union, [[The Hague]], Netherlands, 1983]]\nAndropov faced a series of foreign policy crises: the hopeless situation of the Soviet army in Afghanistan, threatened revolt in Poland, growing animosity with China, the polarization threat of war in the Middle East, Troubles in Ethiopia and South Africa. The most critical threat was the \"Second Cold War\" launched by American President Ronald Reagan and a specific attack on rolling back what he denounced as the \"[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]\". Reagan was using American economic power, and Soviet economic weakness, to escalate massive spending on the [[Cold War]], emphasizing high technology that Moscow lacked.<ref>Lawrence T. Caldwell, and Robert Legvold, \"Reagan through Soviet eyes.\" ''Foreign Policy'' 52 (1983): 3-21 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148230 Online].</ref> The main response was raising the military budget to 70 percent of the national budget, and supplying billions of dollars worth of military aid to Syria, Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, the PLO, Cuba, and North Korea. That included tanks and armored troop carriers, hundreds of fighter planes, as well as anti-aircraft systems, artillery systems, and all sorts of high tech equipment for which the USSR was the main supplier for its allies. Andropov's main goal was to avoid an open war.<ref>Dimitri Volkogonov, ''Autopsy for an empire''  (1998) pp 358\u2013360.</ref><ref>Taylor Downing, ''Reagan, Andropov, and a World on the Brink'' (2018) pp. 34\u201350.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Steele|title=Soviet Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYqQYs8lnWQC&pg=PA4|year=1984|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=4\u20135|isbn=9780671528133}}</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|conflict in Afghanistan]] continued even though Andropov, who now felt the invasion was a mistake, half-heartedly explored options for a negotiated withdrawal. Andropov's rule was also marked by deterioration of relations with the [[United States]]. During a much-publicized \"walk in the woods\" with Soviet dignitary Yuli Kvitsinsky, American diplomat [[Paul Nitze]] suggested a compromise for reducing nuclear missiles in Europe on both sides that was ultimately ignored by the Politburo.<ref>{{cite book |last=Matlock |first=Jack F., Jr. |title=Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2005|location=New York |pages=41\u201346 |isbn=978-0-8129-7489-8}}</ref> Kvitsinsky would later write that, despite his own efforts, the Soviet leadership was not interested in compromise, instead calculating that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kwizinskij|first=Julij A. |title=Vor dem Sturm: Erinnerungen eines Diplomaten |publisher=Siedler Verlag |year=1993 |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-88680-464-1}}</ref> On 8 March 1983, during Andropov's reign as General Secretary, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] famously labeled the Soviet Union an \"[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]\". The same month, on 23 March, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. Reagan claimed this research program into ballistic missile defence would be \"consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty\". However, Andropov was dismissive of this claim, and said that \"It is time they [Washington] stopped ... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war. ... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane\".<ref>''[[Pravda]]'', 27 March 1983</ref>\n\nIn August 1983, Andropov made an announcement that the country was stopping all work on space-based weapons. One of his most notable acts during his short time as leader of the Soviet Union was in response to a letter from a 10-year-old American child from Maine named [[Samantha Smith]], inviting her to the Soviet Union. She came, but he was too ill to meet with her, thus revealing his grave condition to the world. Meanwhile, Soviet\u2013U.S. arms control talks on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe were suspended by the Soviet Union in November 1983 and by the end of the year, the Soviets had broken off all arms control negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Church|first=George J.|title=Person of the Year 1983: Ronald Reagan and Yuri Andropov|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=1 January 1984 |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1983.html|accessdate=2 January 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:1981-09-15 12-00-00 United States Hawaii Aliamanu 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|A photograph of Korean Air Lines HL7442, the airliner shot down by Soviet aircraft after drifting into [[prohibited airspace]] during the KAL 007 Flight.]]\nMassive bad publicity worldwide came when Soviet fighters shot down a civilian jet liner, [[Korean Air Flight KAL-007]], which carried 269 passengers and crew. It had strayed over the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 on its scheduled route from Anchorage, Alaska, US to Seoul, South Korea. Andropov kept secret the fact that the Soviet Union held in its possession the [[Flight recorder|black box]] from KAL 007 which proved the pilot had made a typographical error when entering data in the automatic pilot. Soviet air defence system was unprepared to deal with a civilian airliner, and the shooting down was a matter of following orders without question.<ref>Jonathan Haslam,  \"The KAL shootdown (1983) and the state of Soviet air defence.\" ''Intelligence and National Security'' 3.4 (1988): 128\u2013133.</ref> Instead of admitting an accident, Soviet media proclaimed a brave decision to meet a Western provocation. Together with the low credibility created by the poor explanation in 1986 of the meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, the episode demonstrated an inability to deal with public relations crises; the propaganda system was only useful for individuals and states that were aligned with the Soviet Union. Both crises were escalated by technological and organizational failures, compounded by human error.<ref>Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, \"KAL 007 and Chernobyl: The Soviet management of crises.\" Survival 29.3 (1987): 215\u2013223.</ref>\n\n==Death and funeral==\n[[File:Reagan at the USSR Embassy.jpg|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] signing condolence book on death of Andropov at the Soviet Embassy]]\nIn February 1983, Andropov suffered total [[kidney failure]]. In August 1983, he entered the Central Clinical Hospital in western Moscow on a permanent basis, where he would spend the remainder of his life.\n\nIn late January 1984, Andropov's health deteriorated sharply and due to growing [[Kidney failure|toxicity in his blood]], he had periods of falling consciousness. He died on 9 February 1984 at 16:50 in his hospital room at age 69.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/world/andropov-dead-moscow-69-reagan-asks-productive-contacts-names-bush-attend.html|title=Andropov is Dead in Moscow at 69; Reagan Asks 'Productive Contacts' and Names Bush to Attend Funeral|last=Burns|first=John F.|date=11 February 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=11 July 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Few of the top Soviet leaders, not even all the Politburo members, learned of his death on that day. According to the Soviet post mortem medical report, Andropov suffered from several medical conditions: [[interstitial nephritis]], [[nephrosclerosis]], residual [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes]], which were worsened by chronic kidney deficiency.\n\nA four-day period of nationwide mourning was announced. Andropov was succeeded by [[Konstantin Chernenko]], who seemed to mirror Andropov's tenure. Chernenko had already been afflicted with severe health problems when he ascended to the USSR's top spot, and served an even shorter time in office (13 months). Like Andropov, Chernenko spent much of his time hospitalized, and also died in office, in March 1985.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n\nAndropov lived at 26 [[Kutuzovsky Prospekt]], the same building in which Suslov and Brezhnev also lived. He was first married to Nina Ivanovna; she was born not far from the local farm in which Andropov was born. In 1983 she was diagnosed with [[cancer]] and underwent a successful operation. He met his second wife, Tatyana Filipovna, during World War II on the [[Karelian Front]] when she was Komsomol secretary. She had suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. Andropov's chief guard informed Tatyana about the death of her husband. She was too grief-stricken to join in the procession and during the funeral her relatives helped her to walk. Before the lid could be closed on Andropov's coffin, she bent to kiss him. She touched his hair and then kissed him again. In 1985, a respectful 75-minute film was broadcast in which Tatyana (not even seen in public until Andropov's funeral) reads love poems written by her husband. Tatyana became ill and died in November 1991.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[image:Yuri andropov grave in the kremlin wall necropolis july 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Grave of Andropov at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]], Moscow.]]\nAndropov's legacy remains the subject of much debate in Russia and elsewhere, both among scholars and in the popular media. He remains the focus of television documentaries and popular non-fiction, particularly around important anniversaries. As KGB head, Andropov was ruthless against dissent, and author [[David Remnick]], who covered the Soviet Union for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in the 1980s, called Andropov \"profoundly corrupt, a beast\".<ref name=\"D\">Remnick, David, ''Lenin's Tomb:The Last Days of the Soviet Empire''. New York; Random House, 1993, p. 191.</ref> [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], later an advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev and the ideologist of [[perestroika]], said: \"In a way I always thought Andropov was the most dangerous of all of them, simply because he was smarter than the rest.\"<ref name=\"D\"/> However, it was Andropov himself who recalled Yakovlev back to high office in Moscow in 1983 after a ten-year exile as ambassador to Canada after attacking Russian chauvinism. Yakovlev was also a close colleague of Andropov associate KGB General [[Yevgeny Primakov]], later [[Prime Minister of Russia]]. Andropov began to follow a trend of replacing elderly officials with considerably younger replacements.\n\nAccording to his former subordinate [[Securitate]] general [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]],\n\n<blockquote>In the West, if Andropov is remembered at all, it is for his brutal suppression of political dissidence at home and for his role in planning the [[Prague Spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. By contrast, the leaders of the former [[Warsaw Pact]] intelligence community, when I was one of them, looked up to Andropov as the man who substituted the KGB for the Communist party in governing the Soviet Union, and who was the godfather of Russia's new era of deception operations aimed at improving the badly damaged image of Soviet rulers in the West.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/pacepa200409200814.asp No Peter the Great. Vladimir Putin is in the Andropov mold], by [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], ''[[National Review]]'', 20 September 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite Andropov's hard-line stance in [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungary]] and the numerous banishments and intrigues for which he was responsible during his long tenure as head of the KGB, he has become widely regarded by many commentators as a reformer, especially in comparison with the [[stagnation (USSR)|stagnation]] and corruption during the later years of his predecessor, Leonid Brezhnev. Andropov, \"a throwback to a tradition of Leninist asceticism\",<ref name = \"D\"/> was appalled by the corruption during Brezhnev's regime, and ordered investigations and arrests of the most flagrant abusers. The investigations were so frightening that several members of Brezhnev's circle \"shot, gassed or otherwise did away with themselves.\"<ref name=\"D\"/> He was certainly generally regarded as inclined to more gradual and constructive reform than was Gorbachev; most of the speculation centres around whether Andropov would have reformed the USSR in a manner which did not result in its [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|eventual dissolution]].\n\nThe Western media favored Andropov because of his supposed passion for Western music and scotch.<ref>Suny, Ronald Grigor, ''The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the successor states'' Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 449.</ref> However, these were unproven rumours. It is also questionable whether Andropov spoke any English at all.<ref>Edward Jay Epstein [http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/andropov.htm The Andropov Hoax] ''The New Republic'' 7 February 1983</ref> The short time he spent as leader, much of it in a state of extreme ill health, leaves debaters few concrete indications as to the nature of any [[alternate history (fiction)|hypothetical]] extended rule. The 2002 Tom Clancy novel ''[[Red Rabbit]]'' focuses heavily on Andropov during his tenure of KGB chief, when his health is slightly better.

Following the 18-year rule of [[Leonid Brezhnev]], Andropov served in the post from November 1982 until his death in February 1984.\n\nEarlier in his career, Andropov served as the Soviet ambassador to Hungary from 1954 to 1957, during which time he was involved in the suppression of the [[1956 Hungarian Uprising]]. He was named Chairman of the KGB on 10 May 1967. In this position,  he oversaw a massive crackdown on dissent that was carried out via mass arrests and the wholesale application of involuntary psychiatric [[Involuntary commitment|commitment]] of people deemed \"socially undesirable\". As Brezhnev's health declined during the latter years of his leadership, Andropov formed a [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union#List of troikas|troika]] alongside Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] and Defense Minister [[Dmitry Ustinov]] that ultimately came to dominate Soviet policy.\n\nUpon Brezhnev's death on 10 November 1982, Yuri Andropov succeeded him as General Secretary and (by extension) [[leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]]. During his short tenure, Andropov sought to eliminate corruption and inefficiency within the Soviet system by investigating longtime officials for violations of party discipline and criminalizing truancy in the workplace. The Cold War intensified,  and he was at a loss for how to handle the growing crisis in the Soviet economy. His major long-term impact was bringing to the fore a new generation of young reformers, as energetic as himself,  including [[Yegor Ligachyov]], [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and, most important, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>Mauricio Borrero, \"Andropov, Yuri Vladimirovich 1914\u20131984.\" ''Encyclopedia of Modern Dictators'' (2006), pp. 7\u201310.</ref>  However, upon suffering [[kidney failure]] in February 1983, Andropov's health began to deteriorate rapidly.

In 1961, he was elected full member of the [[CPSU Central Committee]] and was promoted to the [[Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee]] in 1962.

Biographers including Solovyov and Klepikova (1983) and Zhores Medvedev (1983) have discussed the complex possibilities underlying the motivations of anti-corruption campaigning in the Soviet Union during the 1970s and early 1980s: at the same time that it is true that Andropov fought corruption for moral, ethical, ascetic, and ideological reasons, it is also true that it was an effective way for party members from the police and security organizations to defeat competitors for power at the senior levels of the party. Thus Andropov himself, as well as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s including [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], could advance their own power by the same efforts that also promised to be better for the country in terms of justice, economic performance, and even defense readiness (which depended on economic performance). Thus there was a certain inevitable amount of \"what's better for the country also happens to align with what's best for my own power.\" It is not possible to measure the exact balance of self-interest versus selfless altruism and patriotism in this equation. Part of the complexity is that in the Brezhnev era, much corruption was implicitly tolerated and was pervasive (although officially denied), and many a member of the police and security organizations themselves participated in it to various degrees, but only those organizations had access to the power to measure it and monitor its details. In such an environment, anti-corruption campaigning is inherently a path by which police and security people have the potential or opportunity to appear to be white-hat heroes cleaning up the malfeasance of black-hat villains and 'coincidentally' increasing their own power, whereas there may be an underlying reality of one set of gray-hat [[antihero]]es defeating another set of gray-hat antiheroes in a [[wikt:grey area|morally gray]] power struggle. This complex dynamic is perennial; 21st-century anti-corruption campaigns are just as subject to its possibilities as were 20th-century instances.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Anti kernwapendemonstratie in Den Haag ( 550 duizend deelnemers ) overzichten m, Bestanddeelnr 253-8819.jpg|thumb|Protest against the [[nuclear arms race]] between the U.S./NATO and the Soviet Union, [[The Hague]], Netherlands, 1983]]\nAndropov faced a series of foreign policy crises: the hopeless situation of the Soviet army in Afghanistan, threatened revolt in Poland, growing animosity with China, the polarization threat of war in the Middle East, Troubles in Ethiopia and South Africa. The most critical threat was the \"Second Cold War\" launched by American President Ronald Reagan and a specific attack on rolling back what he denounced as the \"[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]\". Reagan was using American economic power, and Soviet economic weakness, to escalate massive spending on the [[Cold War]], emphasizing high technology that Moscow lacked.<ref>Lawrence T.

That included tanks and armored troop carriers, hundreds of fighter planes, as well as anti-aircraft systems, artillery systems, and all sorts of high tech equipment for which the USSR was the main supplier for its allies.

Andropov's rule was also marked by deterioration of relations with the [[United States]]. During a much-publicized \"walk in the woods\" with Soviet dignitary Yuli Kvitsinsky, American diplomat [[Paul Nitze]] suggested a compromise for reducing nuclear missiles in Europe on both sides that was ultimately ignored by the Politburo.<ref>{{cite book |last=Matlock |first=Jack F., Jr. |title=Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2005|location=New York |pages=41\u201346 |isbn=978-0-8129-7489-8}}</ref> Kvitsinsky would later write that, despite his own efforts, the Soviet leadership was not interested in compromise, instead calculating that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kwizinskij|first=Julij A. |title=Vor dem Sturm: Erinnerungen eines Diplomaten |publisher=Siedler Verlag |year=1993 |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-88680-464-1}}</ref> On 8 March 1983, during Andropov's reign as General Secretary, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] famously labeled the Soviet Union an \"[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]\". The same month, on 23 March, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. Reagan claimed this research program into ballistic missile defence would be \"consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty\". However, Andropov was dismissive of this claim, and said that \"It is time they [Washington] stopped ... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war. ... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane\".<ref>''[[Pravda]]'', 27 March 1983</ref>\n\nIn August 1983, Andropov made an announcement that the country was stopping all work on space-based weapons. One of his most notable acts during his short time as leader of the Soviet Union was in response to a letter from a 10-year-old American child from Maine named [[Samantha Smith]], inviting her to the Soviet Union. She came, but he was too ill to meet with her, thus revealing his grave condition to the world. Meanwhile, Soviet\u2013U.S. arms control talks on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe were suspended by the Soviet Union in November 1983 and by the end of the year, the Soviets had broken off all arms control negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Church|first=George J.|title=Person of the Year 1983: Ronald Reagan and Yuri Andropov|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=1 January 1984 |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1983.html|accessdate=2 January 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:1981-09-15 12-00-00 United States Hawaii Aliamanu 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|A photograph of Korean Air Lines HL7442, the airliner shot down by Soviet aircraft after drifting into [[prohibited airspace]] during the KAL 007 Flight.]]\nMassive bad publicity worldwide came when Soviet fighters shot down a civilian jet liner, [[Korean Air Flight KAL-007]], which carried 269 passengers and crew. It had strayed over the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 on its scheduled route from Anchorage, Alaska, US to Seoul, South Korea. Andropov kept secret the fact that the Soviet Union held in its possession the [[Flight recorder|black box]] from KAL 007 which proved the pilot had made a typographical error when entering data in the automatic pilot. Soviet air defence system was unprepared to deal with a civilian airliner, and the shooting down was a matter of following orders without question.<ref>Jonathan Haslam,  \"The KAL shootdown (1983) and the state of Soviet air defence.\" ''Intelligence and National Security'' 3.4 (1988): 128\u2013133.</ref> Instead of admitting an accident, Soviet media proclaimed a brave decision to meet a Western provocation. Together with the low credibility created by the poor explanation in 1986 of the meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, the episode demonstrated an inability to deal with public relations crises; the propaganda system was only useful for individuals and states that were aligned with the Soviet Union. Both crises were escalated by technological and organizational failures, compounded by human error.<ref>Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, \"KAL 007 and Chernobyl: The Soviet management of crises.\" Survival 29.3 (1987): 215\u2013223.</ref>\n\n==Death and funeral==\n[[File:Reagan at the USSR Embassy.jpg|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] signing condolence book on death of Andropov at the Soviet Embassy]]\nIn February 1983, Andropov suffered total [[kidney failure]]. In August 1983, he entered the Central Clinical Hospital in western Moscow on a permanent basis, where he would spend the remainder of his life.\n\nIn late January 1984, Andropov's health deteriorated sharply and due to growing [[Kidney failure|toxicity in his blood]], he had periods of falling consciousness. He died on 9 February 1984 at 16:50 in his hospital room at age 69.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/world/andropov-dead-moscow-69-reagan-asks-productive-contacts-names-bush-attend.html|title=Andropov is Dead in Moscow at 69; Reagan Asks 'Productive Contacts' and Names Bush to Attend Funeral|last=Burns|first=John F.|date=11 February 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=11 July 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Few of the top Soviet leaders, not even all the Politburo members, learned of his death on that day. According to the Soviet post mortem medical report, Andropov suffered from several medical conditions: [[interstitial nephritis]], [[nephrosclerosis]], residual [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes]], which were worsened by chronic kidney deficiency.\n\nA four-day period of nationwide mourning was announced. Andropov was succeeded by [[Konstantin Chernenko]], who seemed to mirror Andropov's tenure. Chernenko had already been afflicted with severe health problems when he ascended to the USSR's top spot, and served an even shorter time in office (13 months). Like Andropov, Chernenko spent much of his time hospitalized, and also died in office, in March 1985.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n\nAndropov lived at 26 [[Kutuzovsky Prospekt]], the same building in which Suslov and Brezhnev also lived. He was first married to Nina Ivanovna; she was born not far from the local farm in which Andropov was born. In 1983 she was diagnosed with [[cancer]] and underwent a successful operation. He met his second wife, Tatyana Filipovna, during World War II on the [[Karelian Front]] when she was Komsomol secretary. She had suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. Andropov's chief guard informed Tatyana about the death of her husband. She was too grief-stricken to join in the procession and during the funeral her relatives helped her to walk. Before the lid could be closed on Andropov's coffin, she bent to kiss him. She touched his hair and then kissed him again. In 1985, a respectful 75-minute film was broadcast in which Tatyana (not even seen in public until Andropov's funeral) reads love poems written by her husband. Tatyana became ill and died in November 1991.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[image:Yuri andropov grave in the kremlin wall necropolis july 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Grave of Andropov at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]], Moscow.]]\nAndropov's legacy remains the subject of much debate in Russia and elsewhere, both among scholars and in the popular media. He remains the focus of television documentaries and popular non-fiction, particularly around important anniversaries. As KGB head, Andropov was ruthless against dissent, and author [[David Remnick]], who covered the Soviet Union for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in the 1980s, called Andropov \"profoundly corrupt, a beast\".<ref name=\"D\">Remnick, David, ''Lenin's Tomb:The Last Days of the Soviet Empire''. New York; Random House, 1993, p. 191.</ref> [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], later an advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev and the ideologist of [[perestroika]], said: \"In a way I always thought Andropov was the most dangerous of all of them, simply because he was smarter than the rest.\"<ref name=\"D\"/> However, it was Andropov himself who recalled Yakovlev back to high office in Moscow in 1983 after a ten-year exile as ambassador to Canada after attacking Russian chauvinism. Yakovlev was also a close colleague of Andropov associate KGB General [[Yevgeny Primakov]], later [[Prime Minister of Russia]]. Andropov began to follow a trend of replacing elderly officials with considerably younger replacements.\n\nAccording to his former subordinate [[Securitate]] general [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]],\n\n<blockquote>In the West, if Andropov is remembered at all, it is for his brutal suppression of political dissidence at home and for his role in planning the [[Prague Spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. By contrast, the leaders of the former [[Warsaw Pact]] intelligence community, when I was one of them, looked up to Andropov as the man who substituted the KGB for the Communist party in governing the Soviet Union, and who was the godfather of Russia's new era of deception operations aimed at improving the badly damaged image of Soviet rulers in the West.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/pacepa200409200814.asp No Peter the Great. Vladimir Putin is in the Andropov mold], by [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], ''[[National Review]]'', 20 September 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite Andropov's hard-line stance in [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungary]] and the numerous banishments and intrigues for which he was responsible during his long tenure as head of the KGB, he has become widely regarded by many commentators as a reformer, especially in comparison with the [[stagnation (USSR)|stagnation]] and corruption during the later years of his predecessor, Leonid Brezhnev. Andropov, \"a throwback to a tradition of Leninist asceticism\",<ref name = \"D\"/> was appalled by the corruption during Brezhnev's regime, and ordered investigations and arrests of the most flagrant abusers. The investigations were so frightening that several members of Brezhnev's circle \"shot, gassed or otherwise did away with themselves.\"<ref name=\"D\"/> He was certainly generally regarded as inclined to more gradual and constructive reform than was Gorbachev; most of the speculation centres around whether Andropov would have reformed the USSR in a manner which did not result in its [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|eventual dissolution]].\n\nThe Western media favored Andropov because of his supposed passion for Western music and scotch.<ref>Suny, Ronald Grigor, ''The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the successor states'' Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 449.</ref> However, these were unproven rumours. It is also questionable whether Andropov spoke any English at all.<ref>Edward Jay Epstein [http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/andropov.htm The Andropov Hoax] ''The New Republic'' 7 February 1983</ref> The short time he spent as leader, much of it in a state of extreme ill health, leaves debaters few concrete indications as to the nature of any [[alternate history (fiction)|hypothetical]] extended rule. The 2002 Tom Clancy novel ''[[Red Rabbit]]'' focuses heavily on Andropov during his tenure of KGB chief, when his health is slightly better. It mirrors his secrecy in that British and American intelligence know little about him, not even able to confirm he was a married man. The novel also depicts Andropov as being a fan of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboros]] and [[starka]] vodka, almost never available to ordinary Soviet citizens.\n\n==Attitudes to Andropov==\nIn a message read out at the opening of a new exhibition dedicated to Andropov, [[Vladimir Putin]] called him \"a man of talent with great abilities.\"<ref>{{cite news|author =Miletitch, Nicolas|title=Andropov birth centenary evokes nostalgia for Soviet hardliner|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Arts-and-Ent/Culture/2014/Jul-29/265406-andropov-birth-centenary-evokes-nostalgia-for-soviet-hardliner.ashx|work=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)]]|date=29 July 2014}}</ref> Putin has praised Andropov's \"honesty and uprightness.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Putin puts Yuri Andropov back on his pedestal|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/putin-puts-yuri-andropov-back-on-his-pedestal-1.1145047|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=16 June 2004}}</ref> According to Russian historian [[Nikita Petrov]], \"He was a typical Soviet jailer who violated human rights.

The amount of stock which needed to be destroyed (because it was impossible to tell if a given item had been tampered with), and the threat of public fear, meant that tamper-evident design principles had the potential to save a lot of money in the future.\n\nJars of food items soon started appearing with a metal bubble-top lid, commonly known as a \"safety button\", which\u2014like the lid of a [[Mason jar]]\u2014popped out if the jar had ever been opened and stayed flat if the jar was in pristine condition. Customers were advised to never buy a product with a popped lid. (These lids would also pop out if the jar was contaminated by gas-producing bacteria, which was an additional safety feature.) Presumably the seal was achieved by packaging the jars in a low-pressure atmosphere, although companies were reluctant to divulge details.\n\nNewer jars of food tend to come with a plastic wrap around the edge of the lid, which is removed when opening, although the springy-cap designs are still in common use.\n\nTamper-evident packaging also extends to protect stores; there are some scale labels for meats and deli products that will tear if removed.\n\nThe [[Chicago Tylenol murders|Tylenol Crisis of 1982]] involved [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter medications]]. Due to [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] regulations, many manufacturers of food and medicine (as well as other products) now use [[induction sealing]] and other special means to help provide evidence of tampering. Break-away components which cannot be reattached are useful. Custom [[seal (mechanical)|seals]], [[security tape]]s, [[label]]s, [[RFID tags]], etc. are sometimes added.\n\nThe current epidemic of opioid abuse and drug abuse has led to a search for tamper-evident strategies to protect central vascular lines. Drug users who shoot drugs into their veins often acquire infections of the heart valves (endocarditis), liver, bones, lungs, and other organs. Treatment of these infections requires several weeks of intravenous antibiotics. During the treatment period, these patients can use the central intravenous line or peripherally inserted central line (PICC) to inject narcotics or other illicit drugs. Evidence exists that applying a tamper-evident device to the central line can deter illicit use of the line.\n\nSecurity packaging is needed to contain evidence of crimes. Items must be kept in an unaltered state until they are submitted in a legal proceeding.\n\nPackaging that tears open raggedly or otherwise cannot readily be resealed is sometimes used to help indicate tampering.\n\nOften, multiple layers or redundant indicators are used because no single layer or device is \"tamper-proof\". Consideration should be given to unique custom indicators (which should be changed regularly because these are subject to counterfeiting).\n\nEnd-users and consumers need to be educated to watch for signs of tampering, both at the primary means of entrance and at secondary or \"back door\" locations on a package.\n\n==Credit cards, money, stamps, coupons==\nIn [[finance|financial]] terms, tamper-evident design overlaps a lot with anti-[[forgery]] techniques, as ways to detect monetary tokens which are [[counterfeit|not what they seem]].\n\n[[Postage stamp]]s, for example, may contain a layer of ultraviolet-reflective ink which changes state under pressure. The impact from a [[postmark]]ing machine then leaves a UV-visible mark as well as an ink mark which identifies attempts to reuse stamps.\n\nIn a similar vein, asset-numbering labels on corporate equipment (PCs and the like) are often designed to leave an imprint of either the serial number, or the word \"VOID\" if the label is peeled off. However, this can easily be defeated by warming up the label using a [[blow dryer]] so it will be more flexible and forgiving to removal (and reapplication).\n\n[[Vignette (road tax)|Road tax vignettes]] and price tags are often tamper-evident in the sense that they cannot be removed in one piece. This makes it difficult to move a vignette from one car to another, or to peel off a price tag from a cheaper article and reapply it to a more expensive one.\n\nMoney is tamper-evident in the sense that it should be difficult to produce a financial token without authorization, even if starting from a token of lower value. For example, forgers may attempt to clean the ink from a banknote and print the image of a higher-denomination note on it, giving them the carefully guarded \"banknote paper\" which is otherwise very difficult to obtain. This may be one of the reasons why many countries use banknotes of different size in ascending order of value. A British \u00a35 [[banknote]] issued by [[Bank of England]] is much smaller than a \u00a350 banknote, and therefore can't be used to create a \u00a350 note.\n\n==Physical security==\n\nTamper-evident physical devices are common in sensitive computer installations, for example [[computer network|network]] cabling is often run down transparent [[electrical conduit|conduit]] in plain view and switches located in glass-fronted cabinets, where any unusual device attached to the network can easily be seen.\n\nDespite the easy availability of miniature [[keystroke logging|key loggers]], tamper-evident design is not often used in [[personal computer]]s. While transparent computer cases and keyboards are common, they are mainly used for the decorative effect rather than security. Many PCs do have a switch to detect opening of the case, and this provides a visual notification when the computer is next turned on that the case has recently been opened. In any case, it has long been possible to complicate the task of tampering with electronic devices by sealing them with tamper-evident tape or [[sealing wax]]. Alternatively, radio-controlled alarm-devices (which transmit a silent alarm) can be installed, or cases can be glued shut in such a manner that tampering attempts will distort or fracture the casing.\n\n[[Fire alarm]]s and other emergency switches are typically non-reversible, using a piece of glass which must be broken to activate the alarm. For example, Panic buttons in [[burglar alarm]] systems might require a plastic key to reset the switch.\n\nIn very much the same manner as with fire alarms, many emergency handles and levers, or handles that are not meant to be opened regularly, are enclosed in a thin metal or plastic security seal. The seal is thin, so as not to prevent the handle from being used (in due time), but only to alert maintenance/security personnel that the handle was indeed used.\nMany times, large sea-going shipping containers have such a metal ring or seal attached to them at the source port. After traveling at sea (and perhaps by land as well), the containers reach their destination, where each container is checked to have the seal properly in place (against a list of doublets - container/seal).\n\nIn [[police]] work, tamper-evident techniques must often be used to guard access to evidence, providing means of storing items and samples in a way which can be used to prove that they were not altered after their collection. It could be argued that [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] systems perform a similar function in the handling of suspects. Video systems of course, can be given tamper-evident features by the use of [[timestamp]]s generated by a suitably trusted clock.\n\n==Computer systems==\nIn [[cryptography|cryptographic]] terminology, [[cryptographic hash function]]s and cryptographic signatures are used to add a tamper-evident layer of protection to document, often referred to as an [[electronic signature]].\n\n[[Hardware-based full disk encryption#Enclosed hard disk drive FDE|Hardware-encrypted full disk drives]] utilise tamper-evident cases, so when it is retrieved the owner can be assured that the [[data breach|data has not been compromised]], thus preventing costly further actions such as notifying the data owners.<ref name=\"Nationwide\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/moneybox/6371089.stm Nationwide wrote to all customers]</ref>\n\nThe document, email, or file to be protected is used to generate a signed [[hash function|hash]], a number generated from the contents of the document. Any change to the document, no matter how trivial, such as changing a single [[bit]] from a 1 to a 0, will cause it to have a different hash, which will make the signature invalid. To alter a document while purposely maintaining the same hash, assuming the hash function and the program implementing it are properly designed, is extremely difficult. See [[Avalanche effect]] and [[Hash collision]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Active packaging]]\n*[[Chicago Tylenol murders|1982 Chicago Tylenol murders]]\n*[[Dye pack]]\n*[[Hardware-based full disk encryption#Enclosed hard disk drive FDE|Hardware-based full disk encryption]]\n*[[Ink tag]]\n*[[Package pilferage]]\n*[[Packaging and labeling]]\n*[[Sealing wax]]\n*[[Security printing]]\n*[[Security seal]]\n*[[Tamperproofing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.fda.gov/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm074391.htm FDA Compliance Policy Guides \u2013 CPG Sec. 450.500 Tamper-Resistant Packaging Requirements for Certain Over-the-Counter Human Drug Products]\n*\"Improving Tamper-Evident Packaging: Problems, Tests and Solutions\", Jack L.

The impact from a [[postmark]]ing machine then leaves a UV-visible mark as well as an ink mark which identifies attempts to reuse stamps.\n\nIn a similar vein, asset-numbering labels on corporate equipment (PCs and the like) are often designed to leave an imprint of either the serial number, or the word \"VOID\" if the label is peeled off. However, this can easily be defeated by warming up the label using a [[blow dryer]] so it will be more flexible and forgiving to removal (and reapplication).\n\n[[Vignette (road tax)|Road tax vignettes]] and price tags are often tamper-evident in the sense that they cannot be removed in one piece. This makes it difficult to move a vignette from one car to another, or to peel off a price tag from a cheaper article and reapply it to a more expensive one.\n\nMoney is tamper-evident in the sense that it should be difficult to produce a financial token without authorization, even if starting from a token of lower value. For example, forgers may attempt to clean the ink from a banknote and print the image of a higher-denomination note on it, giving them the carefully guarded \"banknote paper\" which is otherwise very difficult to obtain. This may be one of the reasons why many countries use banknotes of different size in ascending order of value. A British \u00a35 [[banknote]] issued by [[Bank of England]] is much smaller than a \u00a350 banknote, and therefore can't be used to create a \u00a350 note.\n\n==Physical security==\n\nTamper-evident physical devices are common in sensitive computer installations, for example [[computer network|network]] cabling is often run down transparent [[electrical conduit|conduit]] in plain view and switches located in glass-fronted cabinets, where any unusual device attached to the network can easily be seen.\n\nDespite the easy availability of miniature [[keystroke logging|key loggers]], tamper-evident design is not often used in [[personal computer]]s. While transparent computer cases and keyboards are common, they are mainly used for the decorative effect rather than security. Many PCs do have a switch to detect opening of the case, and this provides a visual notification when the computer is next turned on that the case has recently been opened. In any case, it has long been possible to complicate the task of tampering with electronic devices by sealing them with tamper-evident tape or [[sealing wax]]. Alternatively, radio-controlled alarm-devices (which transmit a silent alarm) can be installed, or cases can be glued shut in such a manner that tampering attempts will distort or fracture the casing.\n\n[[Fire alarm]]s and other emergency switches are typically non-reversible, using a piece of glass which must be broken to activate the alarm. For example, Panic buttons in [[burglar alarm]] systems might require a plastic key to reset the switch.\n\nIn very much the same manner as with fire alarms, many emergency handles and levers, or handles that are not meant to be opened regularly, are enclosed in a thin metal or plastic security seal. The seal is thin, so as not to prevent the handle from being used (in due time), but only to alert maintenance/security personnel that the handle was indeed used.\nMany times, large sea-going shipping containers have such a metal ring or seal attached to them at the source port. After traveling at sea (and perhaps by land as well), the containers reach their destination, where each container is checked to have the seal properly in place (against a list of doublets - container/seal).\n\nIn [[police]] work, tamper-evident techniques must often be used to guard access to evidence, providing means of storing items and samples in a way which can be used to prove that they were not altered after their collection. It could be argued that [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] systems perform a similar function in the handling of suspects. Video systems of course, can be given tamper-evident features by the use of [[timestamp]]s generated by a suitably trusted clock.\n\n==Computer systems==\nIn [[cryptography|cryptographic]] terminology, [[cryptographic hash function]]s and cryptographic signatures are used to add a tamper-evident layer of protection to document, often referred to as an [[electronic signature]].\n\n[[Hardware-based full disk encryption#Enclosed hard disk drive FDE|Hardware-encrypted full disk drives]] utilise tamper-evident cases, so when it is retrieved the owner can be assured that the [[data breach|data has not been compromised]], thus preventing costly further actions such as notifying the data owners.<ref name=\"Nationwide\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/moneybox/6371089.stm Nationwide wrote to all customers]</ref>\n\nThe document, email, or file to be protected is used to generate a signed [[hash function|hash]], a number generated from the contents of the document. Any change to the document, no matter how trivial, such as changing a single [[bit]] from a 1 to a 0, will cause it to have a different hash, which will make the signature invalid. To alter a document while purposely maintaining the same hash, assuming the hash function and the program implementing it are properly designed, is extremely difficult. See [[Avalanche effect]] and [[Hash collision]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Active packaging]]\n*[[Chicago Tylenol murders|1982 Chicago Tylenol murders]]\n*[[Dye pack]]\n*[[Hardware-based full disk encryption#Enclosed hard disk drive FDE|Hardware-based full disk encryption]]\n*[[Ink tag]]\n*[[Package pilferage]]\n*[[Packaging and labeling]]\n*[[Sealing wax]]\n*[[Security printing]]\n*[[Security seal]]\n*[[Tamperproofing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.fda.gov/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm074391.htm FDA Compliance Policy Guides \u2013 CPG Sec. 450.500 Tamper-Resistant Packaging Requirements for Certain Over-the-Counter Human Drug Products]\n*\"Improving Tamper-Evident Packaging: Problems, Tests and Solutions\", Jack L.
