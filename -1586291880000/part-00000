Wood had purchased the {{convert|254|acre|ha}} comprising Del Ray for $38,900, while the {{convert|39|acre|ha}} of St. Elmo were purchased for $15,314. Del Ray originally contained six east\u2013west streets and five north\u2013south. All were identical in width, except Mt. Vernon Avenue, which was approximately twenty feet wider. St. Elmo's, a smaller tract, was laid out in a similar pattern, but with only four east\u2013west streets and one running north\u2013south. Between the two neighborhoods was the [[St. Asaph Racetrack]], a once-controversial [[gambling]] establishment that shut down after a 1904 raid; the location of the racetrack caused some deviation from a pure-grid street pattern, which remains to this day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2012/aug/23/hidden-history-st-asaph-racetrack/|title=Hidden History of St. Asaph Racetrack|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1900, Del Ray contained approximately 130 people, and St. Elmo's 55.

It is the most typically suburban part of Alexandria, with a [[street hierarchy]] of winding roads and [[cul-de-sac]]s. The section of [[Virginia State Route 236|Duke Street]] in the West End is known for a high-density residential area known to locals as \"Landmark\" due to its close proximity to nearby [[Landmark Mall]], and for its concentration of strip and enclosed [[shopping mall]]s. Parts of Alexandria's West End have received an influx of immigrants from [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]], who have settled in the areas surrounding Seminary Road west of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia\u2013Virginia)|I-395]].\n\nThe main areas of the West End all are west of Quaker Lane, a major north\u2013south artery through the western side of Alexandria.\n\n===Seminary Hill===\nSeminary Hill is a mostly residential, single-family dwelling area near the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]], [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Episcopal High School]] and [[St. Stephen's & St. Agnes School]] off of Seminary Road, ending in the area just west of the [[Inova Health System|Inova Alexandria Hospital]].\n\n[[T.C.

There are also areas of industrial businesses south of Duke Street, primarily off Wheeler Ave., South Pickett St., and South Van Dorn St. In the very southern part of this area is the Eisenhower Ave. corridor running parallel to the Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495) and west of Telegraph Rd, which is primarily industrial and commercial in nature.

Wood had purchased the {{convert|254|acre|ha}} comprising Del Ray for $38,900, while the {{convert|39|acre|ha}} of St. Elmo were purchased for $15,314. Del Ray originally contained six east\u2013west streets and five north\u2013south. All were identical in width, except Mt. Vernon Avenue, which was approximately twenty feet wider. St. Elmo's, a smaller tract, was laid out in a similar pattern, but with only four east\u2013west streets and one running north\u2013south. Between the two neighborhoods was the [[St. Asaph Racetrack]], a once-controversial [[gambling]] establishment that shut down after a 1904 raid; the location of the racetrack caused some deviation from a pure-grid street pattern, which remains to this day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2012/aug/23/hidden-history-st-asaph-racetrack/|title=Hidden History of St. Asaph Racetrack|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1900, Del Ray contained approximately 130 people, and St. Elmo's 55. In 1908, the tracts of Del Ray, St. Elmo's, Mt. Ida, and Hume were incorporated into the town of Potomac, which by 1910 had a population of 599; by 1920 it contained 1,000; by 1928 it had 2,355 residents.

It is the most typically suburban part of Alexandria, with a [[street hierarchy]] of winding roads and [[cul-de-sac]]s. The section of [[Virginia State Route 236|Duke Street]] in the West End is known for a high-density residential area known to locals as \"Landmark\" due to its close proximity to nearby [[Landmark Mall]], and for its concentration of strip and enclosed [[shopping mall]]s. Parts of Alexandria's West End have received an influx of immigrants from [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]], who have settled in the areas surrounding Seminary Road west of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia\u2013Virginia)|I-395]].\n\nThe main areas of the West End all are west of Quaker Lane, a major north\u2013south artery through the western side of Alexandria.\n\n===Seminary Hill===\nSeminary Hill is a mostly residential, single-family dwelling area near the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]], [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Episcopal High School]] and [[St. Stephen's & St. Agnes School]] off of Seminary Road, ending in the area just west of the [[Inova Health System|Inova Alexandria Hospital]].\n\n[[T.C.

The section between Wheeler Ave. and Jordan St. is also known as the \"Block.\" In the 1960s and 1970s, this section of Alexandria was also known because of Shirley Duke, a complex of 2,214 low-priced rental apartments, which became the Foxchase development in the early 1980s after five years of stagnancy. There are also areas of industrial businesses south of Duke Street, primarily off Wheeler Ave., South Pickett St., and South Van Dorn St. In the very southern part of this area is the Eisenhower Ave. corridor running parallel to the Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495) and west of Telegraph Rd, which is primarily industrial and commercial in nature. There has been development in apartments and townhouses in the area west of Telegraph Rd and east of Clermont Ave along with Class 1 Offices and national brand hotels.

The 18-arched stone and [[cast iron]] structure is for use by [[narrowboat]]s and was completed in 1805 having taken ten years to design and build. It is the longest aqueduct in [[Great Britain]] and the highest canal aqueduct in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/8115190.stm |date=27 June 2009 |title=Aqueduct crowned world 'wonder' |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/3321311/Pontcysyllte-Aqueduct-in-World-Heritage-bid.html |last=Clover |first=Charles |work=Daily Telegraph |title=Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in World Heritage bid |date=11 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe aqueduct was to have been a key part of the central section of the proposed [[Ellesmere Canal]], an industrial waterway that would have created a commercial link between the [[River Severn]] at [[Shrewsbury]] and the [[Port of Liverpool]] on the [[River Mersey]]. Although a less expensive construction course was surveyed further to the east, the westerly high-ground route across the Vale of Llangollen was preferred because it would have taken the canal through the mineral-rich coalfields of [[North East Wales]]. Only parts of the canal route were completed because the expected revenues required to complete the entire project were never generated. Most major work ceased after the completion of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1805.\n\nThe structure is a [[Grade I listed buildings in Wrexham County Borough|Grade I listed building]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/planning_portal/publications/listed_build_exhib/pontcysyllte_aque.htm|title=Listed Buildings: Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, Trevor|website=Wrexham.gov.uk|accessdate=25 May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013142701/http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/planning_portal/publications/listed_build_exhib/pontcysyllte_aque.htm|archivedate=13 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Pontcysyllte'' is [[Welsh language|Welsh]] for \"Cysyllte Bridge\" or \"Bridge of Cysyllte\", Cysyllte being the [[township (England)|township]] of the old parish of [[Llangollen]] in which the southern end of the bridge lies.<ref name=\"DictionaryPlaceNamesWales\">{{cite book|last=Owen|first=Hywel Wyn|title=A Dictionary of Place-Names in Wales|year=2007|publisher=Gomer Press|location=Ceredigion, Wales|isbn=978-1-84323-901-7}}</ref>  The northern end of the bridge was in Trefor Isaf township, also in Llangollen parish.{{Citation needed|date = November 2019}}\n\nOther translations such as \"Bridge of the Junction\" or \"The Bridge that links\" are a modern [[false etymology]], derived from the name's apparent similarity to the word ''{{lang|cy|cysylltau}}'' (plural of ''cyswllt'') which means connections or links.<ref>[http://geiriadur.ac.uk/gpc/gpc.html?cyswllt cyswllt]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:WalesC0047.jpg|thumbnail|The aqueduct viewed from the valley below]]\nThe aqueduct was designed by civil engineers [[Thomas Telford]] and [[William Jessop]] for a location near an 18th-century road crossing, [[Pont Cysyllte]]. After the westerly high-ground route was approved, the original plan was to create a series of locks down both sides of the valley to an embankment that would carry the [[Ellesmere Canal]] over the River Dee. After Telford was hired the plan was changed to an aqueduct that would create an uninterrupted waterway straight across the valley. Despite considerable public scepticism, Telford was confident his construction method would work because he had previously built a cast-iron trough aqueduct \u2013 the [[Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct]] on the [[Shrewsbury Canal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=308|website=Engineering Timelines|accessdate=28 January 2017|quote=It is still visible in the middle of a field, though the canal was closed in 1944 and dewatered in the 1950s.}}</ref>\n\nThe aqueduct was one of the first major feats of [[civil engineering]] undertaken by Telford, who was becoming one of Britain's leading industrial [[civil engineer]]s; although his work was supervised by Jessop, the more experienced canal engineer. Ironwork was supplied by [[William Hazledine]] from his foundries at [[Shrewsbury]] and nearby [[Cefn Mawr]]. The work, which took around ten years from design to construction, cost around of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]47,000. Adjusted for inflation this is equivalent to no more than \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|47000|1805|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}, but represented a major investment against the contemporary GDP of some \u00a3400&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe Pontcysyllte aqueduct officially opened to traffic on 26 November 1805. A plaque commemorating its inauguration reads:\n<blockquote>The nobility and gentry, the adjacent Counties having united their efforts with the great commercial interests of this country. In creating an intercourse and union between England and North Wales by a navigable communication of the three Rivers, Severne {{sic}} Dee and Mersey for the mutual benefit of agriculture and trades, caused the first stone of this aqueduct of Pontcysyllty {{sic}}, to be laid on the 25th day of July MDCCXCV [1795]. When [[Richard Myddelton (1764\u20131796)|Richard Myddelton]] of Chirk, Esq, M.P. one of the original patrons of the Ellesmere Canal was Lord of this manor, and in the reign of our Sovereign George the Third. When the equity of the laws, and the security of property, promoted the general welfare of the nation. While the arts and sciences flourished by his patronage and the conduct of civil life was improved by his example.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe bridge is {{convert|336|yd|m|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} deep.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pontcysyllte Aqueduct|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=100|website=Engineering Timelines|accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref> It consists of a [[cast iron]] trough supported {{convert|126|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the river on iron arched ribs carried on eighteen hollow masonry piers (pillars). Each of the 18 spans is {{convert|53|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide. With the completion of the aqueduct, the next phase of the canal should have been the continuation of the line to [[Moss Valley, Wrexham]] where Telford had constructed a feeder reservoir lake in 1796. This would provide the water for the length of canal between [[Trevor Basin]] and [[Chester]]. The plan to build this section was cancelled in 1798, and the isolated feeder and a stretch of navigation between Ffrwd and a basin in [[Summerhill, Wrexham|Summerhill]] was abandoned. Remnants of the feeder channel are visible in [[Gwersyllt]]. A street in the village is still named ''Heol Camlas'' ({{lang-cy|Canal Way}}).<ref name=\"coedpoeth.minerahistory.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.coedpoeth.minerahistory.com/timeline.html|title=Local Timeline|website=Coedpoeth.minerahistory.com|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the project incomplete, [[Trevor Basin]] just over the Pontcysyllte aqueduct would become the canal's northern terminus. In 1808 a feeder channel to bring water from the River Dee near [[Llangollen]] was completed. In order to maintain a continual supply, Telford built an artificial [[weir]] known as the [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]] near [[Llantysilio]] to maintain water height.\n\nSubsequently, the Plas Kynaston Canal was built to serve industry in the Cefn Mawr and Rhosymedre areas in the 1820s. There might have been another canal extension (\"Ward's\") but detailed records do not survive.<ref name=\"Plas Kynaston Canal by P Brown\">{{cite web|url=http://plaskynastoncanalgroup.org/app/download/5780802223/Plas+Kynaston+Canal+by+P+Brown.pdf |format=PDF|title=Plas Kynaston Canal by P Brown|website=Plaskynastoncanalgroup.org}}</ref> Goods traffic was brought down to the canal by the [[Ruabon Brook Tramway]] which climbed towards Acrefair and Plas Bennion. This railway was eventually upgraded to steam operation and extended towards [[Rhosllannerchrugog]] and [[Wrexham]].<ref name=\"Plas Kynaston Canal by P Brown\"/>\n\nIn 1844, the Ellesmere and [[Chester Canal]] Company, which owned the broad canals from [[Ellesmere Port]] to [[Chester]] and from Chester to [[Nantwich]], with a branch to [[Middlewich]], began discussions with the narrow [[Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal]], which ran from Nantwich to Autherley, where it joined the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]]. The two companies had always worked together, in a bid to maintain their profits against competition from the railways, and amalgamation seemed to be a logical step. An agreement was worked out by August, and the two companies then sought a [[Private Act of Parliament]] to authorise the takeover. This was granted on 8 May 1845, when the larger Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company was formed.<ref>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1985 |pp=188\u2013189}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pontcysyllte aqueduct plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|Plaque commemorating the construction of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct between 1795 and 1805 by Thomas Telford]]\nIn 1846, the canal and the aqueduct became part of the [[Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company]]. But the intent of the merger was to build railways at a reduced cost, by using the existing routes of the canals they owned.<ref name=nic>{{cite book|title=[[Nicholson Guides|Nicholson Waterways Guide]]|volume=4|year=2006|publisher= Harper Collins Publishing Ltd| ISBN= 0-00-721112-0}}</ref> By 1849, the plan to turn canals into railways had been dropped.<ref name=nic/> As the aqueduct was largely in an area that was served by railways owned by the [[Great Western Railway]], the LNWR was more than happy for the canal to remain open as long as it remained profitable. With the start of the [[First World War]] in 1914, the Shropshire Union \u2013 which the Pontcysyllte aqueduct was a part \u2013 served the war effort with its fleet of more than 450 narrow boats.<ref name=nic/>\n\nCommercial traffic on the canal greatly declined after a waterway breach near [[Newtown, Powys]] (now part of the Montgomery Canal) in 1936. By 1939 boat movements across the aqueduct to [[Llangollen]] had ceased. The canal was formally closed to navigation under the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]] Company Act of 1944. On 6 September 1945, due to inadequate maintenance, the canal breached its banks east of [[Llangollen]] near [[Sun Bank Halt]]. The flow of hundreds of tons of water washed away the embankment of the railway further down the hill, tearing a {{convert|40|yd|adj=on}} crater {{convert|50|ft}} deep.<ref>{{citebook|title=The Shell Book of Inland Waterways|author=Hugh McKnight|publisher=[[David & Charles]]|year=1987|isbn=0-7153-8239-X|page=28}}</ref> This caused the first traffic of the morning, a mail and goods train composed of 16 carriages and two vans, to crash into the breach, killing one and injuring two engine crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/hist/accid.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101023203/http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/hist/accid.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 January 2007|title=History of the Llangollen Railway - Sun Bank Halt accident|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe aqueduct was saved (despite its official closure to waterway traffic) because it was still required as a water feeder for the remainder of the [[Shropshire Union Canal]]. The aqueduct also supplied drinking water to a reservoir at [[Hurleston]]. In 1955 the Mid & South East Cheshire Water Board agreed to maintain the canal securing its future.<ref>{{cite book|title=Narrowboat Nomads: Living the Dream on the English Waterways|first=Steve|last= Haywood|publisher=Summersdale|year=2015 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lBIgCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT128|isbn=9781783726110}}</ref>\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, leisure boating traffic began to rise. In a rebranding exercise by [[British Waterways]] in the 1980s, the former industrial waterway was renamed the [[Llangollen Canal]].

Known locally as 'The Rock', the sandstone was extracted and worked here into the many numerous shapes as required by the architects. Many remnants of the workings are still visible alongside Rock Road which links Rhosymedre to Plas Madoc.\n\nThe supporting arches, four for each span, are in the form of cast-iron ribs, each cast as three voussoirs with external arches cast with an un-pierced [[I-beam|web]] to give greater strength, at the cost of extra weight. Using cast iron in this way, in the same manner as the stone arch it supersedes, makes use of the material's strength in compression.<ref name=\"Hopkins1970\">{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=Henry James|title=A Span of Bridges: An Illustrated History|year=1970|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot, England|isbn=0-7153-4804-3}}</ref> They also give an impression of greater solidity than would be the case were the webs pierced. This impression is enhanced by the arrangement of strips of thicker stiffening incorporated into the castings, arranged in the manner of joints between voussoirs.\n\nCast plates are laid transversely to form the bed of the canal trough. The trough is not fastened to the arches, but [[Lug (knob)|lugs]] are cast into the plates to fit over the rib arches to prevent movement.<ref name=cadw>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcahmw.gov.uk/HI/ENG/Heritage+of+Wales/World+Heritage+Wales/The+Aqueducts/|title=The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct|date=February 2009|publisher=The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=5 June 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924084958/http://www.rcahmw.gov.uk/HI/ENG/Heritage%2Bof%2BWales/World%2BHeritage%2BWales/The%2BAqueducts/|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The aqueduct was left for six months with water inside to check that it was watertight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportheritage.com/find-heritage-locations.html?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&sobi2Id=210|title=Heritage Locations - Pontcysyllte Aqueduct|first=Green Jersey Web|last=Design|website=Transportheritage.com|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> A feature of a canal aqueduct, in contrast with a road or railway viaduct, is that the vertical loading stresses are virtually constant. According to [[Archimedes' principle]], the mass (weight) of a boat and its cargo on the bridge pushes an equal mass of water off the bridge.\n\nThe [[towpath]] is mounted above the water, with the inner edge carried on cast-iron pillars in the trough. This arrangement allows the water displaced by the passage of a [[narrow boat]] to flow easily under the towpath and around the boat, enabling relatively free passage. Pedestrians, and the horses once used for towing, are protected from falling from the aqueduct by railings on the outside edge of the towpath, but the holes in the top flange of the other side of the trough, capable of mounting railings, were never used. The trough sides rise only about {{convert|6|in|cm|0}} above the water level, less than the depth of freeboard of an empty narrow boat, so the helmsman of the boat has no visual protection from the impression of being at the edge of an abyss. The trough of the [[Cosgrove aqueduct]] has a similar structure, although it rests on trestles rather than iron arches.

The 18-arched stone and [[cast iron]] structure is for use by [[narrowboat]]s and was completed in 1805 having taken ten years to design and build.

Although a less expensive construction course was surveyed further to the east, the westerly high-ground route across the Vale of Llangollen was preferred because it would have taken the canal through the mineral-rich coalfields of [[North East Wales]]. Only parts of the canal route were completed because the expected revenues required to complete the entire project were never generated. Most major work ceased after the completion of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1805.\n\nThe structure is a [[Grade I listed buildings in Wrexham County Borough|Grade I listed building]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/planning_portal/publications/listed_build_exhib/pontcysyllte_aque.htm|title=Listed Buildings: Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, Trevor|website=Wrexham.gov.uk|accessdate=25 May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013142701/http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/planning_portal/publications/listed_build_exhib/pontcysyllte_aque.htm|archivedate=13 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Pontcysyllte'' is [[Welsh language|Welsh]] for \"Cysyllte Bridge\" or \"Bridge of Cysyllte\", Cysyllte being the [[township (England)|township]] of the old parish of [[Llangollen]] in which the southern end of the bridge lies.<ref name=\"DictionaryPlaceNamesWales\">{{cite book|last=Owen|first=Hywel Wyn|title=A Dictionary of Place-Names in Wales|year=2007|publisher=Gomer Press|location=Ceredigion, Wales|isbn=978-1-84323-901-7}}</ref>  The northern end of the bridge was in Trefor Isaf township, also in Llangollen parish.{{Citation needed|date = November 2019}}\n\nOther translations such as \"Bridge of the Junction\" or \"The Bridge that links\" are a modern [[false etymology]], derived from the name's apparent similarity to the word ''{{lang|cy|cysylltau}}'' (plural of ''cyswllt'') which means connections or links.<ref>[http://geiriadur.ac.uk/gpc/gpc.html?cyswllt cyswllt]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:WalesC0047.jpg|thumbnail|The aqueduct viewed from the valley below]]\nThe aqueduct was designed by civil engineers [[Thomas Telford]] and [[William Jessop]] for a location near an 18th-century road crossing, [[Pont Cysyllte]]. After the westerly high-ground route was approved, the original plan was to create a series of locks down both sides of the valley to an embankment that would carry the [[Ellesmere Canal]] over the River Dee. After Telford was hired the plan was changed to an aqueduct that would create an uninterrupted waterway straight across the valley. Despite considerable public scepticism, Telford was confident his construction method would work because he had previously built a cast-iron trough aqueduct \u2013 the [[Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct]] on the [[Shrewsbury Canal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=308|website=Engineering Timelines|accessdate=28 January 2017|quote=It is still visible in the middle of a field, though the canal was closed in 1944 and dewatered in the 1950s.}}</ref>\n\nThe aqueduct was one of the first major feats of [[civil engineering]] undertaken by Telford, who was becoming one of Britain's leading industrial [[civil engineer]]s; although his work was supervised by Jessop, the more experienced canal engineer. Ironwork was supplied by [[William Hazledine]] from his foundries at [[Shrewsbury]] and nearby [[Cefn Mawr]]. The work, which took around ten years from design to construction, cost around of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]47,000. Adjusted for inflation this is equivalent to no more than \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|47000|1805|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}, but represented a major investment against the contemporary GDP of some \u00a3400&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe Pontcysyllte aqueduct officially opened to traffic on 26 November 1805. A plaque commemorating its inauguration reads:\n<blockquote>The nobility and gentry, the adjacent Counties having united their efforts with the great commercial interests of this country. In creating an intercourse and union between England and North Wales by a navigable communication of the three Rivers, Severne {{sic}} Dee and Mersey for the mutual benefit of agriculture and trades, caused the first stone of this aqueduct of Pontcysyllty {{sic}}, to be laid on the 25th day of July MDCCXCV [1795]. When [[Richard Myddelton (1764\u20131796)|Richard Myddelton]] of Chirk, Esq, M.P. one of the original patrons of the Ellesmere Canal was Lord of this manor, and in the reign of our Sovereign George the Third. When the equity of the laws, and the security of property, promoted the general welfare of the nation. While the arts and sciences flourished by his patronage and the conduct of civil life was improved by his example.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe bridge is {{convert|336|yd|m|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} deep.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pontcysyllte Aqueduct|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=100|website=Engineering Timelines|accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref> It consists of a [[cast iron]] trough supported {{convert|126|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the river on iron arched ribs carried on eighteen hollow masonry piers (pillars). Each of the 18 spans is {{convert|53|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide. With the completion of the aqueduct, the next phase of the canal should have been the continuation of the line to [[Moss Valley, Wrexham]] where Telford had constructed a feeder reservoir lake in 1796. This would provide the water for the length of canal between [[Trevor Basin]] and [[Chester]]. The plan to build this section was cancelled in 1798, and the isolated feeder and a stretch of navigation between Ffrwd and a basin in [[Summerhill, Wrexham|Summerhill]] was abandoned. Remnants of the feeder channel are visible in [[Gwersyllt]]. A street in the village is still named ''Heol Camlas'' ({{lang-cy|Canal Way}}).<ref name=\"coedpoeth.minerahistory.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.coedpoeth.minerahistory.com/timeline.html|title=Local Timeline|website=Coedpoeth.minerahistory.com|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the project incomplete, [[Trevor Basin]] just over the Pontcysyllte aqueduct would become the canal's northern terminus. In 1808 a feeder channel to bring water from the River Dee near [[Llangollen]] was completed. In order to maintain a continual supply, Telford built an artificial [[weir]] known as the [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]] near [[Llantysilio]] to maintain water height.\n\nSubsequently, the Plas Kynaston Canal was built to serve industry in the Cefn Mawr and Rhosymedre areas in the 1820s. There might have been another canal extension (\"Ward's\") but detailed records do not survive.<ref name=\"Plas Kynaston Canal by P Brown\">{{cite web|url=http://plaskynastoncanalgroup.org/app/download/5780802223/Plas+Kynaston+Canal+by+P+Brown.pdf |format=PDF|title=Plas Kynaston Canal by P Brown|website=Plaskynastoncanalgroup.org}}</ref> Goods traffic was brought down to the canal by the [[Ruabon Brook Tramway]] which climbed towards Acrefair and Plas Bennion. This railway was eventually upgraded to steam operation and extended towards [[Rhosllannerchrugog]] and [[Wrexham]].<ref name=\"Plas Kynaston Canal by P Brown\"/>\n\nIn 1844, the Ellesmere and [[Chester Canal]] Company, which owned the broad canals from [[Ellesmere Port]] to [[Chester]] and from Chester to [[Nantwich]], with a branch to [[Middlewich]], began discussions with the narrow [[Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal]], which ran from Nantwich to Autherley, where it joined the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]]. The two companies had always worked together, in a bid to maintain their profits against competition from the railways, and amalgamation seemed to be a logical step. An agreement was worked out by August, and the two companies then sought a [[Private Act of Parliament]] to authorise the takeover. This was granted on 8 May 1845, when the larger Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company was formed.<ref>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1985 |pp=188\u2013189}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pontcysyllte aqueduct plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|Plaque commemorating the construction of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct between 1795 and 1805 by Thomas Telford]]\nIn 1846, the canal and the aqueduct became part of the [[Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company]]. But the intent of the merger was to build railways at a reduced cost, by using the existing routes of the canals they owned.<ref name=nic>{{cite book|title=[[Nicholson Guides|Nicholson Waterways Guide]]|volume=4|year=2006|publisher= Harper Collins Publishing Ltd| ISBN= 0-00-721112-0}}</ref> By 1849, the plan to turn canals into railways had been dropped.<ref name=nic/> As the aqueduct was largely in an area that was served by railways owned by the [[Great Western Railway]], the LNWR was more than happy for the canal to remain open as long as it remained profitable. With the start of the [[First World War]] in 1914, the Shropshire Union \u2013 which the Pontcysyllte aqueduct was a part \u2013 served the war effort with its fleet of more than 450 narrow boats.<ref name=nic/>\n\nCommercial traffic on the canal greatly declined after a waterway breach near [[Newtown, Powys]] (now part of the Montgomery Canal) in 1936. By 1939 boat movements across the aqueduct to [[Llangollen]] had ceased. The canal was formally closed to navigation under the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]] Company Act of 1944. On 6 September 1945, due to inadequate maintenance, the canal breached its banks east of [[Llangollen]] near [[Sun Bank Halt]]. The flow of hundreds of tons of water washed away the embankment of the railway further down the hill, tearing a {{convert|40|yd|adj=on}} crater {{convert|50|ft}} deep.<ref>{{citebook|title=The Shell Book of Inland Waterways|author=Hugh McKnight|publisher=[[David & Charles]]|year=1987|isbn=0-7153-8239-X|page=28}}</ref> This caused the first traffic of the morning, a mail and goods train composed of 16 carriages and two vans, to crash into the breach, killing one and injuring two engine crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/hist/accid.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101023203/http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/hist/accid.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 January 2007|title=History of the Llangollen Railway - Sun Bank Halt accident|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe aqueduct was saved (despite its official closure to waterway traffic) because it was still required as a water feeder for the remainder of the [[Shropshire Union Canal]]. The aqueduct also supplied drinking water to a reservoir at [[Hurleston]]. In 1955 the Mid & South East Cheshire Water Board agreed to maintain the canal securing its future.<ref>{{cite book|title=Narrowboat Nomads: Living the Dream on the English Waterways|first=Steve|last= Haywood|publisher=Summersdale|year=2015 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lBIgCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT128|isbn=9781783726110}}</ref>\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, leisure boating traffic began to rise. In a rebranding exercise by [[British Waterways]] in the 1980s, the former industrial waterway was renamed the [[Llangollen Canal]].

According to [[Archimedes' principle]], the mass (weight) of a boat and its cargo on the bridge pushes an equal mass of water off the bridge.\n\nThe [[towpath]] is mounted above the water, with the inner edge carried on cast-iron pillars in the trough. This arrangement allows the water displaced by the passage of a [[narrow boat]] to flow easily under the towpath and around the boat, enabling relatively free passage. Pedestrians, and the horses once used for towing, are protected from falling from the aqueduct by railings on the outside edge of the towpath, but the holes in the top flange of the other side of the trough, capable of mounting railings, were never used. The trough sides rise only about {{convert|6|in|cm|0}} above the water level, less than the depth of freeboard of an empty narrow boat, so the helmsman of the boat has no visual protection from the impression of being at the edge of an abyss. The trough of the [[Cosgrove aqueduct]] has a similar structure, although it rests on trestles rather than iron arches. It is also less impressively high.\n\nEvery five years the ends of the aqueduct are closed and a plug in one of the highest spans is opened to drain the canal water into the River Dee below, to allow inspection and maintenance of the trough.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/49078.stm|title=Plug pulled on historic aqueduct|date=20 January 1998|accessdate=25 November 2008|quote=At midday on Tuesday, they pulled the plug and 1.5 million litres of water, enough to fill 8,000 baths, cascaded to the River Dee below.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC News Online|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/3271665.stm|title=Birthday clean for aqueduct|date=16 November 2003|accessdate=25 November 2008|quote=next Monday and Tuesday all 12,000 cubic metres \u2013 around 12,000 bath tubs \u2013 of water will be completely drained away.}}</ref>\n\n==World Heritage Site==\nThe aqueduct and surrounding lands were submitted to the \"tentative list\" of properties being considered for [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site status in 1999.<ref name=\"unesco\">{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1326/|title=Pont-Cysyllte Aqueduct|date=29 June 1999|work=Tentative Lists Database|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=25 November 2008|quote=Pont-Cysyllte Aqueduct; Date of Submission: 21 June 1999; Criteria: (i)(ii)(iv); Category: Cultural}}</ref> The aqueduct was suggested as a contender in 2005\u2014its 200th anniversary year<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_east/4470534.stm |title=Aqueduct's big bicentenary party |publisher=BBC News Online |date=27 November 2005}}</ref>\u2014and it was formally announced in 2006 that a larger proposal, covering a section of the canal from the aqueduct to [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]] would be the United Kingdom's 2008 nomination.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/6037203.stm |title=Aqueduct set for heritage status |publisher=BBC News Online |date=10 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/2143.aspx|title=Pontcysyllte Aqueduct And Canal \u2013 'Magnificent Masterpiece Of The Canal Age' \u2013 To Be UK's Next Bid For World Heritage Status|date=11 January 2008|accessdate=25 November 2008|publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|quote=It consists of 11 miles (18 kilometres) of continuous waterway, from [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]] near [[Llangollen]] to Gledrid Bridge near Rhoswiel|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512154509/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/2143.aspx|archivedate=12 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe length of canal from Rhoswiel, [[Shropshire]], to the Horseshoe Falls, including the main Pontcysyllte Aqueduct structure as well as the older [[Chirk Aqueduct]], were visited by assessors from UNESCO during October 2008, to analyse and confirm the site management and authenticity.

It was initially developed for agriculture, specifically cotton plantations based on [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved labor]] of African Americans. Cotton continued to be important to the economy through the 19th century and into the early 20th century.\n\nThis still rural county has had a decline in population by about half since 1910. It is the fourth least populous county in the state. Mechanization of agriculture and the blight of the [[boll weevil]] both reduced the need for farm workers; they left the area and often the state. Many African Americans went north or west in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] before and after World War II. The county in the 21st century is majority white in population; in the 2000 census, African Americans composed more than 36% of the population. (See Demographics section below.)\n\nAs in the rest of the state, the county had racially segregated facilities under [[Jim Crow]] from the late 19th century. Many white residents opposed the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century. In May 1964, [[Ku Klux Klan]] members [[Mississippi Cold Case|abducted and killed two young black men]], Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore of Meadville, before [[Freedom Summer]] started. Their bodies were not discovered in the Mississippi River until July 1964, during the hunt for three disappeared civil rights workers.\n\nNo one was prosecuted at the time, but the case was reopened in 2007, after a documentary had been released on it by [[Canadian Broadcasting Company]]. Local man [[James Ford Seale]] was convicted of the kidnappings and deaths by an all-white jury in federal court.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6755267.stm|title=Ex-KKK man guilty in 1964 killing|date=2007-06-15|publisher=BBC.com|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref> In 2008 the families of Dee and Moore filed a civil suit against the Franklin County government, charging complicity by its law enforcement in the deaths.

It was initially developed for agriculture, specifically cotton plantations based on [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved labor]] of African Americans. Cotton continued to be important to the economy through the 19th century and into the early 20th century.\n\nThis still rural county has had a decline in population by about half since 1910. It is the fourth least populous county in the state. Mechanization of agriculture and the blight of the [[boll weevil]] both reduced the need for farm workers; they left the area and often the state. Many African Americans went north or west in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] before and after World War II. The county in the 21st century is majority white in population; in the 2000 census, African Americans composed more than 36% of the population. (See Demographics section below.)\n\nAs in the rest of the state, the county had racially segregated facilities under [[Jim Crow]] from the late 19th century. Many white residents opposed the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century. In May 1964, [[Ku Klux Klan]] members [[Mississippi Cold Case|abducted and killed two young black men]], Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore of Meadville, before [[Freedom Summer]] started. Their bodies were not discovered in the Mississippi River until July 1964, during the hunt for three disappeared civil rights workers.\n\nNo one was prosecuted at the time, but the case was reopened in 2007, after a documentary had been released on it by [[Canadian Broadcasting Company]]. Local man [[James Ford Seale]] was convicted of the kidnappings and deaths by an all-white jury in federal court.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6755267.stm|title=Ex-KKK man guilty in 1964 killing|date=2007-06-15|publisher=BBC.com|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref> In 2008 the families of Dee and Moore filed a civil suit against the Franklin County government, charging complicity by its law enforcement in the deaths.

These include Chris's unnamed interns, who test challenges before use and serve as Chris's personal assistants; contestants' family members appearing in video messages and calls; special guests from the aftermath episodes of ''Total Drama Action'' and ''Total Drama World Tour''; and a variety of animals, from pets to challenge obstacles.\n\n===Family members===\nVarious family members are often mentioned in passing by the contestants. The final five in ''[[Total Drama Island]]'' receives video messages from home sent by their family members (and a friend in Leshawna's case), who appears in the tapes. In the finale of ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', both Cameron and Lightning talk to their parents via video chat.\n*Leshaniqua (voiced by Novie Edwards) is Leshawna's cousin who visits her as part of a reward. While they're together, they trash talk the rest of the cast, causing them to lose trust for Leshawna upon finding out.\n*Jos\u00e9 Burromuerto (voiced by [[Alex House]]) is Alejandro's brother who has bullied him growing up. During the finale of ''Total Drama World Tour'', Alejandro slows down when Heather calls him Jos\u00e9, and then again when Cody keeps calling him \"Al\" (a nickname given to him by his Jos\u00e9). He makes his official debut during the boxing challenge, where he fights Alejandro. While at first he is winning, after insulting Heather, Alejandro manages to beat him.\n*DJ's mother (voiced by [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]]), refers to as Mama by the contestants, appears to support her son after quitting the competition. She later allows the contestants to use her bus to stop the cast of ''Total Drama Dirtbags''.\n*Jerd McLean (voiced by [[Christian Potenza]]) is Chris' cousin and has a thick Newfoundland accent that is very difficult to understand, with Chris being the only character to fully comprehend him. Alejandro is also able to partially understand him, but has difficulty figuring out what Jerd was saying. He appears in \"Newf Kids on the Rock\" and plays a role in the challenge when the contestants have to translate a sentence he dictated. Jerd apparently dislikes Noah stating that he is \"as smart as a bag of rocks.\" Each time Jerd speaks, music from Sea Shanty Mix is played.\n*Owen's mother (voiced by Lauren Lipson) tells Owen that she spent fifty thousand dollars on a giant cheese cellar, which excites Owen and makes him want to come home, even though their family is broke from this expense. She eventually tells Owen to come home because his family misses him. She resembles Sadie despite her blonde hair, and is voiced by the same voice actor. Owen does a shout-out to her mother at the end of ''[[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|Total Drama All-Stars]]''.\n*Owen's father makes an appearance in his video message from home. He appears to be very proud of his son.\n*Heather's mother (voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Heather's mother|url=https://twitter.com/thefreshchannel/status/635978517994414080|website=Twitter|publisher=Fresh TV|accessdate=22 July 2017}}</ref>), and Heather's father appear in her video message from home. They are seen partying and moving out all of Heather's belongings in her absence.\n*Duncan's father and mother are seen with his parole officer in his video message from home. While his mother attempts to show support and reassurance that she loves him, his father questions if they do because \"the boy's a criminal.\"\n*Gwen's mother and brother appear in her video message from home where it is revealed her mother paid their neighbor to act as Gwen in her absence.\n*Cameron's mother (voiced by [[Kevin Duhaney]]) is mentioned in Cameron's audition tape that she is very protective of him. She is later seen in a video call from home in \"Brain vs. Brawn: The Ultimate Showdown\", where she tells him he has to win to fuel the air for his bubble. She calls her son \"Cammy Bear\". In terms of appearance, she greatly resembles her son.\n*Lightning's father is seen in a video call from home in \"Brain vs. Brawn: The Ultimate Showdown\", though his face is not shown. He does not appear to be very affectionate, never even turning to look at his son in the video call.\n\n===General characters===\n*Mr. Coconut is a coconut that Owen drew a face on after being left in isolation for too long. After becoming too attached, Chris \"eliminated\" Mr. Coconut to help Owen return to reality. The coconut doesn't appear again for a very long time, but in ''Total Drama All-Stars'', Mr. Coconut appears in the season intro inside a submerged treasure chest. It also appears again in the season finale. Christian Potenza says that Mr. Coconut is one of his favorite characters in the show.\n*The escaped psycho killer with a chainsaw and a hook (voiced by [[Scott McCord]] in ''[[Total Drama Island]]'' and [[Brian Froud]] in ''[[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|Total Drama All-Stars]]'') is a serial killer who escapes and ends up at Camp Wawanakwa. Thinking he is part of the horror movie challenge, Gwen taunts him. Upon realizing he is not, she kick him repeatedly in the face, causing him to leave. Chris later use him as part of the fake cast of ''Total Drama Dirtbags''. At some point after he is arrested.\n*Josh (voiced by [[Dwayne Hill]]) is the co-host of ''Celebrity Manhunt'' who interviews the cast of ''Total Drama Island'' and ''Total Drama Action''.\n*Brady (voiced by [[Dan Petronijevic]]) is Beth's boyfriend. He is supposedly a made-up person by Beth to make her seem cool, but at the end of the final episode, he is in both endings followed by Heather saying \"Not only is he real. He's really handsome\" and Justin saying \"Is it not bad enough that this show made me into a goblin? Now I got his 'gorgeousity' making me come off as even more hideous, great.\" in the original version and \"Now I wish I didn't vote for her [Beth].\" in the alternate ending. He only has one line in the original ending which is \"Oh, was I supposed to bring a prize?\"\n*Emily's debut appearance is in the episode, \"Celebrity Manhunt's TDA Reunion Special\" when Chris and Chef are at the airport in the ending. In ''Total Drama World Tour'', she is the main flight attendant who serves the contestants that are in first-class.\n*Jasmine is Leshawna's friend who \"auditioned\" for ''Total Drama Action'', but never competes in the season. She explains that she has attended McGillis Talent Agency, a drama class, and lives in a rough neighborhood on a peninsula, in which she calls it a \"Total Drama Peninsula\". She is unique because the other videos show family members, but this shows a best friend, which implies Jasmine is like family to Leshawna. Jasmine is the first family-like figure in Leshawna's life to make an appearance.\n\n===Pets and animals===\nThere are also many notable non-human characters in the series that serve as obstacles in the challenges while other characters serve as pets owned by some contestants.\n*Sasquatchanakwa is a yeti who appears in every season. During the first season, a group of Sasquatchanakwas is seen staring at a sleeping Owen, and later he attacks the contestants after they stay in the woods overnight. During the second season he appears as part of a challenge, and seems to have much more human-like qualities (even talking and using the confessional). He appears as part of the fake cast of ''Total Drama Dirtbags''. During the third season, he is again placed in challenges by Chris to attack the contestants. During the fourth season, he kidnaps Lindsay after he begins to feel insecure. In the fifth season, he is brought to Chris by Zoey as part of a challenge, and in the second half of the season he is frozen solid. In the spin-off, a frozen Sasquachanakwa is seen taking a picture with Kitty, and later a Sasquatchanakwa with white fur appears.\n*Bruno is a [[bear]] Bridgette rescues after its paw is injured. After helping him, he follows her back to Hawaii where he refuses to let Geoff get too close to Bridgette, attacking him whenever he did. After Blaineley, who is in a full body cast, is thrown into the water, Bruno saved her, and began using her as a chew toy, distracting him from Geoff and allowing Bridgette and Geoff to reunite.\n*Fang is a mutant [[shark]] obsessed with Scott. After eating him, Scott knocked out Fang's tooth, causing Fang to start chasing him to get it back. At the end of the fourth season, Fang gets his tooth back and mauls Scott. During the following season he still hates Scott, hurting him at any chance he gets. After Mike knocks out his tooth and gives it to Alejandro and Heather, Fang begins to chase instead.\n*Larry is Chris's pet [[Venus fly trap]] that he left on the island before renting it out to a toxic waste disposal company. During the fifth season, Larry has babies, causing Zoey to question if Larry is actually a Laurie.\n*Loki is a [[bunny]] adopted by Crimson and Ennui during the race. He often helps them during the challenges, being dubbed by Don as the unofficial third member of the team. He is kidnapped by the Ice Dancers later in the season, and causes Crimson and Ennui to lose the race.\n*Scruffy is Duncan's pet spider. He is sent to Duncan from home in \"2008: A Space Owen\", along with the other cast members' packages from home. However, Scruffy is accidentally killed in the same episode by Harold, when he is smashed while Harold is riding The Vomit Comet.\n*Irene is DJ's pet fish that he owns during \"Newf Kids on the Rock\" and \"Jamaica Me Sweat\", but then found out that Alejandro is using her to trick him.\n*Leshawna Jr. was Harold's pet snail in ''Total Drama Action''. Harold first found her upon waking up in after Duncan puts the snail in Harold's blanket as a prank. Harold then feels an attachment to the snail, due to the fact he believes that she looks like Leshawna, and then stores her in a match box for safekeeping. Later on, Leshawna Jr. is eliminated by Chris so it heads out packing. While Leshawna Jr. travels out into nature, Chris says that if Leshawna Jr. will ever make it out of the film lot before the year 2020. This gives Leshawna Jr. a little over a year left to get there.\n*Cody Jr. is a baby condor that hatches out of one of Sierra's condor eggs that she is carrying for the challenge. Sierra then considers Cody Jr. as her and Cody's child because they are \"married\". However, due to Heather being the first thing Cody Jr. ever saw, it considers Heather to be its mother, much to both Heather and Sierra's annoyance.\n\n===Special guests===\nThere are also special guests who appear in the aftermath episodes of ''[[Total Drama Action]]'' and ''[[Total Drama World Tour]]''.\n*Ginger (voiced by [[Sarah Gadon]]) is Trent's obsessed fan from [[Sudbury, Ontario]]. She told Trent that she would have loved it if he \"went psycho-crazy\" over her, referring to Gwen's dislike of his strange behavior. He looks a bit uncomfortable, whether it is about the subject of him going crazy, or because of Ginger's overly strong crush on him. She resembles Beth to an extent and is voiced by Sarah Gadon.\n*Gordon (voiced by [[Adam Reid]]) is a furious young man from [[London, Ontario]], who wants to be a chef. He has anger management issues and frequently swears. He attempts to figure out what the secret ingredient is in DJ's food. He seems to be a parody of the world-renowned British chef, [[Gordon Ramsay]], who is famous for his constant swearing at contestants on shows such as ''[[Hell's Kitchen (American TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and ''[[Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares]]''.\n*Kelsey (voiced by [[Kristin Fairlie]]) from [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia]], is another Trent fan, a bit more obsessed than the last one, Ginger, and possibly proves herself to be somewhat unsound. Her voice actor is unknown as of yet. She has a stuffed doll of Trent that she kissed in the video nine times. Trent is terrified of her, due to her obsessiveness.\n*Harvey, from [[Yellowknife]], [[Northwest Territories]], asks Leshawna if she is in a relationship with Harold, to which she replies that they are just friends. Throughout the interview, Harvey hints that he has a crush on Leshawna, too. Harvey is somewhat similar to Harold in terms of personality, but has many physical differences like braces, a different pair of glasses, and a different hair color.\n*Willy, from [[Wiarton, Ontario]], apparently Bridgette's \"biggest\" fan, goes on the webcam, at Bridgette's request. Willy, resembling Harvey from a previous aftermath, tells Bridgette that he doesn't want to be too obvious and ask Bridgette about footwear or catching waves. Willy then states that there's something he really wants to know about Bridgette, takes out a pole, and asks her if she would kiss it. This upsets Bridgette and causes her to snap.\n\n===Mike's alternate personalities===\n*Chester (voiced by [[Corey Doran]]) is an old man personality who appears whenever Mike is frustrated. He seems to have no respect for Mike, constantly making fun of him when in control of the body. After Mike beats his personalities, Chester begins to respect him more, and later teams up with him to stop Mal. Eventually, he is wiped from existence with the other personalities.\n*Svetlana (voiced by Corey Doran) is a Russian gymnast who appears whenever Mike is unable to complete a physical challenge. She seems to dislike that Mike is in control of the body the most, but after Mike beats his personalities, grows to respect him. She later teams up with Mike to stop Mal, and eventually is wiped from existence with the other personalities.\n*Vito (voiced by Corey Doran) is a parody of [[Michael Sorrentino|\"The Situation\"]] from [[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]] who appears whenever Mike is shirtless. He seems to give Mike the most problems when he begins dating Anne Maria, despite Mike dating Zoey. After Mike beats his alternate personalities, he gains respect for him. Eventually, he is wiped from existence after teaming up to help Mike to defeat Mal.\n*Manitoba Smith (voiced by Corey Doran) is a parody of [[Indiana Jones]] who appears whenever Mike puts on a [[fedora]]. He often flirts with the female contestants. After Mike beats his alternate personalities, he seems to respect him. Later he teams up with Mike to stop Mal, and is wiped from existence in the process.\n*The Malevolent One \"Mal\" (voiced by Corey Doran) is Mike's secret fifth personality. He is able to take control of the body seemingly randomly, but gains full control of the body. After trapping all the other personalities in his head, they team up under Mike's leadership to stop Mal, and eventually, they successfully wipe him from existence.\n\n===Interns===\nAcross the entire series, the interns help out Chris with the competition by testing out the challenges before the main competitors use them, and they act as Chris' personal assistants and slaves who do the maintenance work that Chris doesn't want to do.\n*In ''[[Total Drama Island]]'', the main intern starts as a pizza delivery guy who is later hired. In the finale, a new intern is hired.\n*In ''[[Total Drama Action]]'', the pizza delivery guy appears once again along with a larger intern. Another blonde intern appears as the season's main intern. Additionally, several interns' arms are seen applying makeup to the contestants in the confessional.\n*In ''[[Total Drama World Tour]]'', the blonde intern returns, along with two new burly interns, as the main interns. Several interns with the same or similar design as the blonde intern are also seen, as well as a female intern. Starting in this season, all the interns wear shirts similar to Chris's.\n*In ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', four new interns appear. One who is short and chubby, one with long black hair, a female intern, and an intern named Josh. Dakota also briefly works as an intern, before returning to the competition. Josh ends up falling into the toxic waste, causing him to no longer work for the show. The other three interns stay on as the main interns in ''[[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|Total Drama All-Stars]]'' and ''[[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|Total Drama: Pahkitew Island]]''.\n*In ''[[Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race]]'', Don mentions an intern named Andrew died while testing the first challenge.\n\n==Other characters==\n*An eskimo appears in the first season after a mound of snow and a sled falls on Courtney, followed by the eskimo falling on the sled. He appears as part of the fake cast of ''Total Drama Dirtbags''. In the spin-off, he is shown with a female eskimo, and the two kiss. \n*The mime is a character that Trent has to face in the phobia challenge. After jumping in the water, Trent convinces him to leave, stating his make-up would run. He appears in exclusive clips in both the third and fifth seasons, and during the spin-off he steals the Best Friends's travel tip.\n*The ninjas appear in the phobia challenge as Harold's fear.\n*There are many bears that appear in the series, but the most notable one is the brown bear that appears many times throughout the season, mostly scaring the contestants. Izzy has appeared in a brown bear costume as part of a prank. There is also a polar bear that appears in the [[Yukon]] and a black bear calls Bruno, who is Bridgette's best friend.\n*A sumo wrestler appears in the phobia challenge as Heather's fear. During the third season, two sumo wrestlers are seen in an exclusive clip when Harold lands in one of their loin cloths.\n*The Canadian military are characters who extract Izzy after she becomes smart in the third season.\n*The Canadian government are characters who appear in the fourth season and attempt to arrest Chris, which they successfully do at the end of the season.\n*An elderly Chinese woman gives Sierra advice and also \"love me tea\", which Sierra uses on Cody and accidentally poisons him.\n*A fireworks salesman gives Sierra fireworks for free to help Cody win in the third season.\n*Guards are seen outside the London tower. As part of the challenge, the contestants must strip the guards and find the clue hidden in their clothes.\n*Throughout the series, various sharks appear in the water-based challenges to scare away the contestants.\n*The Hawaiian natives appear in the finale of the third season to warn them about throwing pineapples into the volcano. They are seen again in a cameo in the spin-off.\n*The Zing-Zings are a group of natives in the Amazon rainforest. They capture Heather, replacing her missing tooth with a gold tooth. It is revealed they are actors filming a scene.\n*Erin Tapley (voiced by Erin Tapley) is a fan who interviews Chris in an exclusive clip.<ref name=\"Total Drama Revenge of the Island - Contest Winner\">{{cite web|last1=Teletoon|title=Total Drama Revenge of the Island - Contest Winner|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voPTC1EtGzI|website=Youtube|accessdate=19 July 2017|date=19 December 2011}}</ref>\n*The butler is a character who works at the McLean Spa Hotel during the fifth season. He often brings the contestants what they want in a matter of seconds.\n*Chris's promo bots (voiced by [[Christian Potenza]]) are robots of Chris that he uses to promote the show instead of going to each location himself. After Scarlett takes over the island, she makes the promo bots attack the other contestants, prompting Shawn to destroy them.\n\n===Area 51===\n*Aliens appear at Area 51 in ''Total Drama World Tour''. They attack Alejandro and Tyler, and return in an ''Aftermath'' episode, when they attack Noah.\n*Area 51 soldiers appear when the cast brake into Area 51, attempting to hunt down the contestants.\n*Cody's clones are clones of Cody that appear after he touches an alien pod.\n*The Colonel of the United States Military is Chris's friend who allows him access to use Area 51 as a challenge.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Total Drama|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Total Drama}}\n[[Category:2007 establishments in Canada]]\n[[Category:Lists of characters in Canadian television animation]]\n[[Category:Total Drama]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Total Drama'' characters}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2017}}\n''[[Total Drama]]'' is a Canadian [[animated]] [[comedy]] [[television]] series that began airing on [[Teletoon]] in 2007 in Canada and on [[Cartoon Network]] in 2008 in the United States.

While in the beginning of the series, Chris prefers to remain out of the challenges and act more impartial, as the series progressed he involved himself more.

At the end of ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', he is arrested for hosting the show at a toxic island, and is released one year later where he immediately starts the next season.

These include Chris's unnamed interns, who test challenges before use and serve as Chris's personal assistants; contestants' family members appearing in video messages and calls; special guests from the aftermath episodes of ''Total Drama Action'' and ''Total Drama World Tour''; and a variety of animals, from pets to challenge obstacles.\n\n===Family members===\nVarious family members are often mentioned in passing by the contestants. The final five in ''[[Total Drama Island]]'' receives video messages from home sent by their family members (and a friend in Leshawna's case), who appears in the tapes. In the finale of ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', both Cameron and Lightning talk to their parents via video chat.\n*Leshaniqua (voiced by Novie Edwards) is Leshawna's cousin who visits her as part of a reward. While they're together, they trash talk the rest of the cast, causing them to lose trust for Leshawna upon finding out.\n*Jos\u00e9 Burromuerto (voiced by [[Alex House]]) is Alejandro's brother who has bullied him growing up. During the finale of ''Total Drama World Tour'', Alejandro slows down when Heather calls him Jos\u00e9, and then again when Cody keeps calling him \"Al\" (a nickname given to him by his Jos\u00e9). He makes his official debut during the boxing challenge, where he fights Alejandro. While at first he is winning, after insulting Heather, Alejandro manages to beat him.\n*DJ's mother (voiced by [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]]), refers to as Mama by the contestants, appears to support her son after quitting the competition. She later allows the contestants to use her bus to stop the cast of ''Total Drama Dirtbags''.\n*Jerd McLean (voiced by [[Christian Potenza]]) is Chris' cousin and has a thick Newfoundland accent that is very difficult to understand, with Chris being the only character to fully comprehend him. Alejandro is also able to partially understand him, but has difficulty figuring out what Jerd was saying. He appears in \"Newf Kids on the Rock\" and plays a role in the challenge when the contestants have to translate a sentence he dictated. Jerd apparently dislikes Noah stating that he is \"as smart as a bag of rocks.\" Each time Jerd speaks, music from Sea Shanty Mix is played.\n*Owen's mother (voiced by Lauren Lipson) tells Owen that she spent fifty thousand dollars on a giant cheese cellar, which excites Owen and makes him want to come home, even though their family is broke from this expense. She eventually tells Owen to come home because his family misses him. She resembles Sadie despite her blonde hair, and is voiced by the same voice actor. Owen does a shout-out to her mother at the end of ''[[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|Total Drama All-Stars]]''.\n*Owen's father makes an appearance in his video message from home. He appears to be very proud of his son.\n*Heather's mother (voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Heather's mother|url=https://twitter.com/thefreshchannel/status/635978517994414080|website=Twitter|publisher=Fresh TV|accessdate=22 July 2017}}</ref>), and Heather's father appear in her video message from home. They are seen partying and moving out all of Heather's belongings in her absence.\n*Duncan's father and mother are seen with his parole officer in his video message from home. While his mother attempts to show support and reassurance that she loves him, his father questions if they do because \"the boy's a criminal.\"\n*Gwen's mother and brother appear in her video message from home where it is revealed her mother paid their neighbor to act as Gwen in her absence.\n*Cameron's mother (voiced by [[Kevin Duhaney]]) is mentioned in Cameron's audition tape that she is very protective of him. She is later seen in a video call from home in \"Brain vs. Brawn: The Ultimate Showdown\", where she tells him he has to win to fuel the air for his bubble. She calls her son \"Cammy Bear\". In terms of appearance, she greatly resembles her son.\n*Lightning's father is seen in a video call from home in \"Brain vs. Brawn: The Ultimate Showdown\", though his face is not shown. He does not appear to be very affectionate, never even turning to look at his son in the video call.\n\n===General characters===\n*Mr. Coconut is a coconut that Owen drew a face on after being left in isolation for too long. After becoming too attached, Chris \"eliminated\" Mr. Coconut to help Owen return to reality. The coconut doesn't appear again for a very long time, but in ''Total Drama All-Stars'', Mr. Coconut appears in the season intro inside a submerged treasure chest. It also appears again in the season finale. Christian Potenza says that Mr. Coconut is one of his favorite characters in the show.\n*The escaped psycho killer with a chainsaw and a hook (voiced by [[Scott McCord]] in ''[[Total Drama Island]]'' and [[Brian Froud]] in ''[[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|Total Drama All-Stars]]'') is a serial killer who escapes and ends up at Camp Wawanakwa. Thinking he is part of the horror movie challenge, Gwen taunts him. Upon realizing he is not, she kick him repeatedly in the face, causing him to leave. Chris later use him as part of the fake cast of ''Total Drama Dirtbags''. At some point after he is arrested.\n*Josh (voiced by [[Dwayne Hill]]) is the co-host of ''Celebrity Manhunt'' who interviews the cast of ''Total Drama Island'' and ''Total Drama Action''.\n*Brady (voiced by [[Dan Petronijevic]]) is Beth's boyfriend. He is supposedly a made-up person by Beth to make her seem cool, but at the end of the final episode, he is in both endings followed by Heather saying \"Not only is he real. He's really handsome\" and Justin saying \"Is it not bad enough that this show made me into a goblin? Now I got his 'gorgeousity' making me come off as even more hideous, great.\" in the original version and \"Now I wish I didn't vote for her [Beth].\" in the alternate ending. He only has one line in the original ending which is \"Oh, was I supposed to bring a prize?\"\n*Emily's debut appearance is in the episode, \"Celebrity Manhunt's TDA Reunion Special\" when Chris and Chef are at the airport in the ending. In ''Total Drama World Tour'', she is the main flight attendant who serves the contestants that are in first-class.\n*Jasmine is Leshawna's friend who \"auditioned\" for ''Total Drama Action'', but never competes in the season. She explains that she has attended McGillis Talent Agency, a drama class, and lives in a rough neighborhood on a peninsula, in which she calls it a \"Total Drama Peninsula\". She is unique because the other videos show family members, but this shows a best friend, which implies Jasmine is like family to Leshawna. Jasmine is the first family-like figure in Leshawna's life to make an appearance.\n\n===Pets and animals===\nThere are also many notable non-human characters in the series that serve as obstacles in the challenges while other characters serve as pets owned by some contestants.\n*Sasquatchanakwa is a yeti who appears in every season. During the first season, a group of Sasquatchanakwas is seen staring at a sleeping Owen, and later he attacks the contestants after they stay in the woods overnight. During the second season he appears as part of a challenge, and seems to have much more human-like qualities (even talking and using the confessional). He appears as part of the fake cast of ''Total Drama Dirtbags''. During the third season, he is again placed in challenges by Chris to attack the contestants. During the fourth season, he kidnaps Lindsay after he begins to feel insecure. In the fifth season, he is brought to Chris by Zoey as part of a challenge, and in the second half of the season he is frozen solid. In the spin-off, a frozen Sasquachanakwa is seen taking a picture with Kitty, and later a Sasquatchanakwa with white fur appears.\n*Bruno is a [[bear]] Bridgette rescues after its paw is injured. After helping him, he follows her back to Hawaii where he refuses to let Geoff get too close to Bridgette, attacking him whenever he did. After Blaineley, who is in a full body cast, is thrown into the water, Bruno saved her, and began using her as a chew toy, distracting him from Geoff and allowing Bridgette and Geoff to reunite.\n*Fang is a mutant [[shark]] obsessed with Scott. After eating him, Scott knocked out Fang's tooth, causing Fang to start chasing him to get it back. At the end of the fourth season, Fang gets his tooth back and mauls Scott. During the following season he still hates Scott, hurting him at any chance he gets. After Mike knocks out his tooth and gives it to Alejandro and Heather, Fang begins to chase instead.\n*Larry is Chris's pet [[Venus fly trap]] that he left on the island before renting it out to a toxic waste disposal company. During the fifth season, Larry has babies, causing Zoey to question if Larry is actually a Laurie.\n*Loki is a [[bunny]] adopted by Crimson and Ennui during the race. He often helps them during the challenges, being dubbed by Don as the unofficial third member of the team. He is kidnapped by the Ice Dancers later in the season, and causes Crimson and Ennui to lose the race.\n*Scruffy is Duncan's pet spider. He is sent to Duncan from home in \"2008: A Space Owen\", along with the other cast members' packages from home. However, Scruffy is accidentally killed in the same episode by Harold, when he is smashed while Harold is riding The Vomit Comet.\n*Irene is DJ's pet fish that he owns during \"Newf Kids on the Rock\" and \"Jamaica Me Sweat\", but then found out that Alejandro is using her to trick him.\n*Leshawna Jr. was Harold's pet snail in ''Total Drama Action''. Harold first found her upon waking up in after Duncan puts the snail in Harold's blanket as a prank. Harold then feels an attachment to the snail, due to the fact he believes that she looks like Leshawna, and then stores her in a match box for safekeeping. Later on, Leshawna Jr. is eliminated by Chris so it heads out packing. While Leshawna Jr. travels out into nature, Chris says that if Leshawna Jr. will ever make it out of the film lot before the year 2020. This gives Leshawna Jr. a little over a year left to get there.\n*Cody Jr. is a baby condor that hatches out of one of Sierra's condor eggs that she is carrying for the challenge. Sierra then considers Cody Jr. as her and Cody's child because they are \"married\". However, due to Heather being the first thing Cody Jr. ever saw, it considers Heather to be its mother, much to both Heather and Sierra's annoyance.\n\n===Special guests===\nThere are also special guests who appear in the aftermath episodes of ''[[Total Drama Action]]'' and ''[[Total Drama World Tour]]''.\n*Ginger (voiced by [[Sarah Gadon]]) is Trent's obsessed fan from [[Sudbury, Ontario]]. She told Trent that she would have loved it if he \"went psycho-crazy\" over her, referring to Gwen's dislike of his strange behavior. He looks a bit uncomfortable, whether it is about the subject of him going crazy, or because of Ginger's overly strong crush on him. She resembles Beth to an extent and is voiced by Sarah Gadon.\n*Gordon (voiced by [[Adam Reid]]) is a furious young man from [[London, Ontario]], who wants to be a chef. He has anger management issues and frequently swears. He attempts to figure out what the secret ingredient is in DJ's food. He seems to be a parody of the world-renowned British chef, [[Gordon Ramsay]], who is famous for his constant swearing at contestants on shows such as ''[[Hell's Kitchen (American TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and ''[[Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares]]''.\n*Kelsey (voiced by [[Kristin Fairlie]]) from [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia]], is another Trent fan, a bit more obsessed than the last one, Ginger, and possibly proves herself to be somewhat unsound. Her voice actor is unknown as of yet. She has a stuffed doll of Trent that she kissed in the video nine times. Trent is terrified of her, due to her obsessiveness.\n*Harvey, from [[Yellowknife]], [[Northwest Territories]], asks Leshawna if she is in a relationship with Harold, to which she replies that they are just friends. Throughout the interview, Harvey hints that he has a crush on Leshawna, too. Harvey is somewhat similar to Harold in terms of personality, but has many physical differences like braces, a different pair of glasses, and a different hair color.\n*Willy, from [[Wiarton, Ontario]], apparently Bridgette's \"biggest\" fan, goes on the webcam, at Bridgette's request. Willy, resembling Harvey from a previous aftermath, tells Bridgette that he doesn't want to be too obvious and ask Bridgette about footwear or catching waves. Willy then states that there's something he really wants to know about Bridgette, takes out a pole, and asks her if she would kiss it. This upsets Bridgette and causes her to snap.\n\n===Mike's alternate personalities===\n*Chester (voiced by [[Corey Doran]]) is an old man personality who appears whenever Mike is frustrated. He seems to have no respect for Mike, constantly making fun of him when in control of the body. After Mike beats his personalities, Chester begins to respect him more, and later teams up with him to stop Mal. Eventually, he is wiped from existence with the other personalities.\n*Svetlana (voiced by Corey Doran) is a Russian gymnast who appears whenever Mike is unable to complete a physical challenge. She seems to dislike that Mike is in control of the body the most, but after Mike beats his personalities, grows to respect him. She later teams up with Mike to stop Mal, and eventually is wiped from existence with the other personalities.\n*Vito (voiced by Corey Doran) is a parody of [[Michael Sorrentino|\"The Situation\"]] from [[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]] who appears whenever Mike is shirtless. He seems to give Mike the most problems when he begins dating Anne Maria, despite Mike dating Zoey. After Mike beats his alternate personalities, he gains respect for him. Eventually, he is wiped from existence after teaming up to help Mike to defeat Mal.\n*Manitoba Smith (voiced by Corey Doran) is a parody of [[Indiana Jones]] who appears whenever Mike puts on a [[fedora]]. He often flirts with the female contestants. After Mike beats his alternate personalities, he seems to respect him. Later he teams up with Mike to stop Mal, and is wiped from existence in the process.\n*The Malevolent One \"Mal\" (voiced by Corey Doran) is Mike's secret fifth personality. He is able to take control of the body seemingly randomly, but gains full control of the body. After trapping all the other personalities in his head, they team up under Mike's leadership to stop Mal, and eventually, they successfully wipe him from existence.\n\n===Interns===\nAcross the entire series, the interns help out Chris with the competition by testing out the challenges before the main competitors use them, and they act as Chris' personal assistants and slaves who do the maintenance work that Chris doesn't want to do.\n*In ''[[Total Drama Island]]'', the main intern starts as a pizza delivery guy who is later hired. In the finale, a new intern is hired.\n*In ''[[Total Drama Action]]'', the pizza delivery guy appears once again along with a larger intern. Another blonde intern appears as the season's main intern. Additionally, several interns' arms are seen applying makeup to the contestants in the confessional.\n*In ''[[Total Drama World Tour]]'', the blonde intern returns, along with two new burly interns, as the main interns. Several interns with the same or similar design as the blonde intern are also seen, as well as a female intern. Starting in this season, all the interns wear shirts similar to Chris's.\n*In ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', four new interns appear. One who is short and chubby, one with long black hair, a female intern, and an intern named Josh. Dakota also briefly works as an intern, before returning to the competition. Josh ends up falling into the toxic waste, causing him to no longer work for the show. The other three interns stay on as the main interns in ''[[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|Total Drama All-Stars]]'' and ''[[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|Total Drama: Pahkitew Island]]''.\n*In ''[[Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race]]'', Don mentions an intern named Andrew died while testing the first challenge.\n\n==Other characters==\n*An eskimo appears in the first season after a mound of snow and a sled falls on Courtney, followed by the eskimo falling on the sled. He appears as part of the fake cast of ''Total Drama Dirtbags''. In the spin-off, he is shown with a female eskimo, and the two kiss. \n*The mime is a character that Trent has to face in the phobia challenge. After jumping in the water, Trent convinces him to leave, stating his make-up would run. He appears in exclusive clips in both the third and fifth seasons, and during the spin-off he steals the Best Friends's travel tip.\n*The ninjas appear in the phobia challenge as Harold's fear.\n*There are many bears that appear in the series, but the most notable one is the brown bear that appears many times throughout the season, mostly scaring the contestants.
