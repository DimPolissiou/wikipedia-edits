It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[South Tyrol]] in [[Italy]], the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. It is one of the three official languages of [[Luxembourg]] and a co-official language in the [[Opole Voivodeship]] in [[Poland]]. The languages that are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch, including [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], the [[Frisian languages]], [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], and [[Yiddish]]. There are also strong similarities in vocabulary with [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], although those belong to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] group. German is the second most widely spoken [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], after English.\n\nOne of the [[world language|major languages of the world]], German is a [[native language]] to almost 100&nbsp;million people worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"Vasagar2013\"/> German is the third most commonly spoken foreign language in the EU after English and [[French language|French]], making it the second biggest language in the EU in terms of overall speakers. German is also the second most widely taught foreign language in the EU after English at primary school level (but third after English and French at lower secondary level), the fourth most widely taught non-English language in the US (after [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish]], [[French language in the United States#Language study|French]] and [[American Sign Language]]), and the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the third most widely used language on websites after [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]] are ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books, with one tenth of all books (including e-books) in the world being published in the German language. In the [[United Kingdom]], German and French are the most sought-after foreign languages for businesses (with 49% and 50% of businesses identifying these two languages as the most useful, respectively).<ref name=\"Burns2014\"/>\n\nGerman is an [[inflected language]] with four [[Grammatical case|cases]] for nouns, pronouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative), three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and [[Germanic strong verb|strong and weak verbs]]. It derives the majority of its vocabulary from the ancient Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. A portion of the words are derived from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and fewer are borrowed from [[French language|French]] and [[Modern English]]. With standardized variants ([[German Standard German|German]], [[Austrian Standard German|Austrian]], and [[Swiss Standard German|Swiss]] Standard German), German is a [[pluricentric language]]. It is also notable for [[German dialects|its broad spectrum of dialects]], with many unique varieties existing in Europe and also other parts of the world. Italy recognizes all the German-speaking minorities in its territory as [[Languages of Italy#Historical linguistic minorities|national historic minorities]] and protects the varieties of German spoken in several regions of [[Northern Italy]] besides South Tyrol.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm|title=Minorities in Italy - Italian Parliament|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/magazine/lingua_italiana/speciali/minoranze/Caria.html|title=German minorities in Italy|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> Due to the limited intelligibility between certain varieties and [[Standard German]], as well as the lack of an undisputed, scientific difference between a \"dialect\" and a \"language\", some German varieties or dialect groups (e.g. [[Low German]] or [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]<ref name=\"Goossens2000\">Jan Goossens: {{lang|de|Niederdeutsche Sprache: Versuch einer Definition.}} In: Jan Goossens (Hrsg.): {{lang|de|Niederdeutsch: Sprache und Literatur.}} Karl Wachholtz, 2.

The Germanic languages are traditionally subdivided into three branches: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]]. The first of these branches survives in modern [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], all of which are descended from [[Old Norse]]. The East Germanic languages are now extinct, and the only historical member of this branch from which written texts survive is [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. The West Germanic languages, however, have undergone extensive dialectal subdivision and are now represented in modern languages such as [[English language|English]], German, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Yiddish]], [[Afrikaans]], and others.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=16}} \n[[File:Germanic Languages Map Europe.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Germanic languages]] in Europe]]\nWithin the West Germanic language dialect continuum, the [[Benrath line|Benrath]] and [[Uerdingen line|Uerdingen]] lines (running through [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]-[[D\u00fcsseldorf-Benrath|Benrath]] and [[Krefeld]]-[[Uerdingen]], respectively) serve to distinguish the Germanic dialects that were affected by the [[High German consonant shift]] (south of Benrath) from those that were not (north of Uerdingen). The various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as [[High German languages|High German]] dialects ''(nos. 29\u201334 on the map)'', while those spoken to the north comprise the [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] ''(nos. 19\u201324)'' and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] ''(no. 25)'' dialects. As members of the West Germanic language family, High German, Low German, and Low Franconian can be further distinguished historically as [[Irminones|Irminonic]], [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]], and [[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]], respectively. This classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the Irminones (also known as the Elbe group), Ingvaeones (or North Sea Germanic group), and Istvaeones (or Weser-Rhine group).{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=16}}\n\n[[Standard German]] is based on a combination of [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]]-[[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]] and Upper Franconian and Bavarian dialects, which are [[Central German]] and Upper German dialects, belonging to the Irminonic [[High German languages|High German]] dialect group ''(nos. 29\u201334)''. German is therefore closely related to the other languages based on High German dialects, such as [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] (based on [[Central Franconian dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 29''), and [[Yiddish]]. Also closely related to Standard German are the [[Upper German]] dialects spoken in the southern [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]], such as [[Swiss German]] ([[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 34''), and the various Germanic dialects spoken in the [[France|French]] [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Grand Est]], such as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (mainly Alemannic, but also Central- and&nbsp;[[High Franconian German|Upper Franconian]]&nbsp;''(no. 32)''&nbsp;dialects) and [[Lorraine Franconian]] (Central Franconian \u2013 ''no. 29'').\n\nAfter these High German dialects, standard German is (somewhat less closely) related to languages based on Low Franconian dialects (e.g. Dutch and Afrikaans) or Low German/Low Saxon dialects (spoken in northern [[Germany]] and southern [[Denmark]]), neither of which underwent the High German consonant shift. As has been noted, the former of these dialect types is Istvaeonic and the latter Ingvaeonic, whereas the High German dialects are all Irminonic; the differences between these languages and standard German are therefore considerable. Also related to German are the Frisian languages\u2014[[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] (spoken in [[Nordfriesland (district)|Nordfriesland]] \u2013 ''no. 28''), [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]] (spoken in [[Saterland]] \u2013 ''no. 27''), and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] (spoken in [[Friesland]] \u2013 ''no. 26'')\u2014as well as the Anglic languages of [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]]. These [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] dialects are all members of the Ingvaeonic family of West Germanic languages which did not take part in the High German consonant shift.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of German}}\n\n=== Old High German ===\n{{Main|Old High German}}\n\nThe [[History of German|history of the German language]] begins with the [[High German consonant shift]] during the [[migration period]], which separated [[Old High German]] (OHG) dialects from [[Old Saxon]]. This [[Sound change|sound shift]] involved a drastic change in the pronunciation of both [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless [[stop consonant]]s (''b'', ''d'', ''g'', and ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', respectively). The primary effects of the shift were the following:\n* Voiceless stops became long ([[Gemination|geminated]]) voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] following a vowel\n* Voiceless stops became [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] in word-initial position, or following certain consonants\n* Voiced stops became voiceless in certain phonetic settings.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Voiceless stop<br />following a vowel\n!Word-initial<br />voiceless stop\n!Voiced stop\n|-\n|/p/\u2192/ff/\n|/p/\u2192/pf/\n|/b/\u2192/p/\n|-\n|/t/\u2192/ss/\n|/t/\u2192/ts/\n|/d/\u2192/t/\n|-\n|/k/\u2192/xx/\n|/k/\u2192/kx/\n|/g/\u2192/k/\n|}\nWhile there is written evidence of the [[Old High German]] language in several [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions from as early as the 6th century AD (such as the [[Pforzen buckle]]), the Old High German period is generally seen as beginning with the ''[[Abrogans]]'' (written c.765\u2013775), a Latin-German [[glossary]] supplying over 3,000 OHG words with their [[Latin]] equivalents. Following the ''Abrogans'' the first coherent works written in OHG appear in the 9th century, chief among them being the ''[[Muspilli]]'', the ''[[Merseburg Charms]]'', and the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'', as well as a number of other religious texts (the ''[[Georgslied]]'', the ''[[Ludwigslied]]'', the ''Evangelienbuch'', and translated hymns and prayers).{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}<ref name=\"Calvin1909\">{{Cite book |title=An Anthology of German Literature |last=Calvin |first=Thomas |publisher=D. C. Heath & co |pages=5\u20136 |oclc=6128632}}</ref> The ''Muspilli'' is a Christian poem written in a [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]] dialect offering an account of the soul after the [[Last Judgment]], and the ''Merseburg Charms'' are transcriptions of spells and charms from the [[Paganism|pagan]] Germanic tradition. Of particular interest to scholars, however, has been the ''Hildebrandslied'', a secular [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the tale of an estranged father and son unknowingly meeting each other in battle. Linguistically this text is highly interesting due to the mixed use of [[Old Saxon]] and Old High German dialects in its composition. The written works of this period stem mainly from the [[Alemanni|Alamanni]], [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]], and [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]] groups, all belonging to the Elbe Germanic group ([[Irminones]]), which had settled in what is now southern-central [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] between the 2nd and 6th centuries during the great migration.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}\n\nIn general, the surviving texts of OHG show a wide range of [[dialect]]al diversity with very little written uniformity. The early written tradition of OHG survived mostly through [[Monastery|monasteries]] and [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] as local translations of Latin originals; as a result, the surviving texts are written in highly disparate regional dialects and exhibit significant Latin influence, particularly in vocabulary.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}} At this point monasteries, where most written works were produced, were dominated by Latin, and German saw only occasional use in official and ecclesiastical writing.\n\nThe German language through the OHG period was still predominantly a spoken language, with a wide range of dialects and a much more extensive [[Oral literature|oral]] tradition than a written one. Having just emerged from the High German consonant shift, OHG was also a relatively new and volatile language still undergoing a number of [[Phonetics|phonetic]], [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], and [[Syntax|syntactic]] changes. The scarcity of written work, instability of the language, and widespread illiteracy of the time thus account for the lack of [[Standard language|standardization]] up to the end of the OHG period in 1050.\n\n=== Middle High German ===\n\n[[File:AlthochdeutscheSprachr\u00e4ume962 Box.jpg|upright|thumb|The Germanic-speaking area of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around AD 962.\n----\n{{legend|#B298C4|Old Frisian ({{lang|de|Alt-Friesisch}})}}\n{{legend|#DB9564|Old Saxon ({{lang|de|Alt-S\u00e4chsisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FE8741|Old Franconian ({{lang|de|Alt-Fr\u00e4nkisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FCC54B|Old Alemannic ({{lang|de|Alt-Alemannisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FE9A2C|Old Bavarian ({{lang|de|Alt-Bairisch}})}}\n]]\n{{Main|Middle High German}}\n\nWhile there is no complete agreement over the dates of the [[Middle High German]] (MHG) period, it is generally seen as lasting from 1050 to 1350.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/zurgeschichtede02schegoog|title=Zur Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache|last=Scherer|first=Wilhelm|last2=Jankowsky|first2=Kurt R.|date=1995|publisher=Amsterdam; Philadelphia: J.

Whereas during the Old High German period the Germanic tribes extended only as far east as the [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]] rivers, the MHG period saw a number of these tribes expanding beyond this eastern boundary into [[Slavs|Slavic]] territory (this is known as the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''). Along with the increasing wealth and geographic extent of the Germanic groups came greater use of German in the courts of nobles as the standard language of official proceedings and literature.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/Ling450ch/reports/german.html|title=A Brief History of the German Language|last=Alder|first=Aaron D.|date=|website=linguistics.byu.edu|access-date=2017-07-13}}</ref> A clear example of this is the ''mittelhochdeutsche Dichtersprache'' employed in the [[Hohenstaufen]] court in [[Swabia]] as a standardized supra-dialectal written language. While these efforts were still regionally bound, German began to be used in place of Latin for certain official purposes, leading to a greater need for regularity in written conventions.\n\nWhile the major changes of the MHG period were socio-cultural, German was still undergoing significant linguistic changes in syntax, phonetics, and morphology as well (e.g. [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]] of certain vowel sounds: ''hus'' (OHG \"house\")''\u2192haus'' (MHG), and weakening of unstressed short vowels to [[schwa]] [\u0259]: ''taga'' (OHG \"days\")\u2192''tage'' (MHG)).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of German : what the past reveals about today's language|last=Salmons|first=Joe|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969793-9|edition=1st|location=Oxford|page=195|oclc=811323307}}</ref>\n\nA great wealth of texts survives from the MHG period. Significantly, among this repertoire are a number of impressive secular works, such as the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the story of the [[dragon]]-slayer [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] ({{circa}} 13th century), and the ''[[Iwein]],'' an [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] verse poem by [[Hartmann von Aue]] ({{circa}} 1203), as well as several [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] and courtly romances such as ''[[Parzival]]'' and ''[[Tristan]]''. Also noteworthy is the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', the first book of laws written in [[Middle Low German|Middle ''Low'' German]] ({{circa}} 1220). The abundance and especially the secular character of the literature of the MHG period demonstrate the beginnings of a standardized written form of German, as well as the desire of poets and authors to be understood by individuals on supra-dialectal terms.\n\nThe Middle High German period is generally seen as ending with the decimation of the population of [[Europe]] in the [[Black Death]] of 1346\u20131353.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Early New High German ===\n{{Main|Early New High German}}\n\n[[File:Deutsch-Niederl\u00e4ndischer Sprachraum (nach Werner K\u00f6nig).png|thumb|upright=1.36|left|German-Dutch language area before and after the [[flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)]] from much of eastern and central Europe.

While these states were still under the control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and far from any form of unification, the desire for a cohesive written language that would be understandable across the many German-speaking [[Principality|principalities]] and kingdoms was stronger than ever. As a spoken language German remained highly fractured through this period with a vast number of often mutually-incomprehensible [[German dialects|regional dialects]] being spoken throughout the German states; the invention of the [[printing press]] {{circa}} 1440 and the publication of [[Luther Bible|Luther's vernacular translation of the Bible]] in 1534, however, had an immense effect on standardizing German as a supra-dialectal written language.\n\nThe ENHG period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] German, one being ''gemeine tiutsch,'' used in the court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], and the other being ''Mei\u00dfner Deutsch'', used in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in the [[Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The German language|last=Keller|first=R.E.|date=1978|publisher=Faber|isbn=978-0-571-11159-6|location=London|pages=365\u2013368|oclc=4139504}}</ref> Alongside these courtly written standards, the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers' languages (''Druckersprachen'') aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of German as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Geschichte der deutschen Sprache|last=Bach|first=Adolf|publisher=Quelle & Meyer|year=1965|isbn=|location=Heidelberg|page=254}}</ref> The greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardization in the written form of the German language.[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|The widespread popularity of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]] translated into German by [[Martin Luther]] helped establish modern German]]One of the central events in the development of ENHG was the publication of Luther's translation of the Bible into German (the [[New Testament]] in 1522 and the [[Old Testament]], published in parts and completed in 1534). Luther based his translation primarily on the ''Mei\u00dfner Deutsch'' of [[Saxony]], spending much time among the population of Saxony researching the dialect so as to make the work as natural and accessible to German speakers as possible. Copies of Luther's Bible featured a long list of [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] for each region that translated words which were unknown in the region into the regional dialect. Concerning his translation method Luther says the following:<blockquote>One who would talk German does not ask the Latin how he shall do it; he must ask the mother in the home, the children on the streets, the common man in the market-place and note carefully how they talk, then translate accordingly. They will then understand what is said to them because it is German. When Christ says 'ex abundantia cordis os loquitur,' I would translate, if I followed the papists, ''aus dem \u00dcberflusz des Herzens redet der Mund''. But tell me is this talking German?

German is thus considered a [[pluricentric language]].\n\nIn most regions, the speakers use a continuum from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties depending on the circumstances.\n\n=== Varieties of Standard German ===\n[[File:Standard varieties of German.png|thumb|The national and regional standard varieties of German<ref>Ulrich Ammon, Hans Bickel, Jakob Ebner, et al.: {{lang|de|Variantenw\u00f6rterbuch des Deutschen.

Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 2004.</ref>]]\n\nIn German [[linguistics]], German [[dialect]]s are distinguished from [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[standard German]].\nThe ''varieties of standard German'' refer to the different local varieties of the [[pluricentric language|pluricentric]] standard German. They differ only slightly in lexicon and phonology. In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.\n* [[German Standard German]]\n* [[Austrian Standard German]]\n* [[Swiss Standard German]]\n\nIn the German-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]], mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of Standard German is largely restricted to the written language, though about 11% of the Swiss residents speak ''High German'' (aka Standard German) at home, but mainly due to German immigrants.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung/sprachen-religionen/sprachen.assetdetail.4842942.html |title=Die am h\u00e4ufigsten \u00fcblicherweise zu Hause gesprochenen Sprachen der st\u00e4ndigen Wohnbev\u00f6lkerung ab 15 Jahren \u2013 2012\u20132014, 2013\u20132015, 2014\u20132016 |type=official site |date=28 March 2018 |format=XLS |publisher=Federal Statistical Office FSO |location=Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland  |language=de, fr, it |access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref> This situation has been called a ''medial [[diglossia]]''. [[Swiss Standard German]] is used in the Swiss education system, while [[Austrian Standard German]] is officially used in the Austrian education system.\n\nA mixture of dialect and standard does not normally occur in Northern Germany either. The traditional varieties there are Low German, whereas Standard German is a High German \"variety\". Because their linguistic distance is greater, they do not mesh with Standard German the way that High German dialects (such as Bavarian, Swabian, and Hessian) can.\n\n== Dialects ==\n{{Main|German dialects}}\n[[File:Continental West Germanic languages.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] dialects]]\n\nGerman is a member of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[language family|family of languages]], which in turn is part of the [[Indo-European language family]]. The German dialects are the traditional local varieties; many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German, and they have great differences in [[lexicon]], [[phonology]] and [[syntax]]. If a narrow definition of [[language]] based on [[mutual intelligibility]] is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance in the ''[[Ethnologue]]''). However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.\n\nThe German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into [[High German languages|High German]] and [[Low German]], also called [[Lower Saxony|Low Saxon]]. However, historically, High German dialects and Low Saxon/Low German dialects do not belong to the same language. Nevertheless, in today's Germany, Low Saxon/Low German is often perceived as a dialectal variation of Standard German on a functional level even by many native speakers. The same phenomenon is found in the eastern Netherlands, as the traditional dialects are not always identified with their Low Saxon/Low German origins, but with Dutch.<ref>[[:nl:Nederduits]]</ref>{{better source|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe variation among the German dialects is considerable, with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Some dialects are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon.\n\n=== Low German and Low Saxon ===\n{{Main|Low German}}\n[[File:Map of the Low German Dialects.svg|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] (yellow) and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] (orange) dialects]]\n[[Middle Low German]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. It was the predominant language in Northern Germany until the 16th century. In 1534, the [[Luther Bible]] was published. The translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the [[Early New High German]]. It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on [[Central German|Central]] and [[Upper German]] varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than [[Low German]] and became the language of science and literature. Around the same time, the Hanseatic League, based around northern ports, lost its importance as new trade routes to [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]] were established, and the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass [[education]] in [[Standard German]] in schools. Gradually, Low German came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated. Today, Low Saxon can be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable Standard German influx{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as {{lang|de|[[Missingsch]]}}. Sometimes, Low Saxon and [[Low Franconian]] varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift. However, the proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since [[World War II]]. The largest cities in the Low German area are [[Hamburg]] and [[Dortmund]].\n\n=== Low Franconian ===\n[[File:Niederfr\u00e4nkisch.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]]]]\nThe [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are the dialects that are more closely related to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] than to [[Low German]]. Most of the Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Belgium]], where they are considered as dialects of Dutch, which is itself a Low Franconian language. In Germany, Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the northwest of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], along the [[Lower Rhine]]. The Low Franconian dialects spoken in Germany are referred to as [[Meuse-Rhenish]] or Low Rhenish. In the north of the German Low Franconian language area, North Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as Cleverlands or as dialects of [[South Guelderish]]) are spoken. These dialects are more closely related to Dutch (also North Low Franconian) than the South Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as East [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and, east of the [[Rhine]], [[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]), which are spoken in the south of the German Low Franconian language area. The South Low Franconian dialects are more closely related to Limburgish than to Dutch, and are transitional dialects between Low Franconian and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] ([[Central Franconian dialects|Central Franconian]]). The [[East Bergish]] dialects are the easternmost Low Franconian dialects, and are transitional dialects between North- and South Low Franconian, and [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] (Low German), with most of their features being North Low Franconian. The largest cities in the German Low Franconian area are [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]].\n\n=== High German ===\n{{Main|High German languages}}\n[[File:Mitteldeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Central German]] dialects]]\n[[File:Fr\u00e4nkisches Sprachgebiet.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] ([[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]], [[Central Franconian dialects|Central-]] and [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]], and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian)]]]]\nThe High German dialects consist of the [[Central German]], [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]], and [[Upper German]] dialects. The High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. The High German varieties spoken by the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s have several unique features, and are considered as a separate language, [[Yiddish]], written with the [[Hebrew alphabet]].\n\n==== Central German ====\n\nThe [[Central German]] dialects are spoken in Central Germany, from [[Aachen]] in the west to [[G\u00f6rlitz]] in the east. They consist of [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] in the west ([[West Central German]]) and non-Franconian dialects in the east ([[East Central German]]). Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German dialects.\n\nThe Franconian, '''West Central German''' dialects are the [[Central Franconian dialects]] ([[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]]), and the [[Rhine Franconian dialects]] ([[Hessian dialects|Hessian]] and [[Palatine German language|Palatine]]). These dialects are considered as\n* German in Germany and Belgium\n* [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] in Luxembourg\n* [[Lorraine Franconian]] (spoken in [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]) and as a Rhine Franconian variant of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (spoken in [[Alsace bossue]] only) in France\n* [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] or [[Kerkrade dialect]] in the Netherlands.\nLuxembourgish as well as the [[Transylvanian Saxon dialect]] spoken in [[Transylvania]] are based on Moselle Franconian dialects. The largest cities in the Franconian Central German area are [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt]].\n\nFurther east, the non-Franconian, '''East Central German''' dialects are spoken ([[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]], [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]], [[Erzgebirgisch|Ore Mountainian]], and [[Lausitzisch-neum\u00e4rkisch dialects|Lusatian-New Markish]], and earlier, in the then German-speaking parts of [[Silesia]] also [[Silesian German|Silesian]], and in then German southern [[East Prussia]] also [[High Prussian dialect|High Prussian]]). The largest cities in the East Central German area are [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]].\n\n==== High Franconian ====\n\nThe [[High Franconian German|High Franconian dialects]] are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. They consist of the [[East Franconian German|East-]] and [[South Franconian German|South Franconian]] dialects.\n\nThe East Franconian dialect branch is one of the most spoken dialect branches in Germany. These dialects are spoken in the region of [[Franconia]] and in the central parts of [[Saxony|Saxon]] [[Vogtland]]. Franconia consists of the [[Bavaria]]n districts of [[Upper Franconia|Upper-]], [[Middle Franconia|Middle-]], and [[Lower Franconia]], the region of [[South Thuringia]] ([[Thuringia]]), and the eastern parts of the region of [[Heilbronn-Franken]] ([[Tauber Franconia]] and Hohenlohe) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The largest cities in the East Franconian area are [[Nuremberg]] and [[W\u00fcrzburg]].\n\nSouth Franconian is mainly spoken in northern Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany, but also in the northeasternmost part of the region of [[Alsace]] in France. While these dialects are considered as dialects of German in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, they are considered as dialects of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace (most Alsatian dialects are however [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]]). The largest cities in the South Franconian area are [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Heilbronn]].\n\n==== Upper German ====\n[[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Upper German]] and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]] (transitional between Central- and Upper German) dialects]]\nThe [[Upper German]] dialects are the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] in the west and the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]] in the east.\n\n===== Alemannic =====\nAlemannic dialects are spoken in [[Switzerland]] ([[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]] in the densely populated [[Swiss Plateau]], in the south also [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]], and [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]] in [[Basel]]), Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ([[Swabian German|Swabian]] and Low Alemannic, in the southwest also High Alemannic), [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Bavarian Swabia]] (Swabian, in the southwesternmost part also Low Alemannic), [[Vorarlberg]] (Low-, High-, and Highest Alemannic), [[Alsace]] (Low Alemannic, in the southernmost part also High Alemannic), [[Liechtenstein]] (High- and Highest Alemannic), and in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] [[Reutte District|district of Reutte]] (Swabian). The Alemannic dialects are considered as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace. The largest cities in the Alemannic area are [[Stuttgart]] and [[Z\u00fcrich]].\n\n===== Bavarian =====\nBavarian dialects are spoken in [[Austria]] ([[Vienna]], [[Lower Austria|Lower-]] and [[Upper Austria]], [[Styria]], [[Carinthia]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Burgenland]], and in most parts of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]), [[Bavaria]] ([[Upper Bavaria|Upper-]] and [[Lower Bavaria]] as well as [[Upper Palatinate]]), [[South Tyrol]], southwesternmost [[Saxony]] (Southern [[Vogtl\u00e4ndisch dialect|Vogtlandian]]), and in the Swiss village of [[Samnaun]]. The largest cities in the Bavarian area are [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|German grammar}}\n\nGerman is a [[fusional language]] with a moderate degree of [[inflection]], with three [[grammatical gender]]s; as such, there can be a large number of words derived from the same root.\n\n=== Noun inflection ===\n[[File:German die der das declensions.svg|thumb|Declension of the German definite articles (all equivalent to English \"the\")]]\n{{further|Grammatical gender in German}}\n[[German nouns]] inflect by case, gender and number:\n* four [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]].\n* three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter. Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender: for instance, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ung}} (-ing), {{lang|de|-schaft}} (-ship), {{lang|de|-keit}} or {{lang|de|heit}} (-hood, -ness) are feminine, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-chen}} or {{lang|de|-lein}} ([[diminutive]] forms) are neuter and nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ismus}} ([[-ism]]) are masculine. Others are more variable, sometimes depending on the region in which the language is spoken; and some endings are not restricted to one gender, e.g. {{lang|de|-er}} ([[agent noun|-er]]), e.g. {{lang|de|Feier}} (feminine), celebration, party, {{lang|de|Arbeiter}} (masculine), labourer, and {{lang|de|Gewitter}} (neuter), thunderstorm.\n* two numbers: singular and plural.\n\nThis degree of inflection is considerably less than in [[Old High German]] and other old [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], and it is also somewhat less than, for instance, [[Old English]], modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] or [[Russian language|Russian]]. The three genders have collapsed in the plural. With four cases and three genders plus plural, there are 16 permutations of case and gender/number of the article (not the nouns), but there are only six forms of the [[article (grammar)|definite article]], which together cover all 16 permutations. In nouns, inflection for case is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns only in the genitive and in the dative (only in fixed or archaic expression), and even this is losing ground to substitutes in informal speech.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barbour|first1=Stephen|last2=Stevenson|first2=Patrick|title=Variation in German|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-35704-3|pages=160\u2013163}}</ref> The singular dative noun ending is considered archaic or at least old-fashioned in almost all contexts and is almost always dropped even in writing, except in poetry, songs, proverbs and other petrified forms. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular. Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular. The plural has an inflection for the dative. In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: {{lang|de|-s, -es, -n, -ns, -en, -ens, -e}}.\n\nIn German orthography, nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised to make it easier for readers to determine the function of a word within a sentence ({{lang|de|Am Freitag ging ich einkaufen.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"On Friday I went shopping.\"; {{lang|de|Eines Tages kreuzte er endlich auf.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"One day he finally showed up.\") This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related [[Luxembourgish language]] and several insular dialects of the [[North Frisian language]]), but it was historically common in other languages such as Danish (which abolished the capitalization of nouns in 1948) and English.\n\nLike the other Germanic languages, German forms noun [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] in which the first noun modifies the category given by the second: {{lang|de|Hundeh\u00fctte}} (\"dog hut\"; specifically: \"dog kennel\"). Unlike English, whose newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written \"open\" with separating spaces, German (like some other Germanic languages) nearly always uses the \"closed\" form without spaces, for example: {{lang|de|Baumhaus}} (\"tree house\"). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds in theory (see also [[English compounds]]). The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is {{lang|de|[[Rinderkennzeichnungs- und Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz|Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz]]}}, which, literally translated, is \"beef labelling supervision duty assignment law\" [from {{lang|de|Rind}} (cattle), {{lang|de|Fleisch}} (meat), {{lang|de|Etikettierung(s)}} (labelling), {{lang|de|\u00dcberwachung(s)}} (supervision), {{lang|de|Aufgaben}} (duties), {{lang|de|\u00dcbertragung(s)}} (assignment), {{lang|de|Gesetz}} (law)]. However, examples like this are perceived by native speakers as excessively bureaucratic, stylistically awkward or even satirical.\n\n=== Verb inflection ===\n{{Main|German verbs}}\n\nThe inflection of standard German verbs includes:\n* two main [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] classes: [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] and [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] (as in English). Additionally, there is a third class, known as mixed verbs, whose conjugation combines features of both the strong and weak patterns.\n* three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second and third.\n* two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular and plural.\n* three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[realis mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (in addition to [[infinitive]])\n* two [[voice (grammar)|voices]]: active and passive. The passive voice uses auxiliary verbs and is divisible into static and dynamic. Static forms show a constant state and use the verb \u2019\u2019to be\u2019\u2019 (sein). Dynamic forms show an action and use the verb \u201cto become\u2019\u2019 (werden).\n* two [[grammatical tense|tenses]] without auxiliary verbs ([[present tense|present]] and [[preterite]]) and four tenses constructed with auxiliary verbs ([[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[pluperfect]], [[future tense|future]] and [[future perfect]]).\n* the distinction between [[grammatical aspect]]s is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and/or preterite marking so the plain indicative voice uses neither of those two markers; the subjunctive by itself conveys secondhand information{{clarify|date=September 2012}}; subjunctive plus preterite marks the conditional state; and the preterite alone shows either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either second-hand-information or the conditional state of the verb, when necessary for clarity.\n* the distinction between perfect and [[continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]] is and has, at every stage of development, been a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but, strangely enough, it is now rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.\n* disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (''{{wiktde|blicken}}'' [to look], ''{{wiktde|erblicken}}'' [to see&nbsp;\u2013 unrelated form: {{wiktde|sehen}}]).\n\n==== Verb prefixes ====\nThe meaning of basic verbs can be expanded and sometimes radically changed through the use of a number of prefixes. Some prefixes have a specific meaning; the prefix '''{{lang|de|zer-}}''' refers to destruction, as in {{lang|de|'''zer'''rei\u00dfen}} (to tear apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''brechen}} (to break apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''schneiden}} (to cut apart). Other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves; '''{{lang|de|ver-}}''' is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings, as in {{lang|de|'''ver'''suchen}} (to try) from {{lang|de|suchen}} (to seek), {{lang|de|'''ver'''nehmen}} (to interrogate) from {{lang|de|nehmen}} (to take), {{lang|de|'''ver'''teilen}} (to distribute) from {{lang|de|teilen}} (to share), {{lang|de|'''ver'''stehen}} (to understand) from {{lang|de|stehen}} (to stand).\n\nOther examples include the following:\n{{lang|de|haften}} (to stick), {{lang|de|'''ver'''haften}} (to detain); {{lang|de|kaufen}} (to buy), {{lang|de|'''ver'''kaufen}} (to sell); {{lang|de|h\u00f6ren}} (to hear), {{lang|de|'''auf'''h\u00f6ren}} (to cease); {{lang|de|fahren}} (to drive), {{lang|de|'''er'''fahren}} (to experience).\n\nMany [[German verbs]] have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function. In [[finite verb]] forms, it is split off and moved to the end of the clause and is hence considered by some to be a \"resultative particle\". For example, {{lang|de|mitgehen}}, meaning \"to go along\", would be split, giving {{lang|de|Gehen Sie mit?}} (Literal: \"Go you with?\"; Idiomatic: \"Are you going along?\").\n\nIndeed, several [[parenthetical referencing|parenthetical]] clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement (ankommen = to arrive, er kam an = he arrived, er ist angekommen = he has arrived):\n: {{lang|de|Er '''kam''' am Freitagabend nach einem harten Arbeitstag und dem \u00fcblichen \u00c4rger, der ihn schon seit Jahren immer wieder an seinem Arbeitsplatz plagt, mit fraglicher Freude auf ein Mahl, das seine Frau ihm, wie er hoffte, bereits aufgetischt hatte, endlich zu Hause '''an'''.}}\nA selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this:\n: He \"came\" on Friday evening, after a hard day at work and the usual annoyances that had time and again been troubling him for years now at his workplace, with questionable joy, to a meal which, as he hoped, his wife had already put on the table, finally at home \"on\".\n\n=== Word order ===\nGerman word order is generally with the [[V2 word order]] restriction and also with the [[SOV word order]] restriction for main [[clause]]s. For [[polar questions]], exclamations and wishes, the [[finite verb]] always has the first position. In subordinate clauses, the verb occurs at the very end.\n\nGerman requires for a verbal element (main verb or [[auxiliary verb]]) to appear [[V2 word order|second in the sentence]]. The verb is preceded by the [[topic\u2013comment|topic]] of the sentence. The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence. For a sentence without an auxiliary, these are some possibilities:\n\n: {{lang|de|Der alte Mann gab mir gestern das Buch.}} (The old man gave me yesterday the book; normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir gestern der alte Mann.}} (The book gave [to] me yesterday the old man)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab der alte Mann mir gestern.}} (The book gave the old man [to] me yesterday)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir der alte Mann gestern.}} (The book gave [to] me the old man yesterday)\n\n: {{lang|de|Gestern gab mir der alte Mann das Buch.}} (Yesterday gave [to] me the old man the book, normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Mir gab der alte Mann das Buch gestern.}} ([To] me gave the old man the book yesterday (entailing: as for you, it was another date))\n\nThe position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject, an object or another argument. In a [[sentence (linguistics)|declarative sentence]] in English, if the subject does not occur before the predicate, the sentence could well be misunderstood.\n\nHowever, German's flexible word order allows one to emphasise specific words:\n\nNormal word order:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n\nObject in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro betrat der Direktor gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: His office entered the manager yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand.\n: The object {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) is thus highlighted; it could be the topic of the next sentence.\n\nAdverb of time in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern betrat der Direktor um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro. (aber heute ohne Schirm)}}\n:: Yesterday entered the manager at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office. (but today without umbrella)\n\nBoth time expressions in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock entered the manager with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n: The full-time specification {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr}} is highlighted.\n\nAnother possibility:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock the manager entered his office with an umbrella in the hand.\n: Both the time specification and the fact he carried an umbrella are accentuated.\n\nSwapped adverbs:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat mit einem Schirm in der Hand gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered with an umbrella in the hand yesterday at 10 o'clock his office.\n: The phrase {{lang|de|mit einem Schirm in der Hand}} is highlighted.\n\nSwapped object:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock his office with an umbrella in his hand.\n: The time specification and the object {{lang|de|sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) are lightly accentuated.\n\nThe flexible word order also allows one to use language \"tools\" (such as [[poetic meter]] and [[figures of speech]]) more freely.\n\n==== Auxiliary verbs ====\nWhen an [[auxiliary verb]] is present, it appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end. This occurs notably in the creation of the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect tense]]. Many word orders are still possible:\n\n:{{lang|de|Der alte Mann hat mir heute das Buch gegeben.}} (The old man has me today the book given.)\n:{{lang|de|Das Buch hat der alte Mann mir heute gegeben.}} ('''''The book''''' has the old man me today given.)\n:{{lang|de|Heute hat der alte Mann mir das Buch gegeben.}} ('''''Today''''' has the old man me the book given.)\n\nThe main verb may appear in first position to put stress on the action itself. The [[auxiliary verb]] is still in second position.\n\n:{{lang|de|Gegeben hat mir der alte Mann das Buch heute.}} ('''''Given''''' has me the old man the book ''''today''''.) The bare fact that the book has been given is emphasized, as well as 'today'.\n\n==== Modal verbs ====\nSentences using [[modal verb]]s place the infinitive at the end. For example, the English sentence \"Should he go home?\" would be rearranged in German to say \"Should he (to) home go?\" ({{lang|de|Soll er nach Hause gehen?}}). Thus, in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses, the infinitives are clustered at the end.

Borrowing from Latin continued after the fall of the Roman Empire during Christianization, mediated by the church and monasteries. Another important influx of Latin words can be observed during [[Renaissance humanism]]. In a scholarly context, the borrowings from Latin have continued until today, in the last few decades often indirectly through borrowings from English. During the 15th to 17th centuries, the influence of Italian was great, leading to many Italian loanwords in the fields of architecture, finance, and music. The influence of the French language in the 17th to 19th centuries resulted in an even greater import of French words. The English influence was already present in the 19th century, but it did not become dominant until the second half of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:OeWB 42Aufl.jpg|left|thumb|42nd edition of the {{lang|de|[[\u00d6sterreichisches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}} (\"Austrian Dictionary\").]]\n\nThus, [[Notker Labeo]] was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000.{{sfn|Hattemer|1849|p=5}} The tradition of loan translation was revitalized in the 18th century, with linguists like [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], who introduced close to 300 words that are still used in modern German.

Schraegschrift.jpg|right|thumb|[[German alphabet]], one of Austria's elementary school handwriting programs]]\n[[File:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift.png|thumb|[[German alphabet]], elementary school handwriting program in some West German states]]\n\nGerman is written in the [[Latin alphabet]]. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|Umlaut]], namely ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'', as well as the eszett or {{lang|de|[[scharfes s]]}} (sharp s): ''[[\u00df]]''. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, ''ss'' is used instead of ''\u00df''. Since ''\u00df'' can never occur at the beginning of a word, it has no traditional [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]].\n\nWritten texts in German are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] and certain [[German orthography|orthographical]] features&nbsp;\u2013 German is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns, a relic of a widespread practice in Northern Europe in the early modern era (including English for a while, in the 1700s)&nbsp;\u2013 and the frequent occurrence of long compounds. Because legibility and convenience set certain boundaries, compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts. (In contrast, although English can also string nouns together, it usually separates the nouns with spaces. For example, \"toilet bowl cleaner\".)\n\n=== Present ===\nBefore the [[German orthography reform of 1996]], ''\u00df'' replaced ''ss'' after [[vowel length|long vowels]] and [[diphthong]]s and before consonants, word-, or partial-word-endings. In reformed spelling, ''\u00df'' replaces ''ss'' only after long vowels and diphthongs.\n\nSince there is no traditional capital form of ''\u00df'', it was replaced by ''SS'' when capitalization was required. For example, {{lang|de|Ma\u00dfband}} (tape measure) became {{lang|de|MASSBAND}} in capitals. An exception was the use of \u00df in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names. To avoid confusion with similar names, lower case ''\u00df'' was maintained (so, \"{{lang|de|KRE\u00dfLEIN}}\" instead of \"{{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}\"). [[Capital \u00df]] (\u1e9e) was ultimately adopted into German orthography in 2017, ending a long orthographic debate (So, \"{{lang|de|KRE\u1e9eLEIN}} and {{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1033265/germanys-century-long-debate-over-a-missing-letter-in-its-alphabet|title=Germany has ended a century-long debate over a missing letter in its alphabet|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|language=English|accessdate=5 December 2017|quote=According to the council\u2019s 2017 spelling manual: When writing the uppercase [of \u00df], write SS. It\u2019s also possible to use the uppercase \u1e9e. Example: Stra\u00dfe \u2014 STRASSE \u2014 STRA\u1e9eE.}}</ref>\n\nUmlaut vowels (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) are commonly transcribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard or other medium used. In the same manner \u00df can be transcribed as ss. Some [[operating systems]] use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include, amongst other things, umlauts; in [[Microsoft Windows]] this is done using [[Alt codes]]. German readers understand these transcriptions (although they appear unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are a makeshift, not proper spelling. (In Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g. ''Raesfeld'' {{IPA-de|\u02c8ra\u02d0sf\u025blt|}}, ''Coesfeld'' {{IPA|[\u02c8ko\u02d0sf\u025blt]}} and ''Itzehoe'' {{IPA|[\u026ats\u0259\u02c8ho\u02d0]}}, but this use of the letter e after a/o/u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than [[proper noun]]s.)\n\n{{Listen\n|filename = German alphabet-2.ogg\n|title = German alphabet\n|description = (Listen to a German speaker recite the alphabet in German)\n}}\n\nThere is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence. Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e. Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel, but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts. As an example in a [[telephone directory|telephone book]] {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} occurs after {{lang|de|Adressenverlage}} but before {{lang|de|Anlagenbauer}} (because \u00c4 is replaced by Ae). In a dictionary {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} comes after {{lang|de|Arzt}}, but in some dictionaries {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} and all other words starting with ''\u00c4'' may occur after all words starting with ''A''. In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial ''Sch'' and ''St'' are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after ''S'', but they are usually treated as S+C+H and S+T.\n\nWritten German also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma ([[quotation mark]]) as in {{lang|de|\u201eGuten Morgen!\u201c}}.\n\n=== Past ===\n[[File:Fraktur-ru.jpg|thumb|A Russian dictionary from 1931, showing the \"German alphabet\"&nbsp;\u2013 the 3rd and 4th columns of each half are [[Fraktur]] and [[Kurrent]] respectively, with the footnote explaining [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] used in Fraktur.]]\n{{Further|2nd Orthographic Conference (German)|Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|German orthography reform of 1944}}\nUntil the early 20th century, German was mostly printed in [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s (mostly in [[Fraktur]], but also in [[Schwabacher]]) and written in corresponding [[penmanship|handwriting]] (for example [[Kurrent]] and [[S\u00fctterlin]]). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or [[sans-serif]] [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces used today, and the handwritten forms in particular are difficult for the untrained to read. The printed forms, however, were claimed by some to be more readable when used for [[Germanic languages]].<ref>Adolf Reinecke, {{lang|de|Die deutsche Buchstabenschrift: ihre Entstehung und Entwicklung, ihre Zweckm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit und v\u00f6lkische Bedeutung}}, Leipzig, Hasert, 1910</ref> (Often, foreign names in a text were printed in an Antiqua typeface even though the rest of the text was in Fraktur.) The [[Nazism|Nazis]] initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher because they were considered [[Aryan]], but they abolished them in 1941, claiming that these letters were Jewish.<ref>[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]<br />\nThe memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.<br />\"For general attention, on behalf of the F\u00fchrer, I make the following announcement:<br />It is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.<br />Today the F\u00fchrer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf M\u00fcller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools.<br />The use of the Schwabach Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.<br />On behalf of the F\u00fchrer, Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script\".</ref> It is also believed that the Nazi r\u00e9gime had banned this script as they realized that Fraktur would inhibit communication in the territories occupied during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Albert |last=Kapr |title=Fraktur: Form und Geschichte der gebrochenen Schriften |location=Mainz |publisher=H. Schmidt |year=1993 |page=81 |isbn=978-3-87439-260-0 }}</ref>\n\nThe Fraktur script however remains present in everyday life in pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and antiquity.\n\nA proper use of the [[long s]], ({{lang|de|langes s}}), [[long s|\u017f]], is essential for writing German text in [[Fraktur]] typefaces. Many [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces include the [[long s]] also. A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting. Any lower case \"s\" at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s, as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words {{lang|de|Wach\u017ftube}} (guard-house) and {{lang|de|Wachstube}} (tube of polish/wax). One can easily decide which \"s\" to use by appropriate hyphenation, ({{lang|de|Wach-\u017ftube}} vs. {{lang|de|Wachs-tube}}). The long s only appears in [[lower case]].\n\n=== Reform of 1996 ===\n{{Main|German orthography reform of 1996}}\n\nThe orthography reform of 1996 led to public controversy and considerable dispute. The states ({{lang|de|Bundesl\u00e4nder}}) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Bavaria]] would not accept it. The dispute landed at one point in the highest court, which made a short issue of it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule&nbsp;\u2013 everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it. After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major revision was installed in 2006, just in time for the coming school year. In 2007, some traditional spellings were finally invalidated, whereas in 2008, on the other hand, many of the old [[comma]] rules were again put in force.\n\nThe most noticeable change was probably in the use of the letter ''\u00df'', called {{lang|de|scharfes s}} (''Sharp S'') or {{lang|de|ess-zett}} (pronounced ''ess-tsett''). Traditionally, this letter was used in three situations:\n\n# After a long vowel or vowel combination,\n# Before a ''t'', and\n# At the end of a syllable\n\nThus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|pa\u00dft}}, and {{lang|de|da\u00df}}. Currently only the first rule is in effect, thus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|passt}}, and {{lang|de|dass}}. The word {{lang|de|Fu\u00df}} 'foot' has the letter ''\u00df'' because it contains a long vowel, even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable. The logic of this change is that an '\u00df' is a single letter whereas 'ss' obviously are two letters, so the same distinction applies as for instance between the words {{lang|de|den}} and {{lang|de|denn}}.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|German phonology}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\n[[File:De-Faust - Der Trag\u00f6die erster Teil-Prolog und Auf dem Theater-wikisource.ogg|thumb|Spoken German in [[Goethe's Faust]]]]\n\nIn German, vowels (excluding diphthongs; see below) are either ''short'' or ''long'', as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! A !! \u00c4 !! E !! I !! O !! \u00d6 !! U !! \u00dc\n|-\n! short\n| {{IPA|/a/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/, /\u0259/}} || {{IPA|/\u026a/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254/}} || {{IPA|/\u0153/}} || {{IPA|/\u028a/}} || {{IPA|/\u028f/}}\n|-\n! long\n| {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/, /e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}\n|}\nShort {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is realized as {{IPA|[\u025b]}} in stressed syllables (including [[secondary stress]]), but as {{IPA|[\u0259]}} in unstressed syllables. Note that stressed short {{IPA|/\u025b/}} can be spelled either with ''e'' or with ''\u00e4'' (for instance, {{lang|de|h\u00e4tte}} \"would have\" and {{lang|de|Kette}} \"chain\" rhyme). In general, the short vowels are open and the long vowels are close. The one exception is the open {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} sound of long ''\u00c4''; in some varieties of standard German, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} have merged into {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}, removing this anomaly. In that case, pairs like {{lang|de|B\u00e4ren/Beeren}} 'bears/berries' or {{lang|de|\u00c4hre/Ehre}} 'spike (of wheat)/honour' become homophonous (see: [[Captain Bluebear]]).\n\nIn many varieties of standard German, an unstressed {{IPA|/\u025br/}} is not pronounced {{IPA|[\u0259r]}}, but vocalised to {{IPA|[\u0250]}}.\n\nWhether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable, although the following regularities exist:\n* If a vowel (other than ''i'') is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant, it is usually pronounced long (e.g. {{lang|de|Hof}} {{IPA|[ho\u02d0f]}}).\n* If a vowel is followed by ''h'' or if an ''i'' is followed by an ''e'', it is long.\n* If the vowel is followed by a double consonant (e.g. ''ff'', ''ss'' or ''tt''), ''ck'', ''tz'' or a [[consonant cluster]] (e.g. ''st'' or ''nd''), it is nearly always short (e.g. {{lang|de|hoffen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0254f\u0259n]}}). Double consonants are used only for this function of marking preceding vowels as short; the consonant itself is never pronounced lengthened or doubled, in other words this is not a [[feeding order]] of [[gemination]] and then [[vowel shortening]].\nBoth of these rules have exceptions (e.g. {{lang|de|hat}} {{IPA|[hat]}} \"has\" is short despite the first rule; {{lang|de|Mond}} {{IPA|[mo\u02d0nt]}}, \"[[moon]]\" is long despite the second rule). For an ''i'' that is neither in the combination ''ie'' (making it long) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster (making it short), there is no general rule. In some cases, there are regional differences: In central Germany ([[Hessen]]), the ''o'' in the [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper name]] \"Hoffmann\" is pronounced long, whereas most other Germans would pronounce it short; the same applies to the ''e'' in the geographical name \"[[Mecklenburg]]\" for people in that region. The word {{lang|de|St\u00e4dte}} \"cities\", is pronounced with a short vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025bt\u0259]}} by some ([[Jan Hofer]], [[Das Erste|ARD Television]]) and with a long vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025b\u02d0t\u0259]}} by others ([[Marietta Slomka]], [[ZDF]] Television). Finally, a vowel followed by ''ch'' can be short ({{lang|de|Fach}} {{IPA|[fax]}} \"compartment\", {{lang|de|K\u00fcche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u028f\u00e7\u0259]}} \"kitchen\") or long ({{lang|de|Suche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8zu\u02d0x\u0259]}} \"search\", {{lang|de|B\u00fccher}} {{IPA|[\u02c8by\u02d0\u00e7\u0250]}} \"books\") almost at random. Thus, {{lang|de|Lache}} is homographous between {{IPA|[la\u02d0x\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"puddle\" and {{IPA|[lax\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"manner of laughing\" (colloquial) or {{lang|de|lache!}} \"laugh!\" (imperative).\n\nGerman vowels can form the following digraphs (in writing) and diphthongs (in pronunciation); note that the pronunciation of some of them (ei, \u00e4u, eu) is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! spelling\n| ai, ei, ay, ey || au || \u00e4u, eu\n|-\n! pronunciation\n| {{IPA|/a\u026a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/a\u028a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254\u028f\u032f/}}\n|}\nAdditionally, the digraph ''ie'' generally represents the phoneme {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, which is not a diphthong. In many varieties, an {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable is vocalised. However, a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised {{IPA|/r/}} is not a phonemic diphthong: {{lang|de|B\u00e4r}} {{IPA|[b\u025b\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"bear\", {{lang|de|er}} {{IPA|[e\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"he\", {{lang|de|wir}} {{IPA|[vi\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"we\", {{lang|de|Tor}} {{IPA|[to\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"gate\", {{lang|de|kurz}} {{IPA|[k\u028a\u0250\u032fts]}} \"short\", {{lang|de|W\u00f6rter}} {{IPA|[v\u0153\u0250\u032ft\u0250]}} \"words\".\n\nIn most varieties of standard German, syllables that begin with a vowel are preceded by a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nWith approximately 26 phonemes, the German consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages. One of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual [[affricate]] {{IPA|/p\u0361f/}}. The consonant inventory of the standard language is shown below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n! [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!

In the [[syllable coda]], the allophone {{IPA|[\u0250]}} is found in many varieties.\n* <sup>3</sup> The voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] except when preceded by a [[sibilant]], exactly as in English.\n* <sup>4</sup>{{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} and {{IPA|/\u0292/}} occur only in words of foreign (usually English or French) origin.\n* Where a stressed syllable has an initial vowel, it is preceded by {{IPA|[\u0294]}}. As its presence is predictable from context, {{IPA|[\u0294]}} is not considered a phoneme.\n\n==== Consonant spellings ====\n* '''c''' standing by itself is not a German letter. In borrowed words, it is usually pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (before \u00e4, \u00e4u, e, i, \u00f6, \u00fc, y) or {{IPA|[k]}} (before a, o, u, and consonants). The combination '''ck''' is, as in English, used to indicate that the preceding vowel is short.\n* '''ch''' occurs often and is pronounced either {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} (after \u00e4, ai, \u00e4u, e, ei, eu, i, \u00f6, \u00fc and consonants; in the diminutive suffix {{lang|de|-chen}}; and at the beginning of a word), {{IPA|[x]}} (after a, au, o, u), or {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginning of a word before a, o, u and consonants. '''Ch''' never occurs at the beginning of an originally German word. In borrowed words with initial Ch before front vowels ({{lang|de|Chemie}} \"chemistry\" etc.), {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} is considered standard. However, Upper Germans and Franconians (in the geographical sense) replace it with {{IPA|[k]}}, as German as a whole does before darker vowels and consonants such as in {{lang|de|Charakter}}, {{lang|de|Christentum}}. Middle Germans (except Franconians) will borrow a {{IPA|[\u0283]}} from the French model. Both agree in considering each other's variant,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and Upper Germans also the standard in {{IPA|[\u00e7]}}, as particularly awkward and unusual.\n* '''dsch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0292]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Dschungel}} {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0361\u0292\u028a\u014b\u0259l/}} \"jungle\") but appears in a few [[loanwords]] only.\n* '''f''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} as in \"''f''ather\".\n* '''h''' is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} as in \"''h''ome\" at the beginning of a syllable. After a vowel it is silent and only lengthens the vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|Reh}} {{IPA|[\u0281e\u02d0]}} = [[roe deer]]).\n* '''j''' is pronounced {{IPA|[j]}} in Germanic words ({{lang|de|Jahr}} {{IPA|[ja\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}) (like \"y\" in \"year\"). In recent loanwords, it follows more or less the respective languages' pronunciations.\n* '''l''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[l]}}, never {{IPA|*[\u026b]}} (the English \"[[dark L]]\").\n* '''q''' only exists in combination with '''u''' and is pronounced {{IPA|[kv]}}. It appears in both Germanic and Latin words ({{lang|de|quer}} {{IPA|[kve\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}; {{lang|de|Qualit\u00e4t}} {{IPA|[kvali\u02c8t\u025b\u02d0t]}}). But as most words containing q are Latinate, the letter is considerably rarer in German than it is in English.\n* '''r''' is usually pronounced in a [[guttural R|guttural]] fashion (a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0281]}} or [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[\u0280]}}) in front of a vowel or consonant ({{lang|de|Rasen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0281a\u02d0z\u0259n]}}; {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0281k]}}). In spoken German, however, it is commonly vocalised after a vowel ({{lang|de|er}} being pronounced rather like {{IPA|[\u02c8\u025b\u0250\u032f]}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0250\u032fk]}}). In some varieties, the '''r''' is pronounced as a \"tongue-tip\" ''r'' (the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}).\n* '''s''' in German is pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} (as in \"''z''ebra\") if it forms the [[syllable onset]] (e.g. {{lang|de|Sohn}} {{IPA|[zo\u02d0n]}}), otherwise {{IPA|[s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Bus}} {{IPA|[b\u028as]}}). In Austria, Switzerland, and Southern Germany, {{IPA|[s]}} occurs at syllable onset as well. A '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} indicates that the preceding vowel is short. '''st''' and '''sp''' at the beginning of words of German origin are pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283t]}} and {{IPA|[\u0283p]}}, respectively.\n* '''\u00df''' (a letter unique to German called {{lang|de|scharfes S}} or {{lang|de|[[\u00df|Eszett]]}}) is a ligature of a [[Long S|long s (\u017f)]] ''and'' a [[tailed z|tailed z (\u0292)]] and is always pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}. Originating in [[Blackletter]] typeface, it traditionally replaced '''ss''' at the end of a syllable (e.g. {{lang|de|ich muss}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}}; {{lang|de|ich m\u00fcsste}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}}); within a word it contrasts with '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} in indicating that the preceding vowel is long (compare {{lang|de|in Ma\u00dfen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8ma\u02d0s\u0259n]}} \"with moderation\" and {{lang|de|in Massen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8mas\u0259n]}} \"in loads\"). The use of '''\u00df''' has recently been limited by the latest German spelling reform and is no longer used for '''ss''' after a short vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}} and {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}} were always pronounced with a short U/\u00dc); Switzerland and Liechtenstein already abolished it in 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mittelschulvorbereitung.ch/index.php?SUBJECT=&actualid=5 |title=Mittelschulvorbereitung Deutsch |publisher=Mittelschulvorbereitung.ch |date= |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>\n* '''sch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (like \"sh\" in \"shine\").\n* '''tion''' in Latin loanwords is pronounced {{IPA|[tsi\u032fo\u02d0n]}}.\n* '''th''' is found, rarely, in loanwords and is pronounced {{IPA|[t]}} if the loanword is from Greek, and usually as in the original if the loanword is from English (though some, mostly older, speakers tend to replace the English th-sound with {{IPA|[s]}}).\n* '''v''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} in a limited number of words of Germanic origin, such as {{lang|de|Vater}} {{IPA|[\u02c8fa\u02d0t\u0250]}}, {{lang|de|Vogel}} \"bird\", {{lang|de|von}} \"from, of\", {{lang|de|vor}} \"before, in front of\", {{lang|de|voll}} \"full\" and the prefix {{lang|de|ver-}}. It is also used in loanwords, where it is normally pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}. This pronunciation is common in words like {{lang|de|Vase}}, {{lang|de|Vikar}}, {{lang|de|Viktor}}, {{lang|de|Viper}}, {{lang|de|Ventil}}, {{lang|de|vulg\u00e4r}}, and English loanwords; however, pronunciation is {{IPA|[f]}} by some people in some in the very south. The only non-German word in which \"v\" is always pronounced \"f\" is {{lang|de|Eva}} (Eve).\n* '''w''' is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}} as in \"''v''acation\" (e.g. {{lang|de|was}} {{IPA|[vas]}}).\n* '''y''' is pronounced as {{IPA|[y]}} when long, and {{IPA|[\u028f]}} when short (as in {{lang|de|Hygiene}} {{IPA|[hy\u0261i\u032f\u02c8e\u02d0n\u0259]}} ; {{lang|de|Labyrinth}} {{IPA|[laby\u02c8\u0281\u026ant]}} or {{lang|de|Gymnasium}} {{IPA|/\u0261\u028fm\u02c8na\u02d0zi\u032f\u028am/}}), except in ''ay'' and ''ey'' which are both pronounced {{IPA|[a\u026a\u032f]}}. It is also often used in loanwords and pronounced like in the original language like in ''Style'' or ''Recycling''.\n* '''z''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|zog}} {{IPA|[t\u0361so\u02d0k]}}), except in loanwords. A '''tz''' indicates that the preceding vowel is short.\n\n==== Consonant shifts ====\n{{details|High German consonant shift}}\n\nGerman does not have any [[dental fricative]]s (as English '''th'''). The '''th''' sounds, which the English language still has, disappeared on the continent in German with the consonant shifts between the 8th and the 10th centuries.<ref>For a history of the German consonants see {{harvp|Cercignani|1979}}.</ref> It is sometimes possible to find parallels between English and German by replacing the English '''th''' with '''d''' in German: \"Thank\" \u2192 in German {{lang|de|Dank}}, \"this\" and \"that\" \u2192 {{lang|de|dies}} and {{lang|de|das}}, \"[[thou]]\" (old 2nd person singular pronoun) \u2192 {{lang|de|du}}, \"think\" \u2192 {{lang|de|denken}}, \"thirsty\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durstig}} and many other examples.\n\nLikewise, the '''gh''' in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] English words, pronounced in several different ways in modern English (as an '''f''', or not at all), can often be linked to German '''ch''': \"to laugh\" \u2192 {{lang|de|lachen}}, \"through\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durch}}, \"high\" \u2192 {{lang|de|hoch}}, \"naught\" \u2192 {{lang|de|nichts}}, \"light\" \u2192 {{lang|de|leicht}} or {{lang|de|Licht}}, \"sight\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Sicht}}, \"daughter\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Tochter}}, \"neighbour\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Nachbar}}.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|German literature}}\n\nThe German language is used in German literature and can be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most notable authors of the period being [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]].\nThe {{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}}, whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch. The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nReformer and theologian [[Martin Luther]], who was the first to translate the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most well known poets and authors in German are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]. Fourteen German-speaking people have won the [[Nobel Prize in literature]]: [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]], [[Paul von Heyse]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Carl Spitteler]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Nelly Sachs]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]], [[Elias Canetti]], [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Herta M\u00fcller]] and [[Peter Handke]], making it the second most awarded linguistic region (together with French) after English.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"align:center;\"\n!

It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[South Tyrol]] in [[Italy]], the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. It is one of the three official languages of [[Luxembourg]] and a co-official language in the [[Opole Voivodeship]] in [[Poland]]. The languages that are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch, including [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], the [[Frisian languages]], [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], and [[Yiddish]]. There are strong similarities in vocabulary with [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], although those belong to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] group. German is the second most widely spoken [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], after English.\n\nOne of the [[world language|major languages of the world]], German is a [[native language]] to almost 100&nbsp;million people worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"Vasagar2013\"/> German is the third most commonly spoken foreign language in the EU after English and [[French language|French]], making it the second biggest language in the EU in terms of overall speakers. German is also the second most widely taught foreign language in the EU after English at primary school level (but third after English and French at lower secondary level), the fourth most widely taught non-English language in the US (after [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish]], [[French language in the United States#Language study|French]] and [[American Sign Language]]), and the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the third most widely used language on websites after [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]] are ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books, with one tenth of all books (including e-books) in the world being published in the German language. In the [[United Kingdom]], German and French are the most sought-after foreign languages for businesses (with 49% and 50% of businesses identifying these two languages as the most useful, respectively).<ref name=\"Burns2014\"/>\n\nGerman is an [[inflected language]] with four [[Grammatical case|cases]] for nouns, pronouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative), three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and [[Germanic strong verb|strong and weak verbs]]. It derives the majority of its vocabulary from the ancient Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. A portion of the words are derived from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and fewer are borrowed from [[French language|French]] and [[Modern English]]. With standardized variants ([[German Standard German|German]], [[Austrian Standard German|Austrian]], and [[Swiss Standard German|Swiss]] Standard German), German is a [[pluricentric language]]. It is also notable for [[German dialects|its broad spectrum of dialects]], with many unique varieties existing in Europe and also other parts of the world. Italy recognizes all the German-speaking minorities in its territory as [[Languages of Italy#Historical linguistic minorities|national historic minorities]] and protects the varieties of German spoken in several regions of [[Northern Italy]] besides South Tyrol.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm|title=Minorities in Italy - Italian Parliament|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/magazine/lingua_italiana/speciali/minoranze/Caria.html|title=German minorities in Italy|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> Due to the limited intelligibility between certain varieties and [[Standard German]], as well as the lack of an undisputed, scientific difference between a \"dialect\" and a \"language\", some German varieties or dialect groups (e.g. [[Low German]] or [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]<ref name=\"Goossens2000\">Jan Goossens: {{lang|de|Niederdeutsche Sprache: Versuch einer Definition.}} In: Jan Goossens (Hrsg.): {{lang|de|Niederdeutsch: Sprache und Literatur.}} Karl Wachholtz, 2.

The Germanic languages are traditionally subdivided into three branches: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]]. The first of these branches survives in modern [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], all of which are descended from [[Old Norse]]. The East Germanic languages are now extinct, and the only historical member of this branch from which written texts survive is [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. The West Germanic languages, however, have undergone extensive dialectal subdivision and are now represented in modern languages such as [[English language|English]], German, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Yiddish]], [[Afrikaans]], and others.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=16}} \n[[File:Germanic Languages Map Europe.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Germanic languages]] in Europe]]\nWithin the West Germanic language dialect continuum, the [[Benrath line|Benrath]] and [[Uerdingen line|Uerdingen]] lines (running through [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]-[[D\u00fcsseldorf-Benrath|Benrath]] and [[Krefeld]]-[[Uerdingen]], respectively) serve to distinguish the Germanic dialects that were affected by the [[High German consonant shift]] (south of Benrath) from those that were not (north of Uerdingen). The various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as [[High German languages|High German]] dialects ''(nos. 29\u201334 on the map)'', while those spoken to the north comprise the [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] ''(nos. 19\u201324)'' and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] ''(no. 25)'' dialects. As members of the West Germanic language family, High German, Low German, and Low Franconian can be further distinguished historically as [[Irminones|Irminonic]], [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]], and [[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]], respectively. This classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the Irminones (also known as the Elbe group), Ingvaeones (or North Sea Germanic group), and Istvaeones (or Weser-Rhine group).{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=16}}\n\n[[Standard German]] is based on a combination of [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]]-[[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]] and Upper Franconian and Bavarian dialects, which are [[Central German]] and Upper German dialects, belonging to the Irminonic [[High German languages|High German]] dialect group ''(nos. 29\u201334)''. German is therefore closely related to the other languages based on High German dialects, such as [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] (based on [[Central Franconian dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 29''), and [[Yiddish]]. Also closely related to Standard German are the [[Upper German]] dialects spoken in the southern [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]], such as [[Swiss German]] ([[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] \u2013 ''no. 34''), and the various Germanic dialects spoken in the [[France|French]] [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Grand Est]], such as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (mainly Alemannic, but also Central- and&nbsp;[[High Franconian German|Upper Franconian]]&nbsp;''(no. 32)''&nbsp;dialects) and [[Lorraine Franconian]] (Central Franconian \u2013 ''no. 29'').\n\nAfter these High German dialects, standard German is (somewhat less closely) related to languages based on Low Franconian dialects (e.g. Dutch and Afrikaans) or Low German/Low Saxon dialects (spoken in northern [[Germany]] and southern [[Denmark]]), neither of which underwent the High German consonant shift. As has been noted, the former of these dialect types is Istvaeonic and the latter Ingvaeonic, whereas the High German dialects are all Irminonic; the differences between these languages and standard German are therefore considerable. Also related to German are the Frisian languages\u2014[[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] (spoken in [[Nordfriesland (district)|Nordfriesland]] \u2013 ''no. 28''), [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]] (spoken in [[Saterland]] \u2013 ''no. 27''), and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] (spoken in [[Friesland]] \u2013 ''no. 26'')\u2014as well as the Anglic languages of [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]]. These [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] dialects are all members of the Ingvaeonic family of West Germanic languages which did not take part in the High German consonant shift.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of German}}\n\n=== Old High German ===\n{{Main|Old High German}}\n\nThe [[History of German|history of the German language]] begins with the [[High German consonant shift]] during the [[migration period]], which separated [[Old High German]] (OHG) dialects from [[Old Saxon]]. This [[Sound change|sound shift]] involved a drastic change in the pronunciation of both [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless [[stop consonant]]s (''b'', ''d'', ''g'', and ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', respectively). The primary effects of the shift were the following:\n* Voiceless stops became long ([[Gemination|geminated]]) voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] following a vowel\n* Voiceless stops became [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] in word-initial position, or following certain consonants\n* Voiced stops became voiceless in certain phonetic settings.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Voiceless stop<br />following a vowel\n!Word-initial<br />voiceless stop\n!Voiced stop\n|-\n|/p/\u2192/ff/\n|/p/\u2192/pf/\n|/b/\u2192/p/\n|-\n|/t/\u2192/ss/\n|/t/\u2192/ts/\n|/d/\u2192/t/\n|-\n|/k/\u2192/xx/\n|/k/\u2192/kx/\n|/g/\u2192/k/\n|}\nWhile there is written evidence of the [[Old High German]] language in several [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions from as early as the 6th century AD (such as the [[Pforzen buckle]]), the Old High German period is generally seen as beginning with the ''[[Abrogans]]'' (written c.765\u2013775), a Latin-German [[glossary]] supplying over 3,000 OHG words with their [[Latin]] equivalents. Following the ''Abrogans'' the first coherent works written in OHG appear in the 9th century, chief among them being the ''[[Muspilli]]'', the ''[[Merseburg Charms]]'', and the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'', as well as a number of other religious texts (the ''[[Georgslied]]'', the ''[[Ludwigslied]]'', the ''Evangelienbuch'', and translated hymns and prayers).{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}<ref name=\"Calvin1909\">{{Cite book |title=An Anthology of German Literature |last=Calvin |first=Thomas |publisher=D. C. Heath & co |pages=5\u20136 |oclc=6128632}}</ref> The ''Muspilli'' is a Christian poem written in a [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]] dialect offering an account of the soul after the [[Last Judgment]], and the ''Merseburg Charms'' are transcriptions of spells and charms from the [[Paganism|pagan]] Germanic tradition. Of particular interest to scholars, however, has been the ''Hildebrandslied'', a secular [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the tale of an estranged father and son unknowingly meeting each other in battle. Linguistically this text is highly interesting due to the mixed use of [[Old Saxon]] and Old High German dialects in its composition. The written works of this period stem mainly from the [[Alemanni|Alamanni]], [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]], and [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]] groups, all belonging to the Elbe Germanic group ([[Irminones]]), which had settled in what is now southern-central [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] between the 2nd and 6th centuries during the great migration.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}}\n\nIn general, the surviving texts of OHG show a wide range of [[dialect]]al diversity with very little written uniformity. The early written tradition of OHG survived mostly through [[Monastery|monasteries]] and [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] as local translations of Latin originals; as a result, the surviving texts are written in highly disparate regional dialects and exhibit significant Latin influence, particularly in vocabulary.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=239-242}} At this point monasteries, where most written works were produced, were dominated by Latin, and German saw only occasional use in official and ecclesiastical writing.\n\nThe German language through the OHG period was still predominantly a spoken language, with a wide range of dialects and a much more extensive [[Oral literature|oral]] tradition than a written one. Having just emerged from the High German consonant shift, OHG was also a relatively new and volatile language still undergoing a number of [[Phonetics|phonetic]], [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], and [[Syntax|syntactic]] changes. The scarcity of written work, instability of the language, and widespread illiteracy of the time thus account for the lack of [[Standard language|standardization]] up to the end of the OHG period in 1050.\n\n=== Middle High German ===\n\n[[File:AlthochdeutscheSprachr\u00e4ume962 Box.jpg|upright|thumb|The Germanic-speaking area of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around AD 962.\n----\n{{legend|#B298C4|Old Frisian ({{lang|de|Alt-Friesisch}})}}\n{{legend|#DB9564|Old Saxon ({{lang|de|Alt-S\u00e4chsisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FE8741|Old Franconian ({{lang|de|Alt-Fr\u00e4nkisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FCC54B|Old Alemannic ({{lang|de|Alt-Alemannisch}})}}\n{{legend|#FE9A2C|Old Bavarian ({{lang|de|Alt-Bairisch}})}}\n]]\n{{Main|Middle High German}}\n\nWhile there is no complete agreement over the dates of the [[Middle High German]] (MHG) period, it is generally seen as lasting from 1050 to 1350.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/zurgeschichtede02schegoog|title=Zur Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache|last=Scherer|first=Wilhelm|last2=Jankowsky|first2=Kurt R.|date=1995|publisher=Amsterdam; Philadelphia: J.

Whereas during the Old High German period the Germanic tribes extended only as far east as the [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]] rivers, the MHG period saw a number of these tribes expanding beyond this eastern boundary into [[Slavs|Slavic]] territory (this is known as the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''). Along with the increasing wealth and geographic extent of the Germanic groups came greater use of German in the courts of nobles as the standard language of official proceedings and literature.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/Ling450ch/reports/german.html|title=A Brief History of the German Language|last=Alder|first=Aaron D.|date=|website=linguistics.byu.edu|access-date=2017-07-13}}</ref> A clear example of this is the ''mittelhochdeutsche Dichtersprache'' employed in the [[Hohenstaufen]] court in [[Swabia]] as a standardized supra-dialectal written language. While these efforts were still regionally bound, German began to be used in place of Latin for certain official purposes, leading to a greater need for regularity in written conventions.\n\nWhile the major changes of the MHG period were socio-cultural, German was still undergoing significant linguistic changes in syntax, phonetics, and morphology as well (e.g. [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]] of certain vowel sounds: ''hus'' (OHG \"house\")''\u2192haus'' (MHG), and weakening of unstressed short vowels to [[schwa]] [\u0259]: ''taga'' (OHG \"days\")\u2192''tage'' (MHG)).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of German : what the past reveals about today's language|last=Salmons|first=Joe|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969793-9|edition=1st|location=Oxford|page=195|oclc=811323307}}</ref>\n\nA great wealth of texts survives from the MHG period. Significantly, among this repertoire are a number of impressive secular works, such as the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the story of the [[dragon]]-slayer [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] ({{circa}} 13th century), and the ''[[Iwein]],'' an [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] verse poem by [[Hartmann von Aue]] ({{circa}} 1203), as well as several [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] and courtly romances such as ''[[Parzival]]'' and ''[[Tristan]]''. Also noteworthy is the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', the first book of laws written in [[Middle Low German|Middle ''Low'' German]] ({{circa}} 1220). The abundance and especially the secular character of the literature of the MHG period demonstrate the beginnings of a standardized written form of German, as well as the desire of poets and authors to be understood by individuals on supra-dialectal terms.\n\nThe Middle High German period is generally seen as ending with the decimation of the population of [[Europe]] in the [[Black Death]] of 1346\u20131353.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Early New High German ===\n{{Main|Early New High German}}\n\n[[File:Deutsch-Niederl\u00e4ndischer Sprachraum (nach Werner K\u00f6nig).png|thumb|upright=1.36|left|German-Dutch language area before and after the [[flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)]] from much of eastern and central Europe.

While these states were still under the control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and far from any form of unification, the desire for a cohesive written language that would be understandable across the many German-speaking [[Principality|principalities]] and kingdoms was stronger than ever. As a spoken language German remained highly fractured through this period with a vast number of often mutually-incomprehensible [[German dialects|regional dialects]] being spoken throughout the German states; the invention of the [[printing press]] {{circa}} 1440 and the publication of [[Luther Bible|Luther's vernacular translation of the Bible]] in 1534, however, had an immense effect on standardizing German as a supra-dialectal written language.\n\nThe ENHG period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] German, one being ''gemeine tiutsch,'' used in the court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], and the other being ''Mei\u00dfner Deutsch'', used in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in the [[Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The German language|last=Keller|first=R.E.|date=1978|publisher=Faber|isbn=978-0-571-11159-6|location=London|pages=365\u2013368|oclc=4139504}}</ref> Alongside these courtly written standards, the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers' languages (''Druckersprachen'') aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of German as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Geschichte der deutschen Sprache|last=Bach|first=Adolf|publisher=Quelle & Meyer|year=1965|isbn=|location=Heidelberg|page=254}}</ref> The greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardization in the written form of the German language.[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|The widespread popularity of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]] translated into German by [[Martin Luther]] helped establish modern German]]One of the central events in the development of ENHG was the publication of Luther's translation of the Bible into German (the [[New Testament]] in 1522 and the [[Old Testament]], published in parts and completed in 1534). Luther based his translation primarily on the ''Mei\u00dfner Deutsch'' of [[Saxony]], spending much time among the population of Saxony researching the dialect so as to make the work as natural and accessible to German speakers as possible. Copies of Luther's Bible featured a long list of [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] for each region that translated words which were unknown in the region into the regional dialect. Concerning his translation method Luther says the following:<blockquote>One who would talk German does not ask the Latin how he shall do it; he must ask the mother in the home, the children on the streets, the common man in the market-place and note carefully how they talk, then translate accordingly. They will then understand what is said to them because it is German.

It is important to note, however, that the colloquial standard German differs greatly from the formal written language, especially in grammar and syntax, in which it has been influenced by dialectal speech.\n\nStandard German differs regionally among German-speaking countries in [[vocabulary]] and some instances of [[pronunciation]] and even [[grammar]] and [[orthography]]. This variation must not be confused with the variation of local [[dialects]]. Even though the regional varieties of standard German are only somewhat influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. German is thus considered a [[pluricentric language]].\n\nIn most regions, the speakers use a continuum from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties depending on the circumstances.\n\n=== Varieties of Standard German ===\n[[File:Standard varieties of German.png|thumb|The national and regional standard varieties of German<ref>Ulrich Ammon, Hans Bickel, Jakob Ebner, et al.: {{lang|de|Variantenw\u00f6rterbuch des Deutschen.

They differ only slightly in lexicon and phonology. In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.\n* [[German Standard German]]\n* [[Austrian Standard German]]\n* [[Swiss Standard German]]\n\nIn the German-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]], mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of Standard German is largely restricted to the written language, though about 11% of the Swiss residents speak ''High German'' (aka Standard German) at home, but mainly due to German immigrants.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung/sprachen-religionen/sprachen.assetdetail.4842942.html |title=Die am h\u00e4ufigsten \u00fcblicherweise zu Hause gesprochenen Sprachen der st\u00e4ndigen Wohnbev\u00f6lkerung ab 15 Jahren \u2013 2012\u20132014, 2013\u20132015, 2014\u20132016 |type=official site |date=28 March 2018 |format=XLS |publisher=Federal Statistical Office FSO |location=Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland  |language=de, fr, it |access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref> This situation has been called a ''medial [[diglossia]]''. [[Swiss Standard German]] is used in the Swiss education system, while [[Austrian Standard German]] is officially used in the Austrian education system.\n\nA mixture of dialect and standard does not normally occur in Northern Germany either. The traditional varieties there are Low German, whereas Standard German is a High German \"variety\". Because their linguistic distance is greater, they do not mesh with Standard German the way that High German dialects (such as Bavarian, Swabian, and Hessian) can.\n\n== Dialects ==\n{{Main|German dialects}}\n[[File:Continental West Germanic languages.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] dialects]]\n\nGerman is a member of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[language family|family of languages]], which in turn is part of the [[Indo-European language family]]. The German dialects are the traditional local varieties; many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German, and they have great differences in [[lexicon]], [[phonology]] and [[syntax]]. If a narrow definition of [[language]] based on [[mutual intelligibility]] is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance in the ''[[Ethnologue]]''). However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.\n\nThe German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into [[High German languages|High German]] and [[Low German]], also called [[Lower Saxony|Low Saxon]]. However, historically, High German dialects and Low Saxon/Low German dialects do not belong to the same language. Nevertheless, in today's Germany, Low Saxon/Low German is often perceived as a dialectal variation of Standard German on a functional level even by many native speakers. The same phenomenon is found in the eastern Netherlands, as the traditional dialects are not always identified with their Low Saxon/Low German origins, but with Dutch.<ref>[[:nl:Nederduits]]</ref>{{better source|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe variation among the German dialects is considerable, with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Some dialects are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon.\n\n=== Low German and Low Saxon ===\n{{Main|Low German}}\n[[File:Map of the Low German Dialects.svg|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] (yellow) and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] (orange) dialects]]\n[[Middle Low German]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. It was the predominant language in Northern Germany until the 16th century. In 1534, the [[Luther Bible]] was published. The translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the [[Early New High German]]. It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on [[Central German|Central]] and [[Upper German]] varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than [[Low German]] and became the language of science and literature. Around the same time, the Hanseatic League, based around northern ports, lost its importance as new trade routes to [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]] were established, and the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass [[education]] in [[Standard German]] in schools. Gradually, Low German came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated. Today, Low Saxon can be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable Standard German influx{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as {{lang|de|[[Missingsch]]}}. Sometimes, Low Saxon and [[Low Franconian]] varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift. However, the proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since [[World War II]]. The largest cities in the Low German area are [[Hamburg]] and [[Dortmund]].\n\n=== Low Franconian ===\n[[File:Niederfr\u00e4nkisch.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]]]]\nThe [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are the dialects that are more closely related to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] than to [[Low German]]. Most of the Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Belgium]], where they are considered as dialects of Dutch, which is itself a Low Franconian language. In Germany, Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the northwest of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], along the [[Lower Rhine]]. The Low Franconian dialects spoken in Germany are referred to as [[Meuse-Rhenish]] or Low Rhenish. In the north of the German Low Franconian language area, North Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as Cleverlands or as dialects of [[South Guelderish]]) are spoken. These dialects are more closely related to Dutch (also North Low Franconian) than the South Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as East [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and, east of the [[Rhine]], [[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]), which are spoken in the south of the German Low Franconian language area. The South Low Franconian dialects are more closely related to Limburgish than to Dutch, and are transitional dialects between Low Franconian and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] ([[Central Franconian dialects|Central Franconian]]). The [[East Bergish]] dialects are the easternmost Low Franconian dialects, and are transitional dialects between North- and South Low Franconian, and [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] (Low German), with most of their features being North Low Franconian. The largest cities in the German Low Franconian area are [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]].\n\n=== High German ===\n{{Main|High German languages}}\n[[File:Mitteldeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Central German]] dialects]]\n[[File:Fr\u00e4nkisches Sprachgebiet.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] ([[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]], [[Central Franconian dialects|Central-]] and [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]], and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian)]]]]\nThe High German dialects consist of the [[Central German]], [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]], and [[Upper German]] dialects. The High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. The High German varieties spoken by the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s have several unique features, and are considered as a separate language, [[Yiddish]], written with the [[Hebrew alphabet]].\n\n==== Central German ====\n\nThe [[Central German]] dialects are spoken in Central Germany, from [[Aachen]] in the west to [[G\u00f6rlitz]] in the east. They consist of [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] in the west ([[West Central German]]) and non-Franconian dialects in the east ([[East Central German]]). Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German dialects.\n\nThe Franconian, '''West Central German''' dialects are the [[Central Franconian dialects]] ([[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]]), and the [[Rhine Franconian dialects]] ([[Hessian dialects|Hessian]] and [[Palatine German language|Palatine]]). These dialects are considered as\n* German in Germany and Belgium\n* [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] in Luxembourg\n* [[Lorraine Franconian]] (spoken in [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]) and as a Rhine Franconian variant of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (spoken in [[Alsace bossue]] only) in France\n* [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] or [[Kerkrade dialect]] in the Netherlands.\nLuxembourgish as well as the [[Transylvanian Saxon dialect]] spoken in [[Transylvania]] are based on Moselle Franconian dialects. The largest cities in the Franconian Central German area are [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt]].\n\nFurther east, the non-Franconian, '''East Central German''' dialects are spoken ([[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]], [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]], [[Erzgebirgisch|Ore Mountainian]], and [[Lausitzisch-neum\u00e4rkisch dialects|Lusatian-New Markish]], and earlier, in the then German-speaking parts of [[Silesia]] also [[Silesian German|Silesian]], and in then German southern [[East Prussia]] also [[High Prussian dialect|High Prussian]]). The largest cities in the East Central German area are [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]].\n\n==== High Franconian ====\n\nThe [[High Franconian German|High Franconian dialects]] are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. They consist of the [[East Franconian German|East-]] and [[South Franconian German|South Franconian]] dialects.\n\nThe East Franconian dialect branch is one of the most spoken dialect branches in Germany. These dialects are spoken in the region of [[Franconia]] and in the central parts of [[Saxony|Saxon]] [[Vogtland]]. Franconia consists of the [[Bavaria]]n districts of [[Upper Franconia|Upper-]], [[Middle Franconia|Middle-]], and [[Lower Franconia]], the region of [[South Thuringia]] ([[Thuringia]]), and the eastern parts of the region of [[Heilbronn-Franken]] ([[Tauber Franconia]] and Hohenlohe) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The largest cities in the East Franconian area are [[Nuremberg]] and [[W\u00fcrzburg]].\n\nSouth Franconian is mainly spoken in northern Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany, but also in the northeasternmost part of the region of [[Alsace]] in France. While these dialects are considered as dialects of German in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, they are considered as dialects of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace (most Alsatian dialects are however [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]]). The largest cities in the South Franconian area are [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Heilbronn]].\n\n==== Upper German ====\n[[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Upper German]] and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]] (transitional between Central- and Upper German) dialects]]\nThe [[Upper German]] dialects are the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] in the west and the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]] in the east.\n\n===== Alemannic =====\nAlemannic dialects are spoken in [[Switzerland]] ([[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]] in the densely populated [[Swiss Plateau]], in the south also [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]], and [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]] in [[Basel]]), Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ([[Swabian German|Swabian]] and Low Alemannic, in the southwest also High Alemannic), [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Bavarian Swabia]] (Swabian, in the southwesternmost part also Low Alemannic), [[Vorarlberg]] (Low-, High-, and Highest Alemannic), [[Alsace]] (Low Alemannic, in the southernmost part also High Alemannic), [[Liechtenstein]] (High- and Highest Alemannic), and in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] [[Reutte District|district of Reutte]] (Swabian). The Alemannic dialects are considered as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace. The largest cities in the Alemannic area are [[Stuttgart]] and [[Z\u00fcrich]].\n\n===== Bavarian =====\nBavarian dialects are spoken in [[Austria]] ([[Vienna]], [[Lower Austria|Lower-]] and [[Upper Austria]], [[Styria]], [[Carinthia]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Burgenland]], and in most parts of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]), [[Bavaria]] ([[Upper Bavaria|Upper-]] and [[Lower Bavaria]] as well as [[Upper Palatinate]]), [[South Tyrol]], southwesternmost [[Saxony]] (Southern [[Vogtl\u00e4ndisch dialect|Vogtlandian]]), and in the Swiss village of [[Samnaun]]. The largest cities in the Bavarian area are [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|German grammar}}\n\nGerman is a [[fusional language]] with a moderate degree of [[inflection]], with three [[grammatical gender]]s; as such, there can be a large number of words derived from the same root.\n\n=== Noun inflection ===\n[[File:German die der das declensions.svg|thumb|Declension of the German definite articles (all equivalent to English \"the\")]]\n{{further|Grammatical gender in German}}\n[[German nouns]] inflect by case, gender and number:\n* four [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]].\n* three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter. Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender: for instance, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ung}} (-ing), {{lang|de|-schaft}} (-ship), {{lang|de|-keit}} or {{lang|de|heit}} (-hood, -ness) are feminine, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-chen}} or {{lang|de|-lein}} ([[diminutive]] forms) are neuter and nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ismus}} ([[-ism]]) are masculine. Others are more variable, sometimes depending on the region in which the language is spoken; and some endings are not restricted to one gender, e.g. {{lang|de|-er}} ([[agent noun|-er]]), e.g. {{lang|de|Feier}} (feminine), celebration, party, {{lang|de|Arbeiter}} (masculine), labourer, and {{lang|de|Gewitter}} (neuter), thunderstorm.\n* two numbers: singular and plural.\n\nThis degree of inflection is considerably less than in [[Old High German]] and other old [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], and it is also somewhat less than, for instance, [[Old English]], modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] or [[Russian language|Russian]]. The three genders have collapsed in the plural. With four cases and three genders plus plural, there are 16 permutations of case and gender/number of the article (not the nouns), but there are only six forms of the [[article (grammar)|definite article]], which together cover all 16 permutations. In nouns, inflection for case is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns only in the genitive and in the dative (only in fixed or archaic expression), and even this is losing ground to substitutes in informal speech.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barbour|first1=Stephen|last2=Stevenson|first2=Patrick|title=Variation in German|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-35704-3|pages=160\u2013163}}</ref> The singular dative noun ending is considered archaic or at least old-fashioned in almost all contexts and is almost always dropped even in writing, except in poetry, songs, proverbs and other petrified forms. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular. Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular. The plural has an inflection for the dative. In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: {{lang|de|-s, -es, -n, -ns, -en, -ens, -e}}.\n\nIn German orthography, nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised to make it easier for readers to determine the function of a word within a sentence ({{lang|de|Am Freitag ging ich einkaufen.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"On Friday I went shopping.\"; {{lang|de|Eines Tages kreuzte er endlich auf.}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"One day he finally showed up.\") This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related [[Luxembourgish language]] and several insular dialects of the [[North Frisian language]]), but it was historically common in other languages such as Danish (which abolished the capitalization of nouns in 1948) and English.\n\nLike the other Germanic languages, German forms noun [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] in which the first noun modifies the category given by the second: {{lang|de|Hundeh\u00fctte}} (\"dog hut\"; specifically: \"dog kennel\"). Unlike English, whose newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written \"open\" with separating spaces, German (like some other Germanic languages) nearly always uses the \"closed\" form without spaces, for example: {{lang|de|Baumhaus}} (\"tree house\"). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds in theory (see also [[English compounds]]). The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is {{lang|de|[[Rinderkennzeichnungs- und Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz|Rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz]]}}, which, literally translated, is \"beef labelling supervision duty assignment law\" [from {{lang|de|Rind}} (cattle), {{lang|de|Fleisch}} (meat), {{lang|de|Etikettierung(s)}} (labelling), {{lang|de|\u00dcberwachung(s)}} (supervision), {{lang|de|Aufgaben}} (duties), {{lang|de|\u00dcbertragung(s)}} (assignment), {{lang|de|Gesetz}} (law)]. However, examples like this are perceived by native speakers as excessively bureaucratic, stylistically awkward or even satirical.\n\n=== Verb inflection ===\n{{Main|German verbs}}\n\nThe inflection of standard German verbs includes:\n* two main [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] classes: [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] and [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] (as in English). Additionally, there is a third class, known as mixed verbs, whose conjugation combines features of both the strong and weak patterns.\n* three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second and third.\n* two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular and plural.\n* three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[realis mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (in addition to [[infinitive]])\n* two [[voice (grammar)|voices]]: active and passive. The passive voice uses auxiliary verbs and is divisible into static and dynamic. Static forms show a constant state and use the verb \u2019\u2019to be\u2019\u2019 (sein). Dynamic forms show an action and use the verb \u201cto become\u2019\u2019 (werden).\n* two [[grammatical tense|tenses]] without auxiliary verbs ([[present tense|present]] and [[preterite]]) and four tenses constructed with auxiliary verbs ([[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[pluperfect]], [[future tense|future]] and [[future perfect]]).\n* the distinction between [[grammatical aspect]]s is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and/or preterite marking so the plain indicative voice uses neither of those two markers; the subjunctive by itself conveys secondhand information{{clarify|date=September 2012}}; subjunctive plus preterite marks the conditional state; and the preterite alone shows either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either second-hand-information or the conditional state of the verb, when necessary for clarity.\n* the distinction between perfect and [[continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]] is and has, at every stage of development, been a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but, strangely enough, it is now rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.\n* disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (''{{wiktde|blicken}}'' [to look], ''{{wiktde|erblicken}}'' [to see&nbsp;\u2013 unrelated form: {{wiktde|sehen}}]).\n\n==== Verb prefixes ====\nThe meaning of basic verbs can be expanded and sometimes radically changed through the use of a number of prefixes. Some prefixes have a specific meaning; the prefix '''{{lang|de|zer-}}''' refers to destruction, as in {{lang|de|'''zer'''rei\u00dfen}} (to tear apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''brechen}} (to break apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''schneiden}} (to cut apart). Other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves; '''{{lang|de|ver-}}''' is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings, as in {{lang|de|'''ver'''suchen}} (to try) from {{lang|de|suchen}} (to seek), {{lang|de|'''ver'''nehmen}} (to interrogate) from {{lang|de|nehmen}} (to take), {{lang|de|'''ver'''teilen}} (to distribute) from {{lang|de|teilen}} (to share), {{lang|de|'''ver'''stehen}} (to understand) from {{lang|de|stehen}} (to stand).\n\nOther examples include the following:\n{{lang|de|haften}} (to stick), {{lang|de|'''ver'''haften}} (to detain); {{lang|de|kaufen}} (to buy), {{lang|de|'''ver'''kaufen}} (to sell); {{lang|de|h\u00f6ren}} (to hear), {{lang|de|'''auf'''h\u00f6ren}} (to cease); {{lang|de|fahren}} (to drive), {{lang|de|'''er'''fahren}} (to experience).\n\nMany [[German verbs]] have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function. In [[finite verb]] forms, it is split off and moved to the end of the clause and is hence considered by some to be a \"resultative particle\". For example, {{lang|de|mitgehen}}, meaning \"to go along\", would be split, giving {{lang|de|Gehen Sie mit?}} (Literal: \"Go you with?\"; Idiomatic: \"Are you going along?\").\n\nIndeed, several [[parenthetical referencing|parenthetical]] clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement (ankommen = to arrive, er kam an = he arrived, er ist angekommen = he has arrived):\n: {{lang|de|Er '''kam''' am Freitagabend nach einem harten Arbeitstag und dem \u00fcblichen \u00c4rger, der ihn schon seit Jahren immer wieder an seinem Arbeitsplatz plagt, mit fraglicher Freude auf ein Mahl, das seine Frau ihm, wie er hoffte, bereits aufgetischt hatte, endlich zu Hause '''an'''.}}\nA selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this:\n: He \"came\" on Friday evening, after a hard day at work and the usual annoyances that had time and again been troubling him for years now at his workplace, with questionable joy, to a meal which, as he hoped, his wife had already put on the table, finally at home \"on\".\n\n=== Word order ===\nGerman word order is generally with the [[V2 word order]] restriction and also with the [[SOV word order]] restriction for main [[clause]]s. For [[polar questions]], exclamations and wishes, the [[finite verb]] always has the first position. In subordinate clauses, the verb occurs at the very end.\n\nGerman requires for a verbal element (main verb or [[auxiliary verb]]) to appear [[V2 word order|second in the sentence]]. The verb is preceded by the [[topic\u2013comment|topic]] of the sentence. The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence. For a sentence without an auxiliary, these are some possibilities:\n\n: {{lang|de|Der alte Mann gab mir gestern das Buch.}} (The old man gave me yesterday the book; normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir gestern der alte Mann.}} (The book gave [to] me yesterday the old man)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab der alte Mann mir gestern.}} (The book gave the old man [to] me yesterday)\n: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir der alte Mann gestern.}} (The book gave [to] me the old man yesterday)\n\n: {{lang|de|Gestern gab mir der alte Mann das Buch.}} (Yesterday gave [to] me the old man the book, normal order)\n: {{lang|de|Mir gab der alte Mann das Buch gestern.}} ([To] me gave the old man the book yesterday (entailing: as for you, it was another date))\n\nThe position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject, an object or another argument. In a [[sentence (linguistics)|declarative sentence]] in English, if the subject does not occur before the predicate, the sentence could well be misunderstood.\n\nHowever, German's flexible word order allows one to emphasise specific words:\n\nNormal word order:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n\nObject in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro betrat der Direktor gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: His office entered the manager yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand.\n: The object {{lang|de|Sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) is thus highlighted; it could be the topic of the next sentence.\n\nAdverb of time in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern betrat der Direktor um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro. (aber heute ohne Schirm)}}\n:: Yesterday entered the manager at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office. (but today without umbrella)\n\nBoth time expressions in front:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein B\u00fcro}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock entered the manager with an umbrella in the hand his office.\n: The full-time specification {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr}} is highlighted.\n\nAnother possibility:\n:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand}}.\n:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock the manager entered his office with an umbrella in the hand.\n: Both the time specification and the fact he carried an umbrella are accentuated.\n\nSwapped adverbs:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat mit einem Schirm in der Hand gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro.}}\n:: The manager entered with an umbrella in the hand yesterday at 10 o'clock his office.\n: The phrase {{lang|de|mit einem Schirm in der Hand}} is highlighted.\n\nSwapped object:\n:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr sein B\u00fcro mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}\n:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock his office with an umbrella in his hand.\n: The time specification and the object {{lang|de|sein B\u00fcro}} (his office) are lightly accentuated.\n\nThe flexible word order also allows one to use language \"tools\" (such as [[poetic meter]] and [[figures of speech]]) more freely.\n\n==== Auxiliary verbs ====\nWhen an [[auxiliary verb]] is present, it appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end. This occurs notably in the creation of the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect tense]]. Many word orders are still possible:\n\n:{{lang|de|Der alte Mann hat mir heute das Buch gegeben.}} (The old man has me today the book given.)\n:{{lang|de|Das Buch hat der alte Mann mir heute gegeben.}} ('''''The book''''' has the old man me today given.)\n:{{lang|de|Heute hat der alte Mann mir das Buch gegeben.}} ('''''Today''''' has the old man me the book given.)\n\nThe main verb may appear in first position to put stress on the action itself. The [[auxiliary verb]] is still in second position.\n\n:{{lang|de|Gegeben hat mir der alte Mann das Buch heute.}} ('''''Given''''' has me the old man the book ''''today''''.) The bare fact that the book has been given is emphasized, as well as 'today'.\n\n==== Modal verbs ====\nSentences using [[modal verb]]s place the infinitive at the end. For example, the English sentence \"Should he go home?\" would be rearranged in German to say \"Should he (to) home go?\" ({{lang|de|Soll er nach Hause gehen?}}). Thus, in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses, the infinitives are clustered at the end. Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following (highly contrived) English sentence: \"What did you bring that book that I do not like to be read to out of up for?\"\n\n==== Multiple infinitives ====\nGerman subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end. Given that auxiliaries encode [[future]], [[passive voice|passive]], [[modality (semiotics)|modality]], and the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence can occur. In these constructions, the past participle in {{lang|de|ge-}} is often replaced by the infinitive.\n\n: ''{{lang|de|Man nimmt an, dass der Deserteur wohl erschossen}}<sub>V</sub> {{lang|de|worden}}<sub>psv</sub> {{lang|de|sein}}<sub>perf</sub> {{lang|de|soll}}<sub>mod</sub>''\n: One suspects that the deserter probably shot become be should.\n: (\"It is suspected that the deserter probably had been shot\")\n\n:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschl\u00fcssel hatte machen lassen}}\n:: He knew not that the agent a picklock had make let\n\n:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschl\u00fcssel machen lassen hatte}}\n:: He knew not that the agent a picklock make let had\n: (\"He did not know that the agent had had a picklock made\")\n\nThe order at the end of such strings is subject to variation, but the latter version is unusual.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Duden 25Auflage.JPG|upright|thumb|Volume 1\u2013\"German Spelling\"\u2013of the 25 edition of the ''[[Duden]]'' dictionary.]]\n\nMost German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.<ref name=\"Leao2011\"/> However, there is a significant amount of loanwords from other languages, in particular from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], French, and, most recently, English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~deutsch/Grammatik/Wortbildung/Fremdwoerter.html|title=Foreign Words (Fremdw\u00f6rter)|website=www.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> In the early 19th century, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]] estimated that one fifth of the total German vocabulary was of French or Latin origin.<ref>Uwe P\u00f6rksen, German Academy for Language and Literature\u2019s Jahrbuch [Yearbook] 2007 (Wallstein Verlag, G\u00f6ttingen 2008, pp. 121\u2013130)</ref>\n\nLatin words were already imported into the predecessor of the German language during the [[Roman Empire]] and underwent all the characteristic phonetic changes in German. Their origin is thus no longer recognizable for most speakers (e.g. {{lang|de|Pforte}}, {{lang|de|Tafel}}, {{lang|de|Mauer}}, {{lang|de|K\u00e4se}}, {{lang|de|K\u00f6ln}} from Latin {{lang|la|porta}}, {{lang|la|tabula}}, {{lang|la|murus}}, {{lang|la|caseus}}, {{lang|la|Colonia}}). Borrowing from Latin continued after the fall of the Roman Empire during Christianization, mediated by the church and monasteries. Another important influx of Latin words can be observed during [[Renaissance humanism]]. In a scholarly context, the borrowings from Latin have continued until today, in the last few decades often indirectly through borrowings from English. During the 15th to 17th centuries, the influence of Italian was great, leading to many Italian loanwords in the fields of architecture, finance, and music. The influence of the French language in the 17th to 19th centuries resulted in an even greater import of French words. The English influence was already present in the 19th century, but it did not become dominant until the second half of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:OeWB 42Aufl.jpg|left|thumb|42nd edition of the {{lang|de|[[\u00d6sterreichisches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}} (\"Austrian Dictionary\").]]\n\nThus, [[Notker Labeo]] was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000.{{sfn|Hattemer|1849|p=5}} The tradition of loan translation was revitalized in the 18th century, with linguists like [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], who introduced close to 300 words that are still used in modern German.

Schraegschrift.jpg|right|thumb|[[German alphabet]], one of Austria's elementary school handwriting programs]]\n[[File:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift.png|thumb|[[German alphabet]], elementary school handwriting program in some West German states]]\n\nGerman is written in the [[Latin alphabet]]. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|Umlaut]], namely ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'', as well as the eszett or {{lang|de|[[scharfes s]]}} (sharp s): ''[[\u00df]]''. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, ''ss'' is used instead of ''\u00df''. Since ''\u00df'' can never occur at the beginning of a word, it has no traditional [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]].\n\nWritten texts in German are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] and certain [[German orthography|orthographical]] features&nbsp;\u2013 German is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns, a relic of a widespread practice in Northern Europe in the early modern era (including English for a while, in the 1700s)&nbsp;\u2013 and the frequent occurrence of long compounds. Because legibility and convenience set certain boundaries, compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts. (In contrast, although English can also string nouns together, it usually separates the nouns with spaces. For example, \"toilet bowl cleaner\".)\n\n=== Present ===\nBefore the [[German orthography reform of 1996]], ''\u00df'' replaced ''ss'' after [[vowel length|long vowels]] and [[diphthong]]s and before consonants, word-, or partial-word-endings. In reformed spelling, ''\u00df'' replaces ''ss'' only after long vowels and diphthongs.\n\nSince there is no traditional capital form of ''\u00df'', it was replaced by ''SS'' when capitalization was required. For example, {{lang|de|Ma\u00dfband}} (tape measure) became {{lang|de|MASSBAND}} in capitals. An exception was the use of \u00df in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names. To avoid confusion with similar names, lower case ''\u00df'' was maintained (so, \"{{lang|de|KRE\u00dfLEIN}}\" instead of \"{{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}\"). [[Capital \u00df]] (\u1e9e) was ultimately adopted into German orthography in 2017, ending a long orthographic debate (So, \"{{lang|de|KRE\u1e9eLEIN}} and {{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1033265/germanys-century-long-debate-over-a-missing-letter-in-its-alphabet|title=Germany has ended a century-long debate over a missing letter in its alphabet|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|language=English|accessdate=5 December 2017|quote=According to the council\u2019s 2017 spelling manual: When writing the uppercase [of \u00df], write SS. It\u2019s also possible to use the uppercase \u1e9e. Example: Stra\u00dfe \u2014 STRASSE \u2014 STRA\u1e9eE.}}</ref>\n\nUmlaut vowels (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) are commonly transcribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard or other medium used. In the same manner \u00df can be transcribed as ss. Some [[operating systems]] use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include, amongst other things, umlauts; in [[Microsoft Windows]] this is done using [[Alt codes]]. German readers understand these transcriptions (although they appear unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are a makeshift, not proper spelling. (In Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g. ''Raesfeld'' {{IPA-de|\u02c8ra\u02d0sf\u025blt|}}, ''Coesfeld'' {{IPA|[\u02c8ko\u02d0sf\u025blt]}} and ''Itzehoe'' {{IPA|[\u026ats\u0259\u02c8ho\u02d0]}}, but this use of the letter e after a/o/u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than [[proper noun]]s.)\n\n{{Listen\n|filename = German alphabet-2.ogg\n|title = German alphabet\n|description = (Listen to a German speaker recite the alphabet in German)\n}}\n\nThere is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence. Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e. Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel, but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts. As an example in a [[telephone directory|telephone book]] {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} occurs after {{lang|de|Adressenverlage}} but before {{lang|de|Anlagenbauer}} (because \u00c4 is replaced by Ae). In a dictionary {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} comes after {{lang|de|Arzt}}, but in some dictionaries {{lang|de|\u00c4rzte}} and all other words starting with ''\u00c4'' may occur after all words starting with ''A''. In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial ''Sch'' and ''St'' are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after ''S'', but they are usually treated as S+C+H and S+T.\n\nWritten German also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma ([[quotation mark]]) as in {{lang|de|\u201eGuten Morgen!\u201c}}.\n\n=== Past ===\n[[File:Fraktur-ru.jpg|thumb|A Russian dictionary from 1931, showing the \"German alphabet\"&nbsp;\u2013 the 3rd and 4th columns of each half are [[Fraktur]] and [[Kurrent]] respectively, with the footnote explaining [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] used in Fraktur.]]\n{{Further|2nd Orthographic Conference (German)|Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|German orthography reform of 1944}}\nUntil the early 20th century, German was mostly printed in [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s (mostly in [[Fraktur]], but also in [[Schwabacher]]) and written in corresponding [[penmanship|handwriting]] (for example [[Kurrent]] and [[S\u00fctterlin]]). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or [[sans-serif]] [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces used today, and the handwritten forms in particular are difficult for the untrained to read. The printed forms, however, were claimed by some to be more readable when used for [[Germanic languages]].<ref>Adolf Reinecke, {{lang|de|Die deutsche Buchstabenschrift: ihre Entstehung und Entwicklung, ihre Zweckm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit und v\u00f6lkische Bedeutung}}, Leipzig, Hasert, 1910</ref> (Often, foreign names in a text were printed in an Antiqua typeface even though the rest of the text was in Fraktur.) The [[Nazism|Nazis]] initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher because they were considered [[Aryan]], but they abolished them in 1941, claiming that these letters were Jewish.<ref>[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]<br />\nThe memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.<br />\"For general attention, on behalf of the F\u00fchrer, I make the following announcement:<br />It is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.<br />Today the F\u00fchrer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf M\u00fcller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools.<br />The use of the Schwabach Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.<br />On behalf of the F\u00fchrer, Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script\".</ref> It is also believed that the Nazi r\u00e9gime had banned this script as they realized that Fraktur would inhibit communication in the territories occupied during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Albert |last=Kapr |title=Fraktur: Form und Geschichte der gebrochenen Schriften |location=Mainz |publisher=H. Schmidt |year=1993 |page=81 |isbn=978-3-87439-260-0 }}</ref>\n\nThe Fraktur script however remains present in everyday life in pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and antiquity.\n\nA proper use of the [[long s]], ({{lang|de|langes s}}), [[long s|\u017f]], is essential for writing German text in [[Fraktur]] typefaces. Many [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces include the [[long s]] also. A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting. Any lower case \"s\" at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s, as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words {{lang|de|Wach\u017ftube}} (guard-house) and {{lang|de|Wachstube}} (tube of polish/wax). One can easily decide which \"s\" to use by appropriate hyphenation, ({{lang|de|Wach-\u017ftube}} vs. {{lang|de|Wachs-tube}}). The long s only appears in [[lower case]].\n\n=== Reform of 1996 ===\n{{Main|German orthography reform of 1996}}\n\nThe orthography reform of 1996 led to public controversy and considerable dispute. The states ({{lang|de|Bundesl\u00e4nder}}) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Bavaria]] would not accept it. The dispute landed at one point in the highest court, which made a short issue of it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule&nbsp;\u2013 everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it. After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major revision was installed in 2006, just in time for the coming school year. In 2007, some traditional spellings were finally invalidated, whereas in 2008, on the other hand, many of the old [[comma]] rules were again put in force.\n\nThe most noticeable change was probably in the use of the letter ''\u00df'', called {{lang|de|scharfes s}} (''Sharp S'') or {{lang|de|ess-zett}} (pronounced ''ess-tsett''). Traditionally, this letter was used in three situations:\n\n# After a long vowel or vowel combination,\n# Before a ''t'', and\n# At the end of a syllable\n\nThus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|pa\u00dft}}, and {{lang|de|da\u00df}}. Currently only the first rule is in effect, thus {{lang|de|F\u00fc\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|passt}}, and {{lang|de|dass}}. The word {{lang|de|Fu\u00df}} 'foot' has the letter ''\u00df'' because it contains a long vowel, even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable. The logic of this change is that an '\u00df' is a single letter whereas 'ss' obviously are two letters, so the same distinction applies as for instance between the words {{lang|de|den}} and {{lang|de|denn}}.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|German phonology}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\n[[File:De-Faust - Der Trag\u00f6die erster Teil-Prolog und Auf dem Theater-wikisource.ogg|thumb|Spoken German in [[Goethe's Faust]]]]\n\nIn German, vowels (excluding diphthongs; see below) are either ''short'' or ''long'', as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! A !! \u00c4 !! E !! I !! O !! \u00d6 !! U !! \u00dc\n|-\n! short\n| {{IPA|/a/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/, /\u0259/}} || {{IPA|/\u026a/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254/}} || {{IPA|/\u0153/}} || {{IPA|/\u028a/}} || {{IPA|/\u028f/}}\n|-\n! long\n| {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/, /e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}\n|}\nShort {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is realized as {{IPA|[\u025b]}} in stressed syllables (including [[secondary stress]]), but as {{IPA|[\u0259]}} in unstressed syllables. Note that stressed short {{IPA|/\u025b/}} can be spelled either with ''e'' or with ''\u00e4'' (for instance, {{lang|de|h\u00e4tte}} \"would have\" and {{lang|de|Kette}} \"chain\" rhyme). In general, the short vowels are open and the long vowels are close. The one exception is the open {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} sound of long ''\u00c4''; in some varieties of standard German, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} have merged into {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}, removing this anomaly. In that case, pairs like {{lang|de|B\u00e4ren/Beeren}} 'bears/berries' or {{lang|de|\u00c4hre/Ehre}} 'spike (of wheat)/honour' become homophonous (see: [[Captain Bluebear]]).\n\nIn many varieties of standard German, an unstressed {{IPA|/\u025br/}} is not pronounced {{IPA|[\u0259r]}}, but vocalised to {{IPA|[\u0250]}}.\n\nWhether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable, although the following regularities exist:\n* If a vowel (other than ''i'') is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant, it is usually pronounced long (e.g. {{lang|de|Hof}} {{IPA|[ho\u02d0f]}}).\n* If a vowel is followed by ''h'' or if an ''i'' is followed by an ''e'', it is long.\n* If the vowel is followed by a double consonant (e.g. ''ff'', ''ss'' or ''tt''), ''ck'', ''tz'' or a [[consonant cluster]] (e.g. ''st'' or ''nd''), it is nearly always short (e.g. {{lang|de|hoffen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0254f\u0259n]}}). Double consonants are used only for this function of marking preceding vowels as short; the consonant itself is never pronounced lengthened or doubled, in other words this is not a [[feeding order]] of [[gemination]] and then [[vowel shortening]].\nBoth of these rules have exceptions (e.g. {{lang|de|hat}} {{IPA|[hat]}} \"has\" is short despite the first rule; {{lang|de|Mond}} {{IPA|[mo\u02d0nt]}}, \"[[moon]]\" is long despite the second rule). For an ''i'' that is neither in the combination ''ie'' (making it long) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster (making it short), there is no general rule. In some cases, there are regional differences: In central Germany ([[Hessen]]), the ''o'' in the [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper name]] \"Hoffmann\" is pronounced long, whereas most other Germans would pronounce it short; the same applies to the ''e'' in the geographical name \"[[Mecklenburg]]\" for people in that region. The word {{lang|de|St\u00e4dte}} \"cities\", is pronounced with a short vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025bt\u0259]}} by some ([[Jan Hofer]], [[Das Erste|ARD Television]]) and with a long vowel {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283t\u025b\u02d0t\u0259]}} by others ([[Marietta Slomka]], [[ZDF]] Television). Finally, a vowel followed by ''ch'' can be short ({{lang|de|Fach}} {{IPA|[fax]}} \"compartment\", {{lang|de|K\u00fcche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u028f\u00e7\u0259]}} \"kitchen\") or long ({{lang|de|Suche}} {{IPA|[\u02c8zu\u02d0x\u0259]}} \"search\", {{lang|de|B\u00fccher}} {{IPA|[\u02c8by\u02d0\u00e7\u0250]}} \"books\") almost at random. Thus, {{lang|de|Lache}} is homographous between {{IPA|[la\u02d0x\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"puddle\" and {{IPA|[lax\u0259]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} \"manner of laughing\" (colloquial) or {{lang|de|lache!}} \"laugh!\" (imperative).\n\nGerman vowels can form the following digraphs (in writing) and diphthongs (in pronunciation); note that the pronunciation of some of them (ei, \u00e4u, eu) is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! spelling\n| ai, ei, ay, ey || au || \u00e4u, eu\n|-\n! pronunciation\n| {{IPA|/a\u026a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/a\u028a\u032f/}} || {{IPA|/\u0254\u028f\u032f/}}\n|}\nAdditionally, the digraph ''ie'' generally represents the phoneme {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, which is not a diphthong. In many varieties, an {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable is vocalised. However, a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised {{IPA|/r/}} is not a phonemic diphthong: {{lang|de|B\u00e4r}} {{IPA|[b\u025b\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"bear\", {{lang|de|er}} {{IPA|[e\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"he\", {{lang|de|wir}} {{IPA|[vi\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"we\", {{lang|de|Tor}} {{IPA|[to\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}} \"gate\", {{lang|de|kurz}} {{IPA|[k\u028a\u0250\u032fts]}} \"short\", {{lang|de|W\u00f6rter}} {{IPA|[v\u0153\u0250\u032ft\u0250]}} \"words\".\n\nIn most varieties of standard German, syllables that begin with a vowel are preceded by a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nWith approximately 26 phonemes, the German consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages.

In the [[syllable coda]], the allophone {{IPA|[\u0250]}} is found in many varieties.\n* <sup>3</sup> The voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] except when preceded by a [[sibilant]], exactly as in English.\n* <sup>4</sup>{{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} and {{IPA|/\u0292/}} occur only in words of foreign (usually English or French) origin.\n* Where a stressed syllable has an initial vowel, it is preceded by {{IPA|[\u0294]}}. As its presence is predictable from context, {{IPA|[\u0294]}} is not considered a phoneme.\n\n==== Consonant spellings ====\n* '''c''' standing by itself is not a German letter. In borrowed words, it is usually pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (before \u00e4, \u00e4u, e, i, \u00f6, \u00fc, y) or {{IPA|[k]}} (before a, o, u, and consonants). The combination '''ck''' is, as in English, used to indicate that the preceding vowel is short.\n* '''ch''' occurs often and is pronounced either {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} (after \u00e4, ai, \u00e4u, e, ei, eu, i, \u00f6, \u00fc and consonants; in the diminutive suffix {{lang|de|-chen}}; and at the beginning of a word), {{IPA|[x]}} (after a, au, o, u), or {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginning of a word before a, o, u and consonants. '''Ch''' never occurs at the beginning of an originally German word. In borrowed words with initial Ch before front vowels ({{lang|de|Chemie}} \"chemistry\" etc.), {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} is considered standard. However, Upper Germans and Franconians (in the geographical sense) replace it with {{IPA|[k]}}, as German as a whole does before darker vowels and consonants such as in {{lang|de|Charakter}}, {{lang|de|Christentum}}. Middle Germans (except Franconians) will borrow a {{IPA|[\u0283]}} from the French model. Both agree in considering each other's variant,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and Upper Germans also the standard in {{IPA|[\u00e7]}}, as particularly awkward and unusual.\n* '''dsch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0292]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Dschungel}} {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0361\u0292\u028a\u014b\u0259l/}} \"jungle\") but appears in a few [[loanwords]] only.\n* '''f''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} as in \"''f''ather\".\n* '''h''' is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} as in \"''h''ome\" at the beginning of a syllable. After a vowel it is silent and only lengthens the vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|Reh}} {{IPA|[\u0281e\u02d0]}} = [[roe deer]]).\n* '''j''' is pronounced {{IPA|[j]}} in Germanic words ({{lang|de|Jahr}} {{IPA|[ja\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}) (like \"y\" in \"year\"). In recent loanwords, it follows more or less the respective languages' pronunciations.\n* '''l''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[l]}}, never {{IPA|*[\u026b]}} (the English \"[[dark L]]\").\n* '''q''' only exists in combination with '''u''' and is pronounced {{IPA|[kv]}}. It appears in both Germanic and Latin words ({{lang|de|quer}} {{IPA|[kve\u02d0\u0250\u032f]}}; {{lang|de|Qualit\u00e4t}} {{IPA|[kvali\u02c8t\u025b\u02d0t]}}). But as most words containing q are Latinate, the letter is considerably rarer in German than it is in English.\n* '''r''' is usually pronounced in a [[guttural R|guttural]] fashion (a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0281]}} or [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[\u0280]}}) in front of a vowel or consonant ({{lang|de|Rasen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0281a\u02d0z\u0259n]}}; {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0281k]}}). In spoken German, however, it is commonly vocalised after a vowel ({{lang|de|er}} being pronounced rather like {{IPA|[\u02c8\u025b\u0250\u032f]}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[b\u028a\u0250\u032fk]}}). In some varieties, the '''r''' is pronounced as a \"tongue-tip\" ''r'' (the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}).\n* '''s''' in German is pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} (as in \"''z''ebra\") if it forms the [[syllable onset]] (e.g. {{lang|de|Sohn}} {{IPA|[zo\u02d0n]}}), otherwise {{IPA|[s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Bus}} {{IPA|[b\u028as]}}). In Austria, Switzerland, and Southern Germany, {{IPA|[s]}} occurs at syllable onset as well. A '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} indicates that the preceding vowel is short. '''st''' and '''sp''' at the beginning of words of German origin are pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283t]}} and {{IPA|[\u0283p]}}, respectively.\n* '''\u00df''' (a letter unique to German called {{lang|de|scharfes S}} or {{lang|de|[[\u00df|Eszett]]}}) is a ligature of a [[Long S|long s (\u017f)]] ''and'' a [[tailed z|tailed z (\u0292)]] and is always pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}. Originating in [[Blackletter]] typeface, it traditionally replaced '''ss''' at the end of a syllable (e.g. {{lang|de|ich muss}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}}; {{lang|de|ich m\u00fcsste}} \u2192 {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}}); within a word it contrasts with '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} in indicating that the preceding vowel is long (compare {{lang|de|in Ma\u00dfen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8ma\u02d0s\u0259n]}} \"with moderation\" and {{lang|de|in Massen}} {{IPA|[\u026an \u02c8mas\u0259n]}} \"in loads\"). The use of '''\u00df''' has recently been limited by the latest German spelling reform and is no longer used for '''ss''' after a short vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|ich mu\u00df}} and {{lang|de|ich m\u00fc\u00dfte}} were always pronounced with a short U/\u00dc); Switzerland and Liechtenstein already abolished it in 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mittelschulvorbereitung.ch/index.php?SUBJECT=&actualid=5 |title=Mittelschulvorbereitung Deutsch |publisher=Mittelschulvorbereitung.ch |date= |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>\n* '''sch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (like \"sh\" in \"shine\").\n* '''tion''' in Latin loanwords is pronounced {{IPA|[tsi\u032fo\u02d0n]}}.\n* '''th''' is found, rarely, in loanwords and is pronounced {{IPA|[t]}} if the loanword is from Greek, and usually as in the original if the loanword is from English (though some, mostly older, speakers tend to replace the English th-sound with {{IPA|[s]}}).\n* '''v''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} in a limited number of words of Germanic origin, such as {{lang|de|Vater}} {{IPA|[\u02c8fa\u02d0t\u0250]}}, {{lang|de|Vogel}} \"bird\", {{lang|de|von}} \"from, of\", {{lang|de|vor}} \"before, in front of\", {{lang|de|voll}} \"full\" and the prefix {{lang|de|ver-}}. It is also used in loanwords, where it is normally pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}. This pronunciation is common in words like {{lang|de|Vase}}, {{lang|de|Vikar}}, {{lang|de|Viktor}}, {{lang|de|Viper}}, {{lang|de|Ventil}}, {{lang|de|vulg\u00e4r}}, and English loanwords; however, pronunciation is {{IPA|[f]}} by some people in some in the very south. The only non-German word in which \"v\" is always pronounced \"f\" is {{lang|de|Eva}} (Eve).\n* '''w''' is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}} as in \"''v''acation\" (e.g. {{lang|de|was}} {{IPA|[vas]}}).\n* '''y''' is pronounced as {{IPA|[y]}} when long, and {{IPA|[\u028f]}} when short (as in {{lang|de|Hygiene}} {{IPA|[hy\u0261i\u032f\u02c8e\u02d0n\u0259]}} ; {{lang|de|Labyrinth}} {{IPA|[laby\u02c8\u0281\u026ant]}} or {{lang|de|Gymnasium}} {{IPA|/\u0261\u028fm\u02c8na\u02d0zi\u032f\u028am/}}), except in ''ay'' and ''ey'' which are both pronounced {{IPA|[a\u026a\u032f]}}. It is also often used in loanwords and pronounced like in the original language like in ''Style'' or ''Recycling''.\n* '''z''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|zog}} {{IPA|[t\u0361so\u02d0k]}}), except in loanwords. A '''tz''' indicates that the preceding vowel is short.\n\n==== Consonant shifts ====\n{{details|High German consonant shift}}\n\nGerman does not have any [[dental fricative]]s (as English '''th'''). The '''th''' sounds, which the English language still has, disappeared on the continent in German with the consonant shifts between the 8th and the 10th centuries.<ref>For a history of the German consonants see {{harvp|Cercignani|1979}}.</ref> It is sometimes possible to find parallels between English and German by replacing the English '''th''' with '''d''' in German: \"Thank\" \u2192 in German {{lang|de|Dank}}, \"this\" and \"that\" \u2192 {{lang|de|dies}} and {{lang|de|das}}, \"[[thou]]\" (old 2nd person singular pronoun) \u2192 {{lang|de|du}}, \"think\" \u2192 {{lang|de|denken}}, \"thirsty\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durstig}} and many other examples.\n\nLikewise, the '''gh''' in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] English words, pronounced in several different ways in modern English (as an '''f''', or not at all), can often be linked to German '''ch''': \"to laugh\" \u2192 {{lang|de|lachen}}, \"through\" \u2192 {{lang|de|durch}}, \"high\" \u2192 {{lang|de|hoch}}, \"naught\" \u2192 {{lang|de|nichts}}, \"light\" \u2192 {{lang|de|leicht}} or {{lang|de|Licht}}, \"sight\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Sicht}}, \"daughter\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Tochter}}, \"neighbour\" \u2192 {{lang|de|Nachbar}}.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|German literature}}\n\nThe German language is used in German literature and can be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most notable authors of the period being [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]].\nThe {{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}}, whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch. The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nReformer and theologian [[Martin Luther]], who was the first to translate the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most well known poets and authors in German are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]. Fourteen German-speaking people have won the [[Nobel Prize in literature]]: [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]], [[Paul von Heyse]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Carl Spitteler]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Nelly Sachs]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]], [[Elias Canetti]], [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Herta M\u00fcller]] and [[Peter Handke]], making it the second most awarded linguistic region (together with French) after English.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"align:center;\"\n!

{"title_page": "Articulatory gestures", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=August 2013}}\n{{original research|date=August 2013}}\n\n'''Articulatory gestures''' are the actions necessary to enunciate language.   Examples of articulatory gestures are the hand movements necessary to enunciate sign language and the mouth movements of speech.   In [[semiotic]] terms, they are the physical embodiment (signifiers) of speech signs, which are gestural by nature (see below).\n\nThe definition of ''[[gesture]]'' varies greatly, but here it will be taken in its widest sense, namely, any meaningful action.   An intentional action is meaningful if it is not strictly utilitarian: for example, sending flowers to a friend is a gesture, because this action is performed not only for the purpose of moving flowers from one place to another, but also to express some sentiment or even a conventional message in the [[language of flowers]].  Use of the broadest definition of gesture (not restricted to hand movements) allows [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]]\u2019s  \u201crapid fading\u201d [[design features of language | design feature of human language]] to be accommodated as a type of sign in semiotic theory.\n\nBut if an articulatory gesture is to be considered a true gesture in the above sense, it must be meaningful.   Therefore, an articulatory gesture must be at least as large as the smallest meaningful unit of language, the morpheme.  A morpheme corresponds roughly to a spoken word or a sign language gesture.   \n\nThis definition differs from the practice, common among linguists,  of referring to phonemes (meaningless mouth movements) as articulatory gestures (see [[articulatory phonology]]).   In [[semiotics]], meaningless components of spoken gestures (written as individual letters), or meaningless components of sign language gestures (such as location of hand contact) are known as [[figurae]], the constituents of signs.    \n\nIt also differs from the tradition of considering speech sounds to be the signifiers of speech signs.  But this practice confuses signals with symbols.  Sound and light are analogue signals, whereas mouth and hand gestures are discrete symbolic entities.  A sound or light signal is subject to random noise, whereas the image of the gesture is subject to regular [[image distortion | distortion]], as when a signer's hand is viewed from different angles. In speech, the sound of the contact of the tongue in the letter T can be distorted by surrounding mouth movements, as in the phrase \u201cperfect memory\u201d.  When pronounced at conversational speed, the sound of the tongue contact is completely obscured by surrounding consonants even though this T movement is fully carried out.\n\nArticulatory gestures, when seen as the physical embodiment of speech and sign language symbols, provide a link between these two language types, and show how speech resembles sign language more closely than is generally presumed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Language production]]\n*[[Linguistic performance]]\n\n==References and further reading==\n<references/>\n* Eccardt, Thomas.

[[lamella (mycology)|lamella]]) on the underside of the cap. \"Mushroom\" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some [[Ascomycota]]. These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.\n\nForms deviating from the standard [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] usually have more specific names, such as \"[[bolete]]\", \"[[puffball]]\", \"[[stinkhorn]]\", and \"[[morel]]\", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called \"[[agaric]]s\" in reference to their similarity to ''[[Agaricus]]'' or their order [[Agaricales]]. By extension, the term \"mushroom\" can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]] (called a [[mycelium]]) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms, or the species itself.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Zwerg Postkarte 001.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', the most easily recognised \"toadstool\", is frequently depicted in fairy stories and on greeting cards. It is often associated with [[gnome]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mushroom Miscellany |last=Harding |first=Patrick |year=2008 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0-00-728464-1 |page=149}}</ref>]]\nThe terms \"mushroom\" and \"toadstool\" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms ''mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns'' were used.<ref name=\"Ramsbottom1954\" />\n\nThe term \"mushroom\" and its variations may have been derived from the French word ''[[Calocybe gambosa|mousseron]]'' in reference to [[moss]] (''mousse''). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a \"mushroom\" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable.\n\nCultural or [[social phobia]]s of mushrooms and fungi may be related. The term \"fungophobia\" was coined by [[William Delisle Hay]] of [[England]], who noted a national [[superstition]] or fear of \"toadstools\".<ref name=\"Hay\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/elementarytextbo00hayw#page/n5/mode/2up |title=An Elementary Text-Book of British Fungi |last=Hay |first=William Deslisle |year=1887 |publisher=London, S.

In German folklore and old fairy tales, toads are often depicted sitting on toadstool mushrooms and catching, with their tongues, the flies that are said to be drawn to the ''Fliegenpilz'', a German name for the toadstool, meaning \"flies' mushroom\". This is how the mushroom got another of its names, ''Kr\u00f6tenstuhl'' (a less-used German name for the mushroom), literally translating to \"toad-stool\".\n\n==Identification==\n[[File:Mushroom cap morphology2.png|thumb|right|Morphological characteristics of the caps of mushrooms]]\nIdentifying mushrooms requires a basic understanding of their [[macroscopic]] structure. Most are [[Basidiomycetes]] and gilled. Their spores, called [[basidiospore]]s, are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the basidiospores are shot off [[basidia]] and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a [[spore print]], is used to help classify mushrooms and can help to identify them. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.<ref name=\"Dickinson1982\" />\n\nWhile modern identification of mushrooms is quickly becoming molecular, the standard methods for identification are still used by most and have developed into a fine art harking back to [[medieval]] times and the [[Victorian era]], combined with microscopic examination. The presence of juices upon breaking, bruising reactions, odors, tastes, shades of color, habitat, habit, and season are all considered by both amateur and professional mycologists. Tasting and smelling mushrooms carries its own hazards because of poisons and [[allergens]]. Chemical [[Chemical test|tests]] are also used for some genera.<ref>Ammirati ''et al''., 1985, pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn general, identification to [[genus]] can often be accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide. Identification to [[species]], however, requires more effort; one must remember that a mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for the identification of the species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from oozing liquids on [[Lamella (mycology)|lamella]] edges for colored spored prints.\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Sporocarp (fungi)|Basidiocarp|Ascocarp}}\n[[File:Hypomyces lactifluorum 169126.jpg|thumb|A mushroom (probably ''[[Russula brevipes]]'') parasitized by ''[[Hypomyces lactifluorum]]'' resulting in a \"lobster mushroom\".]]\nTypical mushrooms are the fruit bodies of members of the order [[Agaricales]], whose [[type genus]] is ''[[Agaricus]]'' and type species is the field mushroom, ''[[Agaricus campestris]]''. However, in modern [[molecular phylogenetics|molecularly]] defined [[classification (biology)|classifications]], not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class [[Agaricomycetes]]. For example, [[Cantharellus|chanterelles]] are in the [[Cantharellales]], false chanterelles such as ''[[Gomphus (fungus)|Gomphus]]'' are in the [[Gomphales]], [[milk-cap]] mushrooms (''[[Lactarius]]'', ''[[Lactifluus]]'') and russulas (''[[Russula]]''), as well as ''[[Lentinellus]]'', are in the [[Russulales]], while the tough, leathery genera ''[[Lentinus]]'' and ''[[Panus]]'' are among the [[Polyporales]], but ''[[Neolentinus]]'' is in the [[Gloeophyllales]], and the little pin-mushroom genus, ''[[Rickenella]]'', along with similar genera, are in the [[Hymenochaetales]].\n\nWithin the main body of mushrooms, in the Agaricales, are common fungi like the common [[Marasmius oreades|fairy-ring mushroom]], [[shiitake]], [[enoki]], [[oyster mushrooms]], [[fly agaric]]s and other [[Amanita]]s, [[magic mushrooms]] like species of ''[[Psilocybe]]'', [[Volvariella|paddy straw mushrooms]], [[Coprinus comatus|shaggy manes]], etc.\n\nAn atypical mushroom is the [[lobster mushroom]], which is a deformed, cooked-lobster-colored [[parasite|parasitized]] fruitbody of a ''Russula'' or ''Lactarius'', colored and deformed by the mycoparasitic [[Ascomycete]] ''[[Hypomyces lactifluorum]]''.<ref name=\"Volk2001\" />\n\nOther mushrooms are not gilled, so the term \"mushroom\" is loosely used, and giving a full account of their classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath (and are usually called [[bolete]]s), others have spines, such as the [[Hericium erinaceus|hedgehog mushroom]] and other [[tooth fungus|tooth fungi]], and so on. \"Mushroom\" has been used for [[polypore]]s, [[puffball]]s, [[jelly fungi]], [[coral fungi]], [[Bracket fungus|bracket fungi]], [[stinkhorn]]s, and [[cup fungus|cup fungi]]. Thus, the term is more one of common application to [[macroscopic]] fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] meaning. Approximately 14,000 species of mushrooms are described.<ref name=\"Chang2004\" />\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Amanita stirps Hemibapha 45069.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Amanita jacksonii]]'' buttons emerging from their universal veils]]\n[[File:Lactarius indigo 48568.jpg|thumb|The blue [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] of ''[[Lactarius indigo]]'', a [[milk-cap]] mushroom]]\nA mushroom develops from a nodule, or pinhead, less than two millimeters in diameter, called a [[primordium]], which is typically found on or near the surface of the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. It is formed within the [[mycelium]], the mass of threadlike [[hypha]]e that make up the fungus. The primordium enlarges into a roundish structure of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a \"button\". The button has a cottony roll of mycelium, the [[universal veil]], that surrounds the developing fruit body. As the egg expands, the universal veil ruptures and may remain as a cup, or [[volva (mycology)|volva]], at the base of the [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]], or as warts or volval patches on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have either a volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the [[partial veil]], covers the bladelike [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that bear [[spore]]s. As the cap expands, the veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a ring, or [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]], around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the cap. The ring may be skirt-like as in some species of ''[[Amanita]]'', collar-like as in many species of ''[[Lepiota]]'', or merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a partial veil composed of filaments resembling a spiderweb), which is typical of the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''. Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.<ref>Stuntz ''et al''., 1978, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>\n\nThe stalk (also called the stipe, or stem) may be central and support the cap in the middle, or it may be off-center and/or lateral, as in species of ''[[Pleurotus]]'' and ''[[Panus]]''. In other mushrooms, a stalk may be absent, as in the polypores that form shelf-like brackets. [[Puffball]]s lack a stalk, but may have a supporting base. Other mushrooms, such as [[truffles]], [[jelly fungus|jellies]], [[Geastrales|earthstars]], and [[Nidulariaceae|bird's nests]], usually do not have stalks, and a specialized mycological vocabulary exists to describe their parts.\n\nThe way the gills attach to the top of the stalk is an important feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera ''[[Agaricus]]'', ''[[Amanita]]'', ''[[Lepiota]]'' and ''[[Pluteus]]'', among others, have free gills that do not extend to the top of the stalk. Others have [[decurrent]] gills that extend down the stalk, as in the genera ''[[Omphalotus]]'' and ''Pleurotus''. There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.<ref>Stuntz ''et al''., 1978, pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Microscopic features===\n[[File:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|''[[Morchella elata]]'' asci viewed with [[phase contrast microscopy]]]]\nA [[hymenium]] is a layer of microscopic spore-bearing cells that covers the surface of gills. In the nongilled mushrooms, the hymenium lines the inner surfaces of the tubes of [[bolete]]s and polypores, or covers the teeth of spine fungi and the branches of corals. In the Ascomycota, spores develop within microscopic elongated, sac-like cells called [[ascus|asci]], which typically contain eight spores in each ascus. The [[Discomycetes]], which contain the cup, sponge, brain, and some club-like fungi, develop an exposed layer of asci, as on the inner surfaces of [[cup fungi]] or within the pits of [[morel]]s. The [[Pyrenomycetes]], tiny dark-colored fungi that live on a wide range of substrates including soil, dung, leaf litter, and decaying wood, as well as other fungi, produce minute, flask-shaped structures called [[perithecium|perithecia]], within which the asci develop.<ref name=\"Ammirati1985pp25-34\">Ammirati ''et al''., 1985, pp. 25\u201334.</ref>\n\nIn the Basidiomycetes, usually four spores develop on the tips of thin projections called [[sterigmata]], which extend from club-shaped cells called a [[basidium|basidia]]. The fertile portion of the [[Gasteromycetes]], called a [[gleba]], may become powdery as in the puffballs or slimy as in the [[stinkhorn]]s. Interspersed among the asci are threadlike sterile cells called [[paraphyses]]. Similar structures called [[cystidia]] often occur within the hymenium of the Basidiomycota. Many types of cystidia exist, and assessing their presence, shape, and size is often used to verify the identification of a mushroom.<ref name=\"Ammirati1985pp25-34\" />\n\nThe most important microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical tests]] often can be the crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which is the point of attachment to the basidium, termed the apical [[germ pore]], from which the hypha emerges when the spore germinates.<ref name=\"Ammirati1985pp25-34\" />\n\n==Growth==\n[[File:Pop-up mushroom.jpg|thumb|''[[Agaricus bitorquis]]'' mushroom emerging through [[asphalt concrete]] in summer]]\n\nMany species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight, growing or expanding rapidly. This phenomenon is the source of several common expressions in the [[English language]] including \"to mushroom\" or \"mushrooming\" (expanding rapidly in size or scope) and \"to pop up like a mushroom\" (to appear unexpectedly and quickly).  In reality, all species of mushrooms take several days to form primordial mushroom fruit bodies, though they do expand rapidly by the absorption of fluids.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe [[agaricus bisporus|cultivated mushroom]], as well as the common [[field mushroom]], initially form a minute [[fruiting body]], referred to as the pin stage because of their small size. Slightly expanded, they are called buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its [[mycelium]] and expand, mainly by inflating preformed [[cell (biology)|cells]] that took several days to form in the [[primordia]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nSimilarly, there are other mushrooms, like ''[[Parasola plicatilis]]'' (formerly ''[[Coprinus]] plicatlis''), that grow rapidly overnight and may disappear by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall.<ref name=\"Nelson2006\" /> The primordia form at ground level in lawns in humid spaces under the [[Thatch (lawn)|thatch]] and after heavy rainfall or in [[dew]]y conditions balloon to full size in a few hours, release spores, and then collapse. They \"mushroom\" to full size.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nNot all mushrooms expand overnight; some grow very slowly and add tissue to their fruiting bodies by growing from the edges of the colony or by inserting [[hyphae]]. For example, ''[[Pleurotus nebrodensis]]'' grows slowly, and because of this combined with human collection, it is now [[critically endangered]].<ref name=\"redlist\" />\n\n[[File:Yellowmushrooms.jpg|thumb|Yellow flower pot mushrooms (''[[Leucocoprinus birnbaumii]]'') at various states of development]]\n\nThough mushroom fruiting bodies are short-lived, the underlying [[mycelium]] can itself be long-lived and massive. A colony of ''[[Armillaria solidipes]]'' (formerly known as ''Armillaria ostoyae'') in [[Malheur National Forest]] in the [[United States]] is estimated to be 2,400 years old, possibly older, and spans an estimated {{convert|2200|acre|km2}}.<ref>{{Citation|title=26.

Toxicity likely plays a role in protecting the function of the basidiocarp: the mycelium has expended considerable energy and protoplasmic material to develop a structure to efficiently distribute its spores. One defense against consumption and premature destruction is the evolution of chemicals that render the mushroom inedible, either causing the consumer to vomit the meal (see [[emetic]]s), or to learn to avoid consumption altogether.

[[lamella (mycology)|lamella]]) on the underside of the cap. \"Mushroom\" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some [[Ascomycota]]. These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.\n\nForms deviating from the standard [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] usually have more specific names, such as \"[[bolete]]\", \"[[puffball]]\", \"[[stinkhorn]]\", and \"[[morel]]\", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called \"[[agaric]]s\" in reference to their similarity to ''[[Agaricus]]'' or their order [[Agaricales]]. By extension, the term \"mushroom\" can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]] (called a [[mycelium]]) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms, or the species itself.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Zwerg Postkarte 001.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', the most easily recognised \"toadstool\", is frequently depicted in fairy stories and on greeting cards. It is often associated with [[gnome]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mushroom Miscellany |last=Harding |first=Patrick |year=2008 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0-00-728464-1 |page=149}}</ref>]]\nThe terms \"mushroom\" and \"toadstool\" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms ''mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns'' were used.<ref name=\"Ramsbottom1954\" />\n\nThe term \"mushroom\" and its variations may have been derived from the French word ''[[Calocybe gambosa|mousseron]]'' in reference to [[moss]] (''mousse''). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a \"mushroom\" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable.\n\nCultural or [[social phobia]]s of mushrooms and fungi may be related. The term \"fungophobia\" was coined by [[William Delisle Hay]] of [[England]], who noted a national [[superstition]] or fear of \"toadstools\".<ref name=\"Hay\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/elementarytextbo00hayw#page/n5/mode/2up |title=An Elementary Text-Book of British Fungi |last=Hay |first=William Deslisle |year=1887 |publisher=London, S.

In German folklore and old fairy tales, toads are often depicted sitting on toadstool mushrooms and catching, with their tongues, the flies that are said to be drawn to the ''Fliegenpilz'', a German name for the toadstool, meaning \"flies' mushroom\". This is how the mushroom got another of its names, ''Kr\u00f6tenstuhl'' (a less-used German name for the mushroom), literally translating to \"toad-stool\".\n\n==Identification==\n[[File:Mushroom cap morphology2.png|thumb|right|Morphological characteristics of the caps of mushrooms]]\nIdentifying mushrooms requires a basic understanding of their [[macroscopic]] structure. Most are [[Basidiomycetes]] and gilled. Their spores, called [[basidiospore]]s, are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the basidiospores are shot off [[basidia]] and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a [[spore print]], is used to help classify mushrooms and can help to identify them. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.<ref name=\"Dickinson1982\" />\n\nWhile modern identification of mushrooms is quickly becoming molecular, the standard methods for identification are still used by most and have developed into a fine art harking back to [[medieval]] times and the [[Victorian era]], combined with microscopic examination. The presence of juices upon breaking, bruising reactions, odors, tastes, shades of color, habitat, habit, and season are all considered by both amateur and professional mycologists. Tasting and smelling mushrooms carries its own hazards because of poisons and [[allergens]]. Chemical [[Chemical test|tests]] are also used for some genera.<ref>Ammirati ''et al''., 1985, pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn general, identification to [[genus]] can often be accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide. Identification to [[species]], however, requires more effort; one must remember that a mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for the identification of the species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from oozing liquids on [[Lamella (mycology)|lamella]] edges for colored spored prints.\n\n==Classification==\n{{main article|Sporocarp (fungi)|Basidiocarp|Ascocarp}}\n[[File:Hypomyces lactifluorum 169126.jpg|thumb|A mushroom (probably ''[[Russula brevipes]]'') parasitized by ''[[Hypomyces lactifluorum]]'' resulting in a \"lobster mushroom\".]]\nTypical mushrooms are the fruit bodies of members of the order [[Agaricales]], whose [[type genus]] is ''[[Agaricus]]'' and type species is the field mushroom, ''[[Agaricus campestris]]''. However, in modern [[molecular phylogenetics|molecularly]] defined [[classification (biology)|classifications]], not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class [[Agaricomycetes]]. For example, [[Cantharellus|chanterelles]] are in the [[Cantharellales]], false chanterelles such as ''[[Gomphus (fungus)|Gomphus]]'' are in the [[Gomphales]], [[milk-cap]] mushrooms (''[[Lactarius]]'', ''[[Lactifluus]]'') and russulas (''[[Russula]]''), as well as ''[[Lentinellus]]'', are in the [[Russulales]], while the tough, leathery genera ''[[Lentinus]]'' and ''[[Panus]]'' are among the [[Polyporales]], but ''[[Neolentinus]]'' is in the [[Gloeophyllales]], and the little pin-mushroom genus, ''[[Rickenella]]'', along with similar genera, are in the [[Hymenochaetales]].\n\nWithin the main body of mushrooms, in the Agaricales, are common fungi like the common [[Marasmius oreades|fairy-ring mushroom]], [[shiitake]], [[enoki]], [[oyster mushrooms]], [[fly agaric]]s and other [[Amanita]]s, [[magic mushrooms]] like species of ''[[Psilocybe]]'', [[Volvariella|paddy straw mushrooms]], [[Coprinus comatus|shaggy manes]], etc.\n\nAn atypical mushroom is the [[lobster mushroom]], which is a deformed, cooked-lobster-colored [[parasite|parasitized]] fruitbody of a ''Russula'' or ''Lactarius'', colored and deformed by the mycoparasitic [[Ascomycete]] ''[[Hypomyces lactifluorum]]''.<ref name=\"Volk2001\" />\n\nOther mushrooms are not gilled, so the term \"mushroom\" is loosely used, and giving a full account of their classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath (and are usually called [[bolete]]s), others have spines, such as the [[Hericium erinaceus|hedgehog mushroom]] and other [[tooth fungus|tooth fungi]], and so on. \"Mushroom\" has been used for [[polypore]]s, [[puffball]]s, [[jelly fungi]], [[coral fungi]], [[Bracket fungus|bracket fungi]], [[stinkhorn]]s, and [[cup fungus|cup fungi]]. Thus, the term is more one of common application to [[macroscopic]] fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] meaning. Approximately 14,000 species of mushrooms are described.<ref name=\"Chang2004\" />\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Amanita stirps Hemibapha 45069.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Amanita jacksonii]]'' buttons emerging from their universal veils]]\n[[File:Lactarius indigo 48568.jpg|thumb|The blue [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] of ''[[Lactarius indigo]]'', a [[milk-cap]] mushroom]]\nA mushroom develops from a nodule, or pinhead, less than two millimeters in diameter, called a [[primordium]], which is typically found on or near the surface of the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. It is formed within the [[mycelium]], the mass of threadlike [[hypha]]e that make up the fungus. The primordium enlarges into a roundish structure of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a \"button\". The button has a cottony roll of mycelium, the [[universal veil]], that surrounds the developing fruit body. As the egg expands, the universal veil ruptures and may remain as a cup, or [[volva (mycology)|volva]], at the base of the [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]], or as warts or volval patches on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have either a volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the [[partial veil]], covers the bladelike [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that bear [[spore]]s. As the cap expands, the veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a ring, or [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]], around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the cap. The ring may be skirt-like as in some species of ''[[Amanita]]'', collar-like as in many species of ''[[Lepiota]]'', or merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a partial veil composed of filaments resembling a spiderweb), which is typical of the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''. Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.<ref>Stuntz ''et al''., 1978, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>\n\nThe stalk (also called the stipe, or stem) may be central and support the cap in the middle, or it may be off-center and/or lateral, as in species of ''[[Pleurotus]]'' and ''[[Panus]]''. In other mushrooms, a stalk may be absent, as in the polypores that form shelf-like brackets. [[Puffball]]s lack a stalk, but may have a supporting base. Other mushrooms, such as [[truffles]], [[jelly fungus|jellies]], [[Geastrales|earthstars]], and [[Nidulariaceae|bird's nests]], usually do not have stalks, and a specialized mycological vocabulary exists to describe their parts.\n\nThe way the gills attach to the top of the stalk is an important feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera ''[[Agaricus]]'', ''[[Amanita]]'', ''[[Lepiota]]'' and ''[[Pluteus]]'', among others, have free gills that do not extend to the top of the stalk. Others have [[decurrent]] gills that extend down the stalk, as in the genera ''[[Omphalotus]]'' and ''Pleurotus''. There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.<ref>Stuntz ''et al''., 1978, pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Microscopic features===\n[[File:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|''[[Morchella elata]]'' asci viewed with [[phase contrast microscopy]]]]\nA [[hymenium]] is a layer of microscopic spore-bearing cells that covers the surface of gills. In the nongilled mushrooms, the hymenium lines the inner surfaces of the tubes of [[bolete]]s and polypores, or covers the teeth of spine fungi and the branches of corals. In the Ascomycota, spores develop within microscopic elongated, sac-like cells called [[ascus|asci]], which typically contain eight spores in each ascus. The [[Discomycetes]], which contain the cup, sponge, brain, and some club-like fungi, develop an exposed layer of asci, as on the inner surfaces of [[cup fungi]] or within the pits of [[morel]]s. The [[Pyrenomycetes]], tiny dark-colored fungi that live on a wide range of substrates including soil, dung, leaf litter, and decaying wood, as well as other fungi, produce minute, flask-shaped structures called [[perithecium|perithecia]], within which the asci develop.<ref name=\"Ammirati1985pp25-34\">Ammirati ''et al''., 1985, pp. 25\u201334.</ref>\n\nIn the Basidiomycetes, usually four spores develop on the tips of thin projections called [[sterigmata]], which extend from club-shaped cells called a [[basidium|basidia]]. The fertile portion of the [[Gasteromycetes]], called a [[gleba]], may become powdery as in the puffballs or slimy as in the [[stinkhorn]]s. Interspersed among the asci are threadlike sterile cells called [[paraphyses]]. Similar structures called [[cystidia]] often occur within the hymenium of the Basidiomycota. Many types of cystidia exist, and assessing their presence, shape, and size is often used to verify the identification of a mushroom.<ref name=\"Ammirati1985pp25-34\" />\n\nThe most important microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical tests]] often can be the crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which is the point of attachment to the basidium, termed the apical [[germ pore]], from which the hypha emerges when the spore germinates.<ref name=\"Ammirati1985pp25-34\" />\n\n==Growth==\n[[File:Pop-up mushroom.jpg|thumb|''[[Agaricus bitorquis]]'' mushroom emerging through [[asphalt concrete]] in summer]]\n\nMany species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight, growing or expanding rapidly. This phenomenon is the source of several common expressions in the [[English language]] including \"to mushroom\" or \"mushrooming\" (expanding rapidly in size or scope) and \"to pop up like a mushroom\" (to appear unexpectedly and quickly).  In reality, all species of mushrooms take several days to form primordial mushroom fruit bodies, though they do expand rapidly by the absorption of fluids.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe [[agaricus bisporus|cultivated mushroom]], as well as the common [[field mushroom]], initially form a minute [[fruiting body]], referred to as the pin stage because of their small size. Slightly expanded, they are called buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its [[mycelium]] and expand, mainly by inflating preformed [[cell (biology)|cells]] that took several days to form in the [[primordia]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nSimilarly, there are other mushrooms, like ''[[Parasola plicatilis]]'' (formerly ''[[Coprinus]] plicatlis''), that grow rapidly overnight and may disappear by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall.<ref name=\"Nelson2006\" /> The primordia form at ground level in lawns in humid spaces under the [[Thatch (lawn)|thatch]] and after heavy rainfall or in [[dew]]y conditions balloon to full size in a few hours, release spores, and then collapse. They \"mushroom\" to full size.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nNot all mushrooms expand overnight; some grow very slowly and add tissue to their fruiting bodies by growing from the edges of the colony or by inserting [[hyphae]]. For example, ''[[Pleurotus nebrodensis]]'' grows slowly, and because of this combined with human collection, it is now [[critically endangered]].<ref name=\"redlist\" />\n\n[[File:Yellowmushrooms.jpg|thumb|Yellow flower pot mushrooms (''[[Leucocoprinus birnbaumii]]'') at various states of development]]\n\nThough mushroom fruiting bodies are short-lived, the underlying [[mycelium]] can itself be long-lived and massive.

Although there are only a small number of [[List of deadly fungi|deadly species]], several others can cause particularly severe and unpleasant symptoms.  Toxicity likely plays a role in protecting the function of the basidiocarp: the mycelium has expended considerable energy and protoplasmic material to develop a structure to efficiently distribute its spores. One defense against consumption and premature destruction is the evolution of chemicals that render the mushroom inedible, either causing the consumer to vomit the meal (see [[emetic]]s), or to learn to avoid consumption altogether. In addition, due to the propensity of mushrooms to absorb [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], including those that are radioactive, European mushrooms may, as late as 2008, include toxicity from the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] and continue to be studied.<ref name=\"FreshPlaza\" /><ref name=\"Turhan2007\" />\n\n===Psychoactive mushrooms===\n[[File:Psilocybe.zapotecorum.1.jpg|thumb|''[[Psilocybe zapotecorum]]'', a hallucinogenic mushroom]]\n\nMushrooms with psychoactive properties have long played a role in various native medicine traditions in cultures all around the world.
