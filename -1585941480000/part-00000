Maize diversity in Mexico continues to be maintained and managed by smallholder farmers who participate in traditional seed sharing networks. Maize landraces in Mexico are conserved in place, or in-situ, by farmers who continue to grow them in their fields. Commercial maize seed is planted on less than one-fourth of Mexico\u2019s 8 million hectares of arable land<ref name=\":9\" />. The majority of farmers in Mexico use, save, and exchange the seed of traditional maize landraces along with \u201ccreolized\u201d (hybridized or cross-pollinated) commercial [[Cultivar|cultivars]], which are typically planted in small (<5 ha) rain-fed fields<ref name=\":9\" />. \n\nAn estimated 18 percent of maize cultivation in Mexico takes place in the highlands, and maize agro-climates in the highland regions are most at risk from climate change.<ref name=\":4\" /> Many scientists are concerned about the effects climate change poses on maize genetic diversity and the negative impacts that continued maize [[germplasm]] loss will have, not only on Mexican agriculture, but worldwide, as maize is the most widely grown crop in the world.<ref name=\":7\" /> Bellon et al. (2011) discuss the need to strengthen and broaden traditional seed networks in Mexico to support farmers and the genetic integrity of maize in light of climate change; thus, extending the geographic ranges of seed networks to link farmers in the highlands, for example, with farmers in mid-altitude environments.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Coffee ====\nVariable and extreme climatic events such as droughts, floods, and excessive heat will have \u2013 and is already having - important impacts on both the quality and overall production of [[Coffee bean|coffee]] in Mexico.<ref name=\":3\" /> In Mexico and Central America more broadly, some 8.5 million people rely on coffee production for their livelihoods.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2012, higher than average temperatures and high-altitude rains led to an outbreak of [[Hemileia vastatrix|coffee leaf rust]], affecting roughly 50 percent of the coffee crop in Central America.<ref name=\":2\" /> This resulted in $500 million in crop damages to the region and caused many people in the region to lose their livelihoods.<ref name=\":2\" /> Regional studies in Mexico have projected that coffee growing could be unviable by the end of the decade.<ref name=\":3\" /> Responses will need to occur both in the social and ecological realms and across multiple scales. Key strategies include crop diversification and the implementation of more resilient coffee production systems. Farmer education, access to information, health, and equity factors all play important roles in adaptation responses as well.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Yet, there are also large-scale and global factors at play, such as international trade markets, which are often volatile, that are beyond farmers\u2019 control. A handful of coffee companies, NGOs, and agencies have initiated training and education programs for Mexican farmers to better respond to climate change.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Global Impacts ===\nClimate change threatens not only food and economic security in Mexico, but is also tied to much larger, global processes. In 2017, the United States imported $13.3 billion of fruits and vegetables from Mexico.<ref name=\":6\" /> Declining crop yields in Mexico due to climate change will ultimately impact global trade networks, national economies, and food security in countries that are, perhaps, geographically distant; yet through free-trade policies such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and [[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement|USMCA]], have become highly dependent on Mexican agriculture.\n\n=== Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies ===\nThe Mexican government\u2019s climate change program explicitly identifies \u201cthe adoption and implementation of sustainable agriculture\u201d as a key adaptation strategy<ref name=\":9\" />. Sustainable agriculture can take many forms. One type of strategy that has been proposed includes changing farmers\u2019 agricultural practices. For example, changing the timing of irrigation and crop planting, introducing new landraces and cultivars by extending seed-sharing networks, and adopting biodiversity friendly farming practices that increase [[agroecosystem]] resilience<ref name=\":9\" />. Evidence suggests that smallholder farmers in southern Mexico have begun adapting their agricultural practices due to climate change, by, for example, delaying crop plantings and planting a diversity of landrace varieties<ref name=\":9\" />. Another strategy focuses on the development and promotion of new, [[Genetically modified plant|transgenic]], \u201cclimate-adapted\u201d seed varieties that have traits for drought- and disease-resistance<ref name=\":9\" />. Researchers have also noted the importance of state leadership in addressing climate change by, for example, training and preparing farmers for climate adaptation<ref name=\":9\" />. However, implementation of any adaptation or mitigation strategy will need to take into account the complexity of [[Coupled human\u2013environment system|coupled human-natural systems]], wealth and power inequities, and the varying scales at which climate change processes are occurring<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eakin, H., Lerner, A., Murinho, F.|date=2010|title=Adaptive capacity in evolving peri-urban spaces: responses to flood risk in the Upper Lerma River Valley, Mexico|url=|journal=Global Environmental Change|volume=20|pages=14\u201322|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.08.005}}</ref><ref name=\":9\" />.\n[[File:A shade-grown coffee plot helps protect water quality, provides higher yields, reduces irrigation, and even provides wildlife habitat.jpg|thumb|Much of Mexico's coffee (Coffee arabica) production is grown under the shade of a diversity of tree species.

Maize diversity in Mexico continues to be maintained and managed by smallholder farmers who participate in traditional seed sharing networks. Maize landraces in Mexico are conserved in place, or in-situ, by farmers who continue to grow them in their fields. Commercial maize seed is planted on less than one-fourth of Mexico\u2019s 8 million hectares of arable land<ref name=\":9\" />. The majority of farmers in Mexico use, save, and exchange the seed of traditional maize landraces along with \u201ccreolized\u201d (hybridized or cross-pollinated) commercial [[Cultivar|cultivars]], which are typically planted in small (<5 ha) rain-fed fields<ref name=\":9\" />. \n\nAn estimated 18 percent of maize cultivation in Mexico takes place in the highlands, and maize agro-climates in the highland regions are most at risk from climate change.<ref name=\":4\" /> Many scientists are concerned about the effects climate change poses on maize genetic diversity and the negative impacts that continued maize [[germplasm]] loss will have, not only on Mexican agriculture, but worldwide, as maize is the most widely grown crop in the world.<ref name=\":7\" /> Bellon et al. (2011) discuss the need to strengthen and broaden traditional seed networks in Mexico to support farmers and the genetic integrity of maize in light of climate change; thus, extending the geographic ranges of seed networks to link farmers in the highlands, for example, with farmers in mid-altitude environments.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Coffee ====\nVariable and extreme climatic events such as droughts, floods, and excessive heat will have \u2013 and is already having - important impacts on both the quality and overall production of [[Coffee bean|coffee]] in Mexico.<ref name=\":3\" /> In Mexico and Central America more broadly, some 8.5 million people rely on coffee production for their livelihoods.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2012, higher than average temperatures and high-altitude rains led to an outbreak of [[Hemileia vastatrix|coffee leaf rust]], affecting roughly 50 percent of the coffee crop in Central America.<ref name=\":2\" /> This resulted in $500 million in crop damages to the region and caused many people in the region to lose their livelihoods.<ref name=\":2\" /> Regional studies in Mexico have projected that coffee growing could be unviable by the end of the decade.<ref name=\":3\" /> Responses will need to occur both in the social and ecological realms and across multiple scales. Key strategies include crop diversification and the implementation of more resilient coffee production systems. Farmer education, access to information, health, and equity factors all play important roles in adaptation responses as well.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Yet, there are also large-scale and global factors at play, such as international trade markets, which are often volatile, that are beyond farmers\u2019 control. A handful of coffee companies, NGOs, and agencies have initiated training and education programs for Mexican farmers to better respond to climate change.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Global Impacts ===\nClimate change threatens not only food and economic security in Mexico, but is also tied to much larger, global processes. In 2017, the United States imported $13.3 billion of fruits and vegetables from Mexico.<ref name=\":6\" /> Declining crop yields in Mexico due to climate change will ultimately impact global trade networks, national economies, and food security in countries that are, perhaps, geographically distant; yet through free-trade policies such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and [[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement|USMCA]], have become highly dependent on Mexican agriculture.\n\n=== Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies ===\nThe Mexican government\u2019s climate change program explicitly identifies \u201cthe adoption and implementation of sustainable agriculture\u201d as a key adaptation strategy<ref name=\":9\" />. Sustainable agriculture can take many forms. One type of strategy that has been proposed includes changing farmers\u2019 agricultural practices. For example, changing the timing of irrigation and crop planting, introducing new landraces and cultivars by extending seed-sharing networks, and adopting biodiversity friendly farming practices that increase [[agroecosystem]] resilience<ref name=\":9\" />. Evidence suggests that smallholder farmers in southern Mexico have begun adapting their agricultural practices due to climate change, by, for example, delaying crop plantings and planting a diversity of landrace varieties<ref name=\":9\" />. Another strategy focuses on the development and promotion of new, [[Genetically modified plant|transgenic]], \u201cclimate-adapted\u201d seed varieties that have traits for drought- and disease-resistance<ref name=\":9\" />.

It is also the eastern end of a highway known as the '''Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway''', one of three coast-to-coast Interstates, along with [[Interstate 80|I-80]] and [[Interstate 90|I-90]]. The highway runs east from the [[Alabama]] border, traveling through the [[Panhandle of Florida]], serving the major cities of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]], ending at [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and carries the hidden [[Florida Department of Transportation]] (FDOT) [[Florida State Highway System#Numbering|designation]] of '''State Road&nbsp;8''' ('''SR&nbsp;8''').\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I10nearlakecity.JPG|thumb|left|Eastbound view of I-10 near Lake City and I-75]]\nThe Interstate runs roughly parallel to [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US Highway&nbsp;90]] (US&nbsp;90), but is a more direct route, bypassing the central cores of many cities. I-10 runs through some of the least populated areas of the state.\n\nThe western terminus of I-10 is the Florida\u2013Alabama state line at the [[Perdido River]], just west of Pensacola, in [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia County]]. Exit&nbsp;7A, [[Florida State Road 297|SR&nbsp;297]] (southbound), gives access to the [[Pensacola Naval Air Station]] and the [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]]. On the border between [[Brent, Florida|Brent]] and [[Ensley, Florida|Ensley]], the median approaching exits&nbsp;10A and 10B become unexpectedly wide in order to accommodate flyover on-ramps from [[U.S. Route 29 in Florida|US&nbsp;29]] that enter the left sides of the road. At exit&nbsp;12, I-10 serves as the northern terminus of [[Interstate 110 (Florida)|I-110]], a [[spur route]] to central Pensacola. The route leaves the county at the [[Escambia Bay Bridge]] and has two interchanges within [[Santa Rosa County, Florida|Santa Rosa County]] before crossing another bridge over the [[Blackwater River (Florida)|Blackwater River]]. After that bridge it has two more interchanges with a pair of rest areas in between before crossing the Santa Rosa\u2013[[Okaloosa County, Florida|Okaloosa County]] line.\n\nThe road crosses the border between the [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] time zones at the long Dewey M. Johnson Bridge, over the [[Apalachicola River]]. East of the bridge over the [[Ochlockonee River]] and the rest areas that follow, I-10 widens from four to six lanes and remains that way until after the interchange with [[Florida State Road 61|SR&nbsp;61]] and [[U.S. Route 319 in Florida|US&nbsp;319]].\n\nLike at US&nbsp;29 in Escambia County, the median for I-10 widens in the vicinity of [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]] at exits&nbsp;296A and 296B in order to accommodate flyover on-ramps that enter from the left sides of the road.\n\nA {{convert|21|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} segment between exits&nbsp;303 and 324 contains no interchanges because it passes through a portion of [[Osceola National Forest]]. The sole means of leaving and re-entering the highway in this section is at a pair of rest areas, the easternmost rest areas along I-10. The road widens to six lanes again at the interchange with the [[First Coast Expressway]]. Just as I-75 did with I-10 in [[Columbia County, Florida|Columbia County]], I-10's interchange with [[Interstate 295 (Florida)|I-295]] uses single ramps leading to both directions on I-295 with east-to-north and south-to-west flyover ramps leading to the median of I-295. [[U.S. Route 17 in Florida|US&nbsp;17]] overlaps I-10 for two exits before the eastern terminus of the Interstate, located in the [[Brooklyn (Jacksonville)|Brooklyn]] neighborhood of Jacksonville's [[Downtown Jacksonville|urban core]] at [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:I-10west jacksonville.jpg|thumb|right|I-10 west at the interchange for US&nbsp;17 Alt. south in Jacksonville]]\nPrior to the construction of I-10, [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US&nbsp;90]] was the main east\u2013west highway across the state.\n\nThe first section of I-10 in Florida was completed between [[Sanderson, Florida|Sanderson]] and [[Jacksonville]] in 1961. Construction on points westward continued in 1962. The route between Sanderson and [[Winfield, Florida|Winfield]] was completed in 1963. By 1967, construction had been completed from the Alabama state line to [[Florida State Road 87|SR&nbsp;87]], and was under construction from [[Falmouth, Florida|Falmouth]] to [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]]. New construction extending I-10 east from SR&nbsp;87 to [[Mossy Head, Florida|Mossy Head]] began in 1968. The Falmouth to I-75 segment opened in 1969. Construction began in 1970 further extending I-10 eastward from Mossy Head to [[DeFuniak Springs, Florida|DeFuniak Springs]]. New construction began in 1973 from DeFuniak Springs to [[Caryville, Florida|Caryville]] and from [[Drifton, Florida|Drifton]] to [[Capitola, Florida|Capitola]]; the segment between Drifton and Falmouth opened that year. The Capitola\u2013Drifton segment was completed the following year. Construction began between Caryville and [[Chipley, Florida|Chipley]] in 1974, and from Chipley to [[Midway, Gadsden County, Florida|Midway]] in 1975. The segment between Chipley and Midway was completed in 1977 except for a small portion between [[Kynesville, Florida|Kynesville]] and [[Oakdale, Florida|Oakdale]]; in 1978, the entire length of I-10, as well as the [[Interstate 110 (Florida)|I-110]] spur in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] across the state opened along its original planned route.<ref name=\"Florida's Interstates\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fl-interstate.com/ |title = Florida's Interstates: A Half Century of Progress |accessdate = October 4, 2014 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006074205/http://www.fl-interstate.com/ |archivedate = October 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the planning stage of construction, I-10 was placed just north of the central business district of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], roughly along the current route of [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US&nbsp;90]] through town, while later a [[spur route]] was proposed to go to the core of the city.

It is also the eastern end of a highway known as the '''Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway''', one of three coast-to-coast Interstates, along with [[Interstate 80|I-80]] and [[Interstate 90|I-90]]. The highway runs east from the [[Alabama]] border, traveling through the [[Panhandle of Florida]], serving the major cities of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]], ending at [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and carries the hidden [[Florida Department of Transportation]] (FDOT) [[Florida State Highway System#Numbering|designation]] of '''State Road&nbsp;8''' ('''SR&nbsp;8''').\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I10nearlakecity.JPG|thumb|left|Eastbound view of I-10 near Lake City and I-75]]\nThe Interstate runs roughly parallel to [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US Highway&nbsp;90]] (US&nbsp;90), but is a more direct route, bypassing the central cores of many cities. I-10 runs through some of the least populated areas of the state.\n\nThe western terminus of I-10 is the Florida\u2013Alabama state line at the [[Perdido River]], just west of Pensacola, in [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia County]]. Exit&nbsp;7A, [[Florida State Road 297|SR&nbsp;297]] (southbound), gives access to the [[Pensacola Naval Air Station]] and the [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]]. On the border between [[Brent, Florida|Brent]] and [[Ensley, Florida|Ensley]], the median approaching exits&nbsp;10A and 10B become unexpectedly wide in order to accommodate flyover on-ramps from [[U.S. Route 29 in Florida|US&nbsp;29]] that enter the left sides of the road. At exit&nbsp;12, I-10 serves as the northern terminus of [[Interstate 110 (Florida)|I-110]], a [[spur route]] to central Pensacola. The route leaves the county at the [[Escambia Bay Bridge]] and has two interchanges within [[Santa Rosa County, Florida|Santa Rosa County]] before crossing another bridge over the [[Blackwater River (Florida)|Blackwater River]]. After that bridge it has two more interchanges with a pair of rest areas in between before crossing the Santa Rosa\u2013[[Okaloosa County, Florida|Okaloosa County]] line.\n\nThe road crosses the border between the [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] time zones at the long Dewey M. Johnson Bridge, over the [[Apalachicola River]]. East of the bridge over the [[Ochlockonee River]] and the rest areas that follow, I-10 widens from four to six lanes and remains that way until after the interchange with [[Florida State Road 61|SR&nbsp;61]] and [[U.S. Route 319 in Florida|US&nbsp;319]].\n\nLike at US&nbsp;29 in Escambia County, the median for I-10 widens in the vicinity of [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]] at exits&nbsp;296A and 296B in order to accommodate flyover on-ramps that enter from the left sides of the road.\n\nA {{convert|21|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} segment between exits&nbsp;303 and 324 contains no interchanges because it passes through a portion of [[Osceola National Forest]]. The sole means of leaving and re-entering the highway in this section is at a pair of rest areas, the easternmost rest areas along I-10. The road widens to six lanes again at the interchange with the [[First Coast Expressway]]. Just as I-75 did with I-10 in [[Columbia County, Florida|Columbia County]], I-10's interchange with [[Interstate 295 (Florida)|I-295]] uses single ramps leading to both directions on I-295 with east-to-north and south-to-west flyover ramps leading to the median of I-295. [[U.S. Route 17 in Florida|US&nbsp;17]] overlaps I-10 for two exits before the eastern terminus of the Interstate, located in the [[Brooklyn (Jacksonville)|Brooklyn]] neighborhood of Jacksonville's [[Downtown Jacksonville|urban core]] at [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:I-10west jacksonville.jpg|thumb|right|I-10 west at the interchange for US&nbsp;17 Alt. south in Jacksonville]]\nPrior to the construction of I-10, [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US&nbsp;90]] was the main east\u2013west highway across the state.\n\nThe first section of I-10 in Florida was completed between [[Sanderson, Florida|Sanderson]] and [[Jacksonville]] in 1961. Construction on points westward continued in 1962. The route between Sanderson and [[Winfield, Florida|Winfield]] was completed in 1963. By 1967, construction had been completed from the Alabama state line to [[Florida State Road 87|SR&nbsp;87]], and was under construction from [[Falmouth, Florida|Falmouth]] to [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]]. New construction extending I-10 east from SR&nbsp;87 to [[Mossy Head, Florida|Mossy Head]] began in 1968. The Falmouth to I-75 segment opened in 1969. Construction began in 1970 further extending I-10 eastward from Mossy Head to [[DeFuniak Springs, Florida|DeFuniak Springs]]. New construction began in 1973 from DeFuniak Springs to [[Caryville, Florida|Caryville]] and from [[Drifton, Florida|Drifton]] to [[Capitola, Florida|Capitola]]; the segment between Drifton and Falmouth opened that year. The Capitola\u2013Drifton segment was completed the following year. Construction began between Caryville and [[Chipley, Florida|Chipley]] in 1974, and from Chipley to [[Midway, Gadsden County, Florida|Midway]] in 1975. The segment between Chipley and Midway was completed in 1977 except for a small portion between [[Kynesville, Florida|Kynesville]] and [[Oakdale, Florida|Oakdale]]; in 1978, the entire length of I-10, as well as the [[Interstate 110 (Florida)|I-110]] spur in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] across the state opened along its original planned route.<ref name=\"Florida's Interstates\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fl-interstate.com/ |title = Florida's Interstates: A Half Century of Progress |accessdate = October 4, 2014 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006074205/http://www.fl-interstate.com/ |archivedate = October 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the planning stage of construction, I-10 was placed just north of the central business district of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], roughly along the current route of [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US&nbsp;90]] through town, while later a [[spur route]] was proposed to go to the core of the city. Both of these proposals were dropped and a route across the north side of the city was chosen. In 2008 the Interstate stretch in Tallahassee was expanded to six lanes to alleviate congestion. <!--During the Tallahassee construction, (anything to add here, stops mid sentence)-->\n\nIn 2002, I-10, along with most of Florida's Interstates, switched over from a sequential exit numbering system to a [[mile-log|mileage-based]] exit numbering system.<ref name=oldexit>{{Cite web |url = http://www.dot.state.fl.us/TrafficOperations/Operations/exitnumb/i_10.shtm |title = Florida's Interstate Exit Numbers- I-10 |publisher = Florida Department of Transportation |accessdate = November 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Rest area security concerns===\n[[File:I10tallahassee.jpg|right|thumb|I-10 west approaching the interchange for US 319/SR 61 in Tallahassee]]\nIn 1993, a British tourist was killed at the Jefferson County rest area in a botched burglary by teens.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/rest-stop |title = Orlando Sentinel: Articles about Rest stop |work = [[Orlando Sentinel]] |accessdate = October 4, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url = http://myfloridalegal.com/newsrel.nsf/newsreleases/dc0079e79f0738558525700e0056ccdd |title = Crist: Appeal Denied in British Tourist's I-10 Rest Stop Murder |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110617044458/http://myfloridalegal.com/newsrel.nsf/newsreleases/dc0079e79f0738558525700e0056ccdd |archive-date = June 17, 2011 }}</ref> As a result, Florida rest stops were either patrolled or closed for at least two years when lawmakers approved cut-backs.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/15/us/tourist-killed-in-florida-prompting-new-patrols.html |title = Tourist Killed in Florida, Prompting New Patrols |first = Larry |last = Rohter |work = The New York Times |date = September 15, 1993 |access-date = July 5, 2010 }}</ref> A number of rest areas are currently regularly patrolled at night by armed security, often private, due to a resurgence in rest area-related violent crime.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/crime/sfl-530publicsafety,0,7417447.story |title = Highway rest areas no place to let your guard down |first = Sofia |last = Santana |work = South Florida Sun-Sentinel |date = May 30, 2008 |access-date = December 30, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Hurricane Ivan===\n{{Main|Hurricane Ivan#Florida}}\nOn September 16, 2004, [[Hurricane Ivan]] made landfall near Pensacola, with the resulting [[storm surge]] causing heavy damage to the I-10 bridge across [[Escambia Bay]].

It was released as the first official single from his fourth studio album, ''[[Love Is a Four Letter Word (album)|Love Is a Four Letter Word]]'' on January 3, 2012 via [[iTunes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/i-wont-give-up-single/id491231873 |title=I Won't Give Up \u2013 Single |work=[[iTunes]] |publisher=[[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] |date=January 7, 2012 |accessdate=January 7, 2012}}</ref> It was written by Mraz and Michael Natter, and produced by [[Joe Chiccarelli]].\n\nThe acoustic [[folk blues]] and [[folk-pop]] ballad was written during his activist outings and discusses not giving up on loving someone, loving oneself, and not giving up on one's dreams. It received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who agreed that the song is straightforward, emotional and inspiring.\n\nThe song was also a success on the charts, debuting at number 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming his second top-ten single, after \"[[I'm Yours (Jason Mraz song)|I'm Yours]]\" (2008). Internationally, the song achieved large success, reaching top-ten positions in [[Ireland]] and [[Netherlands]], while reaching top-twenty positions in [[Austria]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and more.\n\n== Background ==\nAfter \"[[I'm Yours (Jason Mraz song)|I'm Yours]]\" remained at the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for a record 76 weeks ending in October 2009 (peaking at number 6), Mraz headed to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] during the summer of 2010 to help with efforts to clean the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|last=Lipshut|first=Jason|title=Jason Mraz Is Focusing on Green Issues With New Album|url=https://www.billboard.com/entry/view/id/41467/pn/all/p/0/?KSID=e78e14d81fd825915729e065335b73b9|accessdate=November 22, 2012|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=April 14, 2012}}</ref> Later, he went to a trip to [[Ghana]] to fight child slavery alongside the nonprofit organization ''[[Free the Slaves]]''. Later, Mraz was in [[Antarctica]], spending time with [[Al Gore]] and learning about climate change aboard the [[National Geographic Explorer]]. During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, ''[[Love Is a Four Letter Word (album)|Love Is a Four Letter Word]]'', with producer [[Joe Chiccarelli]].<ref name=billboard/> In an interview for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that \"I'm Yours\" gave him to fuel positive change.<ref name=billboard/> He further elaborated: \"The pressure I put on myself, or what I hope my 'I Won't Give Up' does, is to make a difference in people's lives . . . With 'I'm Yours,' I got to go out and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes. I wanted to see who I was, outside of music.\"<ref name=billboard/>\n\nMraz explained the track, in a \"track-by-track\" commentary for ''Billboard'':\n<blockquote>\n\"'I Won't Give Up' was written selfishly. As many of my songs are, I write for the purpose of understanding what the hell's going on in my life, my position in the world, processing that lesson and that miracle that I'm learning. Seeing it on the page, proving to myself that I understand the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that I can move on. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for. Whether we want to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after.\"<ref name=billboardtrack>{{cite web|last=Benjamin|first=Jeff|title=Jason Mraz, 'Love Is a Four Letter Word': Video Track-By-Track|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1067020/jason-mraz-love-is-a-four-letter-word-video-track-by-track|accessdate=November 22, 2012|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=April 16, 2012}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\n== Composition ==\n{{listen\n | filename     = Jason Mraz - I Wont Give Up.ogg\n | title        = \"I Won't Give Up\" (2012)\n | pos = left\n | description  = A 25 second sample of \"I Won't Give Up\".\n}}\n\"I Won't Give Up\" was written by Jason Mraz and Michael Natter, while production was handled by [[Joe Chiccarelli]].<ref name=discogs>{{cite web|title=Jason Mraz \u2013 Love Is A Four Letter Word (Album) at Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jason-Mraz-Love-Is-A-Four-Letter-Word/release/3549042|accessdate=November 22, 2012|publisher=[[Discogs]]}}</ref> The acoustic [[folk blues]]<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|title=Jason Mraz: Love Is a Four-Letter Word \u2013 review &#124; Music &#124; The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/12/jason-mraz-love-is-review|accessdate=April 14, 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=April 12, 2012}}</ref> and [[folk-pop]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2018/10/jason_mraz_joins_contemporary.html|title=Jason Mraz joins Contemporary Youth Orchestra for summer 2019 concert|last=Nickoloff|first=Anne|website=[[cleveland.com]]|date=October 26, 2018|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref> [[ballad]] features a slower tempo and a sparse arrangement written in the key of E major.<ref name=billboard/> Lyrically, it is a poignant ode to a long-lasting relationship, which Mraz says he won't give up on her whatever happens.<ref name=billboard2>{{cite news|last=Trust|first=Gary|title=Jason Mraz's 'I Won't Give Up' Storms Hot 100's Top 10|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/513326/jason-mrazs-i-wont-give-up-storms-hot-100s-top-10|accessdate=November 23, 2012|newspaper=Billboard|date=January 11, 2012}}</ref> \"Well, I won't give up on us/Even if the skies get rough/I'm giving you all my love/I'm still looking up,\" he sings.<ref name=billboardtrack/> It is guitar led with some additional vocal landscapes towards the end of the song.

It received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who agreed that the song is straightforward, emotional and inspiring.\n\nThe song was also a success on the charts, debuting at number 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming his second top-ten single, after \"[[I'm Yours (Jason Mraz song)|I'm Yours]]\" (2008). Internationally, the song achieved large success, reaching top-ten positions in [[Ireland]] and [[Netherlands]], while reaching top-twenty positions in [[Austria]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and more.\n\n== Background ==\nAfter \"[[I'm Yours (Jason Mraz song)|I'm Yours]]\" remained at the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for a record 76 weeks ending in October 2009 (peaking at number 6), Mraz headed to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] during the summer of 2010 to help with efforts to clean the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|last=Lipshut|first=Jason|title=Jason Mraz Is Focusing on Green Issues With New Album|url=https://www.billboard.com/entry/view/id/41467/pn/all/p/0/?KSID=e78e14d81fd825915729e065335b73b9|accessdate=November 22, 2012|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=April 14, 2012}}</ref> Later, he went to a trip to [[Ghana]] to fight child slavery alongside the nonprofit organization ''[[Free the Slaves]]''. Later, Mraz was in [[Antarctica]], spending time with [[Al Gore]] and learning about climate change aboard the [[National Geographic Explorer]]. During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, ''[[Love Is a Four Letter Word (album)|Love Is a Four Letter Word]]'', with producer [[Joe Chiccarelli]].<ref name=billboard/> In an interview for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that \"I'm Yours\" gave him to fuel positive change.<ref name=billboard/> He further elaborated: \"The pressure I put on myself, or what I hope my 'I Won't Give Up' does, is to make a difference in people's lives . . . With 'I'm Yours,' I got to go out and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes. I wanted to see who I was, outside of music.\"<ref name=billboard/>\n\nMraz explained the track, in a \"track-by-track\" commentary for ''Billboard'':\n<blockquote>\n\"'I Won't Give Up' was written selfishly. As many of my songs are, I write for the purpose of understanding what the hell's going on in my life, my position in the world, processing that lesson and that miracle that I'm learning. Seeing it on the page, proving to myself that I understand the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that I can move on. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us.
