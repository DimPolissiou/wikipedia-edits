Jean, still infatuated with Jakob, manufactures a situation for him to come to her house and they become intimate. Maeve's brother Sean returns after having disappeared for several months; they reconcile after some tense moments.

Modern technology, such as [[smartphone]]s, exists, but the show features very few cars from after the 1990s, with a majority of cars featured ranging from the 1970s to 1990s. Police cars seen during the finale of series two appear to follow 1990s' aesthetic rather than modern day police cars. As well as older cars the show heavily features older technologies such as [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] televisions, and dated household appliances. The d\u00e9cor of the Groffs' house is reminiscent of popular 1970s d\u00e9cor; Maeve's caravan is typical of the 1990s\u20132000s; and the Milburns' house is a more modern d\u00e9cor with a modern, \"American-style\" fridge. Moordale High School also shows some elements of British [[secondary school]]s as well as having a more American high school image. These elements serve to place ''Sex Education'' in an uncertain time period and location. According to showrunner Laurie Nunn, the show's aesthetic is deliberate and an homage to 1980s [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] films.<ref name=\"Popbuzz\">{{cite web|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/tv-film/sex-education/what-year-set-in/|last=Smith|first=Katy Louise|date=17 January 2020|accessdate=30 January 2020|title=What year is 'Sex Education' set in?

Modern technology, such as [[smartphone]]s, exists, but the show features very few cars from after the 1990s, with a majority of cars featured ranging from the 1970s to 1990s. Police cars seen during the finale of series two appear to follow 1990s' aesthetic rather than modern day police cars. As well as older cars the show heavily features older technologies such as [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] televisions, and dated household appliances. The d\u00e9cor of the Groffs' house is reminiscent of popular 1970s d\u00e9cor; Maeve's caravan is typical of the 1990s\u20132000s; and the Milburns' house is a more modern d\u00e9cor with a modern, \"American-style\" fridge. Moordale High School also shows some elements of British [[secondary school]]s as well as having a more American high school image. These elements serve to place ''Sex Education'' in an uncertain time period and location. According to showrunner Laurie Nunn, the show's aesthetic is deliberate and an homage to 1980s [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] films.<ref name=\"Popbuzz\">{{cite web|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/tv-film/sex-education/what-year-set-in/|last=Smith|first=Katy Louise|date=17 January 2020|accessdate=30 January 2020|title=What year is 'Sex Education' set in?

Fred was a captain and [[Bombardier (aircrew)|bombardier]] in Europe. Homer was a [[Petty officer second class|petty officer]]; he lost both hands from burns suffered when his ship was sunk, and now uses mechanical hook [[prostheses]]. Al was an infantry [[platoon sergeant]] in the Pacific. All three have trouble readjusting to civilian life.\n\nAl is a banker with a comfortable apartment and a loving family: wife Milly, adult daughter Peggy, and high-school student son Rob. He is promoted to vice president in charge of small loans, as the president views his military experience as valuable in dealing with other returning servicemen. When Al approves an unsecured loan to a young Navy veteran, despite the man's lack of collateral, the president advises him against making a habit of it. Later, at a banquet in his honor, an inebriated Al expounds that the bank\u2014and America\u2014must stand with the [[Veterans|vets]] and give them every chance to rebuild their lives.\n\nFred, a [[soda jerk]] before the war, wants something better, but the tight labor market forces him to return to his old job. Fred had met and married Marie after a short acquaintance, before shipping out less than a month later. She became a nightclub waitress while Fred was overseas. Marie makes it clear she does not enjoy being married to a lowly soda jerk.\n\nHomer, a high school football quarterback, had become engaged to his next-door neighbor, Wilma, before joining the Navy. He does not want to burden Wilma with his handicap so he eventually pushes her away. However, she still wants to marry him.\n\nPeggy drives her parents around to various nightclubs to celebrate. The last place they stop is a small bar owned and operated by Homer's uncle.  There Al is reunited with Homer and Fred. Peggy and Fred are attracted to each other.\n\nFred finds himself working under a young man who had been Fred's assistant before the war. Peggy drops by, and they have lunch together. Afterward, he suddenly grabs her and kisses her quickly but passionately. He immediately apologizes. Confused and somewhat upset, Peggy gets in her car and drives away. She decides to find out more about Marie in person, and arranges a double-date with herself and a boyfriend. Peggy dislikes Marie, and informs her parents later that night that she intends to end Fred's unhappy marriage. Al demands that Fred stop seeing his daughter. Fred agrees, but the friendship between the two men is strained.\n\nFred is having a casual conversation with Homer at work when an obnoxious customer enrages Homer with his remarks about fighting the wrong enemy in the war. Fred intervenes, knocking the man down and losing his job. Later, Fred encourages Homer to marry Wilma. When Wilma visits Homer at home later that same evening, Homer shows her how hard life with him would be, but she is undaunted.\n\nFred catches his wife with another man when he returns home unexpectedly. They argue, and Marie tells him that she is getting a divorce. \n\nFred decides to leave town to make a fresh start. While waiting for a plane, he wanders into a vast [[aircraft boneyard]]. Inside the nose of a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]], he has a flashback. The boss of a work crew, in charge of disassembling the planes for materials for \"prefabricated houses,\" rouses him. Fred persuades the man to hire him.\n\nAt Homer and Wilma's wedding, Fred, now divorced, is Homer's best man. Fred and Peggy glance at one another. After the ceremony, he takes her in his arms, kisses her and asks if she understands the troubles that lie in store for them. Peggy smiles fondly at him, and then kisses him again.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Entire credited cast, per closing credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Milly Stephenson\n* [[Fredric March]] as Platoon Sergeant Al Stephenson\n* [[Dana Andrews]] as Captain Fred Derry\n* [[Teresa Wright]] as Peggy Stephenson\n* [[Virginia Mayo]] as Marie Derry\n* [[Cathy O'Donnell]] as Wilma Cameron\n* [[Hoagy Carmichael]] as Uncle Butch Engle\n* [[Harold Russell]] as Petty Officer 2nd Class Homer Parrish\n* [[Gladys George]] as Hortense Derry\n* [[Roman Bohnen]] as Pat Derry\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Mr. Milton\n* [[Minna Gombell]] as Mrs. Parrish\n* [[Walter Baldwin]] as Mr. Parrish\n* [[Steve Cochran]] as Cliff\n* [[Dorothy Adams]] as Mrs. Cameron\n* [[Don Beddoe]] as Mr. Cameron\n* Marlene Aames as Luella Parrish\n* [[Charles Halton]] as Prew\n* [[Ray Teal]] as Mr. Mollett\n* [[Howland Chamberlain]] as Thorpe\n* Dean White as Novak\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Bullard\n* Michael Hall as Rob Stephenson\n}}\n\nCasting brought together established stars as well as character actors and relative unknowns.

Other Wyler touches included constructing life-size sets, which went against the standard larger sets that were more suited to camera positions.

[[Samuel Goldwyn]] was inspired to produce a film about veterans after reading an August 7, 1944, article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' about the difficulties experienced by men returning to civilian life.

Fred was a captain and [[Bombardier (aircrew)|bombardier]] in Europe. Homer was a [[Petty officer second class|petty officer]]; he lost both hands from burns suffered when his ship was sunk, and now uses mechanical hook [[prostheses]]. Al was an infantry [[platoon sergeant]] in the Pacific. All three have trouble readjusting to civilian life.\n\nAl is a banker with a comfortable apartment and a loving family: wife Milly, adult daughter Peggy, and high-school student son Rob. He is promoted to vice president in charge of small loans, as the president views his military experience as valuable in dealing with other returning servicemen. When Al approves an unsecured loan to a young Navy veteran, despite the man's lack of collateral, the president advises him against making a habit of it. Later, at a banquet in his honor, an inebriated Al expounds that the bank\u2014and America\u2014must stand with the [[Veterans|vets]] and give them every chance to rebuild their lives.\n\nFred, a [[soda jerk]] before the war, wants something better, but the tight labor market forces him to return to his old job. Fred had met and married Marie after a short acquaintance, before shipping out less than a month later. She became a nightclub waitress while Fred was overseas. Marie makes it clear she does not enjoy being married to a lowly soda jerk.\n\nHomer, a high school football quarterback, had become engaged to his next-door neighbor, Wilma, before joining the Navy. He does not want to burden Wilma with his handicap so he eventually pushes her away. However, she still wants to marry him.\n\nPeggy drives her parents around to various nightclubs to celebrate. The last place they stop is a small bar owned and operated by Homer's uncle.  There Al is reunited with Homer and Fred. Peggy and Fred are attracted to each other.\n\nFred finds himself working under a young man who had been Fred's assistant before the war. Peggy drops by, and they have lunch together. Afterward, he suddenly grabs her and kisses her quickly but passionately. He immediately apologizes. Confused and somewhat upset, Peggy gets in her car and drives away. She decides to find out more about Marie in person, and arranges a double-date with herself and a boyfriend. Peggy dislikes Marie, and informs her parents later that night that she intends to end Fred's unhappy marriage. Al demands that Fred stop seeing his daughter. Fred agrees, but the friendship between the two men is strained.\n\nFred is having a casual conversation with Homer at work when an obnoxious customer enrages Homer with his remarks about fighting the wrong enemy in the war. Fred intervenes, knocking the man down and losing his job. Later, Fred encourages Homer to marry Wilma. When Wilma visits Homer at home later that same evening, Homer shows her how hard life with him would be, but she is undaunted.\n\nFred catches his wife with another man when he returns home unexpectedly. They argue, and Marie tells him that she is getting a divorce. \n\nFred decides to leave town to make a fresh start. While waiting for a plane, he wanders into a vast [[aircraft boneyard]]. Inside the nose of a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]], he has a flashback. The boss of a work crew, in charge of disassembling the planes for materials for \"prefabricated houses,\" rouses him. Fred persuades the man to hire him.\n\nAt Homer and Wilma's wedding, Fred, now divorced, is Homer's best man. Fred and Peggy glance at one another. After the ceremony, he takes her in his arms, kisses her and asks if she understands the troubles that lie in store for them. Peggy smiles fondly at him, and then kisses him again.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Entire credited cast, per closing credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Milly Stephenson\n* [[Fredric March]] as Platoon Sergeant Al Stephenson\n* [[Dana Andrews]] as Captain Fred Derry\n* [[Teresa Wright]] as Peggy Stephenson\n* [[Virginia Mayo]] as Marie Derry\n* [[Cathy O'Donnell]] as Wilma Cameron\n* [[Hoagy Carmichael]] as Uncle Butch Engle\n* [[Harold Russell]] as Petty Officer 2nd Class Homer Parrish\n* [[Gladys George]] as Hortense Derry\n* [[Roman Bohnen]] as Pat Derry\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Mr. Milton\n* [[Minna Gombell]] as Mrs. Parrish\n* [[Walter Baldwin]] as Mr. Parrish\n* [[Steve Cochran]] as Cliff\n* [[Dorothy Adams]] as Mrs. Cameron\n* [[Don Beddoe]] as Mr. Cameron\n* Marlene Aames as Luella Parrish\n* [[Charles Halton]] as Prew\n* [[Ray Teal]] as Mr. Mollett\n* [[Howland Chamberlain]] as Thorpe\n* Dean White as Novak\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Bullard\n* Michael Hall as Rob Stephenson\n}}\n\nCasting brought together established stars as well as character actors and relative unknowns.

Michael Hall, with his role as Fredric March's on-screen son, is absent after the first one-third of the film.\n\n== Production ==\nDirector Wyler had flown combat missions over Europe in filming ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress|Memphis Belle]]'' (1944), and worked hard to get accurate depictions of the combat veterans he had encountered. Wyler changed the original casting that had featured a veteran suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and sought out Harold Russell, a non-actor, to take on the exacting role of Homer Parrish.<ref name=\"Orriss p. 121\" />\n\nFor ''The Best Years of Our Lives'', he asked the principal actors to purchase their own clothes, in order to connect with daily life and produce an authentic feeling. Other Wyler touches included constructing life-size sets, which went against the standard larger sets that were more suited to camera positions.

He played in 34 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] and took 139 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 24.70. The first [[Pakistani]] to pass 100 wickets, he reached the landmark in his 22nd match.\n\nFazal played his earliest [[first-class cricket|first-class]] cricket for [[Northern India cricket team|Northern India]] in the [[Ranji Trophy]] and strong performances there led to selection for India's inaugural tour of Australia in 1947\u201348. The [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]], prior to the tour led Fazal, a Muslim, to withdraw and choose Pakistan. He played a major role in first gaining Test status for the new nation and then establishing them as a Test match team. He took ten wickets in a Test on four occasions; those against [[India national cricket team|India]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] coming in Pakistan's maiden victories over those teams. Fazal's most memorable performance came on the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 1954|1954 tour of England]], when he had a leading role as Pakistan won at [[The Oval]] to square the series. He took [[Bowling analysis|match figures]] of 12/99, including 6/46 in the second [[innings]] as England [[List of cricket terms#C|collapsed]] chasing a target of 168.\n\nSucceeding [[Abdul Kardar]] as [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], Fazal led the national team in 10 matches between 1959 and 1961.

In all Pakistan won two Tests and lost two under his leadership. He retired from Test and first-class cricket following the 1962 tour of England when he was called up to replace injured opening bowlers.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in Lahore, Fazal attended Islamia College, Lahore, from the age of 13.

team|Pakistani]] [[cricket]]er. He played in 34 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] and took 139 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 24.70. The first [[Pakistani]] to pass 100 wickets, he reached the landmark in his 22nd match.\n\nFazal played his earliest [[first-class cricket|first-class]] cricket for [[Northern India cricket team|Northern India]] in the [[Ranji Trophy]] and strong performances there led to selection for India's inaugural tour of Australia in 1947\u201348. The [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]], prior to the tour led Fazal, a Muslim, to withdraw and choose Pakistan. He played a major role in first gaining Test status for the new nation and then establishing them as a Test match team. He took ten wickets in a Test on four occasions; those against [[India national cricket team|India]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] coming in Pakistan's maiden victories over those teams. Fazal's most memorable performance came on the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 1954|1954 tour of England]], when he had a leading role as Pakistan won at [[The Oval]] to square the series. He took [[Bowling analysis|match figures]] of 12/99, including 6/46 in the second [[innings]] as England [[List of cricket terms#C|collapsed]] chasing a target of 168.\n\nSucceeding [[Abdul Kardar]] as [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], Fazal led the national team in 10 matches between 1959 and 1961. He had immediate success against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] but after losing to Australia and a stalemate with [[India national cricket team|India]] he was sacked as captain. In all Pakistan won two Tests and lost two under his leadership. He retired from Test and first-class cricket following the 1962 tour of England when he was called up to replace injured opening bowlers.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in Lahore, Fazal attended Islamia College, Lahore, from the age of 13.
