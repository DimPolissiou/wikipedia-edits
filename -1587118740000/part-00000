Ballet spread from [[Italy]] to [[France]] with the help of [[Catherine de' Medici]], where ballet developed even further under her aristocratic influence.  An early example of Catherine's development of ballet is through 'Le Paradis d' Amour', a piece of work presented at her daughter's wedding, [[Margaret of Valois|Marguerite de Valois]] to [[Henry of Navarre]].  Aristocratic money was responsible for the initial stages of development in 'court ballet', as it was royal money that dictated the ideas, literature and music used in ballets that were created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time.  The first formal 'court ballet' ever recognized was staged in 1573, 'Ballet des Polonais'.  In true form of royal entertainment, 'Ballet des Polonais' was commissioned by Catherine de' Medici to honor the [[Poland|Polish]] ambassadors who were visiting [[Paris]] upon the accession of [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]] to the throne of Poland.  In 1581, Catherine de' Medici commissioned another court ballet, ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', however it was her compatriot, [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]], who organized the ballet. Catherine de' Medici and Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx were responsible for presenting the first court ballet ever to apply the principles of Baif's Academie, by integrating poetry, dance, music and set design to convey a unified dramatic storyline.  Moreover, the early organization and development of 'court ballet' was funded by, influenced by and produced by the aristocrats of the time, fulfilling both their personal entertainment and political propaganda needs.\n\nIn the late 17th century [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] founded the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique (the [[Paris Opera]]) within which emerged the first professional theatrical [[ballet company]], the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]. The predominance of French in the [[Glossary of ballet|vocabulary of ballet]] reflects this history. Theatrical ballet soon became an independent form of art, although still frequently maintaining a close association with opera, and spread from the heart of Europe to other nations. The [[Royal Danish Ballet]] and the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of the [[Russian Empire]] were founded in the 1740s and began to flourish, especially after about 1850. In 1907 the Russian ballet in turn moved back to France, where the [[Ballets Russes]] of [[Sergei Diaghilev]] and its successors were particularly influential. Soon ballet spread around the world with the formation of new companies, including London's [[The Royal Ballet]] (1931), the [[San Francisco Ballet]] (1933), [[American Ballet Theatre]] (1937), the [[Royal Winnipeg Ballet]] (1939), [[The Australian Ballet]] (1940), the [[New York City Ballet]] (1948), the [[National Ballet of Canada]] (1951), and the [[National Ballet Academy and Trust of India]] (2002).<ref>[http://delhiballet.blogspot.com.au/2009/03/national-ballet-academy-trust-of-india.html?m=1 National Ballet Academy & Trust of India] in [[New Delhi, India]].

The word ''ballet'' comes from French and was borrowed into English around the 17th century. The French word in turn has its origins in Italian ''balletto'', a [[diminutive]] of ''ballo'' (dance). ''Ballet'' ultimately traces back to [[Italian language|Italian]] ''ballare'', meaning ''\"to dance\"''.<ref>Chantrell (2002), p. 42.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\n===Renaissance \u2013 Italy and France===\n{{Main|Renaissance dance}}\n[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumbnail|right|180px|Engraving of the second scene of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', staged in Paris in 1581 for the French court.]]\nBallet originated in the [[Renaissance]] [[royal court|court]] as an outgrowth of court pageantry in [[Italy]],<ref>Kirstein (1952), p. 4.</ref> where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations.

Styles of entertainment were imitated, including the royal ballets. Courts in Spain, Portugal, Poland, Germany, and elsewhere all became audiences and participants in ballets. In addition to France, Italy became an important influence on the art form, predominantly [[Venice]].\n\nProfessional ballet troupes began to organize and tour Europe, performing for aristocratic audiences. In Poland, King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]] (1633\u20131648) hosted Italian opera productions, which included ballet performers in some scenes. The famous European ballet-masters who worked for the Polish court include [[Jean Favier]], [[Antoine Pitrot]], [[Antonio Sacco]] and [[Francesco Caselli]].<ref name=\"Polish National Ballet History\">{{cite web|title=Polish National Ballet History|url=http://www.teatrwielki.pl/en/polish_national_ballet/history/our_story.html|publisher=Polish National Theatre|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==18th century==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n\n===France and development as an art form===\n<!--following unverified-->\nThe 18th century was a period of advancement in the technical standards of ballet and the period when ballet became a serious dramatic art form on par with the opera. Central to this advance was the seminal work of [[Jean-Georges Noverre]], ''Lettres sur la danse et les ballets'' (1760), which focused on developing the [[ballet d'action]], in which the movements of the dancers are designed to express character and assist in the narrative. Noverre believed that: ballet should be technical but also move the audience emotionally, plots need to be unified, the scenery and music need to support the plot and be unified within the story, and that pantomime needs to be simple and understandable.<ref>Kassing, Gayle. History of dance : an interactive arts approach. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 2007. Print.</ref>\n\nReforms were made in ballet composition by composers such as [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]. Finally, ballet was divided into three formal techniques ''s\u00e9rieux'', ''demi-caract\u00e8re'' and ''comique''. Ballet also began to be featured in operas as interludes called divertissements.\n\n===Outside France===\nVenice continued to be a centre of dance in Europe, particularly during the [[Venice Carnival]], when dancers and visitors from across the continent would travel to the city for a lively cultural exchange. The city's [[Teatro San Benedetto]] became a famous landmark largely due to the ballets performed there. Italian ballet techniques remained the dominant influence in much of southern and eastern Europe until Russian techniques supplanted them in the early 20th century.\n\nBallet performances spread to Eastern Europe during the 18th century, into areas such as Hungary, where they were held in private theatres at aristocratic castles. Professional companies were established that performed throughout Hungary and also toured abroad. The Budapest National Theatre increasingly serving a role as a home for the dancers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hungarian National Ballet|url=http://www.opera.hu/en/balett/magyar_nemzeti_balett_tortenete|publisher=Hungarian State Opera House|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSome of the leading dancers of the time who performed throughout Europe were [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (dancer)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]], [[Charles Le Picque]] with [[Anna Binetti]], [[Gaetano Vestris]], and [[Jean-Georges Noverre]].<ref name=\"Polish National Ballet History\"/>\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Ballet Carneval von Venedig Berlin 1827.jpg|thumb|180px|Polish ballet performers at the 1827 [[Venice Carnival]]. \nThe dancer on the left is performing \"en travestie\" as a woman taking the man's role.]]\nThe [[ballerina]] became the most popular dance performer in Europe in the first half of the 19th century, gradually turning the spotlight away from the male dancer.

Ballerinas such as [[Genevi\u00e8ve Gosselin]], [[Marie Taglioni]] and [[Fanny Elssler]] experimented with new techniques such as [[pointework]] that gave the ballerina prominence as the ideal stage figure. Taglioni was known as the \"Christian Dancer,\" as her image was light and pure (associated with her role as the sylph in La Sylphide). She was trained primarily by her father, Filipo Taglioni. In 1834, Fanny Elssler arrived at the Paris Opera and became known as the \"Pagan Dancer,\" because of the fiery qualities of the ''Cachucha'' dance that made her famous.  Professional librettists began crafting the stories in ballets. Teachers like [[Carlo Blasis]] codified ballet technique in the basic form that is still used today. The ballet boxed toe shoe was invented to support pointe work.\n\n===Romantic movement===\n{{Main|Romantic ballet}}\n[[File:Marie-taglioni-in-zephire.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Marie Taglioni]] as Flore in [[Charles Didelot]]'s ballet ''[[Flore et Z\u00e9phire]]'' (ca. 1831). She was a pioneer of [[en pointe|pointework]].]]\nThe [[Romantic movement]] in art, literature, and theatre was a reaction against formal constraints and the mechanics of industrialization.[22] The [[zeitgeist]] led choreographers to compose romantic ballets that appeared light, airy and free that would act as a contrast to the spread of reductionist science through many aspects of daily life that had, in the words of Poe, \"driven the hamadryad from the woods\". These \"unreal\" ballets portrayed women as fragile unearthly beings, ethereal creatures who could be lifted effortlessly and almost seemed to float in the air. Ballerinas began to wear costumes with pastel, flowing skirts that bared the shins. The stories revolved around uncanny, folkloric spirits. An example of one such romantic ballet is ''[[La Sylphide]]'', one of the oldest romantic ballets still performed today.\n\nOne strain of the Romantic movement was a new exploration of folklore and traditional ethnic culture. This influence was seen in the emergence of European folk dance and western portrayals of African, Asian, and Middle East peoples on European stages.  In ballets from this period, non-European characters were often created as villains or as silly divertisements to fit the [[Orientalism|orientalist]] western understanding of the world.<ref name=Macaulay/>  The [[National Opera of Ukraine]], a performing arts theatre with a resident opera company, was established in [[Kiev]] in 1867. It also included a small resident troupe of ballet dancers, who would perform mainly folk-style dancing during opera productions. By 1893, this grew to a troupe large enough to stage large ballets. Folk dancing and ballets with Ukrainian stories were among the early productions.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bleiberg|first=Laura|title=Kiev Ballet cleaves to the classics|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/ballet-83686-kiev-nutcracker.html|accessdate=March 10, 2012|newspaper=Orange County Register|date=December 9, 2005}}</ref>\n\nMany leading European professional ballet companies that survive today were established at new theatres in Europe's capital cities during the mid- to late- 19th century, including the [[Kiev Ballet]], the [[Hungarian National Ballet]], the [[National Theatre Ballet (Prague)]] and the [[Vienna State Ballet]] (formerly the [[Vienna State Opera]] Ballet). These theatres usually combined large opera, drama and ballet companies under the same roof. Composers, dramatists, and choreographers were then able to create works that took advantage of the ability to collaborate among these performance troupes.\n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Russian ballet}}\n[[File:Swanlakemordkin.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Mikhail Mordkin]] as Prince Siegfried and [[Adelaide Giuri]] as Odette with students as the little swans in the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre's production of the Petipa/Ivanov/Tchaikovsky ''[[Swan Lake]]''. 1901]]\nWhile France was instrumental in early ballet, other countries and cultures soon adopted the art form, most notably Russia. Russia has a recognized tradition of ballet, and Russian ballet has had great importance in its country throughout history. \nAfter 1850, ballet began to wane in Paris, but it flourished in [[Denmark]] and [[Russia]] thanks to masters such as [[August Bournonville]], [[Jules Perrot]], [[Arthur Saint-L\u00e9on]], [[Enrico Cecchetti]] and [[Marius Petipa]]. In the late nineteenth century, [[orientalism]] was in vogue. Colonialism brought awareness of Asian and African cultures, but distorted with disinformation and fantasy. The East was often perceived as a faraway place where anything was possible, provided it was lavish, exotic and decadent. \nPetipa appealed to popular taste with ''[[The Pharaoh's Daughter]]'' (1862), and later ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|The Talisman]]'' (1889), and ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'' (1877). Petipa is best remembered for his collaborations with [[Tchaikovsky]]. He used his music for his choreography of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' (1892, though this is open to some debate among historians), ''[[The Sleeping Beauty Ballet|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1890), and the definitive revival of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' (1895, with [[Lev Ivanov]]). These works were all drawn from European folklore.\n\nThe female dancers' classical [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] as it is recognized today began to appear at this time. It consisted of a short, stiff skirt supported by layers of crinoline or tulle that revealed the acrobatic legwork, combined with a wide gusset that served to preserve modesty.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Argentina===\nBallet companies from Europe began lucrative tours of theatres in North, Central and South America during the mid-19th century. The prestigious  [[Colon Theater]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina had hosted foreign ballet artists on its stage, with touring companies from Europe presenting full ballets as early as 1867.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Foster, David William|author2=Melissa Fitch Lockhart|author3=Darrell B.

It would still be several decades before most countries outside of Europe could claim their own professional ballet companies, however.\n\n==20th century and modernism==\n\n===Russia and the Ballets Russes===\n[[File:Pavlova Anna as a bacchante in The Seasons.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Anna Pavlova]] as a [[bacchante]] in ''[[Bacchanale]]'' by [[Mikhail Mordkin]].]]\n\n[[Sergei Diaghilev]] brought ballet full-circle back to Paris when he opened his company, [[Ballets Russes]]. It was made up of dancers from the Russian exile community in Paris after the Revolution.\n\nDiaghilev and composer [[Igor Stravinsky]] merged their talents to bring Russian folklore to life in ''[[The Firebird]]'' and ''[[Petrushka]]'' choreographed by Fokine. Diaghilev's next choreographic commissions went to Nijinsky. His First ballet was ''L'apres-midi d'un Faune'' (Afternoon of a Faun) to music by Debussy. It was notable for its two dimensional shapes and lack of ballet technique. It caused controversy by depicting the faun rubbing the scarf of one of the maidens on himself, in simulated masturbation. The most controversial work of the Ballets Russes however, was ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', choreographed by Nijinsky with music by Stravinsky. The ballet's modern music, pigeon toed stomping and theme of human sacrifice shocked audiences so much they rioted.\n\nAfter the \u201cgolden age\u201d of Petipa, [[Michel Fokine]] began his career in St. Petersburg but moved to Paris and worked with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes.\n\n[[File:Vaslav Nijinsky in Le spectre de la rose 1911 Royal Opera House.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vaslav Nijinsky]] in ''[[The Spectre of the Rose]]'', 1911.]]\nRussian ballet continued development under Soviet rule. There was little talent left in the country after the Revolution, but it was enough to seed a new generation. After stagnation in the 1920s, by the mid-1930s that new generation of dancers and choreographers appeared on the scene. The technical perfection and precision of dance was promoted (and demanded) by [[Agrippina Vaganova]], who had been taught by Petipa and Cecchetti and headed the [[Vaganova Ballet Academy]], the school to prepare dancers for the Kirov Ballet in St. Petersburg/Leningrad.\n\nBallet was popular with the public. Both the Moscow-based Bolshoi and the St. Petersburg (then Leningrad)-based Kirov ballet companies were active. Ideological pressure forced the creation of many [[socialist realist]] pieces, most of which made little impression on the public and were removed from the repertoire of both companies later.\n\nSome pieces of that era, however, were remarkable. The ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[Prokofiev]] and [[Leonid Lavrovsky|Lavrovsky]] is a masterpiece. The ''[[Flames of Paris]]'', while it shows all the faults of socialist realist art, pioneered the active use of the corps de ballet in the performance and required stunning virtuosity. The [[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai (ballet)|ballet version]] of the [[Pushkin]] poem, ''[[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai]]'' with music from [[Boris Asafiev]] and choreography by [[Rostislav Zakharov]] was also a hit.\n\nThe well-known ballet ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]'', for which Prokofiev provided the music, is also the product of the Soviet ballet. During the Soviet era, these pieces were mostly unknown outside the [[Soviet Union]] and later outside of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union they received more recognition.\n\nThe 1999 North American premiere of ''[[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai (ballet)|The Fountain of Bakhchisarai]]'' by the Kirov Ballet in New York was an outstanding success, for example. The Soviet era of the Russian Ballet put a lot of emphasis on technique, virtuosity and strength. It demanded strength usually above the norm of contemporary Western dancers. When watching restored old footage, one can only marvel at the talent of their prima ballerinas such as [[Galina Ulanova]], [[Natalya Dudinskaya]] and [[Maya Plisetskaya]] and choreographers such as [[Pyotr Gusev]].\n\nRussian companies, particularly after World War II engaged in multiple tours all over the world that revitalized ballet in the West.\n\n''[[Maiden Tower (ballet)|Maiden Tower]]''<ref name=\"me1\">\u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u0413\u043b. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u042e. \u0412. \u041a\u0435\u043b\u0434\u044b\u0448. \u0422 1. \u0410 \u2014 \u0413\u043e\u043d\u0433. 1072 \u0441\u0442\u0431. \u0441 \u0438\u043b\u043b. \u041c.: \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1973</ref> written by [[Afrasiyab Badalbeyli]] is the first ballet in the [[Muslim]] East.<ref>[http://www.analytique.md/index.php?n=725&r=21&s=737 \u0427\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0437 \u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432: \u00ab\u0412\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043e\u0442\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441, \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044b \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u00bb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124754/http://www.analytique.md/index.php?n=725&r=21&s=737 |date=May 31, 2014 }} <blockquote>\u2026\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0443\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441.</blockquote></ref><ref>\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u0413\u043b. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0410. \u041c. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, 3-\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434. \u0422. 1. \u0410 \u2014 \u0410\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0431. 1969. 608 \u0441\u0442\u0440., \u0438\u043b\u043b.; 47 \u043b. \u0438\u043b\u043b. \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442, 1 \u043e\u0442\u0434. \u043b. \u0442\u0430\u0431\u043b.</ref><ref name=\"me1\" />\n\n===United States of America===\nFollowing the move of the Ballets Russes to France, ballet began to have a broader influence, particularly in the United States of America.\n\nFrom Paris, after disagreements with Diaghilev, Fokine went to Sweden and then the US and settled in New York. Diaghilev believed that traditional ballet offered little more than prettiness and athletic display. For Fokine that was not enough. In addition to technical virtuosity he demanded drama, expression and historical authenticity. The choreographer must research the period and cultural context of the setting and reject the traditional tutu in favour of accurate period costuming.\n\nFokine choreographed ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Sheherazade]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra ballet|Cleopatra]]''. He also reworked ''Petrouchka'' and ''The Firebird''. One of his most famous works was ''[[The Dying Swan]]'', performed by [[Anna Pavlova]]. Beyond her talents as a ballerina, Pavlova had the theatrical gifts to fulfill Fokine's vision of ballet as drama. Legend has it that Pavlova identified so much with the swan role that she requested her swan costume from her deathbed.\n\n[[File:La Mort du Cygne 1 Anna Pavlova 2 Yvette Chauvire 3 Natalia Makarova.mpg.OGG|thumb|200px|''[[The Dying Swan]]'' choreographed by [[Fokine]], performed by three soloists (shown in order): 1.

[[Natalia Makarova]] (14 seconds).]]\n\n[[George Balanchine]] developed state-of-the-art technique in America by opening a school in Chicago and more importantly, in New York. He adapted ballet to the new media, movies and television.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://balanchine.org/01/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113123111/http://balanchine.org/01/index.html |archivedate=November 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }} George Balanchine</ref> A prolific worker, Balanchine rechoreographed classics such as ''Swan Lake'' and ''Sleeping Beauty'' as well as creating new ballets. He produced original interpretations of the dramas of [[William Shakespeare]] such as ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', and also of Franz L\u00e9har's ''[[The Merry Widow]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Balanchine's ''[[Jewels (ballet)|Jewels]]'' broke with the narrative tradition and dramatized a theme rather than a plot.  This focus fits with the state-sponsored funding sources in the United States which sought to encourage \"liberty and freethinking\" in contrast to narrative-driven dance, which was seen as to be connected too closely with socialism, especially [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|Soviet communism]].<ref name=Kiley>{{cite news\n | last =Kiley\n | first =Brendan\n | title =Old Is the New New: The Cold War and Don Quixote at Pacific Northwest Ballet\n | newspaper=The Stranger\n | location =Seattle, United States\n | date =February 7, 2012\n | url =http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/old-is-the-new-new/Content?oid=12374139\n | accessdate = February 10, 2012}}</ref>  Today, partly thanks to Balanchine, ballet is one of the most well-preserved dances in the world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nBarbara Karinska was a Russian emigree and a skilled seamstress who collaborated with Balanchine to elevate the art of costume design from a secondary role to an integral part of a ballet performance. She introduced the [[bias cut]] and a simplified classic tutu that allowed the dancer more freedom of movement. With meticulous attention to detail, she decorated her tutus with beadwork, embroidery, crochet and appliqu\u00e9.\n\n==Neoclassical ballet==\n{{Main|Neoclassical ballet}}\n[[File:Ballets Russes - Apollo musag\u00e8te.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ballets Russes]] with ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' (1928) choreographed by [[George Balanchine]]. Dancers are [[Alexandrova Danilova]] and [[Serge Lifar]].]]\n[[George Balanchine]] is often considered to have been the first pioneer of what is now known as [[neoclassical ballet]], a style of dance between classical ballet and today's contemporary ballet. Tim Scholl, author of ''From Petipa to Balanchine'', considers Balanchine's ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' (1928) to be the first neoclassical ballet. It represented a return to form in response to [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s abstract ballets. ''Apollo'' and other works are still performed today, predominantly by the [[New York City Ballet]]. However, other companies are able to pay a fee for performance rights to George Balanchine's works.\n\n[[Frederick Ashton]] is another prominent choreographer associated with the neoclassical style. Three of his works have become standard pieces in the international repertoire: ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]'' (1952), ''[[Romeo and Juliet (ballet)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1956), and ''[[Ondine (ballet)|Ondine]]'' (1958), the last of which was created as a vehicle to showcase [[Margot Fonteyn]].\n\n==Contemporary==\n{{Main|Contemporary ballet}}\n[[File:Allah Garibou.jpg|thumb|200px|A 2010 performance of [[Ir\u00e8ne Tassemb\u00e9do]]'s [[contemporary ballet]] piece [[Allah Garibou]].]]\nOne dancer who trained with Balanchine and absorbed much of this neo-classical style was [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]. Following Baryshnikov's appointment as artistic director of [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably [[Twyla Tharp]]. Tharp choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976; in 1986 she created ''In The Upper Room'' for her own company. Both these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers\u2014for their use of contemporary ballet.\n\nTharp also worked with the [[Joffrey Ballet]] company, founded in 1957 by [[Robert Joffrey]]. She choreographed ''[[Deuce Coupe]]'' for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet techniques. The Joffrey Ballet continued to perform numerous contemporary pieces, many choreographed by co-founder [[Gerald Arpino]].\n\nToday there are many  contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include [[Madrid Ballet]]; [[Royal Ballet of Flanders]]; [[Alonzo King]] and his company, [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]]; Nacho Duato and [[Compa\u00f1ia Nacional de Danza]]; William Forsythe, who has worked extensively with the [[Frankfurt Ballet]] and today runs [[The Forsythe Company]]; and [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n]], formerly the artistic director of the [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. Traditionally \"classical\" companies, such as the [[Kirov Ballet]] and the [[Paris Opera Ballet]], also regularly perform contemporary works.\n\n==Development of ballet method==\n{{Main|Ballet training}}\nSeveral well-known ballet methods are named after their originators. For example, two prevailing systems from Russia are known as the [[Vaganova method]] after [[Agrippina Vaganova]], and the Legat Method, after [[Nikolai Legat]]. The [[Cecchetti method]] was invented by Italian dancer [[Enrico Cecchetti]] (1850\u20131928), and the Bournonville method, which was invented by [[August Bournonville]] (1805\u20131879), is employed chiefly in Bournonville's own country of Denmark.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of ballets by title]]\n*[[Ballet music]]\n*[[History of dance]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name=Macaulay>{{cite news\n | last =Macaulay\n | first =Alastair\n | title =Stereotypes in Toeshoes\n | newspaper =New York Times\n | location =New York, United States\n | pages =\n | publisher =\n | date =5 September 2012\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/arts/dance/ballet-clings-to-racial-ethnic-and-national-stereotypes.html?_r=1&ref=dance\n | accessdate = 5 September 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Jack |title=Ballet & Modern Dance: A Concise History |edition=2nd |year=1992 |publisher=Princeton Book Company, Publishers |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=0-87127-172-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/balletmoderndanc00ande_0 }}\n* Andre, Paul; Arkadyev, V.

Ballet spread from [[Italy]] to [[France]] with the help of [[Catherine de' Medici]], where ballet developed even further under her aristocratic influence.  An early example of Catherine's development of ballet is through 'Le Paradis d' Amour', a piece of work presented at her daughter's wedding, [[Margaret of Valois|Marguerite de Valois]] to [[Henry of Navarre]].  Aristocratic money was responsible for the initial stages of development in 'court ballet', as it was royal money that dictated the ideas, literature and music used in ballets that were created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time.  The first formal 'court ballet' ever recognized was staged in 1573, 'Ballet des Polonais'.  In true form of royal entertainment, 'Ballet des Polonais' was commissioned by Catherine de' Medici to honor the [[Poland|Polish]] ambassadors who were visiting [[Paris]] upon the accession of [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]] to the throne of Poland.  In 1581, Catherine de' Medici commissioned another court ballet, ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', however it was her compatriot, [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]], who organized the ballet. Catherine de' Medici and Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx were responsible for presenting the first court ballet ever to apply the principles of Baif's Academie, by integrating poetry, dance, music and set design to convey a unified dramatic storyline.  Moreover, the early organization and development of 'court ballet' was funded by, influenced by and produced by the aristocrats of the time, fulfilling both their personal entertainment and political propaganda needs.\n\nIn the late 17th century [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] founded the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique (the [[Paris Opera]]) within which emerged the first professional theatrical [[ballet company]], the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]. The predominance of French in the [[Glossary of ballet|vocabulary of ballet]] reflects this history. Theatrical ballet soon became an independent form of art, although still frequently maintaining a close association with opera, and spread from the heart of Europe to other nations. The [[Royal Danish Ballet]] and the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of the [[Russian Empire]] were founded in the 1740s and began to flourish, especially after about 1850. In 1907 the Russian ballet in turn moved back to France, where the [[Ballets Russes]] of [[Sergei Diaghilev]] and its successors were particularly influential. Soon ballet spread around the world with the formation of new companies, including London's [[The Royal Ballet]] (1931), the [[San Francisco Ballet]] (1933), [[American Ballet Theatre]] (1937), the [[Royal Winnipeg Ballet]] (1939), [[The Australian Ballet]] (1940), the [[New York City Ballet]] (1948), the [[National Ballet of Canada]] (1951), and the [[National Ballet Academy and Trust of India]] (2002).<ref>[http://delhiballet.blogspot.com.au/2009/03/national-ballet-academy-trust-of-india.html?m=1 National Ballet Academy & Trust of India] in [[New Delhi, India]].

The word ''ballet'' comes from French and was borrowed into English around the 17th century. The French word in turn has its origins in Italian ''balletto'', a [[diminutive]] of ''ballo'' (dance). ''Ballet'' ultimately traces back to [[Italian language|Italian]] ''ballare'', meaning ''\"to dance\"''.<ref>Chantrell (2002), p. 42.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\n===Renaissance \u2013 Italy and France===\n{{Main|Renaissance dance}}\n[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumbnail|right|180px|Engraving of the second scene of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', staged in Paris in 1581 for the French court.]]\nBallet originated in the [[Renaissance]] [[royal court|court]] as an outgrowth of court pageantry in [[Italy]],<ref>Kirstein (1952), p. 4.</ref> where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations.

An elaborate dance entertainment was arranged for the celebrations by the Italian dance master Bergonzio di Botta. The dances were linked by a slim narrative concerning [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], and each corresponded to a different course for the dinner.

Styles of entertainment were imitated, including the royal ballets. Courts in Spain, Portugal, Poland, Germany, and elsewhere all became audiences and participants in ballets. In addition to France, Italy became an important influence on the art form, predominantly [[Venice]].\n\nProfessional ballet troupes began to organize and tour Europe, performing for aristocratic audiences. In Poland, King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]] (1633\u20131648) hosted Italian opera productions, which included ballet performers in some scenes. The famous European ballet-masters who worked for the Polish court include [[Jean Favier]], [[Antoine Pitrot]], [[Antonio Sacco]] and [[Francesco Caselli]].<ref name=\"Polish National Ballet History\">{{cite web|title=Polish National Ballet History|url=http://www.teatrwielki.pl/en/polish_national_ballet/history/our_story.html|publisher=Polish National Theatre|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==18th century==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n\n===France and development as an art form===\n<!--following unverified-->\nThe 18th century was a period of advancement in the technical standards of ballet and the period when ballet became a serious dramatic art form on par with the opera. Central to this advance was the seminal work of [[Jean-Georges Noverre]], ''Lettres sur la danse et les ballets'' (1760), which focused on developing the [[ballet d'action]], in which the movements of the dancers are designed to express character and assist in the narrative. Noverre believed that: ballet should be technical but also move the audience emotionally, plots need to be unified, the scenery and music need to support the plot and be unified within the story, and that pantomime needs to be simple and understandable.<ref>Kassing, Gayle. History of dance : an interactive arts approach. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 2007. Print.</ref>\n\nReforms were made in ballet composition by composers such as [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]. Finally, ballet was divided into three formal techniques ''s\u00e9rieux'', ''demi-caract\u00e8re'' and ''comique''. Ballet also began to be featured in operas as interludes called divertissements.\n\n===Outside France===\nVenice continued to be a centre of dance in Europe, particularly during the [[Venice Carnival]], when dancers and visitors from across the continent would travel to the city for a lively cultural exchange. The city's [[Teatro San Benedetto]] became a famous landmark largely due to the ballets performed there. Italian ballet techniques remained the dominant influence in much of southern and eastern Europe until Russian techniques supplanted them in the early 20th century.\n\nBallet performances spread to Eastern Europe during the 18th century, into areas such as Hungary, where they were held in private theatres at aristocratic castles. Professional companies were established that performed throughout Hungary and also toured abroad. The Budapest National Theatre increasingly serving a role as a home for the dancers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hungarian National Ballet|url=http://www.opera.hu/en/balett/magyar_nemzeti_balett_tortenete|publisher=Hungarian State Opera House|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSome of the leading dancers of the time who performed throughout Europe were [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (dancer)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]], [[Charles Le Picque]] with [[Anna Binetti]], [[Gaetano Vestris]], and [[Jean-Georges Noverre]].<ref name=\"Polish National Ballet History\"/>\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Ballet Carneval von Venedig Berlin 1827.jpg|thumb|180px|Polish ballet performers at the 1827 [[Venice Carnival]]. \nThe dancer on the left is performing \"en travestie\" as a woman taking the man's role.]]\nThe [[ballerina]] became the most popular dance performer in Europe in the first half of the 19th century, gradually turning the spotlight away from the male dancer.

Ballerinas such as [[Genevi\u00e8ve Gosselin]], [[Marie Taglioni]] and [[Fanny Elssler]] experimented with new techniques such as [[pointework]] that gave the ballerina prominence as the ideal stage figure. Taglioni was known as the \"Christian Dancer,\" as her image was light and pure (associated with her role as the sylph in La Sylphide). She was trained primarily by her father, Filipo Taglioni. In 1834, Fanny Elssler arrived at the Paris Opera and became known as the \"Pagan Dancer,\" because of the fiery qualities of the ''Cachucha'' dance that made her famous.  Professional librettists began crafting the stories in ballets. Teachers like [[Carlo Blasis]] codified ballet technique in the basic form that is still used today. The ballet boxed toe shoe was invented to support pointe work.\n\n===Romantic movement===\n{{Main|Romantic ballet}}\n[[File:Marie-taglioni-in-zephire.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Marie Taglioni]] as Flore in [[Charles Didelot]]'s ballet ''[[Flore et Z\u00e9phire]]'' (ca. 1831). She was a pioneer of [[en pointe|pointework]].]]\nThe [[Romantic movement]] in art, literature, and theatre was a reaction against formal constraints and the mechanics of industrialization.[22] The [[zeitgeist]] led choreographers to compose romantic ballets that appeared light, airy and free that would act as a contrast to the spread of reductionist science through many aspects of daily life that had, in the words of Poe, \"driven the hamadryad from the woods\". These \"unreal\" ballets portrayed women as fragile unearthly beings, ethereal creatures who could be lifted effortlessly and almost seemed to float in the air. Ballerinas began to wear costumes with pastel, flowing skirts that bared the shins. The stories revolved around uncanny, folkloric spirits. An example of one such romantic ballet is ''[[La Sylphide]]'', one of the oldest romantic ballets still performed today.\n\nOne strain of the Romantic movement was a new exploration of folklore and traditional ethnic culture. This influence was seen in the emergence of European folk dance and western portrayals of African, Asian, and Middle East peoples on European stages.  In ballets from this period, non-European characters were often created as villains or as silly divertisements to fit the [[Orientalism|orientalist]] western understanding of the world.<ref name=Macaulay/>  The [[National Opera of Ukraine]], a performing arts theatre with a resident opera company, was established in [[Kiev]] in 1867. It also included a small resident troupe of ballet dancers, who would perform mainly folk-style dancing during opera productions. By 1893, this grew to a troupe large enough to stage large ballets. Folk dancing and ballets with Ukrainian stories were among the early productions.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bleiberg|first=Laura|title=Kiev Ballet cleaves to the classics|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/ballet-83686-kiev-nutcracker.html|accessdate=March 10, 2012|newspaper=Orange County Register|date=December 9, 2005}}</ref>\n\nMany leading European professional ballet companies that survive today were established at new theatres in Europe's capital cities during the mid- to late- 19th century, including the [[Kiev Ballet]], the [[Hungarian National Ballet]], the [[National Theatre Ballet (Prague)]] and the [[Vienna State Ballet]] (formerly the [[Vienna State Opera]] Ballet). These theatres usually combined large opera, drama and ballet companies under the same roof. Composers, dramatists, and choreographers were then able to create works that took advantage of the ability to collaborate among these performance troupes.\n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Russian ballet}}\n[[File:Swanlakemordkin.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Mikhail Mordkin]] as Prince Siegfried and [[Adelaide Giuri]] as Odette with students as the little swans in the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre's production of the Petipa/Ivanov/Tchaikovsky ''[[Swan Lake]]''. 1901]]\nWhile France was instrumental in early ballet, other countries and cultures soon adopted the art form, most notably Russia. Russia has a recognized tradition of ballet, and Russian ballet has had great importance in its country throughout history. \nAfter 1850, ballet began to wane in Paris, but it flourished in [[Denmark]] and [[Russia]] thanks to masters such as [[August Bournonville]], [[Jules Perrot]], [[Arthur Saint-L\u00e9on]], [[Enrico Cecchetti]] and [[Marius Petipa]]. In the late nineteenth century, [[orientalism]] was in vogue. Colonialism brought awareness of Asian and African cultures, but distorted with disinformation and fantasy. The East was often perceived as a faraway place where anything was possible, provided it was lavish, exotic and decadent. \nPetipa appealed to popular taste with ''[[The Pharaoh's Daughter]]'' (1862), and later ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|The Talisman]]'' (1889), and ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'' (1877). Petipa is best remembered for his collaborations with [[Tchaikovsky]]. He used his music for his choreography of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' (1892, though this is open to some debate among historians), ''[[The Sleeping Beauty Ballet|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1890), and the definitive revival of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' (1895, with [[Lev Ivanov]]). These works were all drawn from European folklore.\n\nThe female dancers' classical [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] as it is recognized today began to appear at this time. It consisted of a short, stiff skirt supported by layers of crinoline or tulle that revealed the acrobatic legwork, combined with a wide gusset that served to preserve modesty.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Argentina===\nBallet companies from Europe began lucrative tours of theatres in North, Central and South America during the mid-19th century. The prestigious  [[Colon Theater]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina had hosted foreign ballet artists on its stage, with touring companies from Europe presenting full ballets as early as 1867.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Foster, David William|author2=Melissa Fitch Lockhart|author3=Darrell B.

It would still be several decades before most countries outside of Europe could claim their own professional ballet companies, however.\n\n==20th century and modernism==\n\n===Russia and the Ballets Russes===\n[[File:Pavlova Anna as a bacchante in The Seasons.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Anna Pavlova]] as a [[bacchante]] in ''[[Bacchanale]]'' by [[Mikhail Mordkin]].]]\n\n[[Sergei Diaghilev]] brought ballet full-circle back to Paris when he opened his company, [[Ballets Russes]]. It was made up of dancers from the Russian exile community in Paris after the Revolution.\n\nDiaghilev and composer [[Igor Stravinsky]] merged their talents to bring Russian folklore to life in ''[[The Firebird]]'' and ''[[Petrushka]]'' choreographed by Fokine. Diaghilev's next choreographic commissions went to Nijinsky. His First ballet was ''L'apres-midi d'un Faune'' (Afternoon of a Faun) to music by Debussy. It was notable for its two dimensional shapes and lack of ballet technique. It caused controversy by depicting the faun rubbing the scarf of one of the maidens on himself, in simulated masturbation. The most controversial work of the Ballets Russes however, was ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', choreographed by Nijinsky with music by Stravinsky. The ballet's modern music, pigeon toed stomping and theme of human sacrifice shocked audiences so much they rioted.\n\nAfter the \u201cgolden age\u201d of Petipa, [[Michel Fokine]] began his career in St. Petersburg but moved to Paris and worked with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes.\n\n[[File:Vaslav Nijinsky in Le spectre de la rose 1911 Royal Opera House.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vaslav Nijinsky]] in ''[[The Spectre of the Rose]]'', 1911.]]\nRussian ballet continued development under Soviet rule. There was little talent left in the country after the Revolution, but it was enough to seed a new generation. After stagnation in the 1920s, by the mid-1930s that new generation of dancers and choreographers appeared on the scene. The technical perfection and precision of dance was promoted (and demanded) by [[Agrippina Vaganova]], who had been taught by Petipa and Cecchetti and headed the [[Vaganova Ballet Academy]], the school to prepare dancers for the Kirov Ballet in St. Petersburg/Leningrad.\n\nBallet was popular with the public. Both the Moscow-based Bolshoi and the St. Petersburg (then Leningrad)-based Kirov ballet companies were active. Ideological pressure forced the creation of many [[socialist realist]] pieces, most of which made little impression on the public and were removed from the repertoire of both companies later.\n\nSome pieces of that era, however, were remarkable. The ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[Prokofiev]] and [[Leonid Lavrovsky|Lavrovsky]] is a masterpiece. The ''[[Flames of Paris]]'', while it shows all the faults of socialist realist art, pioneered the active use of the corps de ballet in the performance and required stunning virtuosity. The [[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai (ballet)|ballet version]] of the [[Pushkin]] poem, ''[[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai]]'' with music from [[Boris Asafiev]] and choreography by [[Rostislav Zakharov]] was also a hit.\n\nThe well-known ballet ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]'', for which Prokofiev provided the music, is also the product of the Soviet ballet. During the Soviet era, these pieces were mostly unknown outside the [[Soviet Union]] and later outside of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union they received more recognition.\n\nThe 1999 North American premiere of ''[[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai (ballet)|The Fountain of Bakhchisarai]]'' by the Kirov Ballet in New York was an outstanding success, for example. The Soviet era of the Russian Ballet put a lot of emphasis on technique, virtuosity and strength. It demanded strength usually above the norm of contemporary Western dancers. When watching restored old footage, one can only marvel at the talent of their prima ballerinas such as [[Galina Ulanova]], [[Natalya Dudinskaya]] and [[Maya Plisetskaya]] and choreographers such as [[Pyotr Gusev]].\n\nRussian companies, particularly after World War II engaged in multiple tours all over the world that revitalized ballet in the West.\n\n''[[Maiden Tower (ballet)|Maiden Tower]]''<ref name=\"me1\">\u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u0413\u043b. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u042e. \u0412. \u041a\u0435\u043b\u0434\u044b\u0448. \u0422 1. \u0410 \u2014 \u0413\u043e\u043d\u0433. 1072 \u0441\u0442\u0431. \u0441 \u0438\u043b\u043b. \u041c.: \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1973</ref> written by [[Afrasiyab Badalbeyli]] is the first ballet in the [[Muslim]] East.<ref>[http://www.analytique.md/index.php?n=725&r=21&s=737 \u0427\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0437 \u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432: \u00ab\u0412\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043e\u0442\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441, \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044b \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u00bb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124754/http://www.analytique.md/index.php?n=725&r=21&s=737 |date=May 31, 2014 }} <blockquote>\u2026\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0443\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441.</blockquote></ref><ref>\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u0413\u043b. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0410. \u041c. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, 3-\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434. \u0422. 1. \u0410 \u2014 \u0410\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0431. 1969. 608 \u0441\u0442\u0440., \u0438\u043b\u043b.; 47 \u043b. \u0438\u043b\u043b. \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442, 1 \u043e\u0442\u0434. \u043b. \u0442\u0430\u0431\u043b.</ref><ref name=\"me1\" />\n\n===United States of America===\nFollowing the move of the Ballets Russes to France, ballet began to have a broader influence, particularly in the United States of America.\n\nFrom Paris, after disagreements with Diaghilev, Fokine went to Sweden and then the US and settled in New York. Diaghilev believed that traditional ballet offered little more than prettiness and athletic display. For Fokine that was not enough. In addition to technical virtuosity he demanded drama, expression and historical authenticity. The choreographer must research the period and cultural context of the setting and reject the traditional tutu in favour of accurate period costuming.\n\nFokine choreographed ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Sheherazade]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra ballet|Cleopatra]]''. He also reworked ''Petrouchka'' and ''The Firebird''. One of his most famous works was ''[[The Dying Swan]]'', performed by [[Anna Pavlova]]. Beyond her talents as a ballerina, Pavlova had the theatrical gifts to fulfill Fokine's vision of ballet as drama. Legend has it that Pavlova identified so much with the swan role that she requested her swan costume from her deathbed.\n\n[[File:La Mort du Cygne 1 Anna Pavlova 2 Yvette Chauvire 3 Natalia Makarova.mpg.OGG|thumb|200px|''[[The Dying Swan]]'' choreographed by [[Fokine]], performed by three soloists (shown in order): 1.

This focus fits with the state-sponsored funding sources in the United States which sought to encourage \"liberty and freethinking\" in contrast to narrative-driven dance, which was seen as to be connected too closely with socialism, especially [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|Soviet communism]].<ref name=Kiley>{{cite news\n | last =Kiley\n | first =Brendan\n | title =Old Is the New New: The Cold War and Don Quixote at Pacific Northwest Ballet\n | newspaper=The Stranger\n | location =Seattle, United States\n | date =February 7, 2012\n | url =http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/old-is-the-new-new/Content?oid=12374139\n | accessdate = February 10, 2012}}</ref>  Today, partly thanks to Balanchine, ballet is one of the most well-preserved dances in the world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nBarbara Karinska was a Russian emigree and a skilled seamstress who collaborated with Balanchine to elevate the art of costume design from a secondary role to an integral part of a ballet performance. She introduced the [[bias cut]] and a simplified classic tutu that allowed the dancer more freedom of movement. With meticulous attention to detail, she decorated her tutus with beadwork, embroidery, crochet and appliqu\u00e9.\n\n==Neoclassical ballet==\n{{Main|Neoclassical ballet}}\n[[File:Ballets Russes - Apollo musag\u00e8te.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ballets Russes]] with ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' (1928) choreographed by [[George Balanchine]]. Dancers are [[Alexandrova Danilova]] and [[Serge Lifar]].]]\n[[George Balanchine]] is often considered to have been the first pioneer of what is now known as [[neoclassical ballet]], a style of dance between classical ballet and today's contemporary ballet. Tim Scholl, author of ''From Petipa to Balanchine'', considers Balanchine's ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' (1928) to be the first neoclassical ballet. It represented a return to form in response to [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s abstract ballets. ''Apollo'' and other works are still performed today, predominantly by the [[New York City Ballet]]. However, other companies are able to pay a fee for performance rights to George Balanchine's works.\n\n[[Frederick Ashton]] is another prominent choreographer associated with the neoclassical style. Three of his works have become standard pieces in the international repertoire: ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]'' (1952), ''[[Romeo and Juliet (ballet)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1956), and ''[[Ondine (ballet)|Ondine]]'' (1958), the last of which was created as a vehicle to showcase [[Margot Fonteyn]].\n\n==Contemporary==\n{{Main|Contemporary ballet}}\n[[File:Allah Garibou.jpg|thumb|200px|A 2010 performance of [[Ir\u00e8ne Tassemb\u00e9do]]'s [[contemporary ballet]] piece [[Allah Garibou]].]]\nOne dancer who trained with Balanchine and absorbed much of this neo-classical style was [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]. Following Baryshnikov's appointment as artistic director of [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably [[Twyla Tharp]]. Tharp choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976; in 1986 she created ''In The Upper Room'' for her own company. Both these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers\u2014for their use of contemporary ballet.\n\nTharp also worked with the [[Joffrey Ballet]] company, founded in 1957 by [[Robert Joffrey]]. She choreographed ''[[Deuce Coupe]]'' for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet techniques. The Joffrey Ballet continued to perform numerous contemporary pieces, many choreographed by co-founder [[Gerald Arpino]].\n\nToday there are many  contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include [[Madrid Ballet]]; [[Royal Ballet of Flanders]]; [[Alonzo King]] and his company, [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]]; Nacho Duato and [[Compa\u00f1ia Nacional de Danza]]; William Forsythe, who has worked extensively with the [[Frankfurt Ballet]] and today runs [[The Forsythe Company]]; and [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n]], formerly the artistic director of the [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. Traditionally \"classical\" companies, such as the [[Kirov Ballet]] and the [[Paris Opera Ballet]], also regularly perform contemporary works.\n\n==Development of ballet method==\n{{Main|Ballet training}}\nSeveral well-known ballet methods are named after their originators. For example, two prevailing systems from Russia are known as the [[Vaganova method]] after [[Agrippina Vaganova]], and the Legat Method, after [[Nikolai Legat]]. The [[Cecchetti method]] was invented by Italian dancer [[Enrico Cecchetti]] (1850\u20131928), and the Bournonville method, which was invented by [[August Bournonville]] (1805\u20131879), is employed chiefly in Bournonville's own country of Denmark.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of ballets by title]]\n*[[Ballet music]]\n*[[History of dance]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name=Macaulay>{{cite news\n | last =Macaulay\n | first =Alastair\n | title =Stereotypes in Toeshoes\n | newspaper =New York Times\n | location =New York, United States\n | pages =\n | publisher =\n | date =5 September 2012\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/arts/dance/ballet-clings-to-racial-ethnic-and-national-stereotypes.html?_r=1&ref=dance\n | accessdate = 5 September 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Jack |title=Ballet & Modern Dance: A Concise History |edition=2nd |year=1992 |publisher=Princeton Book Company, Publishers |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=0-87127-172-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/balletmoderndanc00ande_0 }}\n* Andre, Paul; Arkadyev, V.
