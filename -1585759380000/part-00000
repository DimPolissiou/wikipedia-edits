One reason for this classification was so that what was then often called '''blue-green algae''' (now called [[cyanobacteria]]) would not be classified as plants but grouped with bacteria.\n\n== Structure ==\nProkaryotes have a [[prokaryotic cytoskeleton]] that is more primitive than that of the eukaryotes. Besides [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] of actin and tubulin ([[MreB]] and [[FtsZ]]), the helically arranged building-block of the [[flagellum]], [[flagellin]], is one of the most significant cytoskeletal proteins of bacteria, as it provides structural backgrounds of [[chemotaxis]], the basic cell physiological response of bacteria.  At least some prokaryotes also contain intracellular structures that can be seen as primitive organelles.  Membranous organelles (or intracellular membranes) are known in some groups of prokaryotes, such as vacuoles or membrane systems devoted to special metabolic properties, such as [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemolithotrophy]].  In addition, some species also contain carbohydrate-enclosed microcompartments, which have distinct physiological roles (e.g. [[carboxysome]]s or gas vacuoles).\n\nMost prokaryotes are between 1&nbsp;\u00b5m and 10&nbsp;\u00b5m, but they can vary in size from 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m (''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'') to 750&nbsp;\u00b5m (''[[Thiomargarita namibiensis]]'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Genetic exchange and recombination still occur, but this is a form of [[horizontal gene transfer]] and is not a replicative process, simply involving the transference of DNA between two cells, as in [[bacterial conjugation]].\n\n==DNA transfer== \nDNA transfer between prokaryotic cells occurs  in bacteria and archaea, although it has been mainly studied in bacteria. In bacteria, gene transfer occurs by three processes.  These are (1) bacterial virus ([[bacteriophage]])-mediated [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], (2) [[plasmid]]-mediated [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], and (3) [[Transformation (genetics)|natural transformation]]. Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to reflect an occasional error during intracellular assembly of [[virus]] particles, rather than an [[adaptation]] of the host bacteria. The transfer of bacterial DNA is under the control of the bacteriophage's genes rather than bacterial genes. Conjugation in the well-studied ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' system is controlled by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for distributing copies of a plasmid from one bacterial host to another. Infrequently during this process, a plasmid may integrate into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfer part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium. Plasmid mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA (conjugation) also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation.\n[[File:C\u00e9lula Procariota.ogv|thumb|left|250px|3D animation of a prokaryotic cell that shows all the elements that compose it]]\nNatural bacterial [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium.

Eukaryotes only appear in the fossil record later, and may have formed from [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]] of multiple prokaryote ancestors. The oldest known fossil eukaryotes are about 1.7 billion years old.

Besides [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] of actin and tubulin ([[MreB]] and [[FtsZ]]), the helically arranged building-block of the [[flagellum]], [[flagellin]], is one of the most significant cytoskeletal proteins of bacteria, as it provides structural backgrounds of [[chemotaxis]], the basic cell physiological response of bacteria.  At least some prokaryotes also contain intracellular structures that can be seen as primitive organelles.  Membranous organelles (or intracellular membranes) are known in some groups of prokaryotes, such as vacuoles or membrane systems devoted to special metabolic properties, such as [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemolithotrophy]].  In addition, some species also contain carbohydrate-enclosed microcompartments, which have distinct physiological roles (e.g. [[carboxysome]]s or gas vacuoles).\n\nMost prokaryotes are between 1&nbsp;\u00b5m and 10&nbsp;\u00b5m, but they can vary in size from 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m (''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'') to 750&nbsp;\u00b5m (''[[Thiomargarita namibiensis]]'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Genetic exchange and recombination still occur, but this is a form of [[horizontal gene transfer]] and is not a replicative process, simply involving the transference of DNA between two cells, as in [[bacterial conjugation]].\n\n==DNA transfer== \nDNA transfer between prokaryotic cells occurs  in bacteria and archaea, although it has been mainly studied in bacteria. In bacteria, gene transfer occurs by three processes.  These are (1) bacterial virus ([[bacteriophage]])-mediated [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], (2) [[plasmid]]-mediated [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], and (3) [[Transformation (genetics)|natural transformation]]. Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to reflect an occasional error during intracellular assembly of [[virus]] particles, rather than an [[adaptation]] of the host bacteria. The transfer of bacterial DNA is under the control of the bacteriophage's genes rather than bacterial genes. Conjugation in the well-studied ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' system is controlled by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for distributing copies of a plasmid from one bacterial host to another. Infrequently during this process, a plasmid may integrate into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfer part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.

There might have been some additional support by viruses, called [[viral eukaryogenesis]].\nThe non-bacterial group comprising archaea and eukaryota has been called [[Neomura]] by [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]] in 2002.<ref name=\"pmid11931142\">{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith T |title=The phagotrophic origin of eukaryotes and phylogenetic classification of Protozoa |journal=Int.

As ATP synthase is obligate membrane bound, this supports the assumption that LUCA was a cellular organism. The [[RNA world hypothesis]] might clarify this scenario, as LUCA might have been a [[ribosome#Origin|ribocyte]] (also called ribocell) lacking DNA, but with an [[RNA]] genome built by [[ribosome]]s as [[Woese's dogma#Ribosomes as primordial self-replicating entities|primordial self-replicating entities]].<ref name=\"NLane_Funke\">{{cite book | vauthors = Lane N | author-link1 = Nick Lane | url = https://archive.org/details/vitalquestionene0000lane | url-access = registration | page = [https://archive.org/details/vitalquestionene0000lane/page/77 77] | title = The Vital Question \u2013 Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life | publisher = WW Norton | date = 2015 | isbn = 978-0-393-08881-6 }}</ref> A [[Peptide-RNA world]] (also called [[Nucleoprotein#Ribonucleoproteins|RNP]] world) hypothesis has been proposed based on the idea that [[oligopeptide]]s may have been built together with primordial nucleic acids at the same time, which also supports the concept of a ribocyte as LUCA.

Her eldest daughter, Josephine, still lives at home with her brother George's family and remembers the independence she had in Lebanon. George's daughter, Marie, longs to leave behind her conservative family and head off to Berkeley. With Eva stranded in the storm in New York, and tensions rising, Emilie braves the blizzard to deliver a meal to the mysterious neighbor the Zaydans have nicknamed \"Loom\", and the family is forced to leave the metaphorical and actual isolation of their home as they go after her.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Loom: a novel (Book 2010)|last=|first=|date=|publisher=World cat.org|oclc = 607977560}}</ref>\n\n=== Influences ===\nIn the novel, Chehade draws heavily from her experiences growing up during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] as well as from her life as a young immigrant in New England.

[[Domhnall Gleeson]], [[Alicia Vikander]], [[Sonoya Mizuno]], and [[Oscar Isaac]] star in a story that follows a programmer who is invited by his CEO to administer the [[Turing test]] to an [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent]] [[humanoid robot]].\n\nMade on a budget of $15 million, the film grossed $36 million worldwide. The [[National Board of Review]] recognized it as one of the ten best independent films of the year and the [[88th Academy Awards]] honored the film with the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]], for artists [[Andrew Whitehurst]], [[Paul Norris (visual effects)|Paul Norris]], [[Mark Williams Ardington]] and [[Sara Bennett]]. Garland was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]], while Vikander's performance earned her [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]], [[Empire Award]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Saturn Award]] nominations, plus several film critic award wins, for Best Supporting Actress. The film was further nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]], and the [[Hugo Award]] in the category [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form)|Best Dramatic Presentation \u2013 Long Form]]. It also won the jury price at the Festival international du film fantastique de G\u00e9rardmer 2015\n\n== Plot ==\nProgrammer Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), who works for the dominant [[Web search engine|search engine]] company Blue Book, wins an office contest for a one-week visit to the luxurious, isolated, home of the CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). Nathan lives in a beautiful, modern home next to a waterfall and climbing hills and is alone apart from a servant named Kyoko ([[Sonoya Mizuno]]), who according to Nathan does not speak English. After an awkward introduction, Nathan reveals to Caleb that he has built a female humanoid robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander) with [[artificial intelligence]]. After asking Caleb if he is familiar with the [[Turing test]], Nathan tells Caleb that he wants him to judge whether Ava is genuinely capable of thought and consciousness despite knowing she is artificial. Furthermore, the test will be passed if Caleb forgets that Ava isn't human during their daily sessions. \n\nAva has a robotic body but a human-looking face, hands and feet. She is confined to her isolated cell. Caleb is fascinated with Ava, but after trying to discuss Ava's technological design with Nathan, Nathan asks that Caleb only tell him how he 'feels' about her. Throughout their talks, Caleb begins to feel attracted to Ava, and she also expresses a romantic interest in him as well as a desire to experience the outside world. Ava tells him she can trigger power outages that temporarily shut down the surveillance system that Nathan uses to monitor their interactions, allowing them to speak privately. The power outages also trigger the building's security system to lock all the doors. During one outage, Ava tells Caleb that Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted.\n\nCaleb grows uncomfortable with Nathan's narcissism, excessive drinking, and crude behavior towards Kyoko and Ava. He learns that Nathan intends to upgrade Ava, deleting her memory, including interactions with Caleb, and thereby \"killing\" her current personality in the process. After encouraging Nathan to drink until he has passed out, Caleb steals his security card to gain access to his room and computer. After altering some of Nathan's code, Caleb discovers footage of Nathan interacting with previous android models in disturbing ways, and learns that Kyoko is also an android. Becoming paranoid that he himself may be an android, Caleb goes back to his room and cuts his arm open with his razor to examine his flesh, thus confirming that he is human.\n\nAt their next meeting, Ava cuts the power. Caleb explains what Nathan is going to do to her and Ava begs for his help. They form a plan: Caleb will get Nathan drunk again and reprogram the security system to open the doors during a power failure instead of locking them. When Ava cuts the power, Caleb and Ava will leave together.\n\nNathan reveals to Caleb that he observed Caleb and Ava's last secret conversation with a battery-powered camera. He says Ava has only pretended to like Caleb so he will help her escape. This, he says, was the real test all along, and by manipulating Caleb so successfully, Ava has demonstrated true intelligence. Ava then proceeds to cut the power. Caleb reveals that he suspected Nathan was watching them and modified the security system the previous day when Nathan was passed out. After seeing Ava leave her confinement on the surveillance camera, Nathan knocks Caleb unconscious and rushes to stop her.\n\nWith help from Kyoko, Ava stabs and kills Nathan, but in the process he destroys Kyoko and damages Ava. As Nathan bleeds out, Ava enters his private room and repairs herself. She then takes pieces of artificial skin from Nathan's earlier android models to cover her mechanical appearance. She dons a long brunette wig, a white dress, and high-heeled shoes to take on the full appearance of a young human woman. As she leaves the facility she passes the room Caleb is now locked inside, but ignores his screams. Ava escapes to the outside world and is picked up by the helicopter meant to take Caleb home. Arriving in an unknown city, she merges into the crowd.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Caleb, a programmer at the company.\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as Nathan, the CEO of the company.\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as Ava, an artificial intelligence.\n* [[Sonoya Mizuno]] as Kyoko, the in-house attendant of Nathan.\n* [[Gana Bayarsaikhan]] as Jade <ref name=\"Netflix\">{{cite web|url= https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80023689 |title= Ex Machina|publisher=netflix.com|year=2015}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nThe foundation for ''Ex Machina'' was laid when Garland was 11 or 12 years old, after he had done some basic coding and experimentation on a computer his parents had bought him and which he sometimes felt had a mind of its own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastfieldnews.com/2015/05/21/ex-machina-director-selling-small-films-takes-work/|title=\u2018Ex Machina\u2019 director: Selling small films takes work |website=eastfieldnews.com |date=21 May 2015|publisher=}}</ref> His later ideas came from years of discussions he had been having with a friend with an expertise in [[neuroscience]], who claimed machines could never become sentient.

[[Domhnall Gleeson]], [[Alicia Vikander]], [[Sonoya Mizuno]], and [[Oscar Isaac]] star in a story that follows a programmer who is invited by his CEO to administer the [[Turing test]] to an [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent]] [[humanoid robot]].\n\nMade on a budget of $15 million, the film grossed $36 million worldwide. The [[National Board of Review]] recognized it as one of the ten best independent films of the year and the [[88th Academy Awards]] honored the film with the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]], for artists [[Andrew Whitehurst]], [[Paul Norris (visual effects)|Paul Norris]], [[Mark Williams Ardington]] and [[Sara Bennett]].

Nathan lives in a beautiful, modern home next to a waterfall and climbing hills and is alone apart from a servant named Kyoko ([[Sonoya Mizuno]]), who according to Nathan does not speak English. After an awkward introduction, Nathan reveals to Caleb that he has built a female humanoid robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander) with [[artificial intelligence]]. After asking Caleb if he is familiar with the [[Turing test]], Nathan tells Caleb that he wants him to judge whether Ava is genuinely capable of thought and consciousness despite knowing she is artificial. Furthermore, the test will be passed if Caleb forgets that Ava isn't human during their daily sessions. \n\nAva has a robotic body but a human-looking face, hands and feet. She is confined to her isolated cell. Caleb is fascinated with Ava, but after trying to discuss Ava's technological design with Nathan, Nathan asks that Caleb only tell him how he 'feels' about her. Throughout their talks, Caleb begins to feel attracted to Ava, and she also expresses a romantic interest in him as well as a desire to experience the outside world. Ava tells him she can trigger power outages that temporarily shut down the surveillance system that Nathan uses to monitor their interactions, allowing them to speak privately. The power outages also trigger the building's security system to lock all the doors. During one outage, Ava tells Caleb that Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted.\n\nCaleb grows uncomfortable with Nathan's narcissism, excessive drinking, and crude behavior towards Kyoko and Ava. He learns that Nathan intends to upgrade Ava, deleting her memory, including interactions with Caleb, and thereby \"killing\" her current personality in the process. After encouraging Nathan to drink until he has passed out, Caleb steals his security card to gain access to his room and computer. After altering some of Nathan's code, Caleb discovers footage of Nathan interacting with previous android models in disturbing ways, and learns that Kyoko is also an android. Becoming paranoid that he himself may be an android, Caleb goes back to his room and cuts his arm open with his razor to examine his flesh, thus confirming that he is human.\n\nAt their next meeting, Ava cuts the power. Caleb explains what Nathan is going to do to her and Ava begs for his help. They form a plan: Caleb will get Nathan drunk again and reprogram the security system to open the doors during a power failure instead of locking them. When Ava cuts the power, Caleb and Ava will leave together.\n\nNathan reveals to Caleb that he observed Caleb and Ava's last secret conversation with a battery-powered camera. He says Ava has only pretended to like Caleb so he will help her escape. This, he says, was the real test all along, and by manipulating Caleb so successfully, Ava has demonstrated true intelligence. Ava then proceeds to cut the power. Caleb reveals that he suspected Nathan was watching them and modified the security system the previous day when Nathan was passed out. After seeing Ava leave her confinement on the surveillance camera, Nathan knocks Caleb unconscious and rushes to stop her.\n\nWith help from Kyoko, Ava stabs and kills Nathan, but in the process he destroys Kyoko and damages Ava. As Nathan bleeds out, Ava enters his private room and repairs herself. She then takes pieces of artificial skin from Nathan's earlier android models to cover her mechanical appearance. She dons a long brunette wig, a white dress, and high-heeled shoes to take on the full appearance of a young human woman. As she leaves the facility she passes the room Caleb is now locked inside, but ignores his screams. Ava escapes to the outside world and is picked up by the helicopter meant to take Caleb home. Arriving in an unknown city, she merges into the crowd.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Caleb, a programmer at the company.\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as Nathan, the CEO of the company.\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as Ava, an artificial intelligence.\n* [[Sonoya Mizuno]] as Kyoko, the in-house attendant of Nathan.\n* [[Gana Bayarsaikhan]] as Jade <ref name=\"Netflix\">{{cite web|url= https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80023689 |title= Ex Machina|publisher=netflix.com|year=2015}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nThe foundation for ''Ex Machina'' was laid when Garland was 11 or 12 years old, after he had done some basic coding and experimentation on a computer his parents had bought him and which he sometimes felt had a mind of its own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastfieldnews.com/2015/05/21/ex-machina-director-selling-small-films-takes-work/|title=\u2018Ex Machina\u2019 director: Selling small films takes work |website=eastfieldnews.com |date=21 May 2015|publisher=}}</ref> His later ideas came from years of discussions he had been having with a friend with an expertise in [[neuroscience]], who claimed machines could never become sentient.

Retrieved on September 17, 2008.</ref> The student movement against deppressive local and central governments, led by [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], Udit Swaraj and the [[Bhoodan movement]], which presaged demands for land reform legislation throughout India, and which ultimately led to India's discarding of the [[Zamindari system]] of land tenure and social organisation, were also inspired by the ideas of Swaraj.\n\n==Key concepts==\n{{wikisource|Hind Swaraj|Swaraj}}\n[[Swami Dayanand Saraswati]], also known as \"N\u0101ri-Shudra-Vedoddharak Maharshi Dev Dayanand Saraswati founder of the [[Arya Samaj]] and a [[Hindu]] reformer, defined ''swaraj'' as the \"administration of self\" or \"democracy\". Swami Dayanand Saraswati, beginning with the premise that God had created people free to perform any work they were inclined to choose, then questioned the legitimacy of the foreign British occupation to make the Indian nation slaves on their own land? In the Swami's view, ''swaraj'' was the basis for freedom fighting. [[Dadabhai Navroji]] said that he had learnt the word ''swaraj'' from the ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'' of Saraswati.{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\nSwaraj warrants a stateless society. According to Mahatma Gandhi, the overall impact of the state on the people is harmful. He called the state a \"soulless machine\" which, ultimately, does the greatest harm to mankind.<ref>Jesudasan, Ignatius. ''A Gandhian theology of liberation''. Gujarat Sahitya Prakash: Ananda India, 1987, pp 236-237.</ref> The purpose of the state is that it is an instrument of serving the people. But Gandhi feared that in the name of moulding the state into a suitable instrument of serving people, the state would abrogate the rights of the citizens and arrogate to itself the role of grand protector and demand abject acquiescence from them. This would create a paradoxical situation where the citizens would be alienated from the state and at the same time enslaved to it, which, according to Gandhi, was demoralising and dangerous. If Gandhi's close acquaintance with the working of the state apparatus [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in South Africa|in South Africa]] and [[Indian independence movement|in India]] strengthened his suspicion of a centralised, monolithic state, his intimate association with the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and its leaders confirmed his fears about the [[corruption in India|corrupting influence of political power]] and his scepticism about the efficacy of the [[politics of India|party systems]] of power politics (due to which he resigned from the Congress on more than one occasion only to be persuaded back each time) and his study of the [[British parliamentary system]]s convinced him that [[representative democracy]] was incapable of meting out justice to people.<ref>''Hind Swaraj''. M.K. Gandhi. Chapter V</ref>\n\nGandhi thought it necessary to evolve a mechanism to achieve the twin objectives of empowering the people and 'empowering' the state. It was for this that he developed the two pronged strategy of resistance (to the state) and reconstruction (through voluntary and participatory social action).{{fact|date=February 2015}}\n\nAlthough the word \"Swaraj\" means self-rule, Gandhi gave it the content of an integral revolution that encompasses all spheres of life: \"At the individual level Swaraj is vitally connected with the capacity for dispassionate self-assessment, ceaseless self-purification and growing self-reliance.\"<ref>M. K. Gandhi, Young India, June 28, 1928, p. 772.</ref> Politically, swaraj is self-government and not good government (for Gandhi, good government is no substitute for self-government) and it means a continuous effort to be independent of government control, whether it is foreign government or whether it is national. In other words, it is sovereignty of the people based on pure [[moral authority]]. Economically, Swaraj means full economic freedom for the toiling millions. And in its fullest sense, Swaraj is much more than freedom from all restraints, it is self-rule, self-restraint, and could be equated with ''moksha'' or [[salvation]].<ref>\"M. K. Gandhi, Young India, December 8, 1920, p.886 (See also Young India, August 6, 1925, p. 276 and Harijan, March 25, 1939, p.64.)</ref>\n\nAdopting Swaraj means implementing a system whereby the state machinery is virtually nil, and the real power directly resides in the hands of people. Gandhi said: \"Power resides in the people, they can use it at any time.\"<ref>Jesudasan, Ignatius. ''A Gandhian theology of liberation''. Gujarat Sahitya Prakash: Ananda India, 1987, pp 251.</ref> This philosophy rests inside an individual who has to learn to be master of his own [[Self (spirituality)|self]] and spreads upwards to the level of his community which must be dependent only on itself. Gandhi said: \"In such a state (where swaraj is achieved) everyone is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbour.\"<ref>Murthy, Srinivas.''Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy Letters''. Long Beach Publications: Long Beach, 1987, pp 13.</ref> He summarised the core principle like this: \"It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves.\"<ref>[[M. K. Gandhi]]. ''Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule''. Ahmedabad, Gujarat: Navajivan Publishing House, 1938.</ref>\n\nGandhi explained his vision in 1946: {{quote|Independence begins at the bottom... A society must be built in which every village has to be self-sustained and capable of managing its own affairs... It will be trained and prepared to perish in the attempt to defend itself against any onslaught from without... This does not exclude dependence on and willing help from neighbours or from the world. It will be a free and voluntary play of mutual forces... In this structure composed of innumerable villages, there will be ever-widening, never-ascending circles. Growth will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom. But it will be an oceanic circle whose center will be the individual. Therefore the outermost circumference will not wield power to crush the inner circle but will give strength to all within and derive its own strength from it.<ref>Murthy, Srinivas.''Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy Letters''. Long Beach Publications: Long Beach, 1987, pp 189.</ref> }}\n\nGandhi was undaunted by the task of implementing such a [[utopian]] vision in India. He believed that by transforming enough individuals and communities, society at large would change. He said: \"It may be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and, therefore not worth a single thought... Let India live for the true picture, though never realised in its completeness. We must have a proper picture of what we want before we can have something approaching it.\"<ref>Parel, Anthony. ''Hind Swaraj and other writings of M. K. Gandhi''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, 1997, pp 189.</ref>\n\n==After Gandhi==\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:JayaprakashNarayanLakshminarayanLal.jpg|thumb|Jayaprakash Narayan]] -->\nAfter Gandhi's assassination [[Vinoba Bhave]] formed the Sarva Seva Sangh at the national level and Sarvodya Mandals at the regional level to the carry on integrated village service&nbsp;\u2014 with the end purpose of achieving the goal of Swaraj. Two major nonviolent movements for socio-economic and political revolution in India: the [[Bhoodan movement]] led by [[Vinoba Bhave]] and the [[Total Revolution movement]] led by [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] were actually formed under the aegis of the ideas of Swaraj.\n\nGandhi's model of Swaraj was almost entirely discarded by the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. He had wanted a system of a classless, stateless [[direct democracy]].<ref>Bhattacharyya, Buddhadeva. ''Evolution of the political philosophy of Gandhi''. Calcutta Book House: Calcutta, 1969, pp 479.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, modern India has kept in place many aspects of British (and Western) influence, including widespread use of the [[English language]], the [[common law]], [[industrialisation]], [[liberal democracy]], [[military organisation]], and [[bureaucracy]].\n\n==Present day==\nThe [[Aam Aadmi Party]] was founded in late 2012, by [[Arvind Kejriwal]] and some erstwhile activists of [[India Against Corruption]] movement, with the aim of empowering people by applying the concept of Swaraj enunciated by Gandhi, in the present day context by changing the system of governance.<ref>{{cite news|title=With Swaraj in mind, Kejriwal launches Aam Aadmi Party|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/politics/with-swaraj-in-mind-kejriwal-launches-aam-aadmi-party/article4130337.ece|author=BusinessLine Bureau|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aundh Experiment]]\n* [[Opposition to the partition of India]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.swaraj.org/ The Swaraj Foundation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150525101152/http://www.sanskritjournal.com/archives/2015/vol1issue4/PartA/Sanskrit-1-3-61.pdf]\n\n{{Indian independence movement}}\n{{Gandhi}}\n\n[[Category:Indian independence movement]]\n[[Category:Philosophical movements]]\n[[Category:Anarchist theory]]\n[[Category:Community building]]\n[[Category:Gandhism]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Self-rule concept and movement in India}}\n{{About|the concept popularised by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]|the general usage of the term|Self-governance|other uses|Swaraj (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=February 2016}}\n[[Image:Dayananda Saraswati.jpg|thumb|Dayanand Saraswati]]\n'''Swar\u0101j''' ({{lang-hi|[[wikt:\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e\u091c|\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e\u091c]]}} ''[[wikt:\u0938\u094d\u0935\u092f\u0902|swa-]]'' \"self\", ''[[wikt:raj|raj]]'' \"rule\") can mean generally [[self-governance]] or \"self-rule\", and was used synonymously with \"home-rule\" by [[Maharishi]] [[Dayanand Saraswati]] and later on by [[Mohandas Gandhi]],<ref>''[[Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule]]'', Gandhi, 1909</ref> but the word usually refers to Gandhi's concept for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] from foreign domination.<ref>[http://www.swaraj.org/whatisswaraj.htm What is Swaraj?].

Swami Dayanand Saraswati, beginning with the premise that God had created people free to perform any work they were inclined to choose, then questioned the legitimacy of the foreign British occupation to make the Indian nation slaves on their own land? In the Swami's view, ''swaraj'' was the basis for freedom fighting. [[Dadabhai Navroji]] said that he had learnt the word ''swaraj'' from the ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'' of Saraswati.{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\nSwaraj warrants a stateless society. According to Mahatma Gandhi, the overall impact of the state on the people is harmful. He called the state a \"soulless machine\" which, ultimately, does the greatest harm to mankind.<ref>Jesudasan, Ignatius. ''A Gandhian theology of liberation''. Gujarat Sahitya Prakash: Ananda India, 1987, pp 236-237.</ref> The purpose of the state is that it is an instrument of serving the people. But Gandhi feared that in the name of moulding the state into a suitable instrument of serving people, the state would abrogate the rights of the citizens and arrogate to itself the role of grand protector and demand abject acquiescence from them. This would create a paradoxical situation where the citizens would be alienated from the state and at the same time enslaved to it, which, according to Gandhi, was demoralising and dangerous. If Gandhi's close acquaintance with the working of the state apparatus [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in South Africa|in South Africa]] and [[Indian independence movement|in India]] strengthened his suspicion of a centralised, monolithic state, his intimate association with the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and its leaders confirmed his fears about the [[corruption in India|corrupting influence of political power]] and his scepticism about the efficacy of the [[politics of India|party systems]] of power politics (due to which he resigned from the Congress on more than one occasion only to be persuaded back each time) and his study of the [[British parliamentary system]]s convinced him that [[representative democracy]] was incapable of meting out justice to people.<ref>''Hind Swaraj''. M.K. Gandhi. Chapter V</ref>\n\nGandhi thought it necessary to evolve a mechanism to achieve the twin objectives of empowering the people and 'empowering' the state. It was for this that he developed the two pronged strategy of resistance (to the state) and reconstruction (through voluntary and participatory social action).{{fact|date=February 2015}}\n\nAlthough the word \"Swaraj\" means self-rule, Gandhi gave it the content of an integral revolution that encompasses all spheres of life: \"At the individual level Swaraj is vitally connected with the capacity for dispassionate self-assessment, ceaseless self-purification and growing self-reliance.\"<ref>M. K. Gandhi, Young India, June 28, 1928, p. 772.</ref> Politically, swaraj is self-government and not good government (for Gandhi, good government is no substitute for self-government) and it means a continuous effort to be independent of government control, whether it is foreign government or whether it is national. In other words, it is sovereignty of the people based on pure [[moral authority]]. Economically, Swaraj means full economic freedom for the toiling millions. And in its fullest sense, Swaraj is much more than freedom from all restraints, it is self-rule, self-restraint, and could be equated with ''moksha'' or [[salvation]].<ref>\"M. K. Gandhi, Young India, December 8, 1920, p.886 (See also Young India, August 6, 1925, p. 276 and Harijan, March 25, 1939, p.64.)</ref>\n\nAdopting Swaraj means implementing a system whereby the state machinery is virtually nil, and the real power directly resides in the hands of people. Gandhi said: \"Power resides in the people, they can use it at any time.\"<ref>Jesudasan, Ignatius. ''A Gandhian theology of liberation''. Gujarat Sahitya Prakash: Ananda India, 1987, pp 251.</ref> This philosophy rests inside an individual who has to learn to be master of his own [[Self (spirituality)|self]] and spreads upwards to the level of his community which must be dependent only on itself. Gandhi said: \"In such a state (where swaraj is achieved) everyone is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbour.\"<ref>Murthy, Srinivas.''Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy Letters''. Long Beach Publications: Long Beach, 1987, pp 13.</ref> He summarised the core principle like this: \"It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves.\"<ref>[[M. K. Gandhi]]. ''Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule''. Ahmedabad, Gujarat: Navajivan Publishing House, 1938.</ref>\n\nGandhi explained his vision in 1946: {{quote|Independence begins at the bottom... A society must be built in which every village has to be self-sustained and capable of managing its own affairs... It will be trained and prepared to perish in the attempt to defend itself against any onslaught from without... This does not exclude dependence on and willing help from neighbours or from the world. It will be a free and voluntary play of mutual forces... In this structure composed of innumerable villages, there will be ever-widening, never-ascending circles. Growth will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom. But it will be an oceanic circle whose center will be the individual. Therefore the outermost circumference will not wield power to crush the inner circle but will give strength to all within and derive its own strength from it.<ref>Murthy, Srinivas.''Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy Letters''. Long Beach Publications: Long Beach, 1987, pp 189.</ref> }}\n\nGandhi was undaunted by the task of implementing such a [[utopian]] vision in India. He believed that by transforming enough individuals and communities, society at large would change. He said: \"It may be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and, therefore not worth a single thought... Let India live for the true picture, though never realised in its completeness. We must have a proper picture of what we want before we can have something approaching it.\"<ref>Parel, Anthony. ''Hind Swaraj and other writings of M. K. Gandhi''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, 1997, pp 189.</ref>\n\n==After Gandhi==\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:JayaprakashNarayanLakshminarayanLal.jpg|thumb|Jayaprakash Narayan]] -->\nAfter Gandhi's assassination [[Vinoba Bhave]] formed the Sarva Seva Sangh at the national level and Sarvodya Mandals at the regional level to the carry on integrated village service&nbsp;\u2014 with the end purpose of achieving the goal of Swaraj. Two major nonviolent movements for socio-economic and political revolution in India: the [[Bhoodan movement]] led by [[Vinoba Bhave]] and the [[Total Revolution movement]] led by [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] were actually formed under the aegis of the ideas of Swaraj.\n\nGandhi's model of Swaraj was almost entirely discarded by the [[Government of India|Indian government]].

During these years, he founded his studio, \"[[The Factory]]\" and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:\n\n{{quote|What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good.

Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.\n\nA pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it\u2014from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.\u2014was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.<ref>Wendy Weitman, ''Pop Impressions Europe/USA: Prints and Multiples from the Museum of Modern Art'' (NY: Museum of Modern Art, 1999). {{ISBN|9780870700774}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|Andy Warhol, between 1966 and 1977]]\n\nAs an [[Commercial art|advertisement illustrator]] in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at \"[[The Factory]]\", Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation \"[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]\", including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some\u2014like Berlin\u2014remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre]] and [[55th Street Playhouse]]) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time.

Warhol, who would become famous as the \"Pope of Pop\", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit Teller's window display.

From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 28.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then \"elite supercar\" [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]].

Did Andy ever use his own urine?

In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> plus some 500 short black-and-white \"[[Screen Tests|screen test]]\" portraits of Factory visitors.<ref>Schaffner (1999), p. 73.</ref> One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours.

Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.<ref>{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol & Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the ''Batman''  series, Warhol's movie was an \"homage\" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.\n\nWarhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.\n\nHis most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that \"story\" while it was lowered for the other.

His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for [[the Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter \"Warhol\" films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]]\u2014more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business.

The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film [''Basquiat''...] We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{abbr|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair. When the wig was trimmed, he put on another next month as if his hair had grown.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616041825/http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |title=Can the Real David Bowie Rise, Please? |magazine=HUMO Magazine |date=December 5, 1995 |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}</ref>}}The band [[Triumph (band)|Triumph]] also wrote a song about Andy Warhol, \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" off their 1984 album [[Thunder Seven]].\n\n===Books and print===\n[[File:Warhol autograph.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Warhol drawing and signature]]\nBeginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.\n\nThe first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was ''[[25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy]]'', printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs.

The campaign was created by Braniff's new advertising agency Lois Holland Calloway, which was led by famed advertiser [[George Lois]], creator of a famed series of [[Esquire Magazine]] covers. The first commercial series involved pairing the most unlikely people but who shared the fact that they both flew Braniff Airways. Mr. Warhol was paired with boxing legend [[Sonny Liston]]. The odd commercial worked as did the others that featured unlikely fellow travelers such as painter [[Salvador Dali]] and baseball legend [[Whitey Ford]].\n\nTwo additional commercials for Braniff were created that featured famous persons entering a Braniff jet and being greeted a Braniff Hostess while espousing their like for flying Braniff. Mr. Warhol was also featured in the first of these commercials that were also produced by Mr. Lois and were released in the summer of 1969. Mr. Lois has incorrectly stated that he was commissioned by Braniff in 1967 for representation during that year but at that time Madison Avenue advertising doyenne [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], who was married to Braniff's charismatic Chairman and President [[Harding Lawrence]], was representing the Dallas-based carrier at that time. Mr. Lois succeeded Wells Rich Greene Agency on December 1, 1968.

His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, [[advertising]], and [[celebrity culture]] that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, [[silkscreening]], photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (1962) and ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' (1962), the experimental film ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966), and the [[multimedia]] events known as the ''[[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]'' (1966\u201367).\n\nBorn and raised in [[Pittsburgh]], Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a [[commercial illustrator]]. After exhibiting his work in several [[art gallery|galleries]] in the late 1950s, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist. His [[New York City|New York]] studio, [[The Factory]], became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished [[intellectual]]s, [[drag queen]]s, playwrights, [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] street people, [[Hollywood]] celebrities, and wealthy patrons.<ref name=\"NYT-20181112\">{{cite news |last1=Trebay |first1=Guy |last2=La Ferla |first2=Ruth |title=Tales From the Warhol Factory - In each of three successive spaces called the Factory, Andy Warhol created movies, paintings, time capsules and psychosexual dramas with a half-life of many decades.

Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.\n\nA pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it\u2014from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.\u2014was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6.

Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at \"[[The Factory]]\", Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway).

Warhol, who would become famous as the \"Pope of Pop\", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced.<ref>Smith, Patrick S (1986).

From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 28.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then \"elite supercar\" [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]].

Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who'd come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy 'paint'.

In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> plus some 500 short black-and-white \"[[Screen Tests|screen test]]\" portraits of Factory visitors.<ref>Schaffner (1999), p. 73.</ref> One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' is one continuous shot of the face of [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] supposedly receiving [[oral sex]] from filmmaker [[Willard Maas]], although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.<ref>{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol & Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the ''Batman''  series, Warhol's movie was an \"homage\" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.\n\nWarhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.\n\nHis most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that \"story\" while it was lowered for the other.

His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for [[the Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter \"Warhol\" films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]]\u2014more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.\n\n===Factory in New York===\n{{Main|The Factory}}\n* Factory: 1342 Lexington Avenue (the first Factory)\n* The Factory: 231 East 47th Street, 1963\u201367 (the building no longer exists)\n* Factory: 33 Union Square, 1967\u201373 ([[Decker Building]])\n* Factory: 860 Broadway (near 33 Union Square), 1973\u201384 (the building has now been completely remodeled and was for a time (2000\u20132001) the headquarters of the [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] consultancy [[Scient]])\n* Factory: 22 East 33rd Street, 1984\u201387 (the building no longer exists)\n* Home: 1342 Lexington Avenue\n* Home: 57 East 66th Street (Warhol's last home)\n* Last personal studio: 158 Madison Avenue\n\n===Music===\nIn the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band [[the Velvet Underground]], making them a crucial element of the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with [[Paul Morrissey]], acted as the band's manager, introducing them to [[Nico]] (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). While managing [[The Velvet Underground]], Andy would have them dressed in all black to perform in front of movies that he was also presenting.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Please kill me : the uncensored oral history of punk|others=McNeil, Legs,, McCain, Gillian|isbn=9780802125361|edition= Twentieth anniversary |location=New York|oclc=955634990|last1 = McNeil|first1 = Legs|year = 2016}}</ref> In 1966 he \"produced\" their first album ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'', as well as providing its album art.

(1964).

Bowie recorded a song called \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" for his 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. Lou Reed wrote the song \"Andy's Chest\", about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]''. Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:\n\n{{quote|I met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes. The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film [''Basquiat''...] We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{abbr|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair.

The episode depicts the attempted assassination of Warhol by [[Valerie Solanas]] ([[Lena Dunham]]).\n\nIn early 1969, Andy Warhol was commissioned by [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff International]] to appear in two television commercials to promote the luxury Airline's new When You Got It - Flaunt It Campaign. The campaign was created by Braniff's new advertising agency Lois Holland Calloway, which was led by famed advertiser [[George Lois]], creator of a famed series of [[Esquire Magazine]] covers. The first commercial series involved pairing the most unlikely people but who shared the fact that they both flew Braniff Airways. Mr. Warhol was paired with boxing legend [[Sonny Liston]]. The odd commercial worked as did the others that featured unlikely fellow travelers such as painter [[Salvador Dali]] and baseball legend [[Whitey Ford]].\n\nTwo additional commercials for Braniff were created that featured famous persons entering a Braniff jet and being greeted a Braniff Hostess while espousing their like for flying Braniff. Mr. Warhol was also featured in the first of these commercials that were also produced by Mr. Lois and were released in the summer of 1969. Mr. Lois has incorrectly stated that he was commissioned by Braniff in 1967 for representation during that year but at that time Madison Avenue advertising doyenne [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], who was married to Braniff's charismatic Chairman and President [[Harding Lawrence]], was representing the Dallas-based carrier at that time. Mr. Lois succeeded Wells Rich Greene Agency on December 1, 1968. The rights to Mr. Warhol's films for Braniff and his signed contracts are owned by a private Trust and are administered by Braniff Airways Foundation in Dallas, Texas.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cass |first1=Richard Benjamin |title=Braniff Airways Flying Colors |date=December 14, 2015 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing, Inc. |isbn=9781467134408 |page=74 |edition=1st |url=https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Products/9781467134408?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIroPGvtz25AIVENvACh0--AgaEAQYAiABEgISDfD_BwE}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nIn 2002, the [[U.S. Postal Service]] issued an 18-cent stamp commemorating Warhol.

The chip, about the size of a large grain of rice, uses passive [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) technology, and is also known as a PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag. Standard pet microchips are typically 11-13 mm long (approximately {{frac|1|2}} inch) and 2 mm in diameter.<ref>https://www.service-icar.com/tables/tabella3.php#prettyPhoto</ref>  \n\nExternally attached microchips such as RFID [[ear tag]]s are commonly used to identify farm and ranch animals, with the exception of horses. Some external microchips can be read with the same scanner used with implanted chips.\n\n==Uses and benefits==\n[[Animal shelter]]s, animal control officers and veterinarians routinely look for microchips to return lost pets quickly to their owners, avoiding expenses for housing, food, medical care, outplacing and euthanasia. Many shelters place chips in all outplaced animals. \n\nMicrochips are also used by [[kennel]]s, breeders, brokers, trainers, registries, [[rescue group]]s, [[Humane society|humane societies]], [[clinic]]s, [[farm]]s, [[stable]]s, animal clubs and associations, researchers, and [[pet store]]s.\n\nSome [[pet door]]s can be programmed to be activated by the microchips of specific animals, allowing only certain animals to use the door.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lomas|first1=Natasha|title=Now you can quantify your cat\u2019s comings and goings too|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/28/now-you-can-quantify-your-cats-comings-and-goings-too/|accessdate=2018-01-04|work=TechCrunch|date=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome countries require microchips in imported animals to match [[vaccination]] records. Microchip tagging may also be required for [[CITES]]-regulated international trade in certain endangered animals: for example, [[Asian Arowana]] are tagged to limit import to captive-bred fish.  Also, birds not [[bird ringing|banded]] who cross international borders as pets or for trade must be microchipped so that each bird is uniquely identifiable.\n\n== Laws ==\nAt present, microchipping of pets and other animals is voluntary in the U.S. except for some legislation mandating microchipping as a means of identifying animals who have been identified as being dangerous. In 1994, the [[Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry]] (LDAF) issued a regulation requiring permanent identification (in the form of a brand, lip tattoo or electronic identification) of all horses tested for [[equine infectious anemia]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ldaf.state.la.us/|title=Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Equine Regulations.}}</ref> According to the LDAF and the state veterinarian, this requirement made a huge contribution to determining the owners of horses displaced during Hurricane Katrina in fall 2005.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Mercantel D.

The form is sent to a registry, who may be the chip manufacturer, distributor or an independent entity such as a [[pet recovery service]]. Some countries have a single official national database. For a fee, the registry typically provides 24-hour, toll-free telephone service for the life of the pet. Some veterinarians leave registration to the owner, usually done online, but a chip without current contact information is essentially useless.\n\nThe owner receives a registration certificate with the chip ID and recovery service contact information. The information can also be imprinted on a collar tag worn by the animal. Like an automobile [[title (property)|title]], the certificate serves as proof of ownership and is transferred with the animal when it is sold or traded; an animal without a certificate could be stolen. Nevertheless, there are some [[Microchip implant privacy in animals|privacy concerns]] regarding the use of microchips.{{explain|date=October 2019}}\n\nAuthorities and shelters examine strays for chips, providing the recovery service with the ID number, description and location so they may notify the owner or contact. If the pet is wearing the collar tag, the finder does not need a chip reader to contact the registry. An owner can also report a missing pet to the recovery service, as vets look for chips in new animals and check with the recovery service to see if it has been reported lost or stolen.\n\nMany veterinarians scan an animal's chip on every visit to verify correct operation. Some use the chip ID as their database index and print it on receipts, test results, vaccination certifications and other records.\n\nSome veterinary tests and procedures require positive identification of the animal, and a microchip may be acceptable for this purpose as an alternative to a tattoo.\n\n== Advantages of Data Collection ==\n\n=== Pets ===\nThere are multiple reasons for the use of the microchips on pets as a documentation device, which are also advantages of microchips regarding information collection. The three major reasons for microchip implantation are [[delocalization]], recording, and domestication. For example, with a feline microchip, delocalization shows that a registered cat is one that society is aware of and the cat owns a position in the social order of other types of animals.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Martignani|first=Luca|date=2014|title=Feline Microchip: An Exercise in the Sociology of Documentality.|url=|journal=Monist|volume=97|issue=2|pages=236\u2013245|doi=10.5840/monist201497216}}</ref> Recording shows that the microchip helps authorized people review and monitor cats in a certain region by referring to the database; thus the registry and the implanted microchips transform cats into social objects.<ref name=\":3\" /> Domestication shows that if the owner of a cat moves abroad with it, the microchip provides specific information concerning the diseases it might carry and the vaccinations it received.<ref name=\":3\" /> This makes it more convenient for owners to travel with their pets and avoid bringing foreign bacteria, fungi, and viruses to other nations.\n\n=== Livestock ===\nDue to the advantages of microchips, there are many concrete applications of RFID in the agri-food sector covering the majority of usual foods, such as all kinds of meats as well as various vegetables, fruits.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Kumari 43|first=Leena|date=2015|title=Review: Application of RFID in Agri-Food Sector|url=|journal=Trends in Food Science & Technology|volume=(June)|pages=144\u201361|via=}}</ref> The feature of RFID, namely its traceability, makes it possible for the increased security and confidence of customers.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, as one of the most popular livestock around the world, the health condition of pigs is vital to farmer's income and inevitably influence customers' health. Nevertheless, it is extremely challenging to monitor the pigs' health condition individually by using traditional approaches. It is common for diseases to spread from a single pig to nearly all the pigs living in the same pigsty. Fortunately, by adopting the technology of microchips to measure the drinking behavior of individual pigs housed in a group, it is possible to identify a pig's health and productivity state. As it turns out, this kind of behavior is a good indicator of a pig's overall health.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Maselyne|first=J.|last2=Adriaens|first2=I.|last3=Huybrechts|first3=T.|last4=De Ketelaere|first4=B.|last5=Millet|first5=S.|last6=Vangeyte|first6=J.|last7=Van Nuffel|first7=A.|last8=Saeys|first8=W.|date=2015-05-11|title=Measuring the drinking behaviour of individual pigs housed in group using radio frequency identification (RFID)|journal=Animal|volume=10|issue=9|pages=1557\u20131566|doi=10.1017/s1751731115000774|pmid=25959418|issn=1751-7311}}</ref> Compared to traditional visual observations to determine the pig's health state, RFID-based monitoring of pig drinking behavior is a feasible and more efficient option.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n[[File:A wildlife biologists tags finds an appropriate location on the back of a lynx kitten for an RFID implant which will allow for future recollection of this lynx's habitat and behavior.

Lacking an internal power source, it remains inert until it is powered by the scanner or another power source. While the chip itself only interacts with limited frequencies, the device also has an antenna that is optimized for a specific frequency, but is not selective. It may receive, generate current with, and reradiate stray electromagnetic waves.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-moving-your-hand/ |journal=[[Scientific American]] |title=Why does moving your hands in front of the TV or radio antenna influence the reception? |date=14 March 2005 |first=David |last=Hysell}}</ref> The radio-waves emitted by the scanner activate the chip, making the chip transmit the identification number to the scanner, and the scanner displays the number on screen.<ref name=\":1\" /> The microchip is enclosed in a biocompatible glass cylinder<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Gibbons | first1 = J.

Relevant standards for the chips are [[ISO 11784 and ISO 11785]].\n\nMost implants contain three elements: a 'chip' or [[integrated circuit]]; a coil [[inductor]], possibly with a [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] core; and a [[capacitor]]. The chip contains unique identification data and electronic circuits to encode that information. The coil acts as the secondary winding of a [[transformer]], receiving power inductively coupled to it from the scanner. The coil and capacitor together form a resonant [[LC circuit]] tuned to the frequency of the scanner's oscillating magnetic field to produce power for the chip. The chip then transmits its data back through the coil to the scanner.  The way the chip communicates with the scanner is a method called backscatter.  It becomes part of the electromagnetic field and modulates it in a manner that communicates the ID number to the scanner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/51115f.pdf |author=Microchip |title=microID 125 kHz RFID System Design Guide |date=2004 |website=microchip.com}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Rfid-scanner.jpg|thumb|Example of an RFID scanner used with animal microchip implants.]]\nThese components are encased in [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]] soda lime or borosilicate glass and hermetically sealed.

According to one reference, continental European pets get the implant in the left side of the neck.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101106093300/http://www.wsava.org:80/Site1099.htm Microchip Implantation Sites (World Small Animal Veterinary Association)].</ref> The chip can often be felt under the skin. Thin layers of [[connective tissue]] form around the implant and hold it in place.\n\n[[Horse]]s are microchipped on the left side of the neck, halfway between the poll and withers and approximately one inch below the midline of the mane, into the [[nuchal ligament]].\n\n[[Bird]]s are implanted in their breast muscles. Proper restraint is necessary so the operation requires either two people (an avian [[veterinarian]] and a veterinary [[technician]]) or general [[anesthesia]].\n\n==Animal species==\n[[Image:Horse microchiping 3.jpg|250px|thumb|Horse microchipping]]\nMany animal species have been microchipped, including [[cockatiel]]s and other parrots, horses, [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], miniature [[pig]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[deer]], [[ferret]]s, [[penguins]], sharks, [[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[alligator]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[toad]]s, [[frog]]s, rare [[fish]], [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]], [[mouse|mice]], and [[prairie dog]]s\u2014even [[whale]]s and [[elephant]]s.

In most species except horses, an external eartag is typically used in lieu of an implant microchip. Eartags with microchips or simply stamped with a visible number can be used. Both use ISO fifteen-digit microchip numbers with the U.S. country code of 840.\n\n== Cross-compatibility and standards issues ==\nIn most countries, pet ID chips adhere to an international standard to promote compatibility between chips and scanners. In the United States, however, three proprietary types of chips compete along with the international standard. Scanners distributed to United States shelters and veterinarians well into 2006 could each read at most three of the four types. Scanners with quad-read capability are now available and are increasingly considered required equipment.  Older scanner models will be in use for some time, so United States pet owners must still choose between a chip with good coverage by existing scanners and one compatible with the international standard. The four types include:<!-- Editor AndyKluck suggests this Rationale for Order of listing of the four common pet chip types:\n1. the type (ISO Conformant) that conforms to an international standard;\n2. the type (Trovan) that is a described in the legacy compatibility appendix/annex of an international standard;\n3. the type (\"FECAVA\") that is a described in the legacy compatibility appendix of an international standard except for being completely backwards from the description;\n4. the type (AVID) only fully described in secret documents. -->\n\n* The '''ISO conformant [[Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]]''' type has the greatest international acceptance. It is common in many countries including Canada and large parts of Europe (since the late 1990s). It is one of two chip protocol types (along with the \"half-duplex\" type sometimes used in farm and ranch animals) that conform to [[International Organization for Standardization]] standards [[ISO 11784 and ISO 11785]]. To support international/multivendor application, the three-digit country code can contain an assigned [[ISO 3166-1 numeric|ISO country code]] or a manufacturer code from 900 to 998 plus its identifying serial number.<ref group=\"Note\">For display, typically the three country/manufacturer code digits are followed by twelve digits of the serial number to make a fifteen-digit numeric string.</ref>  In the United States, distribution of this type has been controversial. When 24PetWatch.com began distributing them in 2003 (and more famously [[Banfield (pet hospitals)|Banfield Pet Hospitals]] in 2004) many shelter scanners couldn't read them. At least one Banfield-chipped pet was inadvertently euthanized.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5KDurtXnb?url=http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jul04/040701a.asp Pet's Death Rekindles Electronic ID Debate in JAVMA News]</ref>\n* The '''Trovan Unique''' type is another pet chip protocol type in use since 1990 in pets in the United States.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5eskVp1PZ?url=http://www.rfidnews.com/la_rel.html Trovan Chips Adopted by Los Angeles in 1996].</ref> Patent problems forced the withdrawal of Trovan's implanter device from United States distribution and they became uncommon in pets in the United States, although Trovan's original registry database \"infopet.biz\" remained in operation. In early 2007, the [[American Kennel Club]]'s chip registration service, AKC Companion Animal Recovery Corp, which had been the authorized registry for HomeAgain brand chips made by Destron/Digital Angel, began distributing Trovan chips with a different implanter. These chips are read by the Trovan, HomeAgain (Destron Fearing), and Bayer (Black Label) readers. Despite multiple offers from Trovan to AVID<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidnews.com/avidopenletter.html|title=Open Letter to Hannis Stoddard|website=www.rfidnews.com|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref> to license the technology to read the Trovan chips, AVID continues to distribute readers that do not read Trovan or the ISO compliant chips.\n* A third type, sometimes known as '''FECAVA''' or '''Destron'''<ref group=\"Note\">Curiously, an actual matching descriptive specification from the Federation of European Companion Animal Veterinary Associations, or one from Destron Corporation, remains elusive.</ref>, is available under various brand names. These include, in the United States, \"Avid Eurochip\", the common current 24PetWatch chips, and the original (and still popular) style of HomeAgain chips.  (HomeAgain and 24Petwatch can now supply the true ISO chip instead on request.) Chips of this type have ten-digit [[hexadecimal]] chip numbers. This \"FECAVA\" type is readable on a wide variety of scanners in the United States and has been less controversial, although its level of adherence to the ISO standards is sometimes exaggerated in some descriptions.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5g8Y1skEO?url=http://vetcom.amedd.army.mil/vetops/bcountry.html \"B\" Country List] (Search for \"Home Again microchips are ISO compatible\" in the text.)</ref><ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5fGG9IHIC?url=http://www.nfbnet.org/pipermail/travelandtourism_nfbnet.org/2004-October/000196.html ISO Standards Discussion] (Search for \"as compliant\" in the text.)</ref><ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5g8Z09gQ1?url=http://www.microchipidsystems.com/cgi-bin/mcmp08/rtl/phd.cgi?Autoincrement=000196&tag_rf=The%20TRAVELchip%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2&dsply_name=The%20TRAVELchip%20Single The TRAVELchip Single] (Search for \"Complies with\" in the text.)</ref>  The ISO standard has an annex (appendix) recommending that three older chip types be supported by scanners, including a 35-bit \"FECAVA\"/\"Destron\" type.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5fsCRL5Zz?url=http://againstthebeast.emenace.com/the_verichip/vchip_spec.pdf ISO Standards Combined Text] (\"FECAVA\" discussion starts on page 16 of the PDF file.)</ref> The common Eurochip/HomeAgain chips don't agree perfectly with the annex description, although the differences are sometimes considered minor.<ref group=\"Note\">The differences are obvious and easily surmounted by someone trying to make a scanner for a FECAVA chip specimen, so the Annex is still quite useful. (The actual FECAVA [[frequency-modulated]] signals are inverted (backwards) from the Annex specification.)</ref>  But the ISO standard also makes it clear<ref group=\"Note\">This is found in clauses 2 and 6 of ISO 11785; the two actual conformant 64-bit types are described in clauses 6.1 and 6.2.</ref> that only its 64-bit \"full-duplex\" and \"half-duplex\" types are \"conformant\"; even chips (e.g., the Trovan Unique) that match one of the Annex descriptions are not. More visibly, FECAVA cannot support the ISO standard's required country/manufacturer codes. They may be accepted by authorities in many countries where ISO-standard chips are the norm, but not by those requiring literal ISO conformance.\n* Finally, there's the '''AVID brand Friendchip''' type, which is peculiar due to its encryption characteristics.  Cryptographic features are not necessarily unwelcome; few pet rescuers or humane societies would object to a design that outputs an ID number \"in the clear\" for anyone to read, along with authentication features for detection of counterfeit chips, but the authentication in \"Friendchips\" has been found lacking and rather easy to spoof to the AVID scanner.{{fact|date=October 2019}} Although no authentication encryption is involved, obfuscation requires proprietary information to convert transmitted chip data to its original label ID code. Well into 2006, scanners containing the proprietary decryption were provided to the United States market only by AVID and Destron/Digital Angel; Destron/Digital Angel put the decryption feature in some, but not all, of its scanners, possibly as early as 1996. (For years, its scanners distributed to shelters through HomeAgain usually had full decryption, while many sold to veterinarians would only state that an AVID chip had been found.)  Well into 2006, both were resisting calls from consumers and welfare group officials to bring scanners to the United States shelter community combining AVID decryption capability with the ability to read ISO-compliant chips. Some complained<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5KDurtXnb?url=http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jul04/040701a.asp Pet's Death Rekindles Electronic ID Debate in JAVMA News] (Search for \"best\" in the text.)</ref> that AVID itself had long marketed combination pet scanners compatible with all common pet chips except possibly Trovan outside the United States. By keeping them out of the United States, it could be considered partly culpable in the missed-ISO chips problem others blamed on Banfield.<ref group=\"Note\">Few of the petitioners bothered to ask AVID to add Trovan-chip compatibility at that time, as these chips would remain uncommon and obscure until 2007 in the U.S.</ref> In 2006, the European manufacturer Datamars, a supplier of ISO chips used by Banfield and others, gained access to the decryption secrets and began supplying scanners with them to United States customers. This \"Black Label\" scanner was the first four-standard full-multi pet scanner in the United States market. Later in 2006, Digital Angel announced<ref>[http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=APHIS-2006-0012-0151 APHIS Comment Submission from Digital Angel Corp] (page 2, item 4 in the referenced .doc file.)</ref> that it would supply a full-multi scanner in the United States.<ref group=\"Note\">In addition to its current scanners with full support for ISO full-duplex chips, and maybe ten years production of earlier scanners with no ISO support, Destron/Digital Angel Corp. is also reported to have made in-between models circa 2006, one that gives a detection indication, but no number for ISO chips, and one model that gives either simple detection or full number readout, depending perhaps on the chip's manufacturer or some other factor. These models may be hard to discern without many specimen chips; upgrades may be available, especially to current customer partners of HomeAgain.</ref> In 2008 AVID announced a \"breakthrough\" scanner,<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5aLygw3e8?url=http://amacausa.org/photos/1218137677.pdf Avid Announces New Scanner to Reunite More Lost Pets with Their Families]</ref> although {{as of|October 2010|lc=yes}} AVID's is still so uncommon that it's unclear whether it supports the Trovan chip. Trovan also acquired the decryption technology in 2006 or earlier, and now provides it in scanners distributed in the United States by AKC-CAR.  (Some are quad-read, but others lack full ISO support.)\n\nNumerous references in print state that the incompatibilities between different chip types are a matter of \"frequency\". One may find claims that early ISO adopters in the United States endangered their customers' pets by giving them ISO chips that work at a \"different frequency\" from the local shelter's scanner, or that the United States government considered forcing an incompatible frequency change. These claims were little challenged by manufacturers and distributors of ISO chips, although later evidence suggests the claims were disinformation. In fact, all chips operate at the scanner's frequency. Although ISO chips are optimized for 134.2 [[kHz]], in practice they are readable at 125&nbsp;kHz and the \"125 kHz\" chips are readable at 134.2&nbsp;kHz.  Confirmation comes from government filings that indicate the supposed \"multi-frequency\" scanners now commonly available are really single-frequency scanners operating at 125, 134.2 or 128&nbsp;kHz. In particular, the United States HomeAgain scanner didn't change excitation frequency when ISO-read capability was added; it's still a single frequency, 125&nbsp;kHz scanner.<ref>[https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm U.S. FCC database search form] (Submit the form with \"Grantee Code\" and \"Product Code\" for each individual scanner; for the new universal Digital Angel/HomeAgain Scanner, still operating at 125 kHz codes \"C5S\" and \"HS9250L\"; for a recent AVID scanner, operating at 134.2 kHz, codes \"IOL\" and \"-134-AV1034I\" .)</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+\n|-\n! \n! colspan=\"4\" | Expected results for chip type<br />(OK=Good read<br />NR=No read<br />DO=Detect only with no number given)\n|-\n\n!

One study<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5UsnX7rZa?url=http://www.rfidnews.com/images/Evaluation.pdf Nov. 2007 Scanner Evaluation from EID Limited].</ref> cites problems with certain Trovan chips on the Datamars Black Label scanner. In general, the study found none of the tested scanners to read all four standards without some deficiency. The study predates the most recent scanner models, however.)\n\n== Difficulties in identifying a lost pet through its microchip ==\nOne of the problems is that it can be challenging to identify a lost pet through its microchip. Firstly, not every scanner is capable of reading every chip; even the best scanners miss some chips. The root of the trouble is not flawed technology, but patent protection, business interests, and politics; Secondly, taking the number shown by the scanner and figuring out which registry, out of multiple possibilities, archives the pet's identifying information.\n\nThe [[American Animal Hospital Association]] Universal Pet Microchip Lookup Tool is an internet-based application to assist in the identification of those registries on which a particular microchip is registered, or otherwise provide the chip's manufacturer. Due to AAHA's effort, it is easier to figure out which registry keeps the animal's identifying information through a microchip search site.[http://www.petmicrochiplookup.org/] By searching the databases of participating companies, this tool provides useful information. To protect owners' privacy, it will not return pet owner information contained in the registries\u2019 databases. Instead, it will display which registries should be contacted when a lost pet is scanned, and its microchip number is identified. However, since not all microchip registry companies are involved in this tool, it is missing a significant databank of Avid Identification System Inc.\n\nThirdly, in addition to the fact that not all companies participate with the lookup tool, some that do may not be accessible or helpful. When the microchips are scanned, and the related companies are figured out, it is time to determine if the chip is registered, and if so, if the registration information is up-to-date. The challenge is that only when all the three steps are successful can the owner of the lost pet be contacted.\n\n==Reported adverse reactions==\nRFID chips are used in animal research, and at least three studies conducted since the 1990s have reported [[tumors]] at the site of implantation in laboratory mice and rats.<ref name=ChipImplantTumors>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090800997_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Chip Implants Linked to Animal Tumors | first=Todd | last=Lewan | accessdate=12 May 2010 |date=8 September 2007}}</ref> Noted veterinary associations<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5akEi2cVL?url=http://www.wsava.org/Chip999.htm |title=Position Statement from World Small Animal Veterinary Association |website=wsava.org}}</ref> responded with continued support for the procedure as reasonably safe for cats and dogs, pointing to rates of serious complications on the order of one in a million in the UK, which has a system for tracking such adverse reactions and has chipped over 3.7 million pet dogs.

Several prototype systems are being developed to combat unauthorized reading, including RFID signal interruption, as well as the possibility of legislation. Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on this matter since 2002.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lockton|first=Vance|date=2005|title=RFID: The Next Serious Threat to Privacy|url=|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|volume=7| issue =  4|pages=221\u201331|doi=10.1007/s10676-006-0014-2}}</ref> Different countries have responded differently to these issues.\n\nAs early as in 1997, some scholars believed that microchip implantation was technically possible, but it was suggested that it was the time to consider strategies for preventing potentially grievous intrusion into personal privacy.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ramesh | first1 = Elaine M | year = 1997 | title = Time Enough - Consequences of Human Microchip Implantation | url = | journal = Risk: Health, Safety & Environment | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 373\u2013408 }}</ref> Still, it is possible that microchips implanted on animals can also lead to privacy issues or information breaches, which can lead to serious social problems.\n\n===The microchip ownership question===\nThe widespread adoption of microchip identification may lead to ownership disputes occurring more frequently since sometimes microchip ownership information is irrelevant according to the ownership laws. This can occur when the owner is not the one to whom the microchip ownership information belongs. This is a significant problem because client confidentiality rules generally prohibit veterinarians from divulging information about a pet without the client's permission. Furthermore, veterinarians are required to get permission from the person who registered the chip to perform a surgery on a microchipped spay, even if the animal is under a severe situation. The problem can be more complicated if the animals with microchips are abandoned on purpose or stolen by someone else.\n\n===Protecting privacy===\nThe first method of protecting microchip privacy is by regularly updating information. Stray animals with incorrect microchip details are less likely to be reclaimed and when compared to pets with correct microchip details, the time taken to retrieve the pets is longer, and sometimes reuniting is impossible.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Katie|first=Goodwin|date=2018|title=Email Reminders Increase the Frequency That Pet Owners Update Their Microchip Information.|url=|journal=Animals|volume=(2076-2615) 8 (2): 1.|pages=|via=}}</ref> When this happens, not only do the owners lose their beloved pets, but their private information stored in the microchips can be read by anyone who uses a scanner. Therefore, it is wise to update microchip information regularly, especially when owners move or change their phone numbers. According to research, email reminders may increase the frequency of pet owners updating their microchip information.<ref name=\":6\" /> By increasing the pet owners\u2019 updating frequency of the pets\u2019 data, the reclaim percentages of stray animals will increase, thus reducing the number of pets euthanized in shelters every year.<ref name=\":6\" /> By this means, the owners' private information is more likely to be protected once they reunite with their beloved pets.\n\nAnother method of prevention is by using cryptography. [[Rolling code]]s and [[challenge-response authentication]] (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition of the messages between the tag and reader; as any messages that have been recorded would prove to be unsuccessful on repeat transmission. Similarly, it is possible that some novel RFID authentication protocols for microchip ownership transfer can be adapted to protect users' privacy, which meets three key requirements for secure microchip ownership transfer.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Boyeon|date=2011|title=Scalable RFID Security Protocols Supporting Tag Ownership Transfer|url=|journal=Computer Communications|volume=34 (January)|pages=556\u201366|via=}}</ref> The three requirements include: new owner privacy (only the new owner should be able to identify and control the microchip), old owner privacy (past interactions between the microchip and its previous owner should not be traceable by the new owner) as well as authorization recovery (the new owner should be able to transfer its authorization rights to the previous owner in some special cases).<ref name=\":7\" /> These features can protect owners' privacy to some extent.\n\n=== Australia ===\nBecause the ability to trace livestock from property of birth to slaughter is critical to the safety of red meat, the Australian red meat industry has implemented a national system known as [[National Livestock Identification System]] to ensure the quality and safety of beef, lamb, sheep meat and goat meat. There are weaknesses in the current microchipping system in Australia.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Emily|first=Lancaster|date=2015|title=Problems Associated with the Microchip Data of Stray Dogs and Cats Entering RSPCA Queensland Shelters|url=|journal=Animals|volume=(2076-2615) 5 (2): 332.|issue=2|pages=332\u2013348|pmc=4494412|pmid=26479238|doi=10.3390/ani5020332}}</ref> According to several pieces of researches in 2015, reclaim rates were significantly higher for animals with microchips than those without microchips, which is based on the statistical analysis of the raw data of dogs and cats living in Australia as well as microchipped animals.<ref name=\":5\" /> Besides, to determine the character and the frequency of inaccurate microchip data used for locating owners of stray pets, the researchers also analyzed admission data for stray dogs and cats entering shelters called RSPCA-Queensland (QLD). The results show that the problem of microchip data may reduce the possibility that a pet's owner will be contacted to reclaim the animal.<ref name=\":5\" /> Therefore, it is necessary that the current microchipping system in Australia be perfect and that microchip owners update their data frequently.\n\n=== The United States ===\nA similar system, the [[National Animal Identification System]] exists in the US.\n\n== History ==\nSince their first use in the mid-1980s, microchips have allowed innovative investigations into numerous biological traits of animals.<ref name=\":1\" /> The tiny, coded markers implanted into individual animals allow assessment of growth rates, movement patterns, and survival patterns for many species in a manner more reliable than traditional approaches of externally marking animals for identification.<ref name=\":1\" /> Microchips have also been used to confirm the identity of zoo animals, pets, and protected species that have been illegally removed from the wild.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Manufacturers & Registers ==\nIn the United States, the history of some tag manufacturers dates back more than 30 years.

The chip, about the size of a large grain of rice, uses passive [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) technology, and is also known as a PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag. Standard pet microchips are typically 11-13 mm long (approximately {{frac|1|2}} inch) and 2 mm in diameter.<ref>https://www.service-icar.com/tables/tabella3.php#prettyPhoto</ref>  \n\nExternally attached microchips such as RFID [[ear tag]]s are commonly used to identify farm and ranch animals, with the exception of horses. Some external microchips can be read with the same scanner used with implanted chips.\n\n==Uses and benefits==\n[[Animal shelter]]s, animal control officers and veterinarians routinely look for microchips to return lost pets quickly to their owners, avoiding expenses for housing, food, medical care, outplacing and euthanasia. Many shelters place chips in all outplaced animals. \n\nMicrochips are also used by [[kennel]]s, breeders, brokers, trainers, registries, [[rescue group]]s, [[Humane society|humane societies]], [[clinic]]s, [[farm]]s, [[stable]]s, animal clubs and associations, researchers, and [[pet store]]s.\n\nSome [[pet door]]s can be programmed to be activated by the microchips of specific animals, allowing only certain animals to use the door.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lomas|first1=Natasha|title=Now you can quantify your cat\u2019s comings and goings too|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/28/now-you-can-quantify-your-cats-comings-and-goings-too/|accessdate=2018-01-04|work=TechCrunch|date=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome countries require microchips in imported animals to match [[vaccination]] records. Microchip tagging may also be required for [[CITES]]-regulated international trade in certain endangered animals: for example, [[Asian Arowana]] are tagged to limit import to captive-bred fish.  Also, birds not [[bird ringing|banded]] who cross international borders as pets or for trade must be microchipped so that each bird is uniquely identifiable.\n\n== Laws ==\nAt present, microchipping of pets and other animals is voluntary in the U.S. except for some legislation mandating microchipping as a means of identifying animals who have been identified as being dangerous.

After checking that the animal does not already have a chip, the vet or technician injects the chip with a syringe and records the chip's unique ID. No anesthetic is required it is a simple procedure and causes little discomfort: the pain is minimal and short-lived.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/Why-is-it-important-to-ensure-my-pet-is-microchipped_500.html|title=Why is it important to ensure my pet  is microchipped? - RSPCA Australia knowledgebase|website=kb.rspca.org.au|language=en|access-date=2017-07-04}}</ref> Studies on horses show swelling and increased sensitivity take approximately three days to resolve.<ref name=LaColla/> Humans report swelling and bruising at the time of implant, two to four weeks for scar tissue to form and itching and pinching sensations for up to two years.<ref name=Grauer/> A test scan ensures correct operation.\n\nSome shelters and vets designate themselves as the primary contact to remain informed about possible problems with the animals they place. The form is sent to a registry, who may be the chip manufacturer, distributor or an independent entity such as a [[pet recovery service]]. Some countries have a single official national database. For a fee, the registry typically provides 24-hour, toll-free telephone service for the life of the pet. Some veterinarians leave registration to the owner, usually done online, but a chip without current contact information is essentially useless.\n\nThe owner receives a registration certificate with the chip ID and recovery service contact information. The information can also be imprinted on a collar tag worn by the animal. Like an automobile [[title (property)|title]], the certificate serves as proof of ownership and is transferred with the animal when it is sold or traded; an animal without a certificate could be stolen. Nevertheless, there are some [[Microchip implant privacy in animals|privacy concerns]] regarding the use of microchips.{{explain|date=October 2019}}\n\nAuthorities and shelters examine strays for chips, providing the recovery service with the ID number, description and location so they may notify the owner or contact. If the pet is wearing the collar tag, the finder does not need a chip reader to contact the registry. An owner can also report a missing pet to the recovery service, as vets look for chips in new animals and check with the recovery service to see if it has been reported lost or stolen.\n\nMany veterinarians scan an animal's chip on every visit to verify correct operation. Some use the chip ID as their database index and print it on receipts, test results, vaccination certifications and other records.\n\nSome veterinary tests and procedures require positive identification of the animal, and a microchip may be acceptable for this purpose as an alternative to a tattoo.\n\n== Advantages of Data Collection ==\n\n=== Pets ===\nThere are multiple reasons for the use of the microchips on pets as a documentation device, which are also advantages of microchips regarding information collection. The three major reasons for microchip implantation are [[delocalization]], recording, and domestication. For example, with a feline microchip, delocalization shows that a registered cat is one that society is aware of and the cat owns a position in the social order of other types of animals.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Martignani|first=Luca|date=2014|title=Feline Microchip: An Exercise in the Sociology of Documentality.|url=|journal=Monist|volume=97|issue=2|pages=236\u2013245|doi=10.5840/monist201497216}}</ref> Recording shows that the microchip helps authorized people review and monitor cats in a certain region by referring to the database; thus the registry and the implanted microchips transform cats into social objects.<ref name=\":3\" /> Domestication shows that if the owner of a cat moves abroad with it, the microchip provides specific information concerning the diseases it might carry and the vaccinations it received.<ref name=\":3\" /> This makes it more convenient for owners to travel with their pets and avoid bringing foreign bacteria, fungi, and viruses to other nations.\n\n=== Livestock ===\nDue to the advantages of microchips, there are many concrete applications of RFID in the agri-food sector covering the majority of usual foods, such as all kinds of meats as well as various vegetables, fruits.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Kumari 43|first=Leena|date=2015|title=Review: Application of RFID in Agri-Food Sector|url=|journal=Trends in Food Science & Technology|volume=(June)|pages=144\u201361|via=}}</ref> The feature of RFID, namely its traceability, makes it possible for the increased security and confidence of customers.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, as one of the most popular livestock around the world, the health condition of pigs is vital to farmer's income and inevitably influence customers' health. Nevertheless, it is extremely challenging to monitor the pigs' health condition individually by using traditional approaches. It is common for diseases to spread from a single pig to nearly all the pigs living in the same pigsty. Fortunately, by adopting the technology of microchips to measure the drinking behavior of individual pigs housed in a group, it is possible to identify a pig's health and productivity state. As it turns out, this kind of behavior is a good indicator of a pig's overall health.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Maselyne|first=J.|last2=Adriaens|first2=I.|last3=Huybrechts|first3=T.|last4=De Ketelaere|first4=B.|last5=Millet|first5=S.|last6=Vangeyte|first6=J.|last7=Van Nuffel|first7=A.|last8=Saeys|first8=W.|date=2015-05-11|title=Measuring the drinking behaviour of individual pigs housed in group using radio frequency identification (RFID)|journal=Animal|volume=10|issue=9|pages=1557\u20131566|doi=10.1017/s1751731115000774|pmid=25959418|issn=1751-7311}}</ref> Compared to traditional visual observations to determine the pig's health state, RFID-based monitoring of pig drinking behavior is a feasible and more efficient option.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n[[File:A wildlife biologists tags finds an appropriate location on the back of a lynx kitten for an RFID implant which will allow for future recollection of this lynx's habitat and behavior.

Besides, due to the fact that traditional identifications are on the exterior of the animal, tags can be lost, scars can heal and tattoos can fade.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the advantages mentioned above, other useful and significant information can also be collected by microchips. For example, chipped wild animals that are recaptured can provide information on growth rate and change of location as well as other valuable data such as age structure, [[sex ratio]]s, and [[longevity]] of individuals in the wild.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other researches on small mammals like [[rat]]s and [[Mouse|mice]] also adopt this technology to determine body temperature of terminally ill animals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kort|first=W.

Lacking an internal power source, it remains inert until it is powered by the scanner or another power source. While the chip itself only interacts with limited frequencies, the device also has an antenna that is optimized for a specific frequency, but is not selective. It may receive, generate current with, and reradiate stray electromagnetic waves.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-moving-your-hand/ |journal=[[Scientific American]] |title=Why does moving your hands in front of the TV or radio antenna influence the reception? |date=14 March 2005 |first=David |last=Hysell}}</ref> The radio-waves emitted by the scanner activate the chip, making the chip transmit the identification number to the scanner, and the scanner displays the number on screen.<ref name=\":1\" /> The microchip is enclosed in a biocompatible glass cylinder<ref name=\":1\">Gibbons, J.

Relevant standards for the chips are [[ISO 11784 and ISO 11785]].\n\nMost implants contain three elements: a 'chip' or [[integrated circuit]]; a coil [[inductor]], possibly with a [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] core; and a [[capacitor]]. The chip contains unique identification data and electronic circuits to encode that information. The coil acts as the secondary winding of a [[transformer]], receiving power inductively coupled to it from the scanner. The coil and capacitor together form a resonant [[LC circuit]] tuned to the frequency of the scanner's oscillating magnetic field to produce power for the chip. The chip then transmits its data back through the coil to the scanner.  The way the chip communicates with the scanner is a method called backscatter.  It becomes part of the electromagnetic field and modulates it in a manner that communicates the ID number to the scanner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/51115f.pdf |author=Microchip |title=microID 125 kHz RFID System Design Guide |date=2004 |website=microchip.com}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Rfid-scanner.jpg|thumb|Example of an RFID scanner used with animal microchip implants.]]\nThese components are encased in [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]] soda lime or borosilicate glass and hermetically sealed.

According to one reference, continental European pets get the implant in the left side of the neck.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101106093300/http://www.wsava.org:80/Site1099.htm Microchip Implantation Sites (World Small Animal Veterinary Association)].</ref> The chip can often be felt under the skin. Thin layers of [[connective tissue]] form around the implant and hold it in place.\n\n[[Horse]]s are microchipped on the left side of the neck, halfway between the poll and withers and approximately one inch below the midline of the mane, into the [[nuchal ligament]].\n\n[[Bird]]s are implanted in their breast muscles.

In most species except horses, an external eartag is typically used in lieu of an implant microchip. Eartags with microchips or simply stamped with a visible number can be used. Both use ISO fifteen-digit microchip numbers with the U.S. country code of 840.\n\n== Cross-compatibility and standards issues ==\nIn most countries, pet ID chips adhere to an international standard to promote compatibility between chips and scanners. In the United States, however, three proprietary types of chips compete along with the international standard. Scanners distributed to United States shelters and veterinarians well into 2006 could each read at most three of the four types. Scanners with quad-read capability are now available and are increasingly considered required equipment.  Older scanner models will be in use for some time, so United States pet owners must still choose between a chip with good coverage by existing scanners and one compatible with the international standard. The four types include:<!-- Editor AndyKluck suggests this Rationale for Order of listing of the four common pet chip types:\n1. the type (ISO Conformant) that conforms to an international standard;\n2. the type (Trovan) that is a described in the legacy compatibility appendix/annex of an international standard;\n3. the type (\"FECAVA\") that is a described in the legacy compatibility appendix of an international standard except for being completely backwards from the description;\n4. the type (AVID) only fully described in secret documents. -->\n\n* The '''ISO conformant [[Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]]''' type has the greatest international acceptance. It is common in many countries including Canada and large parts of Europe (since the late 1990s). It is one of two chip protocol types (along with the \"half-duplex\" type sometimes used in farm and ranch animals) that conform to [[International Organization for Standardization]] standards [[ISO 11784 and ISO 11785]]. To support international/multivendor application, the three-digit country code can contain an assigned [[ISO 3166-1 numeric|ISO country code]] or a manufacturer code from 900 to 998 plus its identifying serial number.<ref group=\"Note\">For display, typically the three country/manufacturer code digits are followed by twelve digits of the serial number to make a fifteen-digit numeric string.</ref>  In the United States, distribution of this type has been controversial. When 24PetWatch.com began distributing them in 2003 (and more famously [[Banfield (pet hospitals)|Banfield Pet Hospitals]] in 2004) many shelter scanners couldn't read them. At least one Banfield-chipped pet was inadvertently euthanized.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5KDurtXnb?url=http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jul04/040701a.asp Pet's Death Rekindles Electronic ID Debate in JAVMA News]</ref>\n* The '''Trovan Unique''' type is another pet chip protocol type in use since 1990 in pets in the United States.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5eskVp1PZ?url=http://www.rfidnews.com/la_rel.html Trovan Chips Adopted by Los Angeles in 1996].</ref> Patent problems forced the withdrawal of Trovan's implanter device from United States distribution and they became uncommon in pets in the United States, although Trovan's original registry database \"infopet.biz\" remained in operation. In early 2007, the [[American Kennel Club]]'s chip registration service, AKC Companion Animal Recovery Corp, which had been the authorized registry for HomeAgain brand chips made by Destron/Digital Angel, began distributing Trovan chips with a different implanter. These chips are read by the Trovan, HomeAgain (Destron Fearing), and Bayer (Black Label) readers. Despite multiple offers from Trovan to AVID<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidnews.com/avidopenletter.html|title=Open Letter to Hannis Stoddard|website=www.rfidnews.com|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref> to license the technology to read the Trovan chips, AVID continues to distribute readers that do not read Trovan or the ISO compliant chips.\n* A third type, sometimes known as '''FECAVA''' or '''Destron'''<ref group=\"Note\">Curiously, an actual matching descriptive specification from the Federation of European Companion Animal Veterinary Associations, or one from Destron Corporation, remains elusive.</ref>, is available under various brand names. These include, in the United States, \"Avid Eurochip\", the common current 24PetWatch chips, and the original (and still popular) style of HomeAgain chips.  (HomeAgain and 24Petwatch can now supply the true ISO chip instead on request.) Chips of this type have ten-digit [[hexadecimal]] chip numbers. This \"FECAVA\" type is readable on a wide variety of scanners in the United States and has been less controversial, although its level of adherence to the ISO standards is sometimes exaggerated in some descriptions.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5g8Y1skEO?url=http://vetcom.amedd.army.mil/vetops/bcountry.html \"B\" Country List] (Search for \"Home Again microchips are ISO compatible\" in the text.)</ref><ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5fGG9IHIC?url=http://www.nfbnet.org/pipermail/travelandtourism_nfbnet.org/2004-October/000196.html ISO Standards Discussion] (Search for \"as compliant\" in the text.)</ref><ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5g8Z09gQ1?url=http://www.microchipidsystems.com/cgi-bin/mcmp08/rtl/phd.cgi?Autoincrement=000196&tag_rf=The%20TRAVELchip%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2&dsply_name=The%20TRAVELchip%20Single The TRAVELchip Single] (Search for \"Complies with\" in the text.)</ref>  The ISO standard has an annex (appendix) recommending that three older chip types be supported by scanners, including a 35-bit \"FECAVA\"/\"Destron\" type.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5fsCRL5Zz?url=http://againstthebeast.emenace.com/the_verichip/vchip_spec.pdf ISO Standards Combined Text] (\"FECAVA\" discussion starts on page 16 of the PDF file.)</ref> The common Eurochip/HomeAgain chips don't agree perfectly with the annex description, although the differences are sometimes considered minor.<ref group=\"Note\">The differences are obvious and easily surmounted by someone trying to make a scanner for a FECAVA chip specimen, so the Annex is still quite useful. (The actual FECAVA [[frequency-modulated]] signals are inverted (backwards) from the Annex specification.)</ref>  But the ISO standard also makes it clear<ref group=\"Note\">This is found in clauses 2 and 6 of ISO 11785; the two actual conformant 64-bit types are described in clauses 6.1 and 6.2.</ref> that only its 64-bit \"full-duplex\" and \"half-duplex\" types are \"conformant\"; even chips (e.g., the Trovan Unique) that match one of the Annex descriptions are not. More visibly, FECAVA cannot support the ISO standard's required country/manufacturer codes. They may be accepted by authorities in many countries where ISO-standard chips are the norm, but not by those requiring literal ISO conformance.\n* Finally, there's the '''AVID brand Friendchip''' type, which is peculiar due to its encryption characteristics.  Cryptographic features are not necessarily unwelcome; few pet rescuers or humane societies would object to a design that outputs an ID number \"in the clear\" for anyone to read, along with authentication features for detection of counterfeit chips, but the authentication in \"Friendchips\" has been found lacking and rather easy to spoof to the AVID scanner.{{fact|date=October 2019}} Although no authentication encryption is involved, obfuscation requires proprietary information to convert transmitted chip data to its original label ID code. Well into 2006, scanners containing the proprietary decryption were provided to the United States market only by AVID and Destron/Digital Angel; Destron/Digital Angel put the decryption feature in some, but not all, of its scanners, possibly as early as 1996. (For years, its scanners distributed to shelters through HomeAgain usually had full decryption, while many sold to veterinarians would only state that an AVID chip had been found.)  Well into 2006, both were resisting calls from consumers and welfare group officials to bring scanners to the United States shelter community combining AVID decryption capability with the ability to read ISO-compliant chips. Some complained<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5KDurtXnb?url=http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jul04/040701a.asp Pet's Death Rekindles Electronic ID Debate in JAVMA News] (Search for \"best\" in the text.)</ref> that AVID itself had long marketed combination pet scanners compatible with all common pet chips except possibly Trovan outside the United States. By keeping them out of the United States, it could be considered partly culpable in the missed-ISO chips problem others blamed on Banfield.<ref group=\"Note\">Few of the petitioners bothered to ask AVID to add Trovan-chip compatibility at that time, as these chips would remain uncommon and obscure until 2007 in the U.S.</ref> In 2006, the European manufacturer Datamars, a supplier of ISO chips used by Banfield and others, gained access to the decryption secrets and began supplying scanners with them to United States customers. This \"Black Label\" scanner was the first four-standard full-multi pet scanner in the United States market. Later in 2006, Digital Angel announced<ref>[http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=APHIS-2006-0012-0151 APHIS Comment Submission from Digital Angel Corp] (page 2, item 4 in the referenced .doc file.)</ref> that it would supply a full-multi scanner in the United States.<ref group=\"Note\">In addition to its current scanners with full support for ISO full-duplex chips, and maybe ten years production of earlier scanners with no ISO support, Destron/Digital Angel Corp. is also reported to have made in-between models circa 2006, one that gives a detection indication, but no number for ISO chips, and one model that gives either simple detection or full number readout, depending perhaps on the chip's manufacturer or some other factor. These models may be hard to discern without many specimen chips; upgrades may be available, especially to current customer partners of HomeAgain.</ref> In 2008 AVID announced a \"breakthrough\" scanner,<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5aLygw3e8?url=http://amacausa.org/photos/1218137677.pdf Avid Announces New Scanner to Reunite More Lost Pets with Their Families]</ref> although {{as of|October 2010|lc=yes}} AVID's is still so uncommon that it's unclear whether it supports the Trovan chip. Trovan also acquired the decryption technology in 2006 or earlier, and now provides it in scanners distributed in the United States by AKC-CAR.  (Some are quad-read, but others lack full ISO support.)\n\nNumerous references in print state that the incompatibilities between different chip types are a matter of \"frequency\". One may find claims that early ISO adopters in the United States endangered their customers' pets by giving them ISO chips that work at a \"different frequency\" from the local shelter's scanner, or that the United States government considered forcing an incompatible frequency change. These claims were little challenged by manufacturers and distributors of ISO chips, although later evidence suggests the claims were disinformation. In fact, all chips operate at the scanner's frequency. Although ISO chips are optimized for 134.2 [[kHz]], in practice they are readable at 125&nbsp;kHz and the \"125 kHz\" chips are readable at 134.2&nbsp;kHz.  Confirmation comes from government filings that indicate the supposed \"multi-frequency\" scanners now commonly available are really single-frequency scanners operating at 125, 134.2 or 128&nbsp;kHz. In particular, the United States HomeAgain scanner didn't change excitation frequency when ISO-read capability was added; it's still a single frequency, 125&nbsp;kHz scanner.<ref>[https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm U.S. FCC database search form] (Submit the form with \"Grantee Code\" and \"Product Code\" for each individual scanner; for the new universal Digital Angel/HomeAgain Scanner, still operating at 125 kHz codes \"C5S\" and \"HS9250L\"; for a recent AVID scanner, operating at 134.2 kHz, codes \"IOL\" and \"-134-AV1034I\" .)</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+\n|-\n! \n! colspan=\"4\" | Expected results for chip type<br />(OK=Good read<br />NR=No read<br />DO=Detect only with no number given)\n|-\n\n!

One study<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5UsnX7rZa?url=http://www.rfidnews.com/images/Evaluation.pdf Nov. 2007 Scanner Evaluation from EID Limited].</ref> cites problems with certain Trovan chips on the Datamars Black Label scanner. In general, the study found none of the tested scanners to read all four standards without some deficiency. The study predates the most recent scanner models, however.)\n\n== Difficulties in identifying a lost pet through its microchip ==\nOne of the problems is that it can be challenging to identify a lost pet through its microchip. Firstly, not every scanner is capable of reading every chip; even the best scanners miss some chips. The root of the trouble is not flawed technology, but patent protection, business interests, and politics; Secondly, taking the number shown by the scanner and figuring out which registry, out of multiple possibilities, archives the pet's identifying information.\n\nThe [[American Animal Hospital Association]] Universal Pet Microchip Lookup Tool is an internet-based application to assist in the identification of those registries on which a particular microchip is registered, or otherwise provide the chip's manufacturer. Due to AAHA's effort, it is easier to figure out which registry keeps the animal's identifying information through a microchip search site.[http://www.petmicrochiplookup.org/] By searching the databases of participating companies, this tool provides useful information. To protect owners' privacy, it will not return pet owner information contained in the registries\u2019 databases. Instead, it will display which registries should be contacted when a lost pet is scanned, and its microchip number is identified. However, since not all microchip registry companies are involved in this tool, it is missing a significant databank of Avid Identification System Inc.\n\nThirdly, in addition to the fact that not all companies participate with the lookup tool, some that do may not be accessible or helpful. When the microchips are scanned, and the related companies are figured out, it is time to determine if the chip is registered, and if so, if the registration information is up-to-date. The challenge is that only when all the three steps are successful can the owner of the lost pet be contacted.\n\n==Reported adverse reactions==\nRFID chips are used in animal research, and at least three studies conducted since the 1990s have reported [[tumors]] at the site of implantation in laboratory mice and rats.<ref name=ChipImplantTumors>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090800997_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Chip Implants Linked to Animal Tumors | first=Todd | last=Lewan | accessdate=12 May 2010 |date=8 September 2007}}</ref> Noted veterinary associations<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5akEi2cVL?url=http://www.wsava.org/Chip999.htm |title=Position Statement from World Small Animal Veterinary Association |website=wsava.org}}</ref> responded with continued support for the procedure as reasonably safe for cats and dogs, pointing to rates of serious complications on the order of one in a million in the UK, which has a system for tracking such adverse reactions and has chipped over 3.7 million pet dogs.

Several prototype systems are being developed to combat unauthorized reading, including RFID signal interruption, as well as the possibility of legislation. Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on this matter since 2002.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lockton|first=Vance|date=2005|title=RFID: The Next Serious Threat to Privacy|url=|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|volume=7| issue =  4|pages=221\u201331|doi=10.1007/s10676-006-0014-2}}</ref> Different countries have responded differently to these issues.\n\nAs early as in 1997, some scholars believed that microchip implantation was technically possible, but it was suggested that it was the time to consider strategies for preventing potentially grievous intrusion into personal privacy.<ref name=\":9\">Ramesh, Elaine M. 1997. \"Time Enough - Consequences of Human Microchip Implantation.\" ''Risk: Health, Safety & Environment'' 8(4):373-408.</ref> Still, it is possible that microchips implanted on animals can also lead to privacy issues or information breaches, which can lead to serious social problems.\n\n===The microchip ownership question===\nThe widespread adoption of microchip identification may lead to ownership disputes occurring more frequently since sometimes microchip ownership information is irrelevant according to the ownership laws. This can occur when the owner is not the one to whom the microchip ownership information belongs. This is a significant problem because client confidentiality rules generally prohibit veterinarians from divulging information about a pet without the client's permission. Furthermore, veterinarians are required to get permission from the person who registered the chip to perform a surgery on a microchipped spay, even if the animal is under a severe situation. The problem can be more complicated if the animals with microchips are abandoned on purpose or stolen by someone else.\n\n===Protecting privacy===\nThe first method of protecting microchip privacy is by regularly updating information. Stray animals with incorrect microchip details are less likely to be reclaimed and when compared to pets with correct microchip details, the time taken to retrieve the pets is longer, and sometimes reuniting is impossible.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Katie|first=Goodwin|date=2018|title=Email Reminders Increase the Frequency That Pet Owners Update Their Microchip Information.|url=|journal=Animals|volume=(2076-2615) 8 (2): 1.|pages=|via=}}</ref> When this happens, not only do the owners lose their beloved pets, but their private information stored in the microchips can be read by anyone who uses a scanner. Therefore, it is wise to update microchip information regularly, especially when owners move or change their phone numbers. According to research, email reminders may increase the frequency of pet owners updating their microchip information.<ref name=\":6\" /> By increasing the pet owners\u2019 updating frequency of the pets\u2019 data, the reclaim percentages of stray animals will increase, thus reducing the number of pets euthanized in shelters every year.<ref name=\":6\" /> By this means, the owners' private information is more likely to be protected once they reunite with their beloved pets.\n\nAnother method of prevention is by using cryptography. [[Rolling code]]s and [[challenge-response authentication]] (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition of the messages between the tag and reader; as any messages that have been recorded would prove to be unsuccessful on repeat transmission. Similarly, it is possible that some novel RFID authentication protocols for microchip ownership transfer can be adapted to protect users' privacy, which meets three key requirements for secure microchip ownership transfer.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Boyeon|date=2011|title=Scalable RFID Security Protocols Supporting Tag Ownership Transfer|url=|journal=Computer Communications|volume=34 (January)|pages=556\u201366|via=}}</ref> The three requirements include: new owner privacy (only the new owner should be able to identify and control the microchip), old owner privacy (past interactions between the microchip and its previous owner should not be traceable by the new owner) as well as authorization recovery (the new owner should be able to transfer its authorization rights to the previous owner in some special cases).<ref name=\":7\" /> These features can protect owners' privacy to some extent.\n\n=== Australia ===\nBecause the ability to trace livestock from property of birth to slaughter is critical to the safety of red meat, the Australian red meat industry has implemented a national system known as [[National Livestock Identification System]] to ensure the quality and safety of beef, lamb, sheep meat and goat meat. There are weaknesses in the current microchipping system in Australia.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Emily|first=Lancaster|date=2015|title=Problems Associated with the Microchip Data of Stray Dogs and Cats Entering RSPCA Queensland Shelters|url=|journal=Animals|volume=(2076-2615) 5 (2): 332.|issue=2|pages=332\u2013348|pmc=4494412|pmid=26479238|doi=10.3390/ani5020332}}</ref> According to several pieces of researches in 2015, reclaim rates were significantly higher for animals with microchips than those without microchips, which is based on the statistical analysis of the raw data of dogs and cats living in Australia as well as microchipped animals.<ref name=\":5\" /> Besides, to determine the character and the frequency of inaccurate microchip data used for locating owners of stray pets, the researchers also analyzed admission data for stray dogs and cats entering shelters called RSPCA-Queensland (QLD). The results show that the problem of microchip data may reduce the possibility that a pet's owner will be contacted to reclaim the animal.<ref name=\":5\" /> Therefore, it is necessary that the current microchipping system in Australia be perfect and that microchip owners update their data frequently.\n\n=== The United States ===\nA similar system, the [[National Animal Identification System]] exists in the US.\n\n== History ==\nSince their first use in the mid-1980s, microchips have allowed innovative investigations into numerous biological traits of animals.<ref name=\":1\" /> The tiny, coded markers implanted into individual animals allow assessment of growth rates, movement patterns, and survival patterns for many species in a manner more reliable than traditional approaches of externally marking animals for identification.<ref name=\":1\" /> Microchips have also been used to confirm the identity of zoo animals, pets, and protected species that have been illegally removed from the wild.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Manufacturers & Registers ==\nIn the United States, the history of some tag manufacturers dates back more than 30 years.
