The region includes the provinces of [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], [[Adana Province|Adana]], [[Osmaniye Province|Osmaniye]] and [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. Adding the large population centers surrounding Cilicia, more than 10 million people reside within 2-hours drive from the Adana city center.\n\nThroughout the history, Adana were a market town at the Cilicia plain and one of the gateways from Europe to the Middle East, as it provided the only access on the wide Seyhan river. The city turned into a power house of Cilicia with the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkic]] takeover in 1359. The city remained as the capital of the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] until 1608, and then the regional administrative center for the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkey]], and shortly for the [[Cilicia#French Cilicia|French Cilicia]]. Economically a modest town until 1861 with a population of roughly 15000, the city boomed with the breakdown of the [[American Civil War]], as becoming a new center for supplying cotton and cotton related products to Europe. Traditionally a town populated by Armenians and Turks; influx of [[Armenians]], Turks, [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Alawites]] at this period, made the city one of the most diverse cities of [[Anatolia]]. Economic, social and cultural growth were halted by the [[Adana massacre]], the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]]<ref name=\"HrantAdana\">{{cite web|url=https://hrantdink.org/attachments/article/1398/Adana_Raporu_new.pdf|title=Ermeni K\u00fclt\u00fcr Varl\u0131klar\u0131yla Adana|publisher=HDV Yay\u0131nlar\u0131|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>, all devastated the city in the early 20th century. After the eviction of Armenians and Greeks, most of the city's private properties were confiscated in 1923 and were granted to the Muslim/Turks who recently had migrated into the city.  After a standstill period, city's economy again boomed in 1950s with the construction of the [[Seyhan Dam]], and the growth continued until 1980s.\n\nAdana in the 21st century, are a center for regional trade, healthcare, public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are significant sectors of the city. Economic decline caused by national policies and de-industrialization since 1990s is reversing, as the city is gaining momentum with the fairs, festivals and entertainment life. Though not competing at the top level, the rivalry between the city's football clubs, [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]], is getting national attraction as being the [[Adana football derby|only citywide derby]] of [[Turkey]] that is rooted in socio-economic divisions.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Adana1.jpg|thumb|Eskibaraj Dam Lake on [[Seyhan River]].]]\n\nAdana is located at the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, where it serves as the gateway to the Cilicia plain. This large stretch of flat, fertile land lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]].\n\nFrom Adana, crossing the Cilicia westwards, the road from Tarsus enters the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. It goes through the famous [[Cilician Gates]], the rocky pass through which armies have coursed since the dawn of history, and continues to the Anatolian plain.\n\nThe north of the city is surrounded by the Seyhan reservoir. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power and to irrigate the lower \u00c7ukurova plain. Two irrigation channels in the city flow to the plain, passing through the city center from east to west. There is another canal for irrigating the Y\u00fcre\u011fir plain to the southeast of the city.\n\nThe [[37th parallel north]] passes through the city.\n\n===Climate===\nAdana has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under both the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] classification, and a dry-hot summer subtropical climate (Csa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification. Winters are mild and wet. Summers are long, hot, humid and dry. The highest recorded temperature was on 8 July 1978 at {{convert|45.6|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}. The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-8.1|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Adana (1927\u20132017)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 26.5\n|Feb record high C = 28.5\n|Mar record high C = 32.0\n|Apr record high C = 37.5\n|May record high C = 41.3\n|Jun record high C = 42.8\n|Jul record high C = 44.0\n|Aug record high C = 45.6\n|Sep record high C = 43.2\n|Oct record high C = 41.5\n|Nov record high C = 34.3\n|Dec record high C = 30.8\n|year record high C = 45.6\n|Jan high C = 14.7\n|Feb high C = 16.1\n|Mar high C = 19.3\n|Apr high C = 23.6\n|May high C = 28.2\n|Jun high C = 31.7\n|Jul high C = 33.8\n|Aug high C = 34.6\n|Sep high C = 33.1\n|Oct high C = 28.9\n|Nov high C = 22.5\n|Dec high C = 16.7\n|year high C = 25.3\n|Jan mean C = 9.5\n|Feb mean C = 10.5\n|Mar mean C = 13.4\n|Apr mean C = 17.5\n|May mean C = 21.7\n|Jun mean C = 25.6\n|Jul mean C = 28.2\n|Aug mean C = 28.7\n|Sep mean C = 26.1\n|Oct mean C = 21.6\n|Nov mean C = 15.8\n|Dec mean C = 11.2\n|year mean C = 19.1\n|Jan low C = 5.1\n|Feb low C = 5.9\n|Mar low C = 8.1\n|Apr low C = 11.8\n|May low C = 15.6\n|Jun low C = 19.6\n|Jul low C = 22.8\n|Aug low C = 23.2\n|Sep low C = 20.0\n|Oct low C = 15.5\n|Nov low C = 10.6\n|Dec low C = 6.8\n|year low C = 13.8\n|Jan record low C = -8.1\n|Feb record low C = -6.6\n|Mar record low C = -4.9\n|Apr record low C = -1.3\n|May record low C = 5.6\n|Jun record low C = 9.2\n|Jul record low C = 11.5\n|Aug record low C = 14.8\n|Sep record low C = 9.3\n|Oct record low C = 3.5\n|Nov record low C = -4.3\n|Dec record low C = -4.4\n|year record low C = -8.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 107.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 90.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 65.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 51.3\n|May precipitation mm = 47.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 20.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 6.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 5.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 17.8\n|Oct precipitation mm = 42.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 71.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 119.1\n|year precipitation mm = 644.6\n|Jan precipitation days = 12.1\n|Feb precipitation days = 10.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.7\n|Apr precipitation days = 10.0\n|May precipitation days = 7.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 3.7\n|Jul precipitation days = 1.2\n|Aug precipitation days = 1.1\n|Sep precipitation days = 3.4\n|Oct precipitation days = 6.8\n|Nov precipitation days = 8.0\n|Dec precipitation days = 11.4\n|year precipitation days = 86.8\n|Jan sun = 139.5\n|Feb sun = 149.7\n|Mar sun = 186.0\n|Apr sun = 213.0\n|May sun = 282.1\n|Jun sun = 318.0\n|Jul sun = 334.8\n|Aug sun = 322.4\n|Sep sun = 270.0\n|Oct sun = 229.4\n|Nov sun = 177.0\n|Dec sun = 136.4\n|Jand sun = 4.5\n|Febd sun = 5.3\n|Mard sun = 6.0\n|Aprd sun = 7.1\n|Mayd sun = 9.1\n|Jund sun = 10.6\n|Juld sun = 10.8\n|Augd sun = 10.4\n|Sepd sun = 9.0\n|Octd sun = 7.4\n|Novd sun = 5.9\n|Decd sun = 4.4\n|source 1 = [[Turkish State Meteorological Service]]<ref name=eather1>{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190113150921/https://mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?k=A&m=ADANA\n| archivedate = 13 January 2019\n| url = https://mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?k=A&m=ADANA\n| title = Resmi \u0130statistikler: \u0130llerimize Ait Genel \u0130statistik Verileri\n| publisher = Turkish State Meteorological Service\n| language = Turkish\n| accessdate = 13 January 2019}}</ref>\n|date=January 2016\n}}\n\n==History==\nThe history of the [[Tepeba\u011f]] [[tumulus]] in the middle of Adana dates to the Neolithic Period, 6000 B.C., and the time of the first human settlements. It is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia. A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in a [[Sumer]]ian epic, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], but the geography of this work is too imprecise to identify its location.\n\n===Ancient times===\nFirst known people living in Adana and area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia roughly from 3000BC to around 1600BC. [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]],  Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under the Hittites protection, but they had a brief independent period from 1500s to 1420s.  According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was the kingdom that ruled Adana, under the protection of the Hittites by 1335 BC. At that time, the name of the city was ''Uru Adaniyya'', and the inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]]. Beginning with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] c. 1191\u20131189 BC, relatively unknown [[Sea Peoples]] took control of the plain until around 900BC. Then after, [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite States]] founded in the region and Adana was the center of [[Quw\u00ea]] state. Quw\u00ea and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had independent periods. After the Greek migration to Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A. Knopf, , New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9k8Frkhiq_MC&pg=PA211 pages 211-224], {{ISBN|978-0-679-44431-2}}</ref> and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries founded in  [[Mopsuestia]] were written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. Assyrians took the control of the regions several times until their collapse in 612BC. The region appeared in Assyrian inscriptions as ''Hilikku'', in which the Cilicia name derived from. Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] by the efforts of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom were independent until the invasion of [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549, then after became an autonomous [[satrapy]] of Achaemenids and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]]. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death, for a time, Adana fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], but finally came to the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Seleucids ruled Adana until the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] made Cilicia their vassal state in  83BC.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era===\n[[Pompey]] took over entire Cilicia and organized it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]'s influential period, while nearby Tarsus was the [[metropolis]] of the area. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates of Cilicia. The [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East. After the permanent split of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantation, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important trade centers of the region. \n\nAdana was a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese.The Bishop Paulinus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Piso was among the [[Arianism]]-inclined bishops at the [[Council of Sardica]] (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodoxy]] and signed the profession of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene faith]] at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint [[John Chrysostom]]. Cyrillus was at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434. Philippus took part in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard Price|author2=Michael Gaddis|title=The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&pg=RA2-PA157|volume=Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-039-7|page=122}}</ref> and was a signatory of the joint letter of the bishops of [[Cilicia Prima]] to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] in 458 protesting at the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].

In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] took control of Adana in 746. [[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over the rule of the region from Byzantine  after [[Al-Mansur]]'s inauguration to caliph in 756. With the Abbasid rule, Muslims for the first time started settling in Cilicia. Abandoned for more than 50 years, Adana was garrisoned and re-built from 758 to 760. To form a [[Al-Awasim|Thugh\u016br]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonized with the Turkic Say\u0101bija tribe from [[Khorasan]]. The city had seen rapid economic and cultural growth during the reign of [[Harun al-Rashid]] and [[Al-Amin]].

The city became part of the [[Seleucia (theme)|Seleucia theme]]. After the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] was removed from reign by a coup. He then gathered a troop to regain his power, though got defeated and had to retreat his troop to Adana. He was forced to surrender by the Garrison in Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] annexed Adana, in his campaign in 1084. The city remained under Turkish rule until it was captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo I]]. It was taken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it around 1170. In 1268, a [[1268 Cilicia earthquake|devastating earthquake]] destroyed much of the city. Adana was rebuilt and remained a part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia until 1359, when the city was ceded to the T\u00fcrkmen supported [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] who marched into Cilicia and captured the plain.

The [[Amir]], Ramazan Beg, designated Adana as the capital, and led the Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks to settle in the city. The emirate which later on known as the [[Ramadanid Emirate]], played a key role in the 15th-century Ottoman-Mamluk relations by being a [[Al-Awasim#Mamluk\u2013Turkmen frontier|Mamluk al-'Awasim]]. In 1517, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state.

By the start of the 20th century, factories almost all processing cotton, began to operate in the region. Factories were shut down and the economy almost came to a standstill in 1915, after the genocide of Armenians who ran most of the businesses in the city. Foundation of the republic, again accelerated the growth of industrialization by re-activation of closed plants and opening of state-owned ones. With the construction of [[Seyhan Dam]] and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s.

Among the people with faith, the majority of the residents adhere to [[Sunni Islam]]. The majority of Turks, most of the Kurds and some of the Arabs are Sunni Muslim. Adana is also a stronghold of [[Alevism]], many Alevis having moved to the city from [[Kahramanmara\u015f]] after the [[Mara\u015f Massacre|incidents in 1978]].

The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighborhoods being built. Most of the historical landmarks of Adana were built during this period, thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid]] architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, and few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule. Adana is home to modern Turkey's historic Armenian architecture, which can be found behind the city's central modern buildings.\n\nThe first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepeba\u011f]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age]]. The quarter is next to the Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc stone bridge, situated on a hill which gave its name Tepeba\u011f (Garden on the hill). The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the heritage of this area, particularly the Ottoman houses. Atat\u00fcrk stayed in one of these houses on Seyhan Caddesi which now houses the [[Atat\u00fcrk Museum (Adana)|Atat\u00fcrk Museum]].\n\nSeveral bridges cross the Seyhan river within the city, the most notable among them is the [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]], a 2nd-century [[Roman bridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanakultur.gov.tr/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFB0ED0AA5232E402F59FCBAD67E463149| title = Adana Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Stone Bridge)| author=| publisher=Governship of Adana Tourism and Culture Department| accessdate=}}</ref> Currently used by pedestrians and cyclists, it was the oldest bridge in the world to be open to motorized vehicles until 2007.

In the 1960s, rapid industrialization brought more men to pavyons not only from the city, but from a wide region including Istanbul and Ankara, thus Adana was named ''Pavyon Capital of Turkey''. Many popular singers took the stage at and owe their fame to the pavyons of Adana.\n\nPavyons led the way to Western-style pubs and night clubs by the late 1980s with the socio-economic changes in Adana. The traditional entertainment district is Sular, near Central Station, but the pubs and clubs nowadays are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs such as Life Legend, Uptown, Casara and Lava host world star singers at their elegant locations, mostly along the river and the lake. There are still two active pavyons, Afrodit and Maksim, but adult entertainment is directed mostly to what is known locally as tele-bars. Tele-bars are licensed as regular pubs, but function as places where bargirls entertain customers and usually hook with them afterwards. There are around 20 tele-bars mainly in the city center and around the old dam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=12 | title = Tele-bar Furyas\u0131 (Turkish)|author=\u0130brahim Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref>\n\nA hundred-year-long tradition of [[Adana Kebab|kebab]], liver and [[rak\u0131]] in the Kazanc\u0131lar Bazaar, with street music and dances, turned into a festival since 2010, with all-night entertainment.

Compact urban form due to dominance of high-rise buildings that are closely built, especially in Seyhan and \u00c7ukurova districts, make cycling from any end of the city to the city center to take less than 40 minutes. Despite all the advantages, car-oriented urban planning since the 1950s caused cycling to take a minor part in commuting to work or school. There are no bike lanes, but there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpa\u015fa Boulevard\u2014the latter not used by cyclists at all.

The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on the sidewalks. The city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc to squares and widen the sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk at the peddler-invaded narrow sidewalks. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian friendly]] street of the city is Turgut \u00d6zal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in \u00c7ukurova district are also very convenient for

The region includes the provinces of [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], [[Adana Province|Adana]], [[Osmaniye Province|Osmaniye]] and [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. Adding the large population centers surrounding Cilicia, more than 10 million people reside within 2-hours drive from the Adana city center.\n\nThroughout the history, Adana were a market town at the Cilicia plain and one of the gateways from Europe to the Middle East, as it provided the only access on the wide Seyhan river. The city turned into a power house of Cilicia with the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkic]] takeover in 1359. The city remained as the capital of the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] until 1608, and then the regional administrative center for the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkey]], and shortly for the [[Cilicia#French Cilicia|French Cilicia]]. Economically a modest town until 1861 with a population of roughly 15000, the city boomed with the breakdown of the [[American Civil War]], as becoming a new center for supplying cotton and cotton related products to Europe. Traditionally a town populated by Armenians and Turks; influx of [[Armenians]], Turks, [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Alawites]] at this period, made the city one of the most diverse cities of [[Anatolia]].

After the eviction of Armenians and Greeks, most of the city's private properties were confiscated in 1923 and were granted to the Muslim/Turks who recently had migrated into the city.  After a standstill period, city's economy again boomed in 1950s with the construction of the [[Seyhan Dam]], though unsustainable and at the expense of the city's socioculture, as the new possessors of the properties did not have the management attributes like the owners before the confiscations.<ref name=\"Hrant\">{{cite web|url=https://hrantdink.org/tr/faaliyetler/projeler/kulturel-miras/1477-adana-arastirmasi-ve-saha-calismasi|title=Adana ara\u015ft\u0131rmas\u0131 ve saha \u00e7al\u0131\u015fmas\u0131|publisher=Hrant Dink Foundation|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdana in the 21st century, are a center for regional trade, healthcare, public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are significant sectors of the city. Economic decline caused by national policies and de-industrialization since 1990s is reversing, as the city is gaining momentum with the fairs, festivals and entertainment life. Though not competing at the top level, the rivalry between the city's football clubs, [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]], is getting national attraction as being the [[Adana football derby|only citywide derby]] of [[Turkey]] that is rooted in socio-economic divisions.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Adana1.jpg|thumb|Eskibaraj Dam Lake on [[Seyhan River]].]]\n\nAdana is located at the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, where it serves as the gateway to the Cilicia plain. This large stretch of flat, fertile land lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]].\n\nFrom Adana, crossing the Cilicia westwards, the road from Tarsus enters the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. It goes through the famous [[Cilician Gates]], the rocky pass through which armies have coursed since the dawn of history, and continues to the Anatolian plain.\n\nThe north of the city is surrounded by the Seyhan reservoir. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power and to irrigate the lower \u00c7ukurova plain. Two irrigation channels in the city flow to the plain, passing through the city center from east to west. There is another canal for irrigating the Y\u00fcre\u011fir plain to the southeast of the city.\n\nThe [[37th parallel north]] passes through the city.\n\n===Climate===\nAdana has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under both the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] classification, and a dry-hot summer subtropical climate (Csa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification. Winters are mild and wet. Summers are long, hot, humid and dry. The highest recorded temperature was on 8 July 1978 at {{convert|45.6|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}.

It is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia. A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in a [[Sumer]]ian epic, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], but the geography of this work is too imprecise to identify its location.\n\n===Ancient times===\nFirst known people living in Adana and area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia roughly from 3000BC to around 1600BC. [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]],  Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under the Hittites protection, but they had a brief independent period from 1500s to 1420s.  According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was the kingdom that ruled Adana, under the protection of the Hittites by 1335 BC. At that time, the name of the city was ''Uru Adaniyya'', and the inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]]. Beginning with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] c. 1191\u20131189 BC, relatively unknown [[Sea Peoples]] took control of the plain until around 900BC. Then after, [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite States]] founded in the region and Adana was the center of [[Quw\u00ea]] state. Quw\u00ea and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had independent periods. After the Greek migration to Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A. Knopf, , New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9k8Frkhiq_MC&pg=PA211 pages 211-224], {{ISBN|978-0-679-44431-2}}</ref> and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries founded in  [[Mopsuestia]] were written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. Assyrians took the control of the regions several times until their collapse in 612BC. The region appeared in Assyrian inscriptions as ''Hilikku'', in which the Cilicia name derived from. Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] by the efforts of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom were independent until the invasion of [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549, then after became an autonomous [[satrapy]] of Achaemenids and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]]. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death, for a time, Adana fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], but finally came to the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Seleucids ruled Adana until the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] made Cilicia their vassal state in  83BC.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era===\n[[Pompey]] took over entire Cilicia and organized it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]'s influential period, while nearby Tarsus was the [[metropolis]] of the area. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates of Cilicia. The [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East. After the permanent split of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantation, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important trade centers of the region. \n\nAdana was a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese.The Bishop Paulinus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Piso was among the [[Arianism]]-inclined bishops at the [[Council of Sardica]] (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodoxy]] and signed the profession of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene faith]] at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint [[John Chrysostom]]. Cyrillus was at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434. Philippus took part in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard Price|author2=Michael Gaddis|title=The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&pg=RA2-PA157|volume=Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-039-7|page=122}}</ref> and was a signatory of the joint letter of the bishops of [[Cilicia Prima]] to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] in 458 protesting at the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].

[[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over the rule of the region from Byzantine  after [[Al-Mansur]]'s inauguration to caliph in 756. With the Abbasid rule, Muslims for the first time started settling in Cilicia. Abandoned for more than 50 years, Adana was garrisoned and re-built from 758 to 760. To form a [[Al-Awasim|Thugh\u016br]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonized with the Turkic Say\u0101bija tribe from [[Khorasan]].

The city became part of the [[Seleucia (theme)|Seleucia theme]]. After the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] was removed from reign by a coup. He then gathered a troop to regain his power, though got defeated and had to retreat his troop to Adana. He was forced to surrender by the Garrison in Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] annexed Adana, in his campaign in 1084. The city remained under Turkish rule until it was captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo I]]. It was taken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it around 1170. In 1268, a [[1268 Cilicia earthquake|devastating earthquake]] destroyed much of the city. Adana was rebuilt and remained a part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia until 1359, when the city was ceded to the T\u00fcrkmen supported [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] who marched into Cilicia and captured the plain. Most Armenians residing in Adana, fled to [[Cyprus]] and to [[Kozan|Sis]].\n\n===Turkish era=== \n[[File:Adana Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] forces entering the city.

By the start of the 20th century, factories almost all processing cotton, began to operate in the region. Factories were shut down and the economy almost came to a standstill in 1915, after the genocide of Armenians who ran most of the businesses in the city. Foundation of the republic, again accelerated the growth of industrialization by re-activation of closed plants and opening of state-owned ones. With the construction of [[Seyhan Dam]] and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s.

Among the people with faith, the majority of the residents adhere to [[Sunni Islam]]. The majority of Turks, most of the Kurds and some of the Arabs are Sunni Muslim. Adana is also a stronghold of [[Alevism]], many Alevis having moved to the city from [[Kahramanmara\u015f]] after the [[Mara\u015f Massacre|incidents in 1978]].

The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighborhoods being built. Most of the historical landmarks of Adana were built during this period, thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid]] architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, and few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule. Adana is home to modern Turkey's historic Armenian architecture, which can be found behind the city's central modern buildings.\n\nThe first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepeba\u011f]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age]]. The quarter is next to the Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc stone bridge, situated on a hill which gave its name Tepeba\u011f (Garden on the hill). The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the heritage of this area, particularly the Ottoman houses. Atat\u00fcrk stayed in one of these houses on Seyhan Caddesi which now houses the [[Atat\u00fcrk Museum (Adana)|Atat\u00fcrk Museum]].\n\nSeveral bridges cross the Seyhan river within the city, the most notable among them is the [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]], a 2nd-century [[Roman bridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanakultur.gov.tr/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFB0ED0AA5232E402F59FCBAD67E463149| title = Adana Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Stone Bridge)| author=| publisher=Governship of Adana Tourism and Culture Department| accessdate=}}</ref> Currently used by pedestrians and cyclists, it was the oldest bridge in the world to be open to motorized vehicles until 2007.

In the 1960s, rapid industrialization brought more men to pavyons not only from the city, but from a wide region including Istanbul and Ankara, thus Adana was named ''Pavyon Capital of Turkey''. Many popular singers took the stage at and owe their fame to the pavyons of Adana.\n\nPavyons led the way to Western-style pubs and night clubs by the late 1980s with the socio-economic changes in Adana. The traditional entertainment district is Sular, near Central Station, but the pubs and clubs nowadays are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs such as Life Legend, Uptown, Casara and Lava host world star singers at their elegant locations, mostly along the river and the lake. There are still two active pavyons, Afrodit and Maksim, but adult entertainment is directed mostly to what is known locally as tele-bars. Tele-bars are licensed as regular pubs, but function as places where bargirls entertain customers and usually hook with them afterwards. There are around 20 tele-bars mainly in the city center and around the old dam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=12 | title = Tele-bar Furyas\u0131 (Turkish)|author=\u0130brahim Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref>\n\nA hundred-year-long tradition of [[Adana Kebab|kebab]], liver and [[rak\u0131]] in the Kazanc\u0131lar Bazaar, with street music and dances, turned into a festival since 2010, with all-night entertainment.

Compact urban form due to dominance of high-rise buildings that are closely built, especially in Seyhan and \u00c7ukurova districts, make cycling from any end of the city to the city center to take less than 40 minutes. Despite all the advantages, car-oriented urban planning since the 1950s caused cycling to take a minor part in commuting to work or school. There are no bike lanes, but there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpa\u015fa Boulevard\u2014the latter not used by cyclists at all.

The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on the sidewalks. The city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc to squares and widen the sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk at the peddler-invaded narrow sidewalks. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian friendly]] street of the city is Turgut \u00d6zal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in \u00c7ukurova district are also very convenient for walking.\n\n==International relations==\nAdana is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\nEurope\n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], Spain\n*{{flagicon|NMK}} [[Skopje]], North Macedonia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Livorno]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Debrecen]], Hungary<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/adana-ve-debrecen-kardes-sehir-oldu-40929419|title=Adana ve Debrecen karde\u015f \u015fehir oldu|website=H\u00fcrriyet}}</ref>\n|\nAsia\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Beersheba]], Israel<ref name=\"muni-sister\">{{cite web|title=International Relations of the City of Beersheba |url=http://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/ArimTeomot.asp |publisher=Beersheba Municipality |accessdate=6 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209131035/http://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/ArimTeomot.asp |archivedate=9 December 2008 |url-status=dead |language=he }}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|KAZ}} [[Shymkent]], Kazakhstan\n*{{flagicon|JPN}} [[Sapporo]], Japan\n*{{flagicon|MNG}} [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia\n|}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 2213.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Side view\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 844.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Entrance to courtyard\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 8573.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Entrance to courtyard's backside\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 3570.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Exterior\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque3636.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Courtyard\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 3638.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Mihrab and minber\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 5720.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Woodwork under balcony\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque3645.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Woodwork under balcony\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7586.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami From west\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7588.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami From east\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7589.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami Interior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4990.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Exterior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4995.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Interior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4993.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Decorative stonework\nFile:Adana Yesil Mescit 4989.jpg|Adana Yesil Mescit Exterior\nFile:Adana Yesil Mescit 4988.jpg|Adana Yesil Mescit Window decoration\nFile:Adana Alidede Mosque 1625.jpg|Adana Alidede Mosque Exterior\nFile:Adana Alidede Mosque 3591.jpg|Adana Alidede Mosque Interior\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Turkey}}\n*[[List of people from Adana]]\n*[[List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkey]]\n*[[List of mayors of Adana]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|title = The Helsinki Atlas of the Near East in the Neo-Assyrian Period |ISBN=951-45-9050-3|first1=Simo|last= Parpola|author-link1=Simo Parpola |first2= Michael|last2= Porter|author-link2=Michael Porter|publisher=[[Gazetteer]]|location=Helsinki, Finland|year=2001}}\n*{{Cite book|title = The Turks Today|ISBN=1-58567-756-6|first=Andrew |last=Mango|author-link=Andrew Mango|publisher=The Overlook Press|location=New York City|year=2004}}\n*{{Cite book|title = [[Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World]] |ISBN=0-691-03169-X |first=Richard |last=Talbert|author-link=Richard Talbert|publisher=The Overlook Press|location=New York City|year=2004}}\n*{{Cite book|title = \u0531\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0561\u0575\u056b \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0581 \u054a\u0561\u057f\u0574\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576 |trans-title=The History of the Armenians of Adana|first=Puzant |last=Yeghiayan |location= Beirut |publisher=Union of Armenian Compatriots of Adana|year=1970|language=hy}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Adana}}\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://adana.gov.tr/ Governorship of Adana]\n* [http://adana.bel.tr Adana Metropolitan Municipality]\n* [http://www.adana-to.org.tr Adana Trade and Industry Chamber]\n\n{{City of Adana |state=collapsed}}\n{{Districts of Turkey|provname=Adana}}\n{{Metropolitan centers in Turkey}}\n{{Syro-Hittite states}}\n{{Largest cities in Turkey}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Adana| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Districts of Adana Province]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Adana Province]]\n[[Category:Populated places along the Silk Road]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in the Mediterranean Region, Turkey]]\n[[Category:Hittite cities]]\n[[Category:Roman sites in Turkey]]\n", "name_user": "Seyhan668", "label": "safe", "comment": "already mentioned in the history section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana"}
