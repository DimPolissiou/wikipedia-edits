He graduated from [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]] in 1911, where he had studied [[vedas|Vedic]] literature and classical Indian philosophy. After graduation, \u014ckawa worked for the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] doing translation work.

After reading this book, \u014ckawa abandoned \"complete cosmopolitanism\" (''sekaijin'') for Pan-Asianism. Later that year articles by [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] and [[Maulavi Barkatullah]] appeared in the magazine ''Michi'', published by [[D\u014dkai]], a religious organization in which \u014ckawa was later to play a prominent part. While he studied, he briefly housed the Indian independence leader [[Rash Behari Bose]].\n\nAfter years of study of foreign philosophies, he became increasingly convinced that the solution to Japan's pressing social and political problems lay in an alliance with Asian independence movements, a revival of pre-modern [[Japanese philosophy]], and a renewed emphasis on the ''[[kokutai]]'' principles.<ref>Samuels, Securing Japan: Tokyo's Grand Strategy and the Future of East Asia, p. 18</ref>\n\n[[File:Okawa_Shumei_c.jpg|thumb|left|\u014ckawa as a youth]]\n\nIn 1918, \u014ckawa went to work for the [[South Manchurian Railway]] Company, under its East Asian Research Bureau. Together with [[Ikki Kita]] he founded the nationalist discussion group and political club ''[[Y\u016bzonsha]]''. In the 1920s, he became an instructor of history and colonial policy at [[Takushoku University]], where he was also active in the creation of [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and nationalist student groups.<ref>Calvocoressi, The Penguin History of the Second World War p. 657</ref> Meanwhile, he introduced [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s theory of [[social threefolding]] to Japan.\n\nIn 1926, \u014ckawa published his most influential work: {{nihongo|''Japan and the Way of the Japanese''||Nihon oyobi Nihonjin no michi}}, which was so popular that it was reprinted 46 times by the end of World War II. \u014ckawa also became involved in a number of attempted [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] by the [[Japanese military]] in the early 1930s, including the [[March Incident]], for which he was sentenced to five years in prison in 1935.<ref>Jansen, The Making of Modern Japan, p. 572</ref> Released after only two years, he briefly re-joined the South Manchurian Railway Company before accepting a post as a professor at [[Hosei University]] in 1939. He continued to publish numerous books and articles, helping popularize the idea that a \"[[clash of civilizations]]\" between the East and West was inevitable, and that Japan was destined to assume the mantle of liberator and protector of Asia against the United States and other Western nations.<ref>Wakabayashi, Modern Japanese Thought, pp. 226-227</ref>\n\n== Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal ==\n[[File:Okawa Shumei in court.jpg|thumb|\u014ckawa in court]]\n\nAfter World War II, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prosecuted \u014ckawa as a [[class-A war criminal]]. Of the twenty-eight people indicted with this charge, he was the only one who wasn't a military officer or government official. The Allies described him to the press as the \"Japanese [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]]\" and claimed that he had long agitated for a war between Japan and the West. In pre-trial hearings, Okawa countered that he had merely translated and commented on [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]]'s geopolitical philosophy in 1924, and that in fact Pan-Asianism did not advocate for war.<ref>[http://japanfocus.org/-Cemil-Aydin/2695 Japan\u2019s Pan-Asianism and the Legitimacy of Imperial World Order, 1931\u20131945]</ref>\n\nDuring the trial, \u014ckawa behaved erratically \u2013 dressing in pajamas, sitting barefoot, and hitting the bald head of the former prime minister [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]] while shouting \"Inder!

Some heard him shout \"This is act one of the comedy!\"  [[U.S. Army]] [[psychiatrist]] Daniel Jaffe examined him and reported he was unfit to stand trial. Therefore, the presiding judge Sir [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]] (The President of the Tokyo Tribunal) concluded that he was [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and dropped the case against him.

Later, he was transferred to the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Matsuzawa Hospital]], a famous [[mental hospital]], where he completed the third Japanese translation of the entire [[Quran]].<ref>While \u014ckawa made reference to the Arabic original, he made his translation from about ten language editions, including English, Chinese, German, and French, as his knowledge of Arabic was only basic. At least three more translations of the Quran into Japanese have been produced since then, including several from the Arabic original. \u014ckawa's version is difficult to find nowadays. See Kr\u00e4mer, \u201cPan-Asianism\u2019s Religious Undercurrents,\u201d pp. 627\u2013630.</ref> He was released from hospital in 1948. He spent the final years of his life writing a memoir, ''Anraku no Mon'', reflecting on how he found peace in the mental hospital.\n\nIn October 1957, [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] requested an audience with him during a brief visit to Japan. The invitation was hand-delivered to \u014ckawa's house by an Indian Embassy official, who found that \u014ckawa was already on his deathbed and was unable to leave the house.

At times, a stripper may be hired to perform at a [[bachelor party|bachelor]] or [[bachelorette party]]. In addition to providing [[adult entertainment]], stripping can be a form of [[Foreplay|sexual play]] between partners. This can be done as an impromptu event or&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps for a special occasion&nbsp;\u2013 with elaborate planning involving [[fantasy wear]], music, special lighting, practiced dance moves, or unrehearsed dance moves.\n\nStriptease involves a slow, sensuous undressing. The stripper may prolong the undressing with delaying tactics such as the wearing of additional [[clothes]] or putting clothes or hands in front of just undressed body parts such as the [[breast]]s or [[genitalia]]. The emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude.<ref name=\"Richard Wortley 1976\">Richard Wortley (1976) ''A Pictorial History of Striptease''.</ref><ref name=Clifton>{{cite book|title=Baby Oil and Ice: Striptease in East London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgCfPQAACAAJ|first=Lara|last=Clifton|first2=Sarah|last2=Ainslie|first3=Julie|last3=Cook|publisher=Do-Not Press|year=2002|isbn=9781899344857}}</ref> The costume the stripper wears before disrobing can form part of the act. In some cases, audience interaction can form part of the act, with the audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing, or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them.\n\nStriptease and public nudity have been subject to legal and cultural prohibitions and other aesthetic considerations and [[taboo]]s. Restrictions on venues may be through venue licensing requirements and constraints and a wide variety of national and local laws. These laws vary considerably around the world, and even between different parts of the same country.\n\n[[H. L.

The term \"striptease\" was first recorded in 1932.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Webster|first1=Merriam|title=First known use of striptease 1932|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/striptease}}</ref>\n\nThere is a stripping aspect in the ancient Sumerian myth of the descent of the goddess [[Inanna]] into the Underworld (or Kur). At each of the seven gates, she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry. As long as she remained in hell, the earth was barren. When she returned, [[fecundity]] abounded. Some believe this myth was embodied in the [[dance of the seven veils]] of [[Salome]], who danced for [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], as mentioned in the [[New Testament]] in Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:21-22. However, although the Bible records Salome's dance, the first mention of her removing seven veils occurs in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s [[Salome (play)|play of 'Salome']], in 1893.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the lawgiver [[Solon]] established several classes of prostitutes in the late 6th century BC. Among these classes of prostitutes were the [[auletrides]]: female dancers, acrobats, and musicians, noted for dancing naked in an alluring fashion in front of audiences of men.<ref name=\"Zaplin 1998\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNM_xibHGIsC&pg=PA351&lpg=PA351&dq=Solon+greece+auletrides#v=onepage&q=Solon%20greece%20auletrides&f=false|title=Female offenders: critical perspectives and effective interventions |authorlink= |year=1998 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |location=  |isbn= 978-0-8342-0895-7 |edition= |last1=Zaplin |first1=Ruth |page=351 }}</ref><ref name=\"Jeffreys 2009\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9U7Eqp8NigC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=uk+strip+club+revenues#v=onepage&q=uk%20strip%20club%20revenues&f=false|title=The industrial vagina: the political economy of the global sex trade |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |location=  |isbn= 978-0-415-41233-9 |edition= |last1=Jeffreys |first1=Sheila |pages=86\u2013106 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bassermann 1968\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQiLAAAAIAAJ&dq=auletrides+strip&q=auletrides#search_anchor|title=The oldest profession: a history of prostitution |authorlink= |year=1968 |publisher=Stein and Day |location=  |isbn= 978-0-450-00234-2 |edition= |last1=Baasermann |first1=Lugo |pages=7\u20139 }}</ref> In [[ancient Rome]], dance featuring stripping was part of the entertainments ''([[ludi]])'' at the [[Floralia]], an April festival in honor of the [[Flora (mythology)|goddess Flora]].<ref>As described by [[Ovid]], ''Fasti'' 4.133ff.; [[Juvenal]], ''Satire'' 6.250\u2013251; [[Lactantius]], ''Divine Institutes'' 20.6; Phyllis Culham, \"Women in the Roman Republic,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 144; Christopher H.

It was, however, actively opposed by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Church]], which succeeded in obtaining statutes banning it in the following century. The degree to which these statutes were subsequently enforced is, of course, opened to question. What is certain is that no practice of the sort is reported in texts of the European Middle Ages.\n\nAn early version of strip-tease became popular in England at the time of the [[Restoration drama|Restoration]]. A strip tease was incorporated into the [[Restoration comedy]] ''[[The Rover (play)|The Rover]]'', written by [[Aphra Behn]] in 1677. The stripper is a man; an English country gentleman who sensually undresses and goes to bed in a love scene. (However, the scene is played for laughs; the prostitute he thinks is going to bed with him robs him, and he ends up having to crawl out of the sewer.) The concept of strip-tease was also widely known, as can be seen in the reference to it in [[Thomas Otway]]'s comedy ''[[The Soldier's Fortune]]'' (1681), where a character says: \"Be sure they be lewd, drunken, ''stripping'' whores\".<ref>Robert Hendrickson (1997) ''QPB Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins''.

The dances of the [[Ghawazee]] in North Africa and [[Egypt]] consisted of the erotic [[dance of the bee]] performed by a woman known as [[Kuchuk Hanem]]. In this dance the performer disrobes as she searches for an imaginary bee trapped within her garments. It is likely that the women performing these dances did not do so in an indigenous context, but rather, responded to the commercial climate for this type of entertainment.<ref name=\"Parramore 2008\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsMgC7uXLXIC&pg=PA132&dq=dance+of+the+bee+performed+by+a+woman+known+as+Kuchuk+Hanem#v=onepage&q=dance%20of%20the%20bee%20performed%20by%20a%20woman%20known%20as%20Kuchuk%20Hanem&f=false|title=Reading the Sphinx: Ancient Egypt in Nineteenth-Century Literary Culture |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |location=  |isbn= 978-0-230-60328-8 |edition= |last1=Parramore |first1=Lynn |page=132 }}</ref> [[Middle Eastern]] [[belly dance]], also known as oriental dancing, was popularized in the United States after its introduction on the [[Midway (fair)|Midway]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]] by a dancer known as [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]].<ref name=\"Carlton 1994\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkgUAQAAIAAJ&dq=Looking+for+Little+Egypt&q=midway#search_anchor|title=Looking for Little Egypt |authorlink= |year=1994 |publisher=IDD Books |location=  |isbn= 978-0-9623998-1-7 |edition= |last1=Carlton |first1=Donna |page=14 }}</ref>\n\nSome claim the origin of the modern striptease lies in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s [[Salome (play)|play of 'Salome']], in 1893.

However the burlesque theatres here were prohibited from having striptease performances in a legal ruling of 1937 leading to the later decline of these \"[[grindhouse]]s\" (named after the bump 'n grind entertainment on offer) into venues for cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newvictory.org/newvicMain.m |title=The New Victory Cinema |publisher=Newvictory.org |date=1995-12-11 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722001058/http://www.newvictory.org/newvicMain.m |archivedate=2012-07-22 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1960s saw a revival of striptease in the form of topless [[go-go dancing]]. This eventually merged with the older tradition of burlesque dancing.

To get around the prohibition the models appeared in stationary [[tableaux vivants]].<ref>Vivien Goldsmith, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3648187/Windmill-always-nude-but-never-rude.html \"Windmill: always nude but never rude\"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 24 November 2005</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://islingtontribune.com/article/windmill-girls-meet-for-reunion-and-remember-dancing-days-in-old-soho|title=Windmill Girls meet for reunion and remember dancing days in old Soho|website=Islington Tribune}}</ref>  The Windmill girls also toured other London and provincial theatres, sometimes using ingenious devices such as rotating ropes to move their bodies round, though strictly speaking, staying within the letter of the law by not moving of their own volition. Another example of the way the shows stayed within the law was the [[fan dance]], in which a naked dancer's body was concealed by her fans and those of her attendants, until the end of her act in when she posed nude for a brief interval whilst standing still.\n\nIn 1942, [[Phyllis Dixey]] formed her own company of girls and rented the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in London to put on a review called The Whitehall Follies.\n\nBy the 1950s, touring striptease acts were used to attract audiences to the dying music halls. Arthur Fox started his touring shows in 1948 and Paul Raymond started his in 1951. Paul Raymond later leased the Doric Ballroom in [[Soho]] and opened his private members club, the Raymond Revuebar in 1958. This was one of the first of the private striptease members clubs in Britain.\n\n[[Image:Windmill-Theatre.jpg|thumb|The [[Windmill Theatre]] in 2009]]\n[[File:Pole dancer 04.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A pole dancer]]\n\nIn the 1960s, changes in the law brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho with \"fully nude\" dancing and audience participation.<ref name=\"Murray Goldstein 2005\">{{cite book|first=Murray|last=Goldstein|year=2005|title=Naked Jungle: Soho Stripped Bare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ToqAAAACAAJ|publisher=Silverback Press|isbn=9780954944407}}</ref> Pubs were also used as a venue, most particularly in the [[East End]] with a concentration of such venues in the district of [[Shoreditch]].

An interesting custom in these pubs is that the strippers walk round and collect money from the customers in a beer jug before each individual performance. This custom appears to have originated in the late 1970s when topless go-go dancers first started collecting money from the audience as the fee for going \"fully nude\".<ref name=\"It Started With Theresa\"/> Private dances of a more raunchy nature are sometimes available in a separate area of the pub.<ref name=Clifton/>\n\n===Japan===\nStriptease became popular in Japan after the end of World War II. When entrepreneur Shigeo Ozaki saw [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] perform, he started his own striptease revue in Tokyo's [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] neighborhood. During the 1950s, Japanese \"strip shows\" became more sexually explicit and less dance-oriented, until they were eventually simply [[sex show|live sex shows]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Shteir|first=Rachel|title=Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show|url=https://archive.org/details/stripteaseuntold0000shte|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/stripteaseuntold0000shte/page/264 264]|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-512750-8}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\n\nRecently [[Pole dance|pole dancing]] has come to dominate the world of striptease. In the late 20th century, pole dancing was practised in exotic dance clubs in Canada. These clubs grew up to become a thriving sector of the economy. Canadian style pole dancing, [[Table dance|table dancing]] and [[Lap dance|lap dancing]], organized by multi-national corporations such as [[Spearmint Rhino]], was exported from North America to (among other countries) the United Kingdom, the nations of central Europe, Russia and Australia. In London, England a raft of such so-called \"lap dancing clubs\" grew up in the 1990s, featuring pole dancing on stage and private table dancing, though, despite media misrepresentation, [[Lap dance|lap-dancing]] in the sense of bodily contact was forbidden by law.<ref>Vlad Lapidos (1996) ''The Good Striptease Guide to London''. Tredegar Press.</ref>\n\n\"Feature shows\" are used to generate interest from potential customers who otherwise would not visit the establishment but know the performer from other outlets. A headlining star of a striptease show is referred to as a ''feature dancer'', and is often a performer with credits such as contest titles or appearances in adult films or magazines. The decades-old practice continued through the late 2000s (decade) to the present day with high-profile adult film performers such as [[Jenna Haze]] and Teagan Presley scheduling feature shows through the USA.\n\nIn December 2006, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] court ruled that striptease is an art form and made strip clubs exempt from [[value added tax]].<ref>BBC News.

December 6, 2006.</ref>\n\n===New Burlesque===\n{{Main|Neo-Burlesque}}\nIn the latter 1990s, a number of solo performers and dance groups emerged to create [[Neo-burlesque]], a revival of the classic [[American burlesque]] striptease of the early half of the 20th century. New Burlesque focuses on dancing, costumes and entertainment (which may include comedy and singing) and generally eschews full nudity or toplessness. Some burlesquers of the past have become instructors and mentors to New Burlesque performers such as [[:fr:The Velvet Hammer Burlesque|The Velvet Hammer Burlesque]] and [[The World Famous Pontani Sisters]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The pop group [[Pussycat Dolls]] began as a New Burlesque troupe.\n\n[[File:ChippendalesLasVegas.jpg|thumb|The [[Chippendales]] dancers are a famous group of male strippers.]]\n\n==Male strippers==\n{{main|Male stripper}}\nUntil the 1970s, strippers in Western cultures were almost invariably female, performing to male audiences. Since then, male strippers have also become common. Before the 1970s, dancers of both sexes appeared largely in underground clubs or as part of a theatre experience, but the practice eventually became common enough on its own.  Well-known troupes of male strippers include [[Dreamboys]] in the UK and [[Chippendales]] in the US. Male strippers have become a popular option to have at a [[bachelorette party]].\n\n==Private dancing==\n{{Main|Lap dance}}\nA variation on striptease is private dancing, which often involves [[lap dance|lap dancing]] or contact dancing. Here the performers, in addition to stripping for tips, also offer \"private dances\" which involve more attention for individual audience members. Variations include private dances like [[table dance|table dancing]] where the performer dances on or by customer's table rather than the customer being seated in a couch.\n\n==Striptease and the law==\n{{Main|Legal status of striptease}}\nFrom ancient times to the present day, striptease was considered a form of [[public nudity]] and subject to legal and cultural prohibitions on [[morality|moral]] and [[indecent exposure|decency]] grounds.  Such restrictions have been embodied in venue licensing regulations and various national and local laws, including liquor licensing restrictions.\n\n[[File:IndigoBlueMissExoticWorld2006.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Neo-burlesque]] stripper at the [[Miss Exotic World Pageant]] in 2006, showing the use of [[pasties]] as required in some U.S. jurisdictions]]\n\n===United States===\nNumerous U.S. jurisdictions have specific laws on the books related to striptease.

Among its provisions is the \"six foot rule\", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on|spell=in}} distance while performing.\n\nOther rules forbid \"full nudity\". In some parts of the U.S., there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which have thus to be covered by [[pasties]] by the dancer (though no such taboo applies to the exposure of male nipples).<ref name=\"Richard Wortley 1976\"/> In early 2010, the city of Detroit banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston which began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 |title=Houston topless clubs lose case, may respond to Supreme Court with pasties |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-03-29 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192107/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref> The city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609032414/http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html|url-status=dead|title=Detroit Passes New Strip Club Rules - Detroit Local News Story - WDIV Detroit|archivedate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> but kept other restrictions.

At times, a stripper may be hired to perform at a [[bachelor party|bachelor]] or [[bachelorette party]]. In addition to providing [[adult entertainment]], stripping can be a form of [[Foreplay|sexual play]] between partners. This can be done as an impromptu event or&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps for a special occasion&nbsp;\u2013 with elaborate planning involving [[fantasy wear]], music, special lighting, practiced dance moves, or unrehearsed dance moves.\n\nStriptease involves a slow, sensuous undressing. The stripper may prolong the undressing with delaying tactics such as the wearing of additional [[clothes]] or putting clothes or hands in front of just undressed body parts such as the [[breast]]s or [[genitalia]]. The emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude.<ref name=\"Richard Wortley 1976\">Richard Wortley (1976) ''A Pictorial History of Striptease''.</ref><ref name=Clifton>{{cite book|title=Baby Oil and Ice: Striptease in East London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgCfPQAACAAJ|first=Lara|last=Clifton|first2=Sarah|last2=Ainslie|first3=Julie|last3=Cook|publisher=Do-Not Press|year=2002|isbn=9781899344857}}</ref> The costume the stripper wears before disrobing can form part of the act.

The term \"striptease\" was first recorded in 1932.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Webster|first1=Merriam|title=First known use of striptease 1932|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/striptease}}</ref>\n\nThere is a stripping aspect in the ancient Sumerian myth of the descent of the goddess [[Inanna]] into the Underworld (or Kur). At each of the seven gates, she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry. As long as she remained in hell, the earth was barren. When she returned, [[fecundity]] abounded. Some believe this myth was embodied in the [[dance of the seven veils]] of [[Salome]], who danced for [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], as mentioned in the [[New Testament]] in Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:21-22. However, although the Bible records Salome's dance, the first mention of her removing seven veils occurs in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s [[Salome (play)|play of 'Salome']], in 1893.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the lawgiver [[Solon]] established several classes of prostitutes in the late 6th century BC.

It was, however, actively opposed by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Church]], which succeeded in obtaining statutes banning it in the following century. The degree to which these statutes were subsequently enforced is, of course, opened to question. What is certain is that no practice of the sort is reported in texts of the European Middle Ages.\n\nAn early version of strip-tease became popular in England at the time of the [[Restoration drama|Restoration]]. A strip tease was incorporated into the [[Restoration comedy]] ''[[The Rover (play)|The Rover]]'', written by [[Aphra Behn]] in 1677. The stripper is a man; an English country gentleman who sensually undresses and goes to bed in a love scene. (However, the scene is played for laughs; the prostitute he thinks is going to bed with him robs him, and he ends up having to crawl out of the sewer.) The concept of strip-tease was also widely known, as can be seen in the reference to it in [[Thomas Otway]]'s comedy ''[[The Soldier's Fortune]]'' (1681), where a character says: \"Be sure they be lewd, drunken, ''stripping'' whores\".<ref>Robert Hendrickson (1997) ''QPB Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins''.

The dances of the [[Ghawazee]] in North Africa and [[Egypt]] consisted of the erotic [[dance of the bee]] performed by a woman known as [[Kuchuk Hanem]]. In this dance the performer disrobes as she searches for an imaginary bee trapped within her garments. It is likely that the women performing these dances did not do so in an indigenous context, but rather, responded to the commercial climate for this type of entertainment.<ref name=\"Parramore 2008\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsMgC7uXLXIC&pg=PA132&dq=dance+of+the+bee+performed+by+a+woman+known+as+Kuchuk+Hanem#v=onepage&q=dance%20of%20the%20bee%20performed%20by%20a%20woman%20known%20as%20Kuchuk%20Hanem&f=false|title=Reading the Sphinx: Ancient Egypt in Nineteenth-Century Literary Culture |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |location=  |isbn= 978-0-230-60328-8 |edition= |last1=Parramore |first1=Lynn |page=132 }}</ref> [[Middle Eastern]] [[belly dance]], also known as oriental dancing, was popularized in the United States after its introduction on the [[Midway (fair)|Midway]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]] by a dancer known as [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]].<ref name=\"Carlton 1994\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkgUAQAAIAAJ&dq=Looking+for+Little+Egypt&q=midway#search_anchor|title=Looking for Little Egypt |authorlink= |year=1994 |publisher=IDD Books |location=  |isbn= 978-0-9623998-1-7 |edition= |last1=Carlton |first1=Donna |page=14 }}</ref>\n\nSome claim the origin of the modern striptease lies in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s [[Salome (play)|play of 'Salome']], in 1893.

In the 1920s and 1930s the famous [[Josephine Baker]] danced topless in the ''danse sauvage'' at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the [[Bal Tabarin (Paris)|Tabarin]]. These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers. In his 1957 book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', [[semiotics|semiotician]] [[Roland Barthes]] interpreted this Parisian striptease as a \"mystifying spectacle\", a \"reassuring ritual\" where \"evil is advertised the better to impede and exorcise it\".<ref>[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR/strip.html Striptease], in ''Mythologies'' by Roland Barthes, translated by Annette Lavers.

Another milestone for modern American striptease is the possibly legendary show at [[Minsky's Burlesque]] in April 1925: [[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]. The Minsky brothers brought burlesque to New York's [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]. However the burlesque theatres here were prohibited from having striptease performances in a legal ruling of 1937 leading to the later decline of these \"[[grindhouse]]s\" (named after the bump 'n grind entertainment on offer) into venues for cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newvictory.org/newvicMain.m |title=The New Victory Cinema |publisher=Newvictory.org |date=1995-12-11 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722001058/http://www.newvictory.org/newvicMain.m |archivedate=2012-07-22 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1960s saw a revival of striptease in the form of topless [[go-go dancing]].

To get around the prohibition the models appeared in stationary [[tableaux vivants]].<ref>Vivien Goldsmith, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3648187/Windmill-always-nude-but-never-rude.html \"Windmill: always nude but never rude\"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 24 November 2005</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://islingtontribune.com/article/windmill-girls-meet-for-reunion-and-remember-dancing-days-in-old-soho|title=Windmill Girls meet for reunion and remember dancing days in old Soho|website=Islington Tribune}}</ref>  The Windmill girls also toured other London and provincial theatres, sometimes using ingenious devices such as rotating ropes to move their bodies round, though strictly speaking, staying within the letter of the law by not moving of their own volition. Another example of the way the shows stayed within the law was the [[fan dance]], in which a naked dancer's body was concealed by her fans and those of her attendants, until the end of her act in when she posed nude for a brief interval whilst standing still.\n\nIn 1942, [[Phyllis Dixey]] formed her own company of girls and rented the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in London to put on a review called The Whitehall Follies.\n\nBy the 1950s, touring striptease acts were used to attract audiences to the dying music halls. Arthur Fox started his touring shows in 1948 and Paul Raymond started his in 1951. Paul Raymond later leased the Doric Ballroom in [[Soho]] and opened his private members club, the Raymond Revuebar in 1958. This was one of the first of the private striptease members clubs in Britain.\n\n[[Image:Windmill-Theatre.jpg|thumb|The [[Windmill Theatre]] in 2009]]\n[[File:Pole dancer 04.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A pole dancer]]\n\nIn the 1960s, changes in the law brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho with \"fully nude\" dancing and audience participation.<ref name=\"Murray Goldstein 2005\">{{cite book|first=Murray|last=Goldstein|year=2005|title=Naked Jungle: Soho Stripped Bare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ToqAAAACAAJ|publisher=Silverback Press|isbn=9780954944407}}</ref> Pubs were also used as a venue, most particularly in the [[East End]] with a concentration of such venues in the district of [[Shoreditch]].

An interesting custom in these pubs is that the strippers walk round and collect money from the customers in a beer jug before each individual performance. This custom appears to have originated in the late 1970s when topless go-go dancers first started collecting money from the audience as the fee for going \"fully nude\".<ref name=\"It Started With Theresa\"/> Private dances of a more raunchy nature are sometimes available in a separate area of the pub.<ref name=Clifton/>\n\n===Japan===\nStriptease became popular in Japan after the end of World War II. When entrepreneur Shigeo Ozaki saw [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] perform, he started his own striptease revue in Tokyo's [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] neighborhood. During the 1950s, Japanese \"strip shows\" became more sexually explicit and less dance-oriented, until they were eventually simply [[sex show|live sex shows]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Shteir|first=Rachel|title=Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show|url=https://archive.org/details/stripteaseuntold0000shte|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/stripteaseuntold0000shte/page/264 264]|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-512750-8}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\n\nRecently [[Pole dance|pole dancing]] has come to dominate the world of striptease. In the late 20th century, pole dancing was practised in exotic dance clubs in Canada. These clubs grew up to become a thriving sector of the economy. Canadian style pole dancing, [[Table dance|table dancing]] and [[Lap dance|lap dancing]], organized by multi-national corporations such as [[Spearmint Rhino]], was exported from North America to (among other countries) the United Kingdom, the nations of central Europe, Russia and Australia. In London, England a raft of such so-called \"lap dancing clubs\" grew up in the 1990s, featuring pole dancing on stage and private table dancing, though, despite media misrepresentation, [[Lap dance|lap-dancing]] in the sense of bodily contact was forbidden by law.<ref>Vlad Lapidos (1996) ''The Good Striptease Guide to London''. Tredegar Press.</ref>\n\n\"Feature shows\" are used to generate interest from potential customers who otherwise would not visit the establishment but know the performer from other outlets. A headlining star of a striptease show is referred to as a ''feature dancer'', and is often a performer with credits such as contest titles or appearances in adult films or magazines. The decades-old practice continued through the late 2000s (decade) to the present day with high-profile adult film performers such as [[Jenna Haze]] and Teagan Presley scheduling feature shows through the USA.\n\nIn December 2006, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] court ruled that striptease is an art form and made strip clubs exempt from [[value added tax]].<ref>BBC News.

December 6, 2006.</ref>\n\n===New Burlesque===\n{{Main|Neo-Burlesque}}\nIn the latter 1990s, a number of solo performers and dance groups emerged to create [[Neo-burlesque]], a revival of the classic [[American burlesque]] striptease of the early half of the 20th century. New Burlesque focuses on dancing, costumes and entertainment (which may include comedy and singing) and generally eschews full nudity or toplessness. Some burlesquers of the past have become instructors and mentors to New Burlesque performers such as [[:fr:The Velvet Hammer Burlesque|The Velvet Hammer Burlesque]] and [[The World Famous Pontani Sisters]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The pop group [[Pussycat Dolls]] began as a New Burlesque troupe.\n\n[[File:ChippendalesLasVegas.jpg|thumb|The [[Chippendales]] dancers are a famous group of male strippers.]]\n\n==Male strippers==\n{{main|Male stripper}}\nUntil the 1970s, strippers in Western cultures were almost invariably female, performing to male audiences. Since then, male strippers have also become common. Before the 1970s, dancers of both sexes appeared largely in underground clubs or as part of a theatre experience, but the practice eventually became common enough on its own.  Well-known troupes of male strippers include [[Dreamboys]] in the UK and [[Chippendales]] in the US. Male strippers have become a popular option to have at a [[bachelorette party]].\n\n==Private dancing==\n{{Main|Lap dance}}\nA variation on striptease is private dancing, which often involves [[lap dance|lap dancing]] or contact dancing. Here the performers, in addition to stripping for tips, also offer \"private dances\" which involve more attention for individual audience members. Variations include private dances like [[table dance|table dancing]] where the performer dances on or by customer's table rather than the customer being seated in a couch.\n\n==Striptease and the law==\n{{Main|Legal status of striptease}}\nFrom ancient times to the present day, striptease was considered a form of [[public nudity]] and subject to legal and cultural prohibitions on [[morality|moral]] and [[indecent exposure|decency]] grounds.  Such restrictions have been embodied in venue licensing regulations and various national and local laws, including liquor licensing restrictions.\n\n[[File:IndigoBlueMissExoticWorld2006.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Neo-burlesque]] stripper at the [[Miss Exotic World Pageant]] in 2006, showing the use of [[pasties]] as required in some U.S. jurisdictions]]\n\n===United States===\nNumerous U.S. jurisdictions have specific laws on the books related to striptease.

Among its provisions is the \"six foot rule\", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on|spell=in}} distance while performing.\n\nOther rules forbid \"full nudity\". In some parts of the U.S., there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which have thus to be covered by [[pasties]] by the dancer (though no such taboo applies to the exposure of male nipples).<ref name=\"Richard Wortley 1976\"/> In early 2010, the city of Detroit banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston which began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 |title=Houston topless clubs lose case, may respond to Supreme Court with pasties |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-03-29 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192107/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref> The city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609032414/http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html|url-status=dead|title=Detroit Passes New Strip Club Rules - Detroit Local News Story - WDIV Detroit|archivedate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> but kept other restrictions.

It was founded in 1970 by [[Roger Corman]] as '''New World Pictures, Ltd.''': a producer and distributor of [[film|motion pictures]], eventually expanding into [[television production]] in 1984. New World eventually expanded into broadcasting with the acquisition of seven [[television station]]s in 1993, with the broadcasting unit expanding through additional purchases made during 1994.\n\n[[20th Century Fox]] (then owned by [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]), controlled by [[Rupert Murdoch]], became a major investor in 1994 and purchased the company outright in 1997; the alliance with Murdoch, particularly through a group affiliation agreement with New World reached between the two companies in May 1994, helped to cement the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network as the [[Fourth television network|fourth major U.S. television network]].\n\nAlthough effectively defunct, it continues to exist as [[holding company|holding companies]] within the [[Fox Corporation]] corporate structure along with various regional subsidiaries (e.g. \"[[WTVT|New World Communications of Tampa]]\").  The content library, however, is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] through its acquisition of 21st Century Fox.\n\n==History==\n===New World Pictures (1970\u20131987)===\nThe company was founded on July 8, 1970, as '''New World Pictures, Ltd.'''; it was co-founded by [[B-movie]] director [[Roger Corman]] and his brother [[Gene Corman|Gene]], following their departure from [[American International Pictures]] (AIP).<ref>{{cite news|title=Roger Corman: Master of His Cult|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-09/news/tv-21790_1_roger-corman|author=Susan King|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=July 9, 1995|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> At the time, New World was the last remaining national low-budget film distributor, and was also one of the most successful independent companies in the nation.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Corman hoped to continue AIP's formula at New World, making low-budget films by new talent and distributing them internationally. However, it started out with only ten domestic offices, and one each in [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; its films were distributed regionally by other companies.<ref name=\"rc\">{{cite book|title=Lost Illusions: American cinema in the shadow of Watergate and ..., Volume 9|author=David A. Cook|publisher=Simon & Schuster|pages=328\u2013329}}</ref>\n\nNew World initially made [[exploitation film]]s such as ''[[The Student Nurses]]'' and other small-scale productions. Corman helped launch the filmmaking careers of [[Jonathan Demme]] (''[[Caged Heat]]'', ''[[Crazy Mama]]''), [[Jonathan Kaplan]] (''[[White Line Fever (film)|White Line Fever]]''), [[Ron Howard]] (''[[Grand Theft Auto (film)|Grand Theft Auto]]''), [[Paul Bartel]] (''[[Death Race 2000]]'') and [[Joe Dante]] (''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]''), all of whom made some of their early films as [[intern]]s for the company.<ref name=\"rc\"/> New World also released foreign films from acclaimed directors such as [[Ingmar Bergman]] (''[[Cries and Whispers]]'', ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''), [[Federico Fellini]] (''[[Amarcord]]'') and [[Akira Kurosawa]] (''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]''). The distribution of such films was conceived by Corman in an effort to disassociate New World as an exhibitor of exploitation films.<ref name=\"rc\"/>\n\nIn 1983, Corman sold New World to Larry Kupin, Harry E. Sloan and [[Larry A. Thompson]] for $16.5 million; the three new owners decided to take the company [[publicly traded company|public]]. Corman retained the film library, while New World acquired [[home video]] rights to the releases. In 1984, [[Robert Rehme]] \u2013 who formerly served as [[chief executive officer]] of [[Avco Embassy Pictures]] and [[Universal Pictures]] and had previously worked for New World as its vice president of sales in the 1970s \u2013 returned to the company as its new CEO.

In May 1986, New World acquired post-production facility [[North Shore Studios|Lions Gate Studios]] for $4.4 million. That November the company acquired the [[Marvel Entertainment#Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc.|Marvel Entertainment Group]] (MEG), the corporate parent of [[Marvel Comics]] from the liquidated [[Cadence Industries]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cadence Selling Comic-Book, Animation Unit : New World Pictures to Acquire Marvel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-21/business/fi-14794_1_marvel-comics-group|author=Bruce Keppel|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=November 21, 1986|accessdate=December 2, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015014831/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-21/business/fi-14794_1_marvel-comics-group|archivedate=October 15, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Superheroes' Battleground: Prime Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/11/arts/superheroes-battleground-prime-time.html|author=Aljean Harmetz|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 11, 1988}}</ref> By early 1987, the company sold its shares in [[Taft Broadcasting]] for $17.8 million.<ref name=lat/>\n\n===New World Entertainment (1987\u20131992)===\nIn 1987, New World acquired independent film studio Highgate Pictures and educational film company Learning Corporation of America.<ref>{{cite web|title=William Deneen|url=http://www.afana.org/deneen.htm|website=Afana.org|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref> By this time New World Pictures changed its name to '''New World Entertainment''' to better reflect its range of subsidiaries besides the film studio, including its purchase of [[Marvel Entertainment#Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc.|Marvel Comics]]. Also that year New World almost purchased two toy companies, [[Kenner Products|Kenner Parker Toys]] and [[Mattel]], but both planned acquisitions never materialized (although [[Tonka]] would acquire Kenner in 1987). In the fall of 1987, New World became the third in the list of [[prime time]] television series producers to the network after [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] and [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]. In 1988, [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], executive producer of the hour-long television program ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'', filed a lawsuit against New World.<ref name=lat/>\n\nAround this time, New World faced a major financial slump and the company began restructuring itself. Facing insolvency, management appealed to New World's principal lender, GE Capital, for a comprehensive debt restructuring, which would have wiped out the company's equity and left GE holding a 90% ownership stake. GE demurred, preferring an insolvency workout, and tried to force the company to file for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]]. Another equity firm, Sloan And Kupin, instead pursued an aggressive program of divestitures and sales, which ultimately yielded a substantial profit to management while leaving the debt holders struggling.

SCI had undergone several corporate restructurings following its 1987 purchase by [[Gillett Communications]] from [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (which, in turn, had acquired the stations' former parent [[Storer Communications]] in 1985). Earlier in the decade, the group \u2013 then known as GCI Broadcast Services, Inc. \u2013 had restructured after defaulting on some of its financing agreements. Eventually, the renamed, SCI ran into severe financial problems and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 1992.

Citicasters retained ownership of ABC affiliates [[WKRC-TV]] (channel 12) in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]], and [[WTSP]] (channel 10) in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]; in the latter case, New World decided against buying WTSP, as WTVT had the higher viewership of the two stations and market-wide signal coverage (WTSP's analog signal did not adequately cover southern sections of the Tampa\u2013St. Petersburg market, as its transmitter was short-spaced to avoid interfering with the signal of [[Miami]] ABC affiliate [[WPLG]], as both stations broadcast on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 10; because of this reason, ABC has long maintained a secondary Tampa affiliate in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]]-based [[WWSB]]).\n\nThe concurrent purchases of WBRC and WGHP posed issues as, at the time, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) only allowed a single company to own a maximum of 12 television stations nationwide (the Argyle and Citicasters purchases, combined with the seven stations it earlier acquired from SCI Television, would have given New World a total of 15 stations) and in the case of Birmingham, New World could not keep WBRC and WVTM in any event, as the FCC forbade [[duopoly (broadcasting)|common ownership of two television stations in the same market]]. As a result, following the completion of the Citicasters station purchases in late March 1995, New World placed WBRC and WGHP in a [[blind trust]] and sought buyers for both stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=The FCC last week approved New World's plans to transfer WGHP-TV Greensboro, NC, and WBRC-TV Birmingham, AL, into a trust for eventual sale to Fox|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16799904.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073449/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16799904.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 16, 2015|author=Kim McAvoy|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=April 10, 1995|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliation agreement and merger with Fox====\n{{Further information|1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment|Repercussions of the 1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment}}\nThe biggest deal involving New World Communications would aid in changing the face of American broadcasting.

New World, meanwhile, was concerned about the effect that the network's loss of NFC rights to Fox would have on both CBS, which was near the bottom of the [[Nielsen ratings|network ratings]] at the time, and on the group's CBS-affiliated stations.\n\nThe stations that became Fox affiliates had to acquire or produce additional programming to fill their broadcast days, as Fox programmed significantly fewer hours of network content (prime time programming for two hours on Monday through Saturdays and three hours on Sundays, the Monday through Saturday children's block [[Fox Kids]], and an hour of [[late night television|late night]] programming on Saturdays) than its three established major network competitors; on top of that, most of the New World stations (with KTVI later becoming the lone exception) declined to carry the Fox Kids block, a peculiarity even at a time when some ABC, NBC and CBS affiliates were still pre-empting portions of their network's children's program lineups. The time vacated by news programs, daytime shows and children's programs from each station's former network was filled by additional syndicated programming and, in particular, local newscasts. In the latter regard, local morning newscasts on the stations were expanded by one to two hours and early-evening newscasts by a half-hour; the majority of the stations \u2013 except, initially, for KTBC (which did not launch an hour-long 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast until August 2000) and KTVI (which did not launch a 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast until September 1996 as a half-hour program), both of which aired syndicated programs as lead-ins to their 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts \u2013 also carried a newscast in the final hour of prime time. The deal as a whole (as well as a second affiliation agreement that was struck one month after the New World deal through the purchase of four Burnham Broadcasting stations by SF Broadcasting, a joint venture with [[Savoy Pictures]]) caused a [[domino effect]] that resulted in various individual and group affiliation deals involving all four networks (primarily CBS, Fox, and ABC) affecting television stations in more than 70 [[media market]]s; in most of those areas, New World did not own a station.\n\nThree New World stations were excluded from the Fox affiliation deal. In Boston, where New World owned WSBK-TV, Fox was already affiliated with [[WFXT]] (channel 25), which the network would later re-acquire from the [[Boston Celtics]] in July 1995 (besides that, WSBK \u2013 like WFXT \u2013 was a UHF station with no prior history as a major network station and no existing news department, unlike the vast majority of its sister stations).<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Gets Celtics Station|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/12/business/fox-gets-celtics-station.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 12, 1995|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}</ref> WVTM was exempted in Birmingham, as, in the summer of 1995, New World sold WBRC as well as WGHP to [[Fox Television Stations]], with WBRC switching to Fox after its affiliation contract with ABC expired on August 31, 1996 (Fox's purchases of WBRC and WGHP \u2013 the latter of which switched to the network when its contract with ABC expired on September 1, 1995 \u2013 were finalized on January 17, 1996). KNSD (also a UHF station) also did not switch as Fox was already affiliated with a VHF station in the San Diego market, [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]-based [[XETV-TDT|XETV-TV]] (channel 6, later a [[The CW|CW]] affiliate and now a [[Canal 5 (Mexico)|Canal 5]] station targeting Tijuana). Both KNSD and WVTM retained their NBC affiliations. New World planned to sell all three stations as well, in order to comply with the FCC's twelve-station ownership limit.<ref name=\"NWC 1994\"/> In November 1994, New World sold WSBK-TV to the [[Paramount Stations Group]] subsidiary of [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (which turned it into a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]), a new network launched on January 16, 1995, in partnership with Viacom subsidiary [[Paramount Television]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Viacom agrees to purchase WSBK in Boston|url=http://archive.bangordailynews.com/1994/12/01/viacom-agrees-to-purchase-wsbk-in-boston/|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|publisher=Bangor Publishing Company|date=December 1, 1994|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Viacom to purchase Boston's WSBK-TV from New World Television|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Viacom+to+purchase+Boston%27s+WSBK-TV+from+New+World+Television.-a015921272|agency=Business Wire|publisher=Viacom/Farlex|via=The Free Library|date=November 30, 1994|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the transfer/assignment applications of the Argyle stations were not filed with the FCC until some time after New World had already completed its purchases of the four Citicasters stations on September 9 and October 12, 1994 (the former being the consummation date for the WDAF and KSAZ purchases, and the latter for the WGHP and WBRC purchases). New World began operating the Argyle stations through time brokerage agreements on January 19, 1995; the acquisition of the Argyle stations was completed on April 14, following the trust transfers of WBRC and WGHP.\n\nLater that year [[Brandon Tartikoff]], who helped NBC out of its ratings doldrums in the 1980s in his former role as President of Entertainment at NBC, joined New World Communications in an executive position; concurrently, New World acquired Tartikoff's [[production company]] Moving Target Productions. New World also acquired the remaining interest in Genesis Entertainment, which expanded upon New World's production assets into television distribution (Genesis has subsequently renamed New World-Genesis Distribution following the closure of the purchase).\n\nLater in 1995, the company signed a distribution deal with NBC (''[[Access (U.S. TV series)|Access Hollywood]]'' was the only program that came out of the agreement) in exchange for renewing the NBC affiliations for WVTM and KNSD in ten-year deals. That year also saw the acquisitions of [[Stephen J. Cannell|Cannell Entertainment]] and entertainment magazine ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' (the latter of which was purchased in a joint venture between New World and [[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.]], which assumed New World's interest following its merger with News Corporation).

It was founded in 1970 by [[Roger Corman]] as '''New World Pictures, Ltd.''': a producer and distributor of [[film|motion pictures]], eventually expanding into [[television production]] in 1984. New World eventually expanded into broadcasting with the acquisition of seven [[television station]]s in 1993, with the broadcasting unit expanding through additional purchases made during 1994.\n\n[[20th Century Fox]] (then owned by [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]), controlled by [[Rupert Murdoch]], became a major investor in 1994 and purchased the company outright in 1997; the alliance with Murdoch, particularly through a group affiliation agreement with New World reached between the two companies in May 1994, helped to cement the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network as the [[Fourth television network|fourth major U.S. television network]].\n\nAlthough effectively defunct, it continues to exist as [[holding company|holding companies]] within the [[Fox Corporation]] corporate structure along with various regional subsidiaries (i.e. \"[[WTVT|New World Communications of Tampa]]\").  The content library, however, is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] through its acquisition of 21st Century Fox.\n\n==History==\n===New World Pictures (1970\u20131987)===\nThe company was founded on July 8, 1970, as '''New World Pictures, Ltd.'''; it was co-founded by [[B-movie]] director [[Roger Corman]] and his brother [[Gene Corman|Gene]], following their departure from [[American International Pictures]] (AIP).<ref>{{cite news|title=Roger Corman: Master of His Cult|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-09/news/tv-21790_1_roger-corman|author=Susan King|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=July 9, 1995|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> At the time, New World was the last remaining national low-budget film distributor, and was also one of the most successful independent companies in the nation.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Corman hoped to continue AIP's formula at New World, making low-budget films by new talent and distributing them internationally. However, it started out with only ten domestic offices, and one each in [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; its films were distributed regionally by other companies.<ref name=\"rc\">{{cite book|title=Lost Illusions: American cinema in the shadow of Watergate and ..., Volume 9|author=David A. Cook|publisher=Simon & Schuster|pages=328\u2013329}}</ref>\n\nNew World initially made [[exploitation film]]s such as ''[[The Student Nurses]]'' and other small-scale productions. Corman helped launch the filmmaking careers of [[Jonathan Demme]] (''[[Caged Heat]]'', ''[[Crazy Mama]]''), [[Jonathan Kaplan]] (''[[White Line Fever (film)|White Line Fever]]''), [[Ron Howard]] (''[[Grand Theft Auto (film)|Grand Theft Auto]]''), [[Paul Bartel]] (''[[Death Race 2000]]'') and [[Joe Dante]] (''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]''), all of whom made some of their early films as [[intern]]s for the company.<ref name=\"rc\"/> New World also released foreign films from acclaimed directors such as [[Ingmar Bergman]] (''[[Cries and Whispers]]'', ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''), [[Federico Fellini]] (''[[Amarcord]]'') and [[Akira Kurosawa]] (''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]''). The distribution of such films was conceived by Corman in an effort to disassociate New World as an exhibitor of exploitation films.<ref name=\"rc\"/>\n\nIn 1983, Corman sold New World to Larry Kupin, Harry E. Sloan and [[Larry A. Thompson]] for $16.5 million; the three new owners decided to take the company [[publicly traded company|public]]. Corman retained the film library, while New World acquired [[home video]] rights to the releases. In 1984, [[Robert Rehme]] \u2013 who formerly served as [[chief executive officer]] of [[Avco Embassy Pictures]] and [[Universal Pictures]] and had previously worked for New World as its vice president of sales in the 1970s \u2013 returned to the company as its new CEO. Later that year Thompson left the company to form his own firm.<ref name=lat>{{cite news|title=REAL CLIFFHANGER: Will New World Be the Next Financial Horror in Hollywood?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-06/business/fi-983_1_new-world-entertainment|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=March 6, 1988|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, the company created three new divisions: '''New World International''', which would handle distribution of New World's productions outside the [[United States]]; '''New World Television''', a production unit focusing on television programs (the first television programs produced by the unit were the [[soap opera]] ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'' and the [[television film|made-for-TV movie]] ''Playing With Fire''); and '''New World Video''', which would handle home video distribution of films produced mainly by New World Pictures. In May 1986, New World acquired post-production facility [[North Shore Studios|Lions Gate Studios]] for $4.4 million. That November the company acquired the [[Marvel Entertainment#Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc.|Marvel Entertainment Group]] (MEG), the corporate parent of [[Marvel Comics]] from the liquidated [[Cadence Industries]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cadence Selling Comic-Book, Animation Unit : New World Pictures to Acquire Marvel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-21/business/fi-14794_1_marvel-comics-group|author=Bruce Keppel|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=November 21, 1986|accessdate=December 2, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015014831/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-21/business/fi-14794_1_marvel-comics-group|archivedate=October 15, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Superheroes' Battleground: Prime Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/11/arts/superheroes-battleground-prime-time.html|author=Aljean Harmetz|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 11, 1988}}</ref> By early 1987, the company sold its shares in [[Taft Broadcasting]] for $17.8 million.<ref name=lat/>\n\n===New World Entertainment (1987\u20131992)===\nIn 1987, New World acquired independent film studio Highgate Pictures and educational film company Learning Corporation of America.<ref>{{cite web|title=William Deneen|url=http://www.afana.org/deneen.htm|website=Afana.org|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref> By this time New World Pictures changed its name to '''New World Entertainment''' to better reflect its range of subsidiaries besides the film studio, including its purchase of [[Marvel Entertainment#Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc.|Marvel Comics]]. Also that year New World almost purchased two toy companies, [[Kenner Products|Kenner Parker Toys]] and [[Mattel]], but both planned acquisitions never materialized (although [[Tonka]] would acquire Kenner in 1987). In the fall of 1987, New World became the third in the list of [[prime time]] television series producers to the network after [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] and [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]. In 1988, [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], executive producer of the hour-long television program ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'', filed a lawsuit against New World.<ref name=lat/>\n\nAround this time, New World faced a major financial slump and the company began restructuring itself. Facing insolvency, management appealed to New World's principal lender, GE Capital, for a comprehensive debt restructuring, which would have wiped out the company's equity and left GE holding a 90% ownership stake. GE demurred, preferring an insolvency workout, and tried to force the company to file for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]].

Also included in the purchase was the library of Storer-owned syndication firm Blair Entertainment, which it had bought in 1985. SCI had undergone several corporate restructurings following its 1987 purchase by [[Gillett Communications]] from [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (which, in turn, had acquired the stations' former parent [[Storer Communications]] in 1985). Earlier in the decade, the group \u2013 then known as GCI Broadcast Services, Inc. \u2013 had restructured after defaulting on some of its financing agreements. Eventually, the renamed, SCI ran into severe financial problems and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 1992. SCI was folded into New World, following the completion of its purchase of the group by Perelman in the summer of 1993.\n\nIn 1993, New World Entertainment purchased ownership stakes in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] distributor Genesis Entertainment through [[Four Star Television]] and made a direct purchase of infomercial production company, [[Guthy-Renker]].<ref name=\"Genesis ownership of Four Star\">{{cite news|title=Billionaire May Cast Genesis Into Big Leagues : Television: Ronald O.

Then, New World acquired four of the six television stations owned by [[Taft Broadcasting|Citicasters]]: ABC affiliates [[WBRC|WBRC-TV]] (channel 6) in Birmingham and [[WGHP|WGHP-TV]] (channel 8) in [[High Point, North Carolina]]; NBC affiliate [[WDAF-TV]] (channel 4) in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; and CBS affiliate [[KSAZ-TV]] (channel 10) in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Citicasters retained ownership of ABC affiliates [[WKRC-TV]] (channel 12) in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]], and [[WTSP]] (channel 10) in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]; in the latter case, New World decided against buying WTSP, as WTVT had the higher viewership of the two stations and market-wide signal coverage (WTSP's analog signal did not adequately cover southern sections of the Tampa\u2013St. Petersburg market, as its transmitter was short-spaced to avoid interfering with the signal of [[Miami]] ABC affiliate [[WPLG]], as both stations broadcast on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 10; because of this reason, ABC has long maintained a secondary Tampa affiliate in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]]-based [[WWSB]]).\n\nThe concurrent purchases of WBRC and WGHP posed issues as, at the time, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) only allowed a single company to own a maximum of 12 television stations nationwide (the Argyle and Citicasters purchases, combined with the seven stations it earlier acquired from SCI Television, would have given New World a total of 15 stations) and in the case of Birmingham, New World could not keep WBRC and WVTM in any event, as the FCC forbade [[duopoly (broadcasting)|common ownership of two television stations in the same market]]. As a result, following the completion of the Citicasters station purchases in late March 1995, New World placed WBRC and WGHP in a [[blind trust]] and sought buyers for both stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=The FCC last week approved New World's plans to transfer WGHP-TV Greensboro, NC, and WBRC-TV Birmingham, AL, into a trust for eventual sale to Fox|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16799904.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073449/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16799904.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 16, 2015|author=Kim McAvoy|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=April 10, 1995|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliation agreement and merger with Fox====\n{{Further information|1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment|Repercussions of the 1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment}}\nThe biggest deal involving New World Communications would aid in changing the face of American broadcasting.

New World, meanwhile, was concerned about the effect that the network's loss of NFC rights to Fox would have on both CBS, which was near the bottom of the [[Nielsen ratings|network ratings]] at the time, and on the group's CBS-affiliated stations.\n\nThe stations that became Fox affiliates had to acquire or produce additional programming to fill their broadcast days, as Fox programmed significantly fewer hours of network content (prime time programming for two hours on Monday through Saturdays and three hours on Sundays, the Monday through Saturday children's block [[Fox Kids]], and an hour of [[late night television|late night]] programming on Saturdays) than its three established major network competitors; on top of that, most of the New World stations (with KTVI later becoming the lone exception) declined to carry the Fox Kids block, a peculiarity even at a time when some ABC, NBC and CBS affiliates were still pre-empting portions of their network's children's program lineups. The time vacated by news programs, daytime shows and children's programs from each station's former network was filled by additional syndicated programming and, in particular, local newscasts. In the latter regard, local morning newscasts on the stations were expanded by one to two hours and early-evening newscasts by a half-hour; the majority of the stations \u2013 except, initially, for KTBC (which did not launch an hour-long 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast until August 2000) and KTVI (which did not launch a 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast until September 1996 as a half-hour program), both of which aired syndicated programs as lead-ins to their 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts \u2013 also carried a newscast in the final hour of prime time. The deal as a whole (as well as a second affiliation agreement that was struck one month after the New World deal through the purchase of four Burnham Broadcasting stations by SF Broadcasting, a joint venture with [[Savoy Pictures]]) caused a [[domino effect]] that resulted in various individual and group affiliation deals involving all four networks (primarily CBS, Fox, and ABC) affecting television stations in more than 70 [[media market]]s; in most of those areas, New World did not own a station.\n\nThree New World stations were excluded from the Fox affiliation deal. In Boston, where New World owned WSBK-TV, Fox was already affiliated with [[WFXT]] (channel 25), which the network would later re-acquire from the [[Boston Celtics]] in July 1995 (besides that, WSBK \u2013 like WFXT \u2013 was a UHF station with no prior history as a major network station and no existing news department, unlike the vast majority of its sister stations).<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Gets Celtics Station|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/12/business/fox-gets-celtics-station.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 12, 1995|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}</ref> WVTM was exempted in Birmingham, as, in the summer of 1995, New World sold WBRC as well as WGHP to [[Fox Television Stations]], with WBRC switching to Fox after its affiliation contract with ABC expired on August 31, 1996 (Fox's purchases of WBRC and WGHP \u2013 the latter of which switched to the network when its contract with ABC expired on September 1, 1995 \u2013 were finalized on January 17, 1996). KNSD (also a UHF station) also did not switch as Fox was already affiliated with a VHF station in the San Diego market, [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]-based [[XETV-TDT|XETV-TV]] (channel 6, later a [[The CW|CW]] affiliate and now a [[Canal 5 (Mexico)|Canal 5]] station targeting Tijuana). Both KNSD and WVTM retained their NBC affiliations. New World planned to sell all three stations as well, in order to comply with the FCC's twelve-station ownership limit.<ref name=\"NWC 1994\"/> In November 1994, New World sold WSBK-TV to the [[Paramount Stations Group]] subsidiary of [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (which turned it into a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]), a new network launched on January 16, 1995, in partnership with Viacom subsidiary [[Paramount Television]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Viacom agrees to purchase WSBK in Boston|url=http://archive.bangordailynews.com/1994/12/01/viacom-agrees-to-purchase-wsbk-in-boston/|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|publisher=Bangor Publishing Company|date=December 1, 1994|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Viacom to purchase Boston's WSBK-TV from New World Television|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Viacom+to+purchase+Boston%27s+WSBK-TV+from+New+World+Television.-a015921272|agency=Business Wire|publisher=Viacom/Farlex|via=The Free Library|date=November 30, 1994|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the transfer/assignment applications of the Argyle stations were not filed with the FCC until some time after New World had already completed its purchases of the four Citicasters stations on September 9 and October 12, 1994 (the former being the consummation date for the WDAF and KSAZ purchases, and the latter for the WGHP and WBRC purchases). New World began operating the Argyle stations through time brokerage agreements on January 19, 1995; the acquisition of the Argyle stations was completed on April 14, following the trust transfers of WBRC and WGHP.\n\nLater that year [[Brandon Tartikoff]], who helped NBC out of its ratings doldrums in the 1980s in his former role as President of Entertainment at NBC, joined New World Communications in an executive position; concurrently, New World acquired Tartikoff's [[production company]] Moving Target Productions. New World also acquired the remaining interest in Genesis Entertainment, which expanded upon New World's production assets into television distribution (Genesis has subsequently renamed New World-Genesis Distribution following the closure of the purchase).\n\nLater in 1995, the company signed a distribution deal with NBC (''[[Access (U.S. TV series)|Access Hollywood]]'' was the only program that came out of the agreement) in exchange for renewing the NBC affiliations for WVTM and KNSD in ten-year deals. That year also saw the acquisitions of [[Stephen J. Cannell|Cannell Entertainment]] and entertainment magazine ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' (the latter of which was purchased in a joint venture between New World and [[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.]], which assumed New World's interest following its merger with News Corporation).

[[county-level city]] in Northwestern [[Xinjiang]], People's Republic of China and the seat of the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]]. Historically, Yining is the successor to the ruined city of [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]] in neighbouring [[Huocheng County]]. Yining is the third largest city in Xinjiang after [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] and [[Korla]].\n\n== Area and population ==\nThe city of Yining is a county-level administrative unit located along [[Ili River]]. As of 2015, it has an estimated population of 542,507, with a total land area of {{convert|629|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |title = Yining: Bulletin for economical and social development in 2015 |url = http://www.ahmhxc.com/tongjigongbao/3275_4.html |accessdate = 20 April 2016}}</ref> It is the most populous city in the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]].\n\nThe land area and population of the City of Yining saw an increase in 2003; the increase resulted from the transfer of two villages with some {{convert|100|km2|abbr=on}} of land from the adjacent [[Yining County]], which is a separate administrative unit from the city.\n\n== History ==\n=== Note on historical place names ===\nFrom 13-15th century it was under the control of [[Chagatai Khanate]]. Another Mongol empire&mdash;the [[Zunghar Khanate]]&mdash;established around Ili area. In the 19th and early 20th century, the word Kuldja or Ghulja was often used in Russia and in the West as the name for the entire Chinese part of the Ili River basin as well as for its two main cities. The usage of [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] is fairly characteristic: it defines '''Kulja''' as a \"territory in north-west China\" bounded by the Russian border and the mountains that surround the Ili basin, and it talks about two major cities of the region:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri15chisrich#page/942/mode/2up \"Kulja\" in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 1911, e.g]</ref>\n* ''Kulja''  (i.e. today's Yining), or more specifically ''Old Kulja'' (elsewhere, also called ''[[Taranchi]] Kulja''),  which was the commercial center of the region.\n* ''Suidun'' (i.e. [[Suiding]], now called [[Shuiding]]), or more specifically ''New Kulja'', ''[[Manchu]] Kulja'', or ''Ili'' (elsewhere, also ''Chinese Kulja''),  the Chinese fortress and the regional capital.\nUntil the 1860s [[Huiyuan, Xinjiang|Huiyuan]] to the south of Suiding was the regional capital.\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nThe fort of Ningyuan ({{zh|t=\u5be7\u9060\u57ce|labels=no}}) was built in 1762 to accommodate new settlers from southern [[Xinjiang]]. The forts of Huining ({{zh|t=\u60e0\u5be7\u57ce|labels=no}}) and Xichun ({{zh|t=\u7199\u6625\u57ce|labels=no}}) built later in 1765 and 1780 were also located within the modern Yining City.\n\nThe Sino-Russian [[Treaty of Kulja]] 1851 opened the area for trade.\n\nIn 1864-66, the city suffered severely from fighting during the [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]]. The city and the rest of the Ili River basin were seized by the [[Russia]]ns in 1871 during [[Yakub Beg]]'s independent rule of [[Kashgaria]]. It was restored to the Chinese under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)]]. In 1888 the Ningyuan County was established.\n\n''The Geographical Magazine'' in 1875 by Sir Clements Robert Markham stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat little industry Kulja possesses is all due to the Chinese, who transplanted the taste for art, assiduity and skilfulness of their pigtailed race, even to these western outskirts of \"the celestial flowery dominion of the Middle.\" Had the [[Taranchi|Taranjis]] and [[Oirats|Kalmuks]] been left to themselves, or had they remained in a preponderating majority, Kulja would not be a bit farther advanced than either [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] or [[Aksu Prefecture|Aksu]]. The principal trades are the following:\u2014 founders, manufacturing kettles, plates, and other implements of a very primitive form; paper-makers, whose productions do not seem to be superior to the paper manufactured at the present time after Chinese patterns at [[Khokand]] and [[Samarkand]]. There are, moreover, some confectionaries in which cakes of all shapes are baked of rice and millet, overlaid with sugar; also maccaroni-makers, the Taranjis being notoriously very fond of dried farinaceous food. In Eastern Turkistan there still exist many similar trades, and although their products are not equal to European articles of the same kind\u2014I mean here the fabrics of the formerly western Chinese provinces\u2014 they are still said to be profitable. Finally among the tradesmen we may mention millers, vinegar manufacturers and potters. The number of factories amount to-day at Kulja to 38, wherein over 131 hands are occupied. To this of course other tradespeople have to be added, such as 169 boot-makers, 50 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 11 brass-founders, 3 silversmiths, 26 stone-cutters, and 2 tailors.<ref name=\"Markham1875\">{{cite book|author=Sir Clements Robert Markham|title=The Geographical Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo7pAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1875|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company|pages=176\u2013}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nIn 1914 the Ningyuan County was renamed Yining County to avoid confusion with other places in China named [[Ningyuan (disambiguation)|Ningyuan]].\n\n=== People's Republic ===\nYining became a separate city from [[Yining County]] in 1952.

Dry and sunny weather dominates year-round. Winters are cold, with a January average of {{convert|-8.8|\u00b0C|1}}. Yet the influence of the [[Dzungarian Altau]] to the northwest and [[Boroboro Mountains]] to the northeast helps keep the city warmer than more easterly locales on a similar latitude.

[[county-level city]] in Northwestern [[Xinjiang]], People's Republic of China and the seat of the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]]. Historically, Yining is the successor to the ruined city of [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]] in neighbouring [[Huocheng County]]. Yining is the third largest city in Xinjiang after [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] and [[Korla]].\n\n== Area and population ==\nThe city of Yining is a county-level administrative unit located along [[Ili River]]. As of 2015, it has an estimated population of 542,507, with a total land area of {{convert|629|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |title = Yining: Bulletin for economical and social development in 2015 |url = http://www.ahmhxc.com/tongjigongbao/3275_4.html |accessdate = 20 April 2016}}</ref> It is the most populous city in the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]].\n\nThe land area and population of the City of Yining saw an increase in 2003; the increase resulted from the transfer of two villages with some {{convert|100|km2|abbr=on}} of land from the adjacent [[Yining County]], which is a separate administrative unit from the city.\n\n== History ==\n=== Note on historical place names ===\nFrom 13-15th century it was under the control of [[Chagatai Khanate]]. Another Mongol empire&mdash;the [[Zunghar Khanate]]&mdash;established around Ili area. In the 19th and early 20th century, the word Kuldja or Ghulja was often used in Russia and in the West as the name for the entire Chinese part of the Ili River basin as well as for its two main cities. The usage of [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] is fairly characteristic: it defines '''Kulja''' as a \"territory in north-west China\" bounded by the Russian border and the mountains that surround the Ili basin, and it talks about two major cities of the region:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri15chisrich#page/942/mode/2up \"Kulja\" in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 1911, e.g]</ref>\n* ''Kulja''  (i.e. today's Yining), or more specifically ''Old Kulja'' (elsewhere, also called ''[[Taranchi]] Kulja''),  which was the commercial center of the region.\n* ''Suidun'' (i.e. [[Suiding]], now called [[Shuiding]]), or more specifically ''New Kulja'', ''[[Manchu]] Kulja'', or ''Ili'' (elsewhere, also ''Chinese Kulja''),  the Chinese fortress and the regional capital.\nUntil the 1860s [[Huiyuan, Xinjiang|Huiyuan]] to the south of Suiding was the regional capital.\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nThe fort of Ningyuan ({{zh|t=\u5be7\u9060\u57ce|labels=no}}) was built in 1762 to accommodate new settlers from southern [[Xinjiang]]. The forts of Huining ({{zh|t=\u60e0\u5be7\u57ce|labels=no}}) and Xichun ({{zh|t=\u7199\u6625\u57ce|labels=no}}) built later in 1765 and 1780 were also located within the modern Yining City.\n\nThe Sino-Russian [[Treaty of Kulja]] 1851 opened the area for trade.\n\nIn 1864-66, the city suffered severely from fighting during the [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]]. The city and the rest of the Ili River basin were seized by the [[Russia]]ns in 1871 during [[Yakub Beg]]'s independent rule of [[Kashgaria]]. It was restored to the Chinese under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)]]. In 1888 the Ningyuan County was established.\n\n''The Geographical Magazine'' in 1875 by Sir Clements Robert Markham stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat little industry Kulja possesses is all due to the Chinese, who transplanted the taste for art, assiduity and skilfulness of their pigtailed race, even to these western outskirts of \"the celestial flowery dominion of the Middle.\" Had the [[Taranchi|Taranjis]] and [[Oirats|Kalmuks]] been left to themselves, or had they remained in a preponderating majority, Kulja would not be a bit farther advanced than either [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] or [[Aksu Prefecture|Aksu]]. The principal trades are the following:\u2014 founders, manufacturing kettles, plates, and other implements of a very primitive form; paper-makers, whose productions do not seem to be superior to the paper manufactured at the present time after Chinese patterns at [[Khokand]] and [[Samarkand]]. There are, moreover, some confectionaries in which cakes of all shapes are baked of rice and millet, overlaid with sugar; also maccaroni-makers, the Taranjis being notoriously very fond of dried farinaceous food. In Eastern Turkistan there still exist many similar trades, and although their products are not equal to European articles of the same kind\u2014I mean here the fabrics of the formerly western Chinese provinces\u2014 they are still said to be profitable. Finally among the tradesmen we may mention millers, vinegar manufacturers and potters. The number of factories amount to-day at Kulja to 38, wherein over 131 hands are occupied. To this of course other tradespeople have to be added, such as 169 boot-makers, 50 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 11 brass-founders, 3 silversmiths, 26 stone-cutters, and 2 tailors.<ref name=\"Markham1875\">{{cite book|author=Sir Clements Robert Markham|title=The Geographical Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo7pAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1875|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company|pages=176\u2013}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nIn 1914 the Ningyuan County was renamed Yining County to avoid confusion with other places in China named [[Ningyuan (disambiguation)|Ningyuan]].\n\n=== People's Republic ===\nYining became a separate city from [[Yining County]] in 1952. In 1962, major Sino-Soviet clashes{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} took place along the [[Ili River]].\n\nIn 1997, in what came to be known as the [[Gulja Incident]] or massacre, the city was rocked by two days of demonstrations or riots<ref>\"Xinjiang to intensify crackdown on separatists\", [[China Daily]], 10/25/2001 [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2001-10/25/content_90592.htm]</ref> followed by a government crack down resulting in at least 9 deaths following the execution of 30 [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] activists.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RUCOrg2Pb0 1997 Channel 4 UK report which can be seen here]</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:USSR map NK 44-2 I-Ning.jpg|thumb|left|Yining (labelled as I-NING (KULDJA) {{lang|zh-hant|\u4f0a\u5be7}}) (1952)]]\n{{climate chart\n| Yining (Gulja)\n| -15.0 | -2.1 | 18\n| -12.2 |   .2 | 19\n| - 2.5 |  9.0 | 20\n|   5.8 | 20.4 | 28\n|  10.2 | 24.8 | 27\n|  14.0 | 28.5 | 29\n|  15.8 | 31.0 | 20\n|  14.1 | 30.4 | 14\n|   9.3 | 25.8 | 15\n|   2.9 | 18.0 | 26\n| - 2.8 |  8.7 | 28\n| - 9.5 |  1.3 | 25\n|float = right\n|clear = none\n|source = CMA <REF NAME = CMA />\n}}\n\nYining is located on the northern side of the [[Ili River]] in the [[Dzungaria]]n basin, about {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} east of the border with [[Kazakhstan]], and about {{convert|710|km|abbr=on}} west of [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]].

Dry and sunny weather dominates year-round. Winters are cold, with a January average of {{convert|-8.8|\u00b0C|1}}.

From there it runs towards the east coast at [[Mangonui]] and then inland again until it reaches the coast again at [[Whangaroa Harbour]]. The road then heads south-east towards the [[Bay of Islands]] before turning more southerly to pass inland of [[Kerikeri]] and [[Paihia]]. It then turns south-west and south until rejoining SH 1 near [[Pakaraka]], 8&nbsp;km east of [[Ohaeawai]].\n\nAs with several roads in the [[Far North District]], the highway is prone to flooding at some times of the year. Heavy rains in August 2012 caused major subsidence to undermine parts of the highway near [[Kaeo]], which required substantial repair.<ref>\"[http://www.nzta.govt.nz/about/media/releases/2126/news.html NZTA advises care on SH10 after Northland storm]\", New Zealand Transport Authority, 13 August 2012.

At both ends it terminates at [[New Zealand State Highway 1|SH 1]]. With the exception of SH 1, it is the country's northernmost [[New Zealand state highway network|state highway]].\n\n==Route==\nSH 10 begins at Awanui, 7&nbsp;km north of [[Kaitaia]]. From there it runs towards the east coast at [[Mangonui]] and then inland again until it reaches the coast again at [[Whangaroa Harbour]]. The road then heads south-east towards the [[Bay of Islands]] before turning more southerly to pass inland of [[Kerikeri]] and [[Paihia]]. It then turns south-west and south until rejoining SH 1 near [[Pakaraka]], 8&nbsp;km east of [[Ohaeawai]].\n\nAs with several roads in the [[Far North District]], the highway is prone to flooding at some times of the year. Heavy rains in August 2012 caused major subsidence to undermine parts of the highway near [[Kaeo]], which required substantial repair.<ref>\"[http://www.nzta.govt.nz/about/media/releases/2126/news.html NZTA advises care on SH10 after Northland storm]\", New Zealand Transport Authority, 13 August 2012. Retrieved 29 December 2013.</ref> The road is narrow in places, due to the nature of the landscape around the highway, though substantial improvements have been made since 2010 to one of the most dangerous stretches at Bulls Gorge, south of Kerikeri.<ref>\"[http://www.ncceng.co.nz/projects/project%201%20-%20sh10%20bulls%20gorge SH10 Bulls Gorge]\", Northern Civil Consulting Engineers.
