Jinn are not a strictly Islamic concept; rather, they may represent several [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pagan]] beliefs integrated into Islam.{{efn|\"M. Dols points out that jinn-belief is not a strictly Islamic concept. It rather includes countless elements of idol-worship, as Muhammad's enemies practised in Mecca during ''jahilliya''. According to F. Meier early Islam integrated many pagan deities into its system by degrading them to spirits. 1. In Islam, the existence of spirits that are neither angels nor necessarily devils is acknowledged. 2. Thereby Islam is able to incorporate non-biblical[,] non-Quranic ideas about mythic images, that means: a. degrading deities to spirits and therefore taking into the spiritual world. b. taking daemons, not mentioned in the sacred traditions of Islam, of uncertain origin. c. consideration of spirits to tolerate or advising to regulate them.\" Original: \"M. Dols macht darauf aufmerksam, dass der Ginn-Glaube kein strikt islamisches Konzept ist.

If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.

By that, a vast amount of traditions and beliefs among Muslims is excluded from contemporary theological discourse and downplaying embedded Muslim beliefs as local lore, such as symptoms of jinn possession.

It is a powerful account of their attempt to free themselves from a past viewed as inhabited by evil forces and about the encounter between contemporary Salafi reformism and a presumed disappearing religious universe. It serves to prove how a novel version of Islam has superseded former practices; delegitimized and categorized as belonging to the past. The story is, however, also an important source and an interesting entry-point to examine the continued relevance of past practices within processes of reform. Analyzing the story about the jinns and the trajectory of Salafi reform in Bale, this contribution demonstrates how the past remains intersected with present reformism, and how both former practices and novel impetuses are reconfigured through this process. The article pays attention to the dialectics of negotiations inherent to processes of reform and points to the manner in which the involvement of a range of different actors produces idiosyncratic results. It challenges notions of contemporary Islamic reform as something linear and fixed and argues that such processes are multifaceted and open-ended.\nSN  - 1872-0226\nUR  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nDO  - 10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nID  - \u00d8steb\u00f82014\nER  - \n</ref> For that reason, jinn are taken as serious danger by adherents of Salafism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} [[Saudi Arabia]], following the [[Wahhabism]] strant of Salafism, imposes a [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|death penalty]] for dealing with jinn to prevent [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]] and [[witchcraft]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/the-death-penalty-in-saudi-arabia-facts-and-figures/ | title=The death penalty in Saudi Arabia: Facts and Figures}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/saudi-arabias-war-on-witchcraft/278701/ | title=Saudi Arabia's War on Witchcraft| date=2013-08-19}}</ref> Contrary to the official teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remained popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology.<ref>PEDRAM PARTOVI\n ''Girls\u2019 Dormitor y : Women\u2019s Islam and Iranian Horror\n''</ref>\n\n[[Ahmadi]] interpret jinn not as supernatural beings, but as powerful men whose influence is felt even though they keep their distance from the common people.

Dols points out that jinn-belief is not a strictly Islamic concept. It rather includes countless elements of idol-worship, as Muhammad's enemies practised in Mecca during ''jahilliya''. According to F. Meier early Islam integrated many pagan deities into its system by degrading them to spirits. 1. In Islam, the existence of spirits that are neither angels nor necessarily devils is acknowledged. 2. Thereby Islam is able to incorporate non-biblical[,] non-Quranic ideas about mythic images, that means: a. degrading deities to spirits and therefore taking into the spiritual world. b. taking daemons, not mentioned in the sacred traditions of Islam, of uncertain origin. c. consideration of spirits to tolerate or advising to regulate them.\" Original: \"M.

Jahiz states in his work [[Kitab al-Hayawan]] that loneliness induces humans to mind-games and wishful thinking, causing ''wasw\u0101s'' (whisperings in the mind, traditionally thought to be caused by [[Satan]]). If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.

It is a powerful account of their attempt to free themselves from a past viewed as inhabited by evil forces and about the encounter between contemporary Salafi reformism and a presumed disappearing religious universe. It serves to prove how a novel version of Islam has superseded former practices; delegitimized and categorized as belonging to the past. The story is, however, also an important source and an interesting entry-point to examine the continued relevance of past practices within processes of reform. Analyzing the story about the jinns and the trajectory of Salafi reform in Bale, this contribution demonstrates how the past remains intersected with present reformism, and how both former practices and novel impetuses are reconfigured through this process. The article pays attention to the dialectics of negotiations inherent to processes of reform and points to the manner in which the involvement of a range of different actors produces idiosyncratic results. It challenges notions of contemporary Islamic reform as something linear and fixed and argues that such processes are multifaceted and open-ended.\nSN  - 1872-0226\nUR  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nDO  - 10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nID  - \u00d8steb\u00f82014\nER  - \n</ref> For that reason, jinn are taken as serious danger by adherents of Salafism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} [[Saudi Arabia]], following the [[Wahhabism]] strant of Salafism, imposes a [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|death penalty]] for dealing with jinn to prevent [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]] and [[witchcraft]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/the-death-penalty-in-saudi-arabia-facts-and-figures/ | title=The death penalty in Saudi Arabia: Facts and Figures}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/saudi-arabias-war-on-witchcraft/278701/ | title=Saudi Arabia's War on Witchcraft| date=2013-08-19}}</ref> Contrary to the official teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remained popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology.<ref>PEDRAM PARTOVI\n ''Girls\u2019 Dormitor y : Women\u2019s Islam and Iranian Horror\n''</ref>\n\n[[Ahmadi]] interpret jinn not as supernatural beings, but as powerful men whose influence is felt even though they keep their distance from the common people.

He was a close ally of the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] ({{reign}}1220\u20131250), and ruled [[Verona]], [[Vicenza]] and [[Padua]] for almost two decades.{{sfn|Dean|1999|page=460}} He became infamous as a cruel tyrant, and was, in fact, the most \"notorious\" of the \"early tyrants\".{{sfn|Dean|1999|page=459}}\n\n==Biography==\n=== Early life ===\n\nEzzelino was a son of [[Ezzelino II da Romano]], ruler of [[Bassano del Grappa]] and other fiefs in the Veneto, and Adelaide degli Alberti di Mangona, who came from a family of counts in [[Tuscany]]. At the age of four years, he was sent as a hostage to Verona, but nothing else is known about his childhood or education. In 1213, he took part in the siege of the castle of [[Este, Italy|Este]], which belonged to his father's archenemy, marquess [[Azzo VI of Este]], who died in 1212 and later to his son Aldobrandino. According to the chronicler [[Rolandino of Padua]], the young Ezzelino already showed a keen interest in siegecraft and acquired a hatred of the Este which would last his entire life.\n\n=== Rise to power 1226\u20131239 ===\n\nWhen Ezzelino II retired to a monastery in 1223, his possessions went to his sons [[Alberico da Romano|Alberico]], who got the castles and villages in the countryside of Vicenza (including the important centre of Bassano del Grappa) and Ezzelino, who got the possessions in the countryside of Treviso. In 1226 Ezzelino intervened in a faction struggle in Verona and aided the Veronese factions of the Monticuli and Quattuorviginti against their enemies, the so-called ''pars comitis'' (\"party of the\" count), which was headed by the Veronese count [[Richard of San Bonifacio]]. From this time onwards Ezzelino became an important factor in Veronese politics and in 1226/1227 he had become {{lang|it|[[podest\u00e0]]}}\u2014Lord Mayor, that is\u2014of that city. He briefly lost Verona, but regained it in 1230.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Eccelino da Romano|volume=8|pages=846\u2013847}}</ref>\n\nAt this time control over Verona was highly important because the Emperor Frederick II was in conflict with the Second [[Lombard League]], an alliance of cities in Northern Italy. Whoever controlled Verona could block the [[Brenner Pass]], and thereby prevent the arrival of reinforcements for Frederick from Germany. Initially in 1226, Ezzelino favoured the Lombard League which could block the Brenner and emerge victorious from its first confrontation with the Emperor. Later however, he and his brother Alberico changed sides, when it became apparent that the League favoured their enemies in the March: the Este and the San Bonifacio (Sambonifacio).\n\nIn 1232 they struck an alliance with Frederick and received an imperial privilege of protection. However four years passed before the emperor could personally intervene in the March of Treviso. The years 1232\u20131236 were therefore very hard for Ezzelino and Alberico, who were assaulted by many enemies, primarily the San Bonifacio, the Este and the city of Padua.\nFinally in 1236, Frederick II arrived in the March. Since Ezzelino and his Veronese allies, the Monticuli and Quattuorviginti, had gained control of Verona in early 1236, the emperor could bring reinforcements\u2013among them 3000 German knights\u2014from across the Alps. In a campaign that began in November 1236 Frederich and Ezzelino, who was becoming an increasingly important ally of the emperor, subjugated all the important cities of the March of Treviso: Vicenza was conquered in November 1236, Padua and Treviso surrendered in February/March 1237.\n\n[[File:Activities of Ezzelino III da Romano.svg|thumb|Activities of Ezzelino III da Romano.]]\n\nIn 1236 Ezzelino married Selvaggia, Frederick's natural daughter who was thirteen years old at the time;  conquered [[Verona]] and by treason Padua, seizing the position of ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' of that city. In Padua he had the monk [[Giordano Forzat\u00e8]] arrested and exiled.\n\nEzzelino was one of the protagonists in the Ghibelline-Imperial victory of [[Battle of Cortenuova|Cortenuova]] (1237)  and in 1239 was named Imperial viceroy for the [[March of Treviso]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His long-lasting struggle against [[Azzo VII of Este]], the new duke of the [[House of Este|Este]]  ended with the total defeat of the latter and the annexion of many territories.\n\n===Last years===\nAfter a failed pacification attempt by Frederick, as soon as the emperor set off again Ezzelino attacked the Este, submitting Treviso\u2014even though it was his brother's fief\u2014[[Belluno]] and [[Feltre]]. He was now lord of all lands between the city of [[Trento]] and the [[Oglio river]] and had acquired a reputation for cruelty and the regular use of [[torture]] against all enemies and alleged plotters, in the cities he ruled. \nIn 1249, five years after Selvaggia's death at the tender age of just 21 years, he married [[Beatrice di Buontraverso]].\n\nAfter Frederick's death in 1250, Ezzelino supported his son, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]]. There was growing disgust at Ezzelino's cruel behavior,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and in 1254 he was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Innocent IV]], who also launched a [[crusade]] against him. He had reconciled with his brother and allied himself with other seigneurs of the Veneto and [[Lombardy]], attacking Padua, which resisted and Brescia, which was instead sacked after an easy victory of his German knights over the crusaders' army. \nIn 1258 he launched a broad Ghibelline offensive in Lombardy and Veneto along with [[Oberto Pallavicino]] of [[Cremona]]. After a failed attempt to assault [[Milan]] itself, he was wounded by an arrow in the course of the [[Battle of Cassano (1259)|Battle of Cassano d'Adda]] and had to retreat but was captured near [[Bergamo]]. He killed himself by intentional self-neglect during his imprisonment in the castle of [[Soncino, Lombardy|Soncino]], near the city of Cremona in Lombardy. In the following year his brother Albert was put to death, and the Romano family became extinct.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIt was only after his death that the alliance between Sambonifacio and Este fell apart.{{sfn|Dean|1999|page=460}}\n\n==Legacy==\nMuch of what we know about Ezzelino comes from a literary tradition that was embroidered over the course of centuries; despite the brevity of his reign, Ezzelino's reputed cruelty became symbolic of tyranny, poets and chroniclers living in recent memory of his tactics used his name to evoke the sense of arbitrary power and the moral transgressions it enabled; fourteenth century authors raised the level of accusation, insisting that Ezzelino's parentage was demonic. [[Rolandino of Padua]]'s ''Chronicle of the Trevisan March'' (c. 1262) charts the rise and the fall of the 'da Romano' family, introducing Ezzelino as a young man throwing stones at the home of the family rival; the extremely partisan political work follows the fortunes of Padua under the tyrant's iron grip up to the [[Medieval commune|commune]]'s liberation by the Guelph League.\n[[Albertino Mussato]]'s ''[[Ecerinis]]'' ( c. 1315 ) portrays Ezzelino as the son of the [[Devil]]; the Latin verse play introduces Ezzelino's mother, who provides testimony of the tyrant's infernal sire.\nIn [[Dante Aligheri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', his soul is consigned to [[Hell]], where Dante encounters him in the Seventh Circle, First Ring: the Violent against their Neighbors (''Inferno'', XII, 109). His younger sister [[Cunizza da Romano|Cunizza]] is also cited by Dante, in ''Paradise'', IX, 31-33.\n\nBefore Ezzelino, the seizing of political power in city-states throughout the Middle Ages, had been based on real or pretended inheritance claims or else were directed against infidels and the excommunicated; but with him, as the historian [[Jacob Burkhardt]] relates, \"Here for the first time the attempt was openly made to found a throne by wholesale murder and endless barbarities, by the adoption in short, of any means with a view to nothing but the end pursued.\"<ref>Jacob Burkhardt, [[s:The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy/Part 1#Introduction|''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy'', Introduction.]]</ref> The example set by the success of this kind of ruthlessness, was not lost on the future tyrants of late Middle Age and early Renaissance Italy.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ezzelini]]\n*[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]\n*[[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Dean|first=Trevor|chapter=The rise of the ''signori''|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History (Vol. '''5'''): c. 1198-c. 1300|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0521362894|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=bclfdU_2lesC&dq=Ezzelino+III+da+Romano&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv| editor-given1 = David | editor-surname1 = Abulafia | postscript = .}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ezzelino III da Romano}}\n*[http://www.mondimedievali.net/personaggi/ezzelino.htm Summary of Ezzelino's deeds] {{in lang|it}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Romano, Ezzelino 03 Da}}\n[[Category:1194 births]]\n[[Category:1259 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Padua]]\n[[Category:Condottieri]]\n[[Category:Ezzelini|Ezzelino 03]]\n[[Category:Wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines]]\n[[Category:People excommunicated by the Catholic Church]]\n[[Category:13th-century Italian people]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=June 2019}}\n\n{{Infobox noble|type\n| name              = Ezzelino\n| title             = [[Podest\u00e0]] of [[Verona]]\n| image             = EzzIII.jpg\n| caption           = 16th century woodcut of Ezzelino III da Romano.\n| alt               = \n| CoA               =\n| more              = no\n| reign             = 1226\u201330, 1232\u201359\n| reign-type        = \n| predecessor       = \n| successor         = [[Mastino I della Scala]]\n| suc-type          = Successor\n| succession        = \n| spouse            = {{marriage|Selvaggia|1236|1244|end=her death}}<br>{{marriage|Beatrice di Buontraverso.|1244|October 7, 1259|end=his death}}\n| spouse-type       = Spouse\n| issue             =\n| issue-link        = \n| issue-pipe        = \n| full name         = \n| styles            = \n| titles            = Podest\u00e0 of [[Verona]] <small>(1226\u201330, 1232\u201359)</small><br>Podest\u00e0 of [[Padua]] <small>(1236\u201359)</small><br>Podest\u00e0 of [[Vicenza]] <small>(1237\u201356)</small>\n| noble family      = [[Ezzelino]]\n| house-type        = Nobility\n| father            = [[ Ezzelino II da Romano]]\n| mother            = \n| birth_date        = {{birth date|1194|4|25|df=y}}\n| birth_place       = [[Tombolo, Veneto|Tombolo]]\n| christening_date  = \n| christening_place = \n| death_date        = {{death date|1259|10|7|df=y}}\n| death_place       = [[Soncino, Lombardy|Castle of Soncino]]\n| burial_date       = \n| burial_place      = \n| occupation        = statesman, commander\n}}\n\n'''Ezzelino III da Romano''' (April 25, 1194, [[Tombolo, Veneto|Tombolo]]{{snd}}October 7, 1259) was an Italian feudal lord, a member of the [[Ezzelino]] family, in the [[March of Treviso]] (in the modern Veneto).

In 1226 Ezzelino intervened in a faction struggle in Verona and aided the Veronese factions of the Monticuli and Quattuorviginti against their enemies, the so-called ''pars comitis'' (\"party of the\" count), which was headed by the Veronese count [[Richard of San Bonifacio]]. From this time onwards Ezzelino became an important factor in Veronese politics and in 1226/1227 he had become {{lang|it|[[podest\u00e0]]}}\u2014Lord Mayor, that is\u2014of that city. He briefly lost Verona, but regained it in 1230.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Eccelino da Romano|volume=8|pages=846\u2013847}}</ref>\n\nAt this time control over Verona was highly important because the Emperor Frederick II was in conflict with the Second [[Lombard League]], an alliance of cities in Northern Italy. Whoever controlled Verona could block the [[Brenner Pass]], and thereby prevent the arrival of reinforcements for Frederick from Germany. Initially in 1226, Ezzelino favoured the Lombard League which could block the Brenner and emerge victorious from its first confrontation with the Emperor. Later however, he and his brother Alberico changed sides, when it became apparent that the League favoured their enemies in the March: the Este and the San Bonifacio (also known as ''Sambonifacio'').\n\nIn 1232 they struck an alliance with Frederick and received an imperial privilege of protection. However four years passed before the emperor could personally intervene in the March of Treviso. The years 1232\u20131236 were therefore very hard for Ezzelino and Alberico, who were assaulted by many enemies, primarily the San Bonifacio, the Este and the city of Padua.\nFinally in 1236, Frederick II arrived in the March. Since Ezzelino and his Veronese allies, the Monticuli and Quattuorviginti, had gained control of Verona in early 1236, the emperor could bring reinforcements\u2013among them 3000 German knights\u2014from across the Alps. In a campaign that began in November 1236 Frederich and Ezzelino, who was becoming an increasingly important ally of the emperor, subjugated all the important cities of the March of Treviso: Vicenza was conquered in November 1236, Padua and Treviso surrendered in February/March 1237.\n\n[[File:Activities of Ezzelino III da Romano.svg|thumb|Activities of Ezzelino III da Romano.]]\n\nIn 1236 Ezzelino married Selvaggia, Frederick's natural daughter who was thirteen years old at the time;  conquered [[Verona]] and by treason [[Padua]], seizing the position of ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' of that city. He was one of the protagonists in the Ghibelline-Imperial victory of [[Battle of Cortenuova|Cortenuova]] (1237)  and in 1239 was named Imperial viceroy for the [[March of Treviso]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His long-lasting struggle against [[Azzo VII of Este]], the new duke of the [[House of Este|Este]]  ended with the total defeat of the latter and the annexion of many territories.\n\n===Last years===\nAfter a failed pacification attempt by Frederick, as soon as the emperor set off again Ezzelino attacked the Este, submitting Treviso\u2014even though it was his brother's fief\u2014[[Belluno]] and [[Feltre]]. He was now lord of all lands between the city of [[Trento]] and the [[Oglio river]] and had acquired a reputation for cruelty and the regular use of [[torture]] against all enemies and alleged plotters, in the cities he ruled. \nIn 1249, five years after Selvaggia's death at the tender age of just 21 years, he married [[Beatrice di Buontraverso]].\n\nAfter Frederick's death in 1250, Ezzelino supported his son, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]]. There was growing disgust at Ezzelino's cruel behavior,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and in 1254 he was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Innocent IV]], who also launched a [[crusade]] against him. He had reconciled with his brother and allied himself with other seigneurs of the Veneto and [[Lombardy]], attacking Padua, which resisted and Brescia, which was instead sacked after an easy victory of his German knights over the crusaders' army. \nIn 1258 he launched a broad Ghibelline offensive in Lombardy and Veneto along with [[Oberto Pallavicino]] of [[Cremona]]. After a failed attempt to assault [[Milan]] itself, he was wounded by an arrow in the course of the [[Battle of Cassano (1259)|Battle of Cassano d'Adda]] and had to retreat but was captured near [[Bergamo]]. He killed himself by intentional self-neglect during his imprisonment in the castle of [[Soncino, Lombardy|Soncino]], near the city of Cremona in Lombardy. In the following year his brother Albert was put to death, and the Romano family became extinct.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIt was only after his death that the alliance between Sambonifacio and Este fell apart.{{sfn|Dean|1999|page=460}}\n\n==Legacy==\nMuch of what we know about Ezzelino comes from a literary tradition that was embroidered over the course of centuries; despite the brevity of his reign, Ezzelino's reputed cruelty became symbolic of tyranny, poets and chroniclers living in recent memory of his tactics used his name to evoke the sense of arbitrary power and the moral transgressions it enabled; fourteenth century authors raised the level of accusation, insisting that Ezzelino's parentage was demonic. [[Rolandino of Padua]]'s ''Chronicle of the Trevisan March'' (c. 1262) charts the rise and the fall of the 'da Romano' family, introducing Ezzelino as a young man throwing stones at the home of the family rival; the extremely partisan political work follows the fortunes of Padua under the tyrant's iron grip up to the [[Medieval commune|commune]]'s liberation by the Guelph League.\n[[Albertino Mussato]]'s ''[[Ecerinis]]'' ( c. 1315 ) portrays Ezzelino as the son of the [[Devil]]; the Latin verse play introduces Ezzelino's mother, who provides testimony of the tyrant's infernal sire.\nIn [[Dante Aligheri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', his soul is consigned to [[Hell]], where Dante encounters him in the Seventh Circle, First Ring: the Violent against their Neighbors (''Inferno'', XII, 109). His younger sister [[Cunizza da Romano|Cunizza]] is also cited by Dante, in ''Paradise'', IX, 31-33.\n\nBefore Ezzelino, the seizing of political power in city-states throughout the Middle Ages, had been based on real or pretended inheritance claims or else were directed against infidels and the excommunicated; but with him, as the historian [[Jacob Burkhardt]] relates, \"Here for the first time the attempt was openly made to found a throne by wholesale murder and endless barbarities, by the adoption in short, of any means with a view to nothing but the end pursued.\"<ref>Jacob Burkhardt, [[s:The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy/Part 1#Introduction|''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy'', Introduction.]]</ref> The example set by the success of this kind of ruthlessness, was not lost on the future tyrants of late Middle Age and early Renaissance Italy.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ezzelini]]\n*[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]\n*[[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Dean|first=Trevor|chapter=The rise of the ''signori''|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History (Vol. '''5'''): c. 1198-c. 1300|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0521362894|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=bclfdU_2lesC&dq=Ezzelino+III+da+Romano&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv| editor-given1 = David | editor-surname1 = Abulafia | postscript = .}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ezzelino III da Romano}}\n*[http://www.mondimedievali.net/personaggi/ezzelino.htm Summary of Ezzelino's deeds] {{in lang|it}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Romano, Ezzelino 03 Da}}\n[[Category:1194 births]]\n[[Category:1259 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Padua]]\n[[Category:Condottieri]]\n[[Category:Ezzelini|Ezzelino 03]]\n[[Category:Wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines]]\n[[Category:People excommunicated by the Catholic Church]]\n[[Category:13th-century Italian people]]\n", "name_user": "Srnec", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRise to power 1226\u20131239:link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezzelino_III_da_Romano"}

In the 1970s and 80s he was a founding member of the influential [[neo-expressionist]] art movement [[Neue Wilde]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] alongside [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Markus L\u00fcpertz]], and his brother [[Albert Oehlen]]. \n\n==Biography==\nOehlen studied at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] ([[Alfonso H\u00fcppi]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} His is formative participant of the German art movement [[Neue Wilde]], which was especially active in Germany during the 1980s, and used a [[Punk subculture|punk]] style that stood in opposition to [[minimalism]]. The aim was to attack the high-browed nature of minimalism with a style of painting that is based on instinct and gesturally emphasizes the wild, spontaneous, obsessive and sensual. \n\nOehlen has continuously developed his work and, in parallel with painting, also works on sculptures and musical projects. His new works are increasingly inspired by the perceptual experiments of [[Op Art]], with printed image interferences that occur in grid-like patterns above and below the layers of the picture. Along with forms that are oriented toward computer aesthetics, this brings an aspect of serialism to the images. It can be understood as a humorous and ironic commentary on the expressive nature of painting and \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 on the Neuen Wilden movement itself. Markus Oehlen's complex, layered pictures are composed of a plethora of found images, shapes and distorted painterly elements which, taken out of their previous context, take on a new function and meaning. By rearranging the individual compositional elements of the canvasses in the context of art, Oehlen creates surreal still lifes that were not originally so intended, playing with the notion of randomness and suggesting strange narratives. The pictures on large canvasses convince through their radical approach to painting.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 1977 he meet [[Martin Kippenberger]].

It originated in the [[United States]] as a morning program block on the [[Disney Channel]]. Its programming was targeted at children ages 2\u20136, featuring a mix of live-action and [[list of animated television series|animated series]].\n\nThe Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel was rebranded as the [[Disney Junior]] block on Disney Channel on February 14, 2011. The 22 cable channels and blocks using the Playhouse Disney brand around the world were relaunched under the Disney Junior brand over the next two years, concluding with the rebranding of the Russian channel in November 2012.\n\n==History==\nPrior to Playhouse Disney's launch, Disney Channel had aired a lineup of preschool-targeted programs (which were mixed alongside animated series aimed at older children) during the morning hours since its debut in April 1983. On April 6, 1997, Disney Channel underwent a relaunch that signified the beginning of its full conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel, and its morning program block now utilized a similar graphics package for its promotions as that used for the channel's afternoon children's programs. After Disney Channel's preschool block premiered three new original series in 1998 (''[[PB&J Otter]]'', ''[[Rolie Polie Olie]]'', and ''[[Out of the Box (TV series)|Out of the Box]]''), the block rebranded as Playhouse Disney on February 1, 1999.\n\nOne of the Playhouse Disney block's most popular series was ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'', an educational live-action series from [[Jim Henson Productions]] that debuted in October 1997, focusing on the adventures of Bear (voice by [[Noel MacNeal]]); the series was named by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as one of the \"top 10 new shows for kids\" that year.<ref name=ks>{{cite news|last=Kidscreen Staff|title=A Salute to Disney Channel: Disney Channel time line|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21442-19980401/|accessdate=April 12, 2014|newspaper=KidScreen.com|date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> For the first three years of its run, the Playhouse Disney block originally aired each weekday from 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 2:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], and weekends from 6:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time. Following each program, which usually ran 23 minutes (most of which, with the exception of movies, aired without promotional interruption), the remainder of the time period was filled by either short segments and [[music video]]s (the latter of which were originally aired under the banner \"Feet Beat\") or an episode of an acquired short series.\n\nOn April 16, 2001, Playhouse Disney introduced a new on-air graphics package produced by motion graphics company Beehive;<ref>[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2002/June-1-2002/Opens-and-Logos.aspx Opens and Logos], ''Post Magazine'', June 1, 2002.</ref> actress [[Allyce Beasley]] began serving as the U.S. block's promo announcer at this time, a capacity she would hold until March 30, 2007.

On October 7, 2002, Playhouse Disney changed its logo to reflect Disney Channel's on-air rebranding. As part of the block's effort to phase out its older interstitial material, it introduced a mascot in September named Clay (voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]]), an anthropomorphic clay figure who often used the catchphrases \"It's true!\" and \"Are you with me?\".\n\nOn March 31, 2007, Clay was replaced by two anthropomorphic monkey puppets as the block's hosts, Ooh and Aah (who served as the main characters for one of the short series featured on the Playhouse Disney lineup, ''[[Ooh, Aah & You]]''). Beginning in 2007, Disney Channel began truncating the weekday block to four hours (from 5:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time) during the summer months, in order to air episodes of Disney Channel original series during the late morning and early afternoon hours; however, the weekend schedule continued to air as a seven-hour block. By this point, the Playhouse Disney block had expanded to air from 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays, and 4:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time on weekends, each running a different schedule.\n\n===Disney Junior===\n{{see also|Disney Junior}}\nOn May 26, 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced the launch of Disney Junior, a relaunching of Playhouse Disney that would serve as the brand for the Disney Channel block and a new standalone digital cable and satellite channel in the United States, as well as the new brand for the 22 existing Playhouse Disney-branded cable channels and program blocks worldwide.<ref name=\"PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/business/media/27disney.html?src=busln PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2010.</ref><ref name=\"EW\">[http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior SOAPnet Will Go Dark to Make Way for Disney Junior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527032646/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', May 26, 2010.</ref> The Playhouse Disney block ended its 14-year run on February 13, 2011, with the last program to air being an episode of the short series ''Handy Manny's School for Tools'' at 1:55&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Disney Junior block debuted on February 14, 2011,<ref>{{cite web |first=Christy|last=Grosz |url=https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/disney-junior-acing-frosh-year-1118043061/ |title=Disney Junior acing frosh year |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 26, 2011 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref> with ''[[Little Einsteins]]'' as its first program.<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart|last=Levine |url=https://variety.com/2010/scene/markets-festivals/doc-mcstuffins-set-for-disney-1118021002/ |title=\"Doc McStuffins\" Set for Disney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 24, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/disney-junior-to-debut-in-february-2011-on-disney-channel/ |title=Disney Junior to Debut In February 2011 on Disney Channel |publisher=Disney Junior |via=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=November 5, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sofia M.|last=Fernandez |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-junior-shifts-focus-educational-35845 |title=Disney Junior Shifts Focus Away From Educational Programming |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 4, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=None of these sources even mention ''Little Einsteins''.|date=September 2019}} Several former Playhouse Disney series were carried over to the relaunched block including ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', ''[[Imagination Movers (TV series)|Imagination Movers]]'', ''[[Handy Manny]]'', and ''[[Little Einsteins]]''.

television|satellite]] [[television channel]] that was owned by the [[Disney Channels Worldwide]] unit of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Disney\u2013ABC Television Group]]. It originated in the [[United States]] as a morning program block on the [[Disney Channel]]. Its programming was targeted at children ages 2\u20136, featuring a mix of live-action and [[list of animated television series|animated series]].\n\nThe Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel was rebranded as the [[Disney Junior]] block on Disney Channel on February 14, 2011. The 22 cable channels and blocks using the Playhouse Disney brand around the world were relaunched under the Disney Junior brand over the next two years, concluding with the rebranding of the Russian channel in November 2012.\n\n==History==\nPrior to Playhouse Disney's launch, Disney Channel had aired a lineup of preschool-targeted programs (which were mixed alongside animated series aimed at older children) during the morning hours since its debut in April 1983. On April 6, 1997, Disney Channel underwent a relaunch that signified the beginning of its full conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel, and its morning program block now utilized a similar graphics package for its promotions as that used for the channel's afternoon children's programs. After Disney Channel's preschool block premiered three new original series in 1998 (''[[PB&J Otter]]'', ''[[Rolie Polie Olie]]'', and ''[[Out of the Box (TV series)|Out of the Box]]''), the block rebranded as Playhouse Disney on February 1, 1999.\n\nOne of the Playhouse Disney block's most popular series was ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'', an educational live-action series from [[Jim Henson Productions]] that debuted in October 1997, focusing on the adventures of Bear (voice by [[Noel MacNeal]]); the series was named by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as one of the \"top 10 new shows for kids\" that year.<ref name=ks>{{cite news|last=Kidscreen Staff|title=A Salute to Disney Channel: Disney Channel time line|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21442-19980401/|accessdate=April 12, 2014|newspaper=KidScreen.com|date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> For the first three years of its run, the Playhouse Disney block originally aired each weekday from 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 2:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], and weekends from 6:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time. Following each program, which usually ran 23 minutes (most of which, with the exception of movies, aired without promotional interruption), the remainder of the time period was filled by either short segments and [[music video]]s (the latter of which were originally aired under the banner \"Feet Beat\") or an episode of an acquired short series.\n\nOn April 16, 2001, Playhouse Disney introduced a new on-air graphics package produced by motion graphics company Beehive;<ref>[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2002/June-1-2002/Opens-and-Logos.aspx Opens and Logos], ''Post Magazine'', June 1, 2002.</ref> actress [[Allyce Beasley]] began serving as the U.S. block's promo announcer at this time, a capacity she would hold until March 30, 2007. [[Radio Disney]] [[cross-promotion|cross-promoted]] the block by rebranding its \"Mickey and Minnie's Tune Time\" block as \"Playhouse Disney\", and in 2002, the TV block's \"Feet Beat\" interstitials were renamed \"[[B. B. Good|B.B.]]'s Music Time\" to promote the Radio Disney block. On June 25, 2001, Disney-ABC Cable Networks Group (now Disney-ABC Television Group) announced plans to launch Playhouse Disney Channel, a companion [[digital cable]] and satellite channel that would have served the same target audience as the Disney Channel block;<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624034312/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76166895.html Play nice now; Walt Disney Co. plans to introduce Playhouse Disney Channel], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'' (via HighBeam Research), June 25, 2001.</ref><ref name=wsj>{{cite news|last1=Beatty|first1=Sally|title=Disney Plans to Launch New Cable Network, Aiming Programming at Preschool Audience|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB993071891973180362|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=June 21, 2001}}</ref> plans for the network were later scrapped, although Disney-ABC International Television would launch dedicated Playhouse Disney Channels in international markets (including [[Canada]] and [[Latin America]]) between 2002 and 2007. The Walt Disney Company acquired the broadcast rights to ''[[The Wiggles]]'' as part of their purchase of the [[Fox Family Channel]] in 2001; ''The Wiggles'' moved to Playhouse Disney in June 2002 and became one of the block's most watched shows during its run.\n\nLike Disney Channel, Playhouse Disney was a commercial-free service, but it did show short \"promotional spots\" (structured as short-form segments for Disney products targeted at the block's demographics) along with \u2013 beginning in 2002 \u2013 [[underwriting|underwriter sponsorships]] (with companies such as [[McDonald's]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oei|first1=Lily|title=Nick's Noggin nabs sponsors|url=https://variety.com/2004/tv/news/nick-s-noggin-nabs-sponsors-1117897987/|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Variety|date=January 7, 2004}}</ref>) within breaks between programs<ref>{{cite web | title = Playhouse Disney schedule | url = http://tv.disney.go.com/playhouse/grown-ups/tvschedule.html | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}</ref> (preschool-targeted programs that aired between 3:00 and 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Central Time outside of the Playhouse Disney banner, included the promotional shorts for Disney entertainment products that were seen during Disney Channel's afternoon and nighttime schedule). On October 7, 2002, Playhouse Disney changed its logo to reflect Disney Channel's on-air rebranding. As part of the block's effort to phase out its older interstitial material, it introduced a mascot in September named Clay (voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]]), an anthropomorphic clay figure who often used the catchphrases \"It's true!\" and \"Are you with me?\".\n\nOn March 31, 2007, Clay was replaced by two anthropomorphic monkey puppets as the block's hosts, Ooh and Aah (who served as the main characters for one of the short series featured on the Playhouse Disney lineup, ''[[Ooh, Aah & You]]''). Beginning in 2007, Disney Channel began truncating the weekday block to four hours (from 5:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time) during the summer months, in order to air episodes of Disney Channel original series during the late morning and early afternoon hours; however, the weekend schedule continued to air as a seven-hour block. By this point, the Playhouse Disney block had expanded to air from 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays, and 4:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time on weekends, each running a different schedule.\n\n===Disney Junior===\n{{see also|Disney Junior}}\nOn May 26, 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced the launch of Disney Junior, a relaunching of Playhouse Disney that would serve as the brand for the Disney Channel block and a new standalone digital cable and satellite channel in the United States, as well as the new brand for the 22 existing Playhouse Disney-branded cable channels and program blocks worldwide.<ref name=\"PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/business/media/27disney.html?src=busln PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2010.</ref><ref name=\"EW\">[http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior SOAPnet Will Go Dark to Make Way for Disney Junior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527032646/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', May 26, 2010.</ref> The Playhouse Disney block ended its 14-year run on February 13, 2011, with the last program to air being an episode of the short series ''Handy Manny's School for Tools'' at 1:55&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Disney Junior block debuted on February 14, 2011,<ref>{{cite web |first=Christy|last=Grosz |url=https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/disney-junior-acing-frosh-year-1118043061/ |title=Disney Junior acing frosh year |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 26, 2011 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref> with ''[[Little Einsteins]]'' as its first program.<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart|last=Levine |url=https://variety.com/2010/scene/markets-festivals/doc-mcstuffins-set-for-disney-1118021002/ |title=\"Doc McStuffins\" Set for Disney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 24, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/disney-junior-to-debut-in-february-2011-on-disney-channel/ |title=Disney Junior to Debut In February 2011 on Disney Channel |publisher=Disney Junior |via=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=November 5, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sofia M.|last=Fernandez |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-junior-shifts-focus-educational-35845 |title=Disney Junior Shifts Focus Away From Educational Programming |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 4, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=None of these sources even mention ''Little Einsteins''.|date=September 2019}} Several former Playhouse Disney series were carried over to the relaunched block including ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', ''[[Imagination Movers (TV series)|Imagination Movers]]'', ''[[Handy Manny]]'', and ''[[Little Einsteins]]''.

These numbers included cartoon studio production numbers, [[Vitaphone]] release numbers, [[List of Warner Bros. cartoons with Blue Ribbon reissues|Blue Ribbon]] re-release numbers, and [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] certificate numbers. Not all of these types of numbers were listed in the title cards of every cartoon and the numbering schemes were sometimes inconsistent. For example, until 1943 cartoons listed Vitaphone release numbers but not cartoon studio production numbers. These release numbers, in turn, increased to 9999 but then restarted at 1. Complicating matters was the Warner Bros. Blue Ribbon re-release program, in which some cartoons were re-released in theaters with new title cards that often removed original production credits and substituted production or release numbers with new re-release numbers. In many cases, the Blue Ribbon releases are the only available prints of a cartoon, making it challenging to discern these cartoons' correct original production information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/fieldguide.html |title=Field Guide To Titles And Credits |last=Mackey |first=Dave |date=2013-03-26 |access-date=2016-08-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326071004/http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/fieldguide.html |archivedate=2013-03-26 }}</ref>\n\n'''In the list below, Blue Ribbon re-release numbers are noted with \"BR\" and Vitaphone release numbers are noted with \"VP\".'''\n\n==1950==\nStarting this year, all cartoons are in Technicolor.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5px;\" | #\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Animator\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 200px;\" | Characters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Identification Numbers\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Identification Numbers (BR)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" | Release date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 400px;\" | Availability\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | {{blue ribbon}} reissue?\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" | Reissue release date\n!Notes\n|-\n|578\n|''[[Home Tweet Home]]''\n|[[Merrie Melodies|MM]]\n|[[Friz Freleng|I.

These numbers included cartoon studio production numbers, [[Vitaphone]] release numbers, [[List of Warner Bros. cartoons with Blue Ribbon reissues|Blue Ribbon]] re-release numbers, and [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] certificate numbers. Not all of these types of numbers were listed in the title cards of every cartoon and the numbering schemes were sometimes inconsistent. For example, until 1943 cartoons listed Vitaphone release numbers but not cartoon studio production numbers. These release numbers, in turn, increased to 9999 but then restarted at 1. Complicating matters was the Warner Bros. Blue Ribbon re-release program, in which some cartoons were re-released in theaters with new title cards that often removed original production credits and substituted production or release numbers with new re-release numbers. In many cases, the Blue Ribbon releases are the only available prints of a cartoon, making it challenging to discern these cartoons' correct original production information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/fieldguide.html |title=Field Guide To Titles And Credits |last=Mackey |first=Dave |date=2013-03-26 |access-date=2016-08-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326071004/http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/fieldguide.html |archivedate=2013-03-26 }}</ref>\n\n'''In the list below, Blue Ribbon re-release numbers are noted with \"BR\" and Vitaphone release numbers are noted with \"VP\".'''\n\n==1950==\nStarting this year, all cartoons are in Technicolor.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5px;\" | #\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Animator\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 200px;\" | Characters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Identification Numbers\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Identification Numbers (BR)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" | Release date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 400px;\" | Availability\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | {{blue ribbon}} reissue?\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" | Reissue release date\n!Notes\n|-\n|578\n|''[[Home Tweet Home]]''\n|[[Merrie Melodies|MM]]\n|[[Friz Freleng|I.
