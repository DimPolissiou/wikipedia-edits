They were first domesticated in what is now [[Mexico]] and the [[Southern United States]].<ref>''Genetics, Genomics and Breeding of Sunflower'', (CRC Press, 8 Apr 2010)\nedited by Jinguo Hu, Gerald Seiler, C. Kole, page 8</ref><ref name=Hancock2012>''Plant Evolution and the Origin of Crop Species'', By James F. Hancock (CABI, 2012), page 188</ref>\nNative American peoples grew sunflowers as a crop from Mexico to Southern Canada.<ref name=Hancock2012/>\nIn the 16th century the first crop breeds were brought from America to Europe by explorers.<ref name=Hancock2012/>\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nSunflowers are usually tall [[annual plant|annual]] or perennial plants that in some species can grow to a height of {{convert|300|cm|in|abbr=on}} or more. They bear one or more wide, terminal [[pseudanthium|capitula]] (flower heads), with bright yellow ray [[florets]] at the outside and yellow or maroon (also known as a brown/red) disc florets inside. Several ornamental [[cultivars]] of ''H. annuus'' have red-colored ray florets; all of them stem from a single original mutant.<ref>Heiser, C.B. ''The Sunflower''. University of Oklahoma Press. 1981.</ref> During growth, sunflowers tilt during the day to face the sun but stop once they begin blooming. This tracking of the sun in young sunflower heads is called [[heliotropism]]. By the time they are mature, sunflowers generally face east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/sunflower-move-73855.html|title=How Does a Sunflower Move?|work=Home Guides \u2013 SF Gate|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018204852/http://homeguides.sfgate.com/sunflower-move-73855.html|archivedate=2014-10-18}}</ref> The rough and hairy [[Plant stem|stem]] is branched in the upper part in wild plants but is usually unbranched in domesticated cultivars.\n\nThe [[petiole (botany)|petiolate]] [[Leaf|leaves]] are dentate and often sticky. The lower leaves are opposite, [[Glossary of leaf morphology#ovate|ovate]], or often heart-shaped.\nThey are distinguished technically by the fact that the ray florets (when present) are sterile, and by the presence on the disk flowers of a [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] that is of two awn-like scales that are [[caducous]] (that is, easily detached and falling at maturity). Some species also have additional shorter scales in the pappus, and  one species lacks a pappus entirely. Another technical feature that distinguishes the genus more reliably, but requires a microscope to see, is the presence of a prominent, multicellular appendage at the apex of the style. Further, the florets of a sunflower are arranged in a natural [[Spiral#In_nature|spiral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geogebra.org/m/B4C9bbuy|title=Geogebra: Sunflowers are irrationally pretty|author=Ben Sparks}}</ref>\n\nVariability is seen among the perennial species that make up the bulk of those in the genus. Some have most or all of the large leaves in a rosette at the base of the plant and produce a flowering stem that has leaves that are reduced in size. Most of the perennials have disk flowers that are entirely yellow, but a few have disk flowers with reddish lobes. One species, ''H. radula'', lacks ray flowers altogether.\n\n''Helianthus'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of [[list of Lepidoptera that feed on Helianthus|many lepidopterans]]. The [[Sunflower seed|seeds]] of ''H. annuus'' are used as human food.\n\n===Growth stages===\nThe growth of a sunflower depends strictly on its genetic makeup and background.<ref name=\"Sunflower Production\">{{cite web |last1=Berglund |first1=Duane |title=Sunflower Production |url=https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/extensionentomology/recent-publications-main/publications/A-1331-sunflower-production-field-guide |website=ag,ndsu |publisher=NDSU Extension Service and N.D.

Sunflowers are usually planted in the extreme southern or northern regions of the country. Frequently, in the southern regions, sunflowers are grown in the beginning of rainy seasons, and soybeans can then be planted in the summer.<ref>{{cite document |last1=Castro |first1=C. |last2=Leite |first2=Regina |title=Main aspects of sunflower production in Brazil |id={{ProQuest|2036361008}} }}</ref> Researchers have concluded that the soybean-sunflower method of plantation could be further improved through changes in fertilizer use.

They were first domesticated in what is now [[Mexico]] and the [[Southern United States]].<ref>''Genetics, Genomics and Breeding of Sunflower'', (CRC Press, 8 Apr 2010)\nedited by Jinguo Hu, Gerald Seiler, C. Kole, page 8</ref><ref name=Hancock2012>''Plant Evolution and the Origin of Crop Species'', By James F. Hancock (CABI, 2012), page 188</ref>\nNative American peoples grew sunflowers as a crop from Mexico to Southern Canada.<ref name=Hancock2012/>\nIn the 16th century the first crop breeds were brought from America to Europe by explorers.<ref name=Hancock2012/>\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nSunflowers are usually tall [[annual plant|annual]] or perennial plants that in some species can grow to a height of {{convert|300|cm|in|abbr=on}} or more. They bear one or more wide, terminal [[pseudanthium|capitula]] (flower heads), with bright yellow ray [[florets]] at the outside and yellow or maroon (also known as a brown/red) disc florets inside. Several ornamental [[cultivars]] of ''H. annuus'' have red-colored ray florets; all of them stem from a single original mutant.<ref>Heiser, C.B. ''The Sunflower''. University of Oklahoma Press. 1981.</ref> During growth, sunflowers tilt during the day to face the sun but stop once they begin blooming. This tracking of the sun in young sunflower heads is called [[heliotropism]]. By the time they are mature, sunflowers generally face east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/sunflower-move-73855.html|title=How Does a Sunflower Move?|work=Home Guides \u2013 SF Gate|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018204852/http://homeguides.sfgate.com/sunflower-move-73855.html|archivedate=2014-10-18}}</ref> The rough and hairy [[Plant stem|stem]] is branched in the upper part in wild plants but is usually unbranched in domesticated cultivars.\n\nThe [[petiole (botany)|petiolate]] [[Leaf|leaves]] are dentate and often sticky. The lower leaves are opposite, [[Glossary of leaf morphology#ovate|ovate]], or often heart-shaped.\nThey are distinguished technically by the fact that the ray florets (when present) are sterile, and by the presence on the disk flowers of a [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] that is of two awn-like scales that are [[caducous]] (that is, easily detached and falling at maturity). Some species also have additional shorter scales in the pappus, and  one species lacks a pappus entirely. Another technical feature that distinguishes the genus more reliably, but requires a microscope to see, is the presence of a prominent, multicellular appendage at the apex of the style. Further, the florets of a sunflower are arranged in a natural [[Spiral#In_nature|spiral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geogebra.org/m/B4C9bbuy|title=Geogebra: Sunflowers are irrationally pretty|author=Ben Sparks}}</ref>\n\nVariability is seen among the perennial species that make up the bulk of those in the genus. Some have most or all of the large leaves in a rosette at the base of the plant and produce a flowering stem that has leaves that are reduced in size. Most of the perennials have disk flowers that are entirely yellow, but a few have disk flowers with reddish lobes. One species, ''H. radula'', lacks ray flowers altogether.\n\n''Helianthus'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of [[list of Lepidoptera that feed on Helianthus|many lepidopterans]]. The [[Sunflower seed|seeds]] of ''H. annuus'' are used as human food.\n\n===Growth stages===\nThe growth of a sunflower depends strictly on its genetic makeup and background.<ref name=\"Sunflower Production\">{{cite web |last1=Berglund |first1=Duane |title=Sunflower Production |url=https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/extensionentomology/recent-publications-main/publications/A-1331-sunflower-production-field-guide |website=ag,ndsu |publisher=NDSU Extension Service and N.D.

Kittu made her researches before the interview but Yuvraaj scolds her for not having enough information about Munna Babu's wife Maladevi. Kittu thought that she won't be given the chance for the interview but Yuvraaj once he made the decision he does not change it, therefore Kittu goes for the interview with Jogi who plans to trap Kittu, the innocent.\n\nKituu is born to be successful, and with her determination she climbs up the corporate ladder and becomes a household name in the field of electronic journalism. And to pursue her fields of work, she even reject a lover, the scion of a millionaire family, on realizing that he fails to understand her when it comes to her profession. However, as the story moves on, Kituu falls in love with a guy from the news channel, Yuvraaj. But, once successful in her field she is torn apart between Yuvraaj, a divorcee with a child and Rohan, her ex-lover who comes back in her life after a failed marriage.\n\nKituu does an investigation concerning a stealth aircraft and Rohan gets trapped as the one who tried to bribe the officials. Kituu gets Rohan jailed. But then, it is revealed that Rohan is innocent and was trapped by Samresh Gupta, the ex-lover of his mother, who is trying to take revenge from Rohan and his mother. Kituu does all her best to save Rohan and in the process, both get injured and end up in the hospital. On his part, Yuvvraj gets irritated on seeing Kituu's concern for Rohan and her getting close to him, as he had earlier proposed Kituu to marry him. The truth is finally revealed and before the police can arrest Samresh Gupta, he commits suicide.\n\nNNN, which became a respectable and famous News Channel, soon finds itself under financial crisis. In order to save the company, Balraj Sir decides to unemploys half of the staff and later even convince Yuvraaj, Kittu and Daksha. However, Kittu although being employed since much shorter time than others, her job stays intact as she is considered to be one of the backbones of NNN. This is misinterpreted by staffs who claimed that she is given the chance due to her closeness to Yuvraaj. Hearing all these, Kittu resigns from the job. As Rohan comes to know about Kittu's resignation and its reason, Rohan finance the Channel and becomes the boss.\n\nThe story takes a major twist when Nandini (Rohan's Ex-wife) comes back after so long. She stops Kittu and Rohan wedding. She wants to talk to Rohan privately. She narrates that they have a baby girl and so on. Rohan stops the marriage and confesses to everyone that he has a little child. He did not want the child to be deprived of a father's love. So, Kittu heart-brokenly tells Rohan to get married to Nandini and take care of the child (Pihu). Nandini wants to separate Rohan and Kittu. She does not want Kittu to come in between Rohan and Pihu. Rohan's mother wants to stops the marriage. Rohan still misses Kittu. He persuades her to marry him and not to Nandini. But, Kittu refuses and convinces Rohan to marry Nandini.

Kittu's family were their when they learn the truth from Neil that Kittu was burn. ROhanika pleads for forgiveness with her husband and father-in-law. She realises all her mistakes and ask for a last chance to prove to be a good daughter-in-law. Then, she meets Kittu and also asks her for forgiveness. Later on, Nandini came and meets Kittu and also instigate Kittu's father for Neil and Kittu. When Rohan meets Kittu, her father ask him to stop meeting Kittu and let her daughter live in peace with Neil. Hearing this, Rohan was totally shattered and promise that he will not interfere in Kittu's life. Kittu's father tells her that Neil is a good boy and he will keep her happy. Kittu cries a lot thinking of Rohan. Her colleague, Prabhakar, came and meet her. Kittu narrates all the problems with him. Then, he opines Kittu that she should talk with Neil about this matter. At the same time Neil comes in the room. He confesses his love for Kittu and Kittue accepts to marry him. Rohan decides to do a court marriage with Nandini. On that day, Rohan receives a letter and a CD from a well-wisher.

It was released as the third single from her third [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009). Co-written and produced by herself and [[RedOne|Nadir \"RedOne\" Khayat]], the song was inspired by her \"Fear of Men Monster\", and the lyrics portray Gaga bidding farewell to her lovers. Musically, it is a mid-tempo [[synth-pop]] song with a [[Europop]] beat.\n\nContemporary critics predominantly gave \"Alejandro\" positive reviews and noted that it takes influence from the pop acts [[ABBA]] and [[Ace of Base]]. The song charted in the United Kingdom and Hungary due to digital sales following the album's release. Upon release, \"Alejandro\" charted again in the United Kingdom as well as in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United States while topping the Czech, Finnish, Mexican, Venezuelan, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, and Romanian charts. \"Alejandro\" became Gaga's seventh successive single to reach the top-ten of the US  [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nThe accompanying music video was directed by fashion photographer [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]] and inspired by Gaga's love for her gay friends and admiration of gay love. Within the video, Gaga dances with a group of soldiers in a cabaret, interspersed with scenes of Gaga as a nun swallowing a rosary and near-naked men holding machine guns. The music video was controversial and received mixed reviews. Critics complimented its idea and dark nature while the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] criticized Gaga for alleged [[blasphemy]], despite Klein dismissing the idea and claiming that the scene in question (the swallowing of [[Rosary beads]]) was Gaga's \"desire to take in the Holy\".<ref name=\"holy\"/> Gaga performed the song on the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' and has performed it on all dates of [[The Monster Ball Tour]] and on all subsequent tours to date.\n\n==Composition and release==\nGaga co-wrote and co-produced \"Alejandro\" with RedOne.

It was released as the third single from her third [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009). Co-written and produced by herself and [[RedOne|Nadir \"RedOne\" Khayat]], the song was inspired by her \"Fear of Men Monster\", and the lyrics portray Gaga bidding farewell to her lovers. Musically, it is a mid-tempo [[synth-pop]] song with a [[Europop]] beat.\n\nContemporary critics predominantly gave \"Alejandro\" positive reviews and noted that it takes influence from the pop acts [[ABBA]] and [[Ace of Base]]. The song charted in the United Kingdom and Hungary due to digital sales following the album's release. Upon release, \"Alejandro\" charted again in the United Kingdom as well as in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United States while topping the Czech, Finnish, Mexican, Venezuelan, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, and Romanian charts. \"Alejandro\" became Gaga's seventh successive single to reach the top-ten of the US  [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nThe accompanying music video was directed by fashion photographer [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]] and inspired by Gaga's love for her gay friends and admiration of gay love. Within the video, Gaga dances with a group of soldiers in a cabaret, interspersed with scenes of Gaga as a nun swallowing a rosary and near-naked men holding machine guns. The music video was controversial and received mixed reviews. Critics complimented its idea and dark nature while the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] criticized Gaga for alleged [[blasphemy]], despite Klein dismissing the idea and claiming that the scene in question (the swallowing of [[Rosary beads]]) was Gaga's \"desire to take in the Holy\".<ref name=\"holy\"/> Gaga performed the song on the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' and has performed it on all dates of [[The Monster Ball Tour]] and on all subsequent tours to date.\n\n==Composition and release==\nGaga co-wrote and co-produced \"Alejandro\" with RedOne.

A quarrel then arose between Gaga and her label where \"Alejandro\" was ultimately chosen to be released. Through her account on [[Twitter]], the singer remarked on the decision, \"Alejandro is on the radio.
