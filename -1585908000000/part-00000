{"title_page": "List of career achievements by Rafael Nadal", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=December 2010}}\n{{Lead too long|date=May 2018}}\nThis article lists various career, tournament, and seasonal achievements by the Spanish tennis player '''[[Rafael Nadal]]'''.\n[[File:Rafael Nadal 2011 Roland Garros 2011.jpg|thumb|160px|Rafael Nadal]]\n\nRafael Nadal has won 19 Grand Slam singles titles which ranks him [[All-time tennis records \u2013 men's singles#Grand Slam Majors|second on the all-time list]] only to [[Roger Federer]]\u2019s record of 20 majors. Nadal has also won a record [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000#Most titles|35 Masters 1000 titles]].\n\nNadal has appeared in 27 Grand Slam finals which is second only to Federer\u2019s record of 31 finals.  He has appeared in at least five finals at each major (a feat equaled only by Federer) and has won multiple majors on hard, grass, and clay courts,  the latter of which distinguishes him from his contemporaries as Federer and Djokovic have both managed only 1 clay slam each.  Nadal completed the Career Grand Slam and the Career Golden Slam, becoming the youngest player in the Open Era to achieve this feat, having won all four majors and the Olympic title by the age of {{Age in years, months and days|1986|6|3|2010|9|13}}.\n\nKnown as the ''\u201cKing of Clay\u201d'', Nadal won the [[French Open]] 9 times in his first 10 attempts, with a match record of 66-1 (98.5% win rate), and is viewed by many analysts as one of the greatest feats in the Open Era. Nadal won the French Open on his first attempt as a 19-year-old in 2005 and went on to make three consecutive title defences from 2005 to 2008; he defeated then world No. 1 Roger Federer in three consecutive finals from 2006 to 2008 (he also defeated Federer in the 2005 semi-finals) and again in the 2011 final (Nadal is the only player to defeat Federer in four finals at the same major.  Nadal is also the only player to beat Federer in the finals of 3 different grand slams, the French Open, the Australian Open, and Wimbledon). His sole loss at the French Open during this period came at the hands of Sweden's [[Robin S\u00f6derling]] in 2009 in the round of 16. Nadal then went on to avenge his loss to S\u00f6derling by defeating him in the 2010 French Open final, and then notched four consecutive title defences from 2011 to 2014 (an Open Era record).  Rafa furthered his legend in history when he won \"La Decima\", a 10th title in Paris in 2017, where he didn't drop a set and lost only 35 games, only three shy of Borg's record of 32 games lost. He holds a match record of 93\u20132 at the French Open (never taken to five sets in the final) from 2005 to 2019 achieving a win percentage of 97.9%, and is the only player to achieve this type of dominance at any single Grand Slam tournament. Nadal won the French Open an all-time record of 12 times and is the first, and only, player in history, male or female, to win 12 grand slams at a single major (no other male player has won more than 8 titles at a single major in the Open Era). Additionally, Nadal is 25-0 in best of 5 matches on clay at other events, bringing his total match record in best of 5 on clay to 118-2, a win percentage of 98.3%. Nadal didn't lose a single semifinal on clay courts for 12 years (52-0) from the [[2003 Croatia Open \u2013 Singles|2003 Croatia Open]] (lost to [[Carlos Moya]]) to the [[2015 Rio Open \u2013 Men's Singles|2015 Rio Open]] (lost to [[Fabio Fognini]]).<ref>https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/31573452 . Retrieved 20 August 2019</ref>\n\nNadal has won all-time records of 35 [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|Masters 1000]] titles, 25 clay Masters 1000 titles, 12 Grand Slam singles titles, as well as an Open Era record 59 titles on clay. He won at least 1 Masters 1000 title for ten consecutive years from 2005 to 2014 and is the only player to achieve this type of consistency in the Open Era. He owns the Open era records of most consecutive years of winning 1+ ATP singles titles (17 years from 2004-2020) and most consecutive years of winning 2+ ATP singles titles (15 years from 2005-2019). He owns the longest single surface win streak by a male having won 81 consecutive matches on clay courts from 2005 to 2007, 16 better than Federer's record on grass, and 25 better than Federer's  record on hard courts. Nadal also won a record 8 consecutive Monte Carlo Masters 1000 titles from 2005 to 2012, and a record overall 11 titles including his three-peat from 2016 to 2018.  Nadal has also won an all-time record 9 Masters 1000 titles in Rome, and 11 titles at the ATP 500 Barcelona Open. In 2010, Nadal won the French Open plus all three clay court Masters 1000 events (Monte Carlo, Rome, Madrid) in the same calendar year, thus becoming the first, and only, player to complete the '''\"Clay Slam\"'''.\n\nNadal won at least one Grand Slam tournament for 10 consecutive years (2005 \u2013 2014) having broken the previous men's record of 8 consecutive years. He holds the record for most titles at 3 different ATP Tour levels: ATP500 (Barcelona-11), Masters 1000 (Monte Carlo-11), and Grand Slams (French Open-12).\n\nNadal\u2019s success does not hold strictly to the clay courts.  Over the course of his career, he has won 400+ hard court matches as well as 400+ clay court matches.  He is the only player, regardless of gender, to have recorded 400+ match wins on both hard and clay courts.  He has won 468 matches on hard courts, which is fifth in the Open Era behind only [[Roger Federer]], [[Andre Agassi]], [[Novak Djokovic]], and [[Jimmy Connors]]. He has won 5 hard court Grand Slam titles, which makes him fifth place all-time behind only Federer, Djokovic, [[Pete Sampras]], and Agassi. He has achieved considerable success on hard courts and grass courts, obtaining multiple Grand Slams outside of the French Open having won 1 Australian Open (hard), 2 Wimbledon (grass), and 4 US Open (hard) titles.  This fact sets him apart from the other Career Grand Slam winners as none of them have won multiple slams on clay, hard, and grass courts (Federer, Djokovic, and Agassi each only have 1 clay slam & Laver never played on hard courts).  Furthermore, Nadal is the second Spaniard to win Wimbledon, and in 2008 he became only the third player in the Open Era, after Rod Laver in 1969 & Bjorn Borg in 1980, to win the French Open and Wimbledon crowns in the same year, also known as the '''\"Channel Slam\"''', which he would repeat in 2010 (Federer would join the club in 2009).  Nadal is the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open and the first male player in the Open Era to simultaneously hold Grand Slams on clay, grass and hard courts which he has achieved three times (French Open 2008-Wimbledon 2008-Australian Open 2009, French Open 2010-Wimbledon 2010-US Open 2010, and Wimbledon 2010-US Open 2010-French Open 2011) Federer joined the club twice (US Open 2008-French Open 2009-Wimbledon 2009 and French Open 2009-Wimbledon 2009-Australian Open 2010) Djokovic also joined the club once (Wimbledon 2015-US Open 2015-Australian Open 2016-French Open 2016). Nadal is the only male player in tennis history to win the French Open and the US Open in the same calendar year four times (2010, 2013, 2017, 2019). Nadal won the Olympic gold medal in singles in Beijing (2008) on hard courts (defeating Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals), the Olympic gold medal in men's doubles in Rio de Janeiro (2016), and has won 10 Masters 1000 titles [spread out over four different tournaments. He won 5 Canada, 3 Indian Wells, 1 Cincinnati, 1 Madrid indoor (2005)]. Nadal dominated the North American hard court season in 2013, having already won the Indian Wells title earlier in the year, he would win his first 26 matches on hard courts by winning the [[2013 Rogers Cup \u2013 Men's Singles|Canadian Masters]], [[2013 Western & Southern Open \u2013 Men's Singles|Cincinnati Masters]] as well as the [[2013 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|US Open]], thus joining [[Patrick Rafter]] (1998) and [[Andy Roddick]] (2003) in completing the '''\"Summer Slam\"''' [winning the Canada Masters, Cincy Masters, and the US Open in the same calendar year, something only 3 men have accomplished].\n\nNadal was ATP year-end number 1 in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 2019, tied for second all-time with Connors, Federer, and Djokovic. He is the oldest year-end number 1 and the first man to be year-end number 1 twice after turning 30 years old (2017 and 2019). The gap between his first and most recent year-end number 1 is 11 years, another ATP record. He is the first male player to be year-end number 1 in five non-consecutive years. The razor-thin margin between him and the #2 ranked player, Novak Djokovic, in 2013 was 770 ranking points and in 2019 was 840 ranking points.\n\nNadal also owns the Open era record of most consecutive years qualifying for the year-end [[ATP Finals]] at 15 years in a row. Nadal has the Open Era record for [[Open Era tennis records \u2013 men's singles#Matches played, won, win rate|best career winning percentage (minimum 500 wins)]] at 83.21% (977-197 record), ahead of [[Novak Djokovic|Novak Djokovic's]] 82.68% winning percentage.\n\nIn 2020, Rafael Nadal is also the first and only player that has been ranked ATP world number one in three different decades, in the 2000s, 2010s & 2020s\n\n==All time tournament records==\n* These records were attained since the amateur era (1877) and the Open Era of tennis (1968).\n* Records in ''italics'' are currently active streaks.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tournament\n!Since\n!Record accomplished\n!Players tied\n|-\n| rowspan=\"20\" |[[Overall tennis tournaments records and statistics#Most consecutive titles at a particular tournament|'''Grand Slams''']]\n| rowspan=\"20\" |1877\n|French Open (12) -

player '''[[Rafael Nadal]]'''.\n[[File:Rafael Nadal 2011 Roland Garros 2011.jpg|thumb|160px|Rafael Nadal]]\n\nRafael Nadal has won 19 Grand Slam singles titles which ranks him [[All-time tennis records \u2013 men's singles#Grand Slam Majors|second on the all-time list]] only to [[Roger Federer]]\u2019s record of 20 majors. Nadal has also won a record [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000#Most titles|35 Masters 1000 titles]].\n\nNadal has appeared in 27 Grand Slam finals which is second only to Federer\u2019s record of 31 finals.  He has appeared in at least five finals at each major (a feat equaled only by Federer) and has won multiple majors on hard, grass, and clay courts,  the latter of which distinguishes him from his contemporaries as Federer and Djokovic have both managed only 1 clay slam each.  Nadal completed the Career Grand Slam and the Career Golden Slam, becoming the youngest player in the Open Era to achieve this feat, having won all four majors and the Olympic title by the age of {{Age in years, months and days|1986|6|3|2010|9|13}}.\n\nKnown as the ''\u201cKing of Clay\u201d'', Nadal won the [[French Open]] 9 times in his first 10 attempts, with a match record of 66-1 (98.5% win rate), and is viewed by many analysts as one of the greatest feats in the Open Era. Nadal won the French Open on his first attempt as a 19-year-old in 2005 and went on to make three consecutive title defences from 2005 to 2008; he defeated then world No. 1 Roger Federer in three consecutive finals from 2006 to 2008 (he also defeated Federer in the 2005 semi-finals) and again in the 2011 final (Nadal is the only player to defeat Federer in four finals at the same major.  Nadal is also the only player to beat Federer in the finals of 3 different grand slams, the French Open, the Australian Open, and Wimbledon). His sole loss at the French Open during this period came at the hands of Sweden's [[Robin S\u00f6derling]] in 2009 in the round of 16. Nadal then went on to avenge his loss to S\u00f6derling by defeating him in the 2010 French Open final, and then notched four consecutive title defences from 2011 to 2014 (an Open Era record).  Rafa furthered his legend in history when he won \"La Decima\", a 10th title in Paris in 2017, where he didn't drop a set and lost only 35 games, only three shy of Borg's record of 32 games lost. He holds a match record of 93\u20132 at the French Open (never taken to five sets in the final) from 2005 to 2019 achieving a win percentage of 97.9%, and is the only player to achieve this type of dominance at any single Grand Slam tournament. Nadal won the French Open an all-time record of 12 times and is the first, and only, player in history, male or female, to win 12 grand slams at a single major (no other male player has won more than 8 titles at a single major in the Open Era). Additionally, Nadal is 25-0 in best of 5 matches on clay at other events, bringing his total match record in best of 5 on clay to 118-2, a win percentage of 98.3%. Nadal didn't lose a single semifinal on clay courts for 12 years (52-0) from the [[2003 Croatia Open \u2013 Singles|2003 Croatia Open]] (lost to [[Carlos Moya]]) to the [[2015 Rio Open \u2013 Men's Singles|2015 Rio Open]] (lost to [[Fabio Fognini]]).<ref>https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/31573452 . Retrieved 20 August 2019</ref>\n\nNadal has won all-time records of 35 [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|Masters 1000]] titles, 25 clay Masters 1000 titles, 12 Grand Slam singles titles, as well as an Open Era record 59 titles on clay. He won at least 1 Masters 1000 title for ten consecutive years from 2005 to 2014 and is the only player to achieve this type of consistency in the Open Era. He owns the Open era records of most consecutive years of winning 1+ ATP singles titles (17 years from 2004-2020) and most consecutive years of winning 2+ ATP singles titles (15 years from 2005-2019). He owns the longest single surface win streak by a male having won 81 consecutive matches on clay courts from 2005 to 2007, 16 better than Federer's record on grass, and 25 better than Federer's  record on hard courts. Nadal also won a record 8 consecutive Monte Carlo Masters 1000 titles from 2005 to 2012, and a record overall 11 titles including his three-peat from 2016 to 2018.  Nadal has also won an all-time record 9 Masters 1000 titles in Rome, and 11 titles at the ATP 500 Barcelona Open. In 2010, Nadal won the French Open plus all three clay court Masters 1000 events (Monte Carlo, Rome, Madrid) in the same calendar year, thus becoming the first, and only, player to complete the '''\"Clay Slam\"'''.\n\nNadal won at least one Grand Slam tournament for 10 consecutive years (2005 \u2013 2014) having broken the previous men's record of 8 consecutive years. He holds the record for most titles at 3 different ATP Tour levels: ATP500 (Barcelona-11), Masters 1000 (Monte Carlo-11), and Grand Slams (French Open-12).\n\nNadal\u2019s success does not hold strictly to the clay courts.  Over the course of his career, he has won 400+ hard court matches as well as 400+ clay court matches.  He is the only player, regardless of gender, to have recorded 400+ match wins on both hard and clay courts.  He has won 468 matches on hard courts, which is fifth in the Open Era behind only [[Roger Federer]], [[Andre Agassi]], [[Novak Djokovic]], and [[Jimmy Connors]]. He has won 5 hard court Grand Slam titles, which makes him fifth place all-time behind only Federer, Djokovic, [[Pete Sampras]], and Agassi. He has achieved considerable success on hard courts and grass courts, obtaining multiple Grand Slams outside of the French Open having won 1 Australian Open (hard), 2 Wimbledon (grass), and 4 US Open (hard) titles.  This fact sets him apart from the other Career Grand Slam winners as none of them have won multiple slams on clay, hard, and grass courts (Federer, Djokovic, and Agassi each only have 1 clay slam & Laver never played on hard courts).  Furthermore, Nadal is the second Spaniard to win Wimbledon, and in 2008 he became only the third player in the Open Era, after Rod Laver in 1969 & Bjorn Borg in 1980, to win the French Open and Wimbledon crowns in the same year, also known as the '''\"Channel Slam\"''', which he would repeat in 2010 (Federer would join the club in 2009).  Nadal is the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open and the first male player in the Open Era to simultaneously hold Grand Slams on clay, grass and hard courts which he has achieved three times (French Open 2008-Wimbledon 2008-Australian Open 2009, French Open 2010-Wimbledon 2010-US Open 2010, and Wimbledon 2010-US Open 2010-French Open 2011) Federer joined the club twice (US Open 2008-French Open 2009-Wimbledon 2009 and French Open 2009-Wimbledon 2009-Australian Open 2010) Djokovic also joined the club once (Wimbledon 2015-US Open 2015-Australian Open 2016-French Open 2016). Nadal is the only male player in tennis history to win the French Open and the US Open in the same calendar year four times (2010, 2013, 2017, 2019). Nadal won the Olympic gold medal in singles in Beijing (2008) on hard courts (defeating Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals), the Olympic gold medal in men's doubles in Rio de Janeiro (2016), and has won 10 Masters 1000 titles [spread out over four different tournaments. He won 5 Canada, 3 Indian Wells, 1 Cincinnati, 1 Madrid indoor (2005)]. Nadal dominated the North American hard court season in 2013, having already won the Indian Wells title earlier in the year, he would win his first 26 matches on hard courts by winning the [[2013 Rogers Cup \u2013 Men's Singles|Canadian Masters]], [[2013 Western & Southern Open \u2013 Men's Singles|Cincinnati Masters]] as well as the [[2013 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|US Open]], thus joining [[Patrick Rafter]] (1998) and [[Andy Roddick]] (2003) in completing the '''\"Summer Slam\"''' [winning the Canada Masters, Cincy Masters, and the US Open in the same calendar year, something only 3 men have accomplished].\n\nNadal was ATP year-end number 1 in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 2019, tied for second all-time with Connors, Federer, and Djokovic. He is the oldest year-end number 1 and the first man to be year-end number 1 twice after turning 30 years old (2017 and 2019). The gap between his first and most recent year-end number 1 is 11 years, another ATP record. He is the first male player to be year-end number 1 in five non-consecutive years. The razor-thin margin between him and the #2 ranked player, Novak Djokovic, in 2013 was 770 ranking points and in 2019 was 840 ranking points.\n\nNadal also owns the Open era record of most consecutive years qualifying for the year-end [[ATP Finals]] at 15 years in a row. Nadal has the Open Era record for [[Open Era tennis records \u2013 men's singles#Matches played, won, win rate|best career winning percentage (minimum 500 wins)]] at 83.21% (977-197 record), ahead of [[Novak Djokovic|Novak Djokovic's]] 82.68% winning percentage.\n\nIn 2020, Rafael Nadal is also the first and only player that has been ranked ATP world number one in three different decades, in the 2000\u2019s, 2010\u2019s & 2020\u2019s\n\n==All time tournament records==\n* These records were attained since the amateur era (1877) and the Open Era of tennis (1968).\n* Records in ''italics'' are currently active streaks.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tournament\n!Since\n!Record accomplished\n!Players tied\n|-\n| rowspan=\"20\" |[[Overall tennis tournaments records and statistics#Most consecutive titles at a particular tournament|'''Grand Slams''']]\n| rowspan=\"20\" |1877\n|French Open (12) -

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was formed on 12 February 1950 by 23 broadcasting organisations from Europe and the Mediterranean at a conference in Devon, United Kingdom. It was on 6 June 1954, that Montreux became the venue for the first transmission by the EBU's Eurovision Network of the Narcissus Festival and its flower-bedecked procession floats. At Monaco, in late January 1955, this committee, chaired by Marcel Bezen\u00e7on, director general of Swiss Television, came up with the idea of creating a song contest, inspired by the very popular San Remo Festival. The idea was approved by the EBU General Assembly in Rome on 19 October 1955, and it was decided that the first \"Eurovision Grand Prix\" \u2013 so baptised, incidentally, by a British journalist \u2013 would take place in spring 1956 at Lugano, Switzerland.}}</ref> At a committee meeting held in Monaco in January 1955 with [[Marcel Bezen\u00e7on]] of the Swiss television as chairman, the committee conceived the idea (initially proposed by [[Sergio Pugliese]] of the Italian broadcaster [[RAI]]) of an international song contest where countries would participate in one television programme to be transmitted simultaneously across all countries of the union.<ref name=\"bristol\" /><ref name=\"GoldenJubilee\">{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Jaquin |date=1 December 2004 |url=http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811033906/http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 August 2004 |title=Eurovision's Golden Jubilee |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |accessdate=18 July 2009 }}</ref> The competition was based upon the existing [[Sanremo Music Festival]] held in Italy<ref>{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]] |year=2003 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224074456/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history/ |archivedate=24 December 2007 |title=History of Eurovision |accessdate=20 July 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> and was seen as a technological experiment in [[live television]].

However, in the new millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.<ref name=\"Euroclub\"/>\n\n== Rules ==\n{{Further|Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nNumerous detailed rules must be observed by the participating nations, and a new version is produced each year, for instance the rules specify various deadlines, including the date by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the EBU. The rules also cover sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re-transmit the show. The most notable rules which affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed over the years, and are highlighted here.\n\n=== Live music ===\nAll vocals must be sung live; no voices are permitted on the backing tracks.<ref name=\"RULES\"/> In 1999, [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999|the Croatian song]] performed by [[Doris Dragovi\u0107]] and composed by [[Ton\u010di Hulji\u0107]] featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.<ref name=\"ESC1999\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1999|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231130541/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1956 until 1998, the host country was required to provide a live orchestra. Before 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded, non-vocal backing tracks were permitted\u2014although the host country was still obliged to provide a live orchestra to give participants a choice. If a backing track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\nIn 1999 the requirement for a live orchestra was removed: it was left as an optional contribution.<ref name=\"1999rules\"/> The host that year, Israel's [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], decided not to use an orchestra to save expenses, and thus 1999 was the first year when all the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in conjunction with live vocals).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Languages in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nEach submission must have vocals; purely instrumental music has never been allowed. In the past, competitors have been required to sing in one of their own national languages, but this rule has been changed several times over the years. From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. In 1966, a rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, after Sweden was the first country to not sing in their own language, with opera singer [[Ingvar Wixell]] performing [[Absent Friend|Sweden's 1965 entry]] in English.<ref name=\"milestones\"/> The Swedish-language version of the song was originally selected at [[Melodifestivalen 1965]], but it was later translated into English for the Eurovision contest.\n\nThe language restriction continued until 1973, when performers were again allowed to sing in any language they wished.<ref name=\"ESC1973\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1973|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523025310/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Several winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of this: performers from non-English-speaking countries sang in English, including [[ABBA]] in 1974.

Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over [[telephone line]]s; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the [[Eiffel Tower]] or an Italian presenter might be seen with the [[Colosseum]] in the background.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1999, some countries did not have their spokesperson in front of a backdrop of a famous place, instead opting to show the spokesperson in the studio or in a famous building, for example when Malta presented their votes from a hotel in the country in 1995, or have them standing behind a blurred image of the famous building or skyline. From the 2000s, new technology meant that the spokespersons could be standing behind a live video of a famous place in that country. There have also been occasions where the backdrop of the spokesperson is not a still image or video, but instead is a slideshow of multiple shots of many of that country's famous buildings.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, the participating countries were called in reverse order of the presentation of their songs, and from 1963 to 2003, they were called in the same order in which their songs had been presented (except for 1974). Since 2004, when semi-finals were introduced, the order of the countries' announcements of votes has changed; and the countries that did not make it to the final each year could also vote. In 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO codes]]).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=12 May 2004 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |title=Eurovision 2004 \u2013 Voting Briefing |accessdate=7 May 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507155415/http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |archivedate=7 May 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2005, the votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance.

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] one of the Swiss jurors presented his votes with flamboyant gestures. This system was retired the next year.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] no public votes were presented: a closed jury simply announced that Switzerland had won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1956|work=Eurovision.tv|access-date=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231055819/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273|archive-date=31 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> From 1957 to 1987, the points were displayed on a physical [[scoreboard]] to the side of the stage.

Countries must announce the country names and points in either English or French and the scores are repeated by the contest's presenters in the other language. For this reason, the expression ''{{lang|fr|douze points}}'' when the host or spokesperson states the top score in French is popularly associated with the contest throughout the continent.<ref name=\"1999rules\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=13 October 1998|url=http://www.eurosong.net/archive/esc1999.pdf|title=Rules of the 44th Eurovision Song Contest, 1999|accessdate=18 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723152907/http://www.eurosong.net/archive/esc1999.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> Since 2016, only the name of the top jury votegetter is announced, with the points awarded to the other nine countries shown in an on-screen scoreboard during the announcement. In addition, only the jury points are announced by country. The televoting results are announced in aggregate, from the lowest-scoring country to the highest. In the 2019 contest the televoting results were announced in aggregate in inverse standing order based on the jury votes; starting with Spain (7 points from the juries) and culminating in Sweden (239 points from the juries). After the winner has been announced, the televoting points from the country where the contest is watched from are briefly seen on screen.\n\n==== Ties for first place ====\nIn {{ESCYr|1969}}, four of the sixteen countries taking part, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. There was nothing in the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among most of the other participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.<ref name=\"ESC1969\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1969|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523004804/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ESC1970\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1970|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231092150/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe current tie-break procedure was implemented in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]]. In the procedure, sometimes known as a [[Issues affecting the single transferable vote#Countback|countback]], if two (or more) countries tie, the song receiving more points from the televote is the winner. If the songs received the same number of televote points, the song that received at least one televote point from the greatest number of countries is the winner. If there is still a tie, a second tie-breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve televote points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. If the tie cannot be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal, the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed earlier (in which case the song performed later would be the winner). The tie-break procedure originally applied only to first place ties,<ref name=\"RULES\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|title=Public rules of the 60th Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=1 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2015}}</ref> but since 2008 has been applied to all places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1469 |work=Eurovision.tv |title=Eurovision 2008 Final |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for first place on total points alone was in {{ESCYr|1991}}, when France and Sweden both totalled 146 points. At that time, there was no televote, and the tie break was to determine which country had received the most sets of twelve points, then ten points, and so on. Both France and Sweden had received four sets of 12 points, but Sweden had received more sets of 10-point scores, they were declared the winners. Had the current predominant tiebreaker been in play, France would have won instead by virtue of receiving points from more overall countries.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nEach participating broadcaster is required to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for advertising breaks if they wish.<ref name=\"RULES\"/> From 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to take more advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme.<ref name=\"1999rules\"/> Four major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999.

The only Big 5 country that has never finished last since the introduction of this concept is Italy: since its return in 2011, the country placed in the top 10 seven times out of 9 contests, including four times in the top 5, a third place and twice as the runner up; its worst place was a 21st in 2014.

The worst example of this was that Bosnia and Herzegovina finished 7th with 86 points in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Contest]], but it wasn't enough to save the country being relegated from taking part in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 Contest]]. As a result, the EBU reverted to the older relegation system for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] contests. Soon, the EBU created what was hoped would be a more permanent solution to the problem.

In 1989, Yugoslavia won the contest with \"[[Rock Me (Riva song)|Rock Me]]\" performed by [[Riva (band)|Riva]], who won the Yugoslav selection competition that year representing (along with 2 more acts) the Yugoslav Socialist Republic of Croatia. The 1990 contest was subsequently held in Zagreb, now the capital of Croatia.\n\nThe early years of the contest saw many wins for \"traditional\" Eurovision countries: France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

The current research into the analysis of the voting patterns has been used in notable sources, such as the Economist, for investigating whether over 10-year periods such collusion is increasing or decreasing.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Economist|first1=DailyChart|title=Partisanship at Eurovision is becoming more blatant|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2018/05/daily-chart-7|journal=Economist|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=2018-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511153023/https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2018/05/daily-chart-7|archive-date=11 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Economist|first1=WarableGames|title=Neighbourly voting in the Eurovision Song Contest|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21742117-continents-annual-singing-tournament-becoming-increasingly-partisan-neighbourly-voting|journal=Economist|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=2018-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512021846/https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21742117-continents-annual-singing-tournament-becoming-increasingly-partisan-neighbourly-voting|archive-date=12 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 475\n | footer = Produced using the methods presented in<ref name=\"Mantzaris et al\" /> and<ref name=\"Mantzaris et al 2018\" /> a network of the significant score deviations can be viewed over a time period of interest.\n | image1 = The collusion between countries in Eurovision 1997 to 2017.png\n | alt1 = Collusion in Eurovision 1997 to 2017\n | caption1 = The collusion between countries in Eurovision 1997 to 2017\n | image2 = Mutual neglect of score allocations in the Eurovision 2010 to 2015.png\n | alt2 = Neglect in Eurovision 2010 to 2015\n | caption2 = Mutual neglect of score allocations in the Eurovision 2010 to 2015\n }}\n\nAs an example, [[Terry Wogan]], the United Kingdom's presenter of Eurovision since 1980 and one of the only three presenters mentioned by name during the contest proper<ref>{{cite episode|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2008|episodelink = Eurovision Song Contest 2008|series=Eurovision Song Contest|serieslink=Eurovision Song Contest|airdate=24 May 2008}}</ref> stood down from [[BBC One]]'s broadcast in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] saying \"The voting used to be about the songs.

Although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.\n\nThe total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. Thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries. For example, San Marino holds the same voting power as Russia despite the vast geographic and population differences between them.\n\nTo try to reduce the effect of voting blocs, national juries were re-introduced alongside televoting in the final in 2009: each contributing 50% of the vote.<ref name=\"juryconfirmed\">{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |title=EBU confirms 50/50 vote for Eurovision Song Contest |last=Viniker |first=Barry |date=8 December 2008 |website=ESCToday |accessdate=8 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211002140/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |archivedate=11 December 2008 }}</ref> This hybrid system was expanded in 2010 to also be implemented in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"Countries\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&_t=Exclusive%3A+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|title=Exclusive: 39 countries to be represented in Oslo|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=31 December 2009|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]|accessdate=31 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103100815/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&_t=Exclusive:+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|archive-date=3 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> However, since 1994 no country has won two years in a row, and semi-finals have also been won by different countries, until 2012 when Sweden won the second semi-final in 2011 and 2012. Although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like Turkey and Azerbaijan, it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions.\n\nAn overview of the overall preference between countries that exhibits patterns of high score allocations is a question that appears frequently and recently a new study investigates the question of 'neglect' in the competition. The concept of 'neglect' here is represented by countries which produce patterns of biased low score allocations to certain countries. Together these two patterns provide a better view of the competition's intrinsic country pair biases. Result of such a study are presented in this paper.<ref name=\"Mantzaris et al 2018\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s42001-018-0020-2|title = Preference and neglect amongst countries in the Eurovision Song Contest| journal=Journal of Computational Social Science| volume=1| issue=2| pages=377\u2013390|year = 2018|last1 = Mantzaris|first1 = Alexander V.| last2=Rein| first2=Samuel R.| last3=Hopkins| first3=Alexander D.}}</ref> From the analysis it can be seen that countries which exhibit these biases do not receive a penalization from other participants and it presents itself as a means to accumulate more points by establishing these partnerships.\n\n=== Running order of the participating songs ===\nFrom 2013 onwards, the final and the semi-finals running order of the competing performances at the semi-finals and the final has been decided by the show's producers and then approved by the EBU Executive Supervisor and the Reference Group.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was formed on 12 February 1950 by 23 broadcasting organisations from Europe and the Mediterranean at a conference in Devon, United Kingdom.

At Monaco, in late January 1955, this committee, chaired by Marcel Bezen\u00e7on, director general of Swiss Television, came up with the idea of creating a song contest, inspired by the very popular San Remo Festival. The idea was approved by the EBU General Assembly in Rome on 19 October 1955, and it was decided that the first \"Eurovision Grand Prix\" \u2013 so baptised, incidentally, by a British journalist \u2013 would take place in spring 1956 at Lugano, Switzerland.}}</ref> At a committee meeting held in Monaco in January 1955 with [[Marcel Bezen\u00e7on]] of the Swiss television as chairman, the committee conceived the idea (initially proposed by [[Sergio Pugliese]] of the Italian broadcaster [[RAI]]) of an international song contest where countries would participate in one television programme to be transmitted simultaneously across all countries of the union.<ref name=\"bristol\" /><ref name=\"GoldenJubilee\">{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Jaquin |date=1 December 2004 |url=http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811033906/http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 August 2004 |title=Eurovision's Golden Jubilee |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |accessdate=18 July 2009 }}</ref> The competition was based upon the existing [[Sanremo Music Festival]] held in Italy<ref>{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]] |year=2003 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224074456/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history/ |archivedate=24 December 2007 |title=History of Eurovision |accessdate=20 July 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> and was seen as a technological experiment in [[live television]].

Journalists and fans are also present during the preceding days, and so the events of Eurovision last a lot longer than a few hours of television.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/about/in-depth/event-weeks|title=Event weeks - Eurovision Song Contest|website=eurovision.tv|access-date=2019-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513002900/https://eurovision.tv/about/in-depth/event-weeks/|archive-date=13 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A number of officially accredited hotels are selected for the delegations to stay in, and shuttle-bus services are used to transport the performers and accompanying people to and from the contest venue.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=17 March 2008 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=587 |title=Belgrade 2008 |accessdate=19 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518160711/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=587 |archivedate=18 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nEach participating broadcaster nominates a Head of Delegation, whose job it is to co-ordinate the movements of the delegate members, and who acts as that country's representative to the EBU in the host city.<ref name=\"2005rules\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |year=2005 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |title=Rules of the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest |accessdate=10 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210010517/http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |archivedate=10 February 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> Members of the delegations include performers, lyricists, composers, official press officers and\u2014in the years where songs were performed with a live orchestra\u2014a conductor.

There are two rehearsal periods for each country. The countries taking part in the semi-finals have their first rehearsal over four days from the first Sunday to Wednesday. The second is from Thursday to Sunday. The countries which have already directly qualified for the Grand Final rehearse on the Saturday and Sunday.<ref name=\"eurovision.tv\">[http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2012/RehearsalSchedule2012/_press_v1.1pdf]{{Dead link|date=March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2006ch Press Conference.jpg|thumb|left|Switzerland hosting a press conference at Eurovision 2006]]\n\nAfter each country has rehearsed, the delegation meets with the show's production team in the viewing room. Here, they watch the footage of the rehearsal just performed. At this point the Delegation may make known any special requirements or changes needed for the performance, and request them to the host broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions.<ref name=\"RehearsalSchedule\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|year=2008|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/media/ESC2008_rehearsals.pdf|title=Rehearsal Schedule|accessdate=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221010818/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/media/ESC2008_rehearsals.pdf|archive-date=21 December 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing.

Two rehearsals are held the day before (one in the afternoon and the other in the evening), while the third is held on the afternoon of the live event. Since tickets to the live shows are often scarce, tickets are also sold so the public may attend these dress rehearsals.\n\nThe same applies for the final, with two rehearsals on the Friday and the third on Saturday afternoon before the live transmission of the grand final on Saturday evening.<ref name=\"RehearsalSchedule\"/> For both semi-finals and for the final, the second dress rehearsal is also the ''Jury Final'', this is where the jury from each country casts their votes.

However, in the new millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.<ref name=\"Euroclub\"/>\n\n== Rules ==\n{{Further|Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nNumerous detailed rules must be observed by the participating nations, and a new version is produced each year, for instance the rules specify various deadlines, including the date by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the EBU. The rules also cover sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re-transmit the show. The most notable rules which affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed over the years, and are highlighted here.\n\n=== Live music ===\nAll vocals must be sung live; no voices are permitted on the backing tracks.<ref name=\"RULES\"/> In 1999, [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999|the Croatian song]] performed by [[Doris Dragovi\u0107]] and composed by [[Ton\u010di Hulji\u0107]] featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.<ref name=\"ESC1999\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1999|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231130541/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1956 until 1998, the host country was required to provide a live orchestra. Before 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded, non-vocal backing tracks were permitted\u2014although the host country was still obliged to provide a live orchestra to give participants a choice. If a backing track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\nIn 1999 the requirement for a live orchestra was removed: it was left as an optional contribution.<ref name=\"1999rules\"/> The host that year, Israel's [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], decided not to use an orchestra to save expenses, and thus 1999 was the first year when all the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in conjunction with live vocals).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Languages in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nEach submission must have vocals; purely instrumental music has never been allowed. In the past, competitors have been required to sing in one of their own national languages, but this rule has been changed several times over the years. From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. In 1966, a rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, after Sweden was the first country to not sing in their own language, with opera singer [[Ingvar Wixell]] performing [[Absent Friend|Sweden's 1965 entry]] in English.<ref name=\"milestones\"/> The Swedish-language version of the song was originally selected at [[Melodifestivalen 1965]], but it was later translated into English for the Eurovision contest.\n\nThe language restriction continued until 1973, when performers were again allowed to sing in any language they wished.<ref name=\"ESC1973\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1973|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523025310/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Several winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of this: performers from non-English-speaking countries sang in English, including [[ABBA]] in 1974. In 1977, the EBU decided to revert to the national language restriction.

In the final, all but three out of 26 contestants had songs in English. After [[Salvador Sobral]]'s win in 2017 with a Portuguese-language song, the 2018 edition saw a significant increase in the use of native languages, with twelve of 43 participants singing in their country's native language (not including Estonia, whose representative opted to sing in Italian).<ref name=EN>{{cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2018/05/09/english-song-dominance-on-the-decline-at-eurovision-2018|title=English song dominance on the decline at Eurovision 2018|first1=Antonio|last1=Silva|first2=Chris|last2=Harris|website=[[Euronews]]|date=10 May 2018|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> In 2019, nine of the songs were performed totally in different languages, while four others mixed English with their native languages.<ref name=ESClang>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/eurovision-class-of-2019-languages|title=Eurovision Class of 2019: This year's languages|publisher=Eurovision Song Contest|date=5 April 2019|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Voting ===\n{{Further|Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nThe voting system used in the contest has changed over the years.

Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over [[telephone line]]s; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the [[Eiffel Tower]] or an Italian presenter might be seen with the [[Colosseum]] in the background.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1999, some countries did not have their spokesperson in front of a backdrop of a famous place, instead opting to show the spokesperson in the studio or in a famous building, for example when Malta presented their votes from a hotel in the country in 1995, or have them standing behind a blurred image of the famous building or skyline. From the 2000s, new technology meant that the spokespersons could be standing behind a live video of a famous place in that country. There have also been occasions where the backdrop of the spokesperson is not a still image or video, but instead is a slideshow of multiple shots of many of that country's famous buildings.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, the participating countries were called in reverse order of the presentation of their songs, and from 1963 to 2003, they were called in the same order in which their songs had been presented (except for 1974).

There was nothing in the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among most of the other participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.<ref name=\"ESC1969\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1969|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523004804/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ESC1970\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1970|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231092150/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe current tie-break procedure was implemented in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]]. In the procedure, sometimes known as a [[Issues affecting the single transferable vote#Countback|countback]], if two (or more) countries tie, the song receiving more points from the televote is the winner. If the songs received the same number of televote points, the song that received at least one televote point from the greatest number of countries is the winner. If there is still a tie, a second tie-breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve televote points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. If the tie cannot be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal, the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed earlier (in which case the song performed later would be the winner). The tie-break procedure originally applied only to first place ties,<ref name=\"RULES\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|title=Public rules of the 60th Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=1 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2015}}</ref> but since 2008 has been applied to all places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1469 |work=Eurovision.tv |title=Eurovision 2008 Final |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for first place on total points alone was in {{ESCYr|1991}}, when France and Sweden both totalled 146 points. At that time, there was no televote, and the tie break was to determine which country had received the most sets of twelve points, then ten points, and so on. Both France and Sweden had received four sets of 12 points, but Sweden had received more sets of 10-point scores, they were declared the winners. Had the current predominant tiebreaker been in play, France would have won instead by virtue of receiving points from more overall countries.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nEach participating broadcaster is required to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for advertising breaks if they wish.<ref name=\"RULES\"/> From 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to take more advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme.<ref name=\"1999rules\"/> Four major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999.

The only Big 5 country that has never finished last since the introduction of this concept is Italy: since its return in 2011, the country placed in the top 10 seven times out of 9 contests, including four times in the top 5, a third place and twice as the runner up; its worst place was a 21st in 2014.

The worst example of this was that Bosnia and Herzegovina finished 7th with 86 points in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Contest]], but it wasn't enough to save the country being relegated from taking part in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 Contest]]. As a result, the EBU reverted to the older relegation system for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] contests. Soon, the EBU created what was hoped would be a more permanent solution to the problem.

Although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.\n\nThe total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. Thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries.

Although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like Turkey and Azerbaijan, it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions.\n\nAn overview of the overall preference between countries that exhibits patterns of high score allocations is a question that appears frequently and recently a new study investigates the question of 'neglect' in the competition. The concept of 'neglect' here is represented by countries which produce patterns of biased low score allocations to certain countries.

He reigned during an important transitional phase, when the [[Dutch East India Company]] gained ascendency in the [[Maluku Islands]] and began to regulate the commerce in spices. This was the beginning of the colonial subordination of Maluku that would accelerate during his successors.\n\n==Sultan in opposition==\n\nMudafar was born around 1595 to Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (r. 1583-1606). It is unclear if his mother was Saidi's main consort Ainal-ma-lamo or a co-wife from ''soa'' Jika.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 17-9.</ref> At his birth, the spice empire of Ternate was still intact, and invasion attempts by Spanish-Portuguese forces were regularly thwarted. Ternate had vassals in [[North Sulawesi]], the [[Sangihe Islands]], [[Halmahera]], [[Buru Island]], [[Seram Island|Ceram]] and the [[Banda Islands]].<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 150.</ref> However, the arrival of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], political and commercial rivals of the [[Iberian Union|Spanish-Portuguese empire]], alerted the Spanish authorities in the [[Philippines]]. Dutch seafarers entered negotiations with Saidi in 1599 and onwards and conquered the Iberian fortification on nearby [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]] in 1605. A large Spanish armada invaded Ternate in 1606 and reduced the kingdom to vassalage. Sultan Saidi and most of his family was brought to [[Manila]] as prisoners. However, the young Prince Modafar with a number of supporters hid in Halmahera where they found protection with his brother-in-law, King Doa of [[Jailolo]]. He was now proclaimed new Sultan of Ternate, though he was not universally recognized.<ref>Peter Borschberg (2015) ''Journals, memorials and letters of Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge''. Singapore: NUS Press, p. 84.</ref>\n\n==Contract with the VOC==\n\nNow Mudafar's party became the natural allies of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Admiral [[Cornelis Matelief de Jonge]] arrived to [[North Maluku]] in 1607 and made contact with the pretender-Sultan. He concluded a contract with the VOC on 26 May 1607, where the Dutch were acknowledged as protectors and they would all unite to fight the Iberian powers. There was an important commercial aspect with the contract, since Mudafar undertook to only sell [[cloves]] produced on the island to the VOC for a fixed price.<ref>Peter Borschberg (2015), p. 87-9.</ref> Defying the Portuguese garrisons on Ternate and Tidore, the Dutch built a fort at Malayu on the eastern side of Ternate. In the following years a series of forts were constructed in North Maluku: four in Ternate, three on [[Makian]], and one each on [[Moti Island|Moti]], [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Jailolo]] (Halmahera). Ternatans and other allied peoples moved to live under VOC protection close to fortresses.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 153.</ref>\n\nThe new contract was initially seen by the Ternatans as a pact for support, with due commercial advantages for the part that provided assistance. At length, however, the regulations of the spice trade had bad effects for the regional economy. Although the price that the VOC paid for the spices was reasonable, the Ternatans were paid in goods more than in money. The Dutch fixed the prices for the imported goods at an overly high level, so that the producers in practice received less for their cloves than before. As all visits by other European and Asian trading vessels were forbidden, the VOC were not able to bring in sufficient foodstuff (such as rice) and other necessities to meet the needs of the locals. The system therefore led to a comprehensive smuggling from the outside, where [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Malay people|Malays]] and [[Makassarese people|Makassarese]] seafarers braved the European restrictions and paid much higher prices for the spices than the VOC did.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 49-50.</ref>\n\n==New Spanish efforts==\n\nThe Spaniards tried to strike back against the VOC alliance using their traditional friends (and rivals of Ternate), the Tidorese. In spite of initial successes against the Ternatan vassal Jailolo in 1608, the efforts could not be sustained, however, since the Tidorese feared Dutch retaliation. The Governor of the Philippines, Juan de Silva, brought Mudafar's exiled father Saidi with him on an expedition in 1611, trying to reconcile with the Ternatans. As this failed, the Spanish fleet attacked and captured a few sites in Halmahera, though they soon reverted to Ternate and the VOC. A new diplomatic foray in 1623 also failed. The Spanish nevertheless kept the Gamalama fortress in Ternate and several forts in Tidore until the 1660s.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 154-6.</ref>\n\n==Under Company protection==\n\nA number of startling events took place in Maluku during the time of Mudafar Syah. These included the genocidal [[Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands]], a traditional vassal of Ternate, in 1621, which secured VOC exploitation of the valuable [[nutmeg]] that grew on the islands. Furthermore, the Dutch strengthened their grip on [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], parts of which were also Ternatan dependencies, through the equally notorious [[Amboyna massacre]] that eliminated English influence.<ref>Adam Clulow (2019) ''Amboina, 1623: Fear and conspiracy on the edge of empire''. New York: Columbia University Press, p. 36-8, 46-9.</ref> Though Mudafar Syah presided over a formally independent realm, the Dutch and Spanish regarded their respective Ternatan and Tidorese allies as mere auxiliaries whose wishes were subordinated to those of the Europeans.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 156.</ref> Mudafar was, moreover, no forceful figure and was far from popular with the Dutch. He was considered a lethargic youth sometimes capable of fits of cruelty. His first wife was a daughter of the ''Sangaji'' (sub-ruler) of Sahu in Halmahera, but she somehow displeased him, and he killed her with his [[kris]] and had her body thrown into the sea.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 151.</ref> He also asked for the daughter of the Tidorese crown prince Ngarolamo in marriage, but this was opposed by his kinsman Kapita Laut Ali, who wanted her for himself. Kapita Laut Ali was the Ternatan sea lord and was remembered by historical tradition as a forceful figure who maintained the wide influence of the Ternate kingdom.<ref>Na\u00efdah (1878) \"Geschiednis van Ternate\", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'', 4:II, p. 450-7.</ref> Mudafar Syah eventually fell sick and died on 16 June 1627, only 32 years old. Though he left a number of sons, his successor was [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]], a cousin of his father.\n\n==Family==\n\nSultan Mudafar Syah had several wives and co-wives:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 19.</ref>\n* A daughter of the Sangaji of Sahu, Halmahera, married in 1612\n* A sister of Kapita Laut Ali, married in 1612 as co-wife\n* A daughter of a Ternate chief\n* A daughter of the Sangaji of Sarangani, South [[Mindanao]], fled to the Spanish in 1616\n* A daughter of the Sangaji of Gamkonara, married in 1623\n* A daughter of the Sangaji of Ngofakiaha, married in 1626\n* Bida, from ''soa'' Toboleo, mother of [[Mandar Syah]]\n* Woman from ''soa'' Kalmata, mother of Kaicili Kalamata\n* Woman from ''soa'' Kulaba, mother of Kaicili Manilha\n\nHis sons were:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 19.</ref>\n* [[Mandar Syah]], sultan of Ternate\n* Kaicili Kalamata\n* Kaicili Manilha\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n* [[Spice trade]]\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Saidi Berkat]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Sultan of Ternate|years=1606\u20131627}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:Sultans of Ternate]]\n[[Category:Ternate Sultanate]]\n[[Category:People from Maluku Islands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox royalty\n|name  = Mudafar Syah I\n|succession  = [[Sultan of Ternate]]\n|reign       = 1583\u20131606\n|predecessor = [[Saidi Berkat]]\n|successor   = [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]]\n|regnal name =  \n|house       = \n|father      = [[Saidi Berkat]]\n|mother      = \n|birth_date  = c. 1595\n|birth_place = \n|death_date  = 16 June 1627\n|religion    = [[Islam]]\n}}\n\n'''Sultan Mudafar Syah I''' (b. c. 1595-d. 16 June 1627), also spelt Muzaffar Syah, was the ninth Sultan of [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]] who ruled from 1606 to 1627.

The system therefore led to a comprehensive smuggling from the outside, where [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Malay people|Malays]] and [[Makassarese people|Makassarese]] seafarers braved the European restrictions and paid much higher prices for the spices than the VOC did.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 49-50.</ref>\n\n==New Spanish efforts==\n\nThe Spaniards tried to strike back against the VOC alliance using their traditional friends (and rivals of Ternate), the Tidorese. In spite of initial successes against the Ternatan vassal Jailolo in 1608, the efforts could not be sustained, however, since the Tidorese feared Dutch retaliation. The Governor of the Philippines, Juan de Silva, brought Mudafar's exiled father Saidi with him on an expedition in 1611, trying to reconcile with the Ternatans. As this failed, the Spanish fleet attacked and captured a few sites in Halmahera, though they soon reverted to Ternate and the VOC. A new diplomatic foray in 1623 also failed. The Spanish nevertheless kept the Gamalama fortress in Ternate and several forts in Tidore until the 1660s.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 154-6.</ref>\n\n==Under Company protection==\n\nA number of startling events took place in Maluku during the time of Mudafar Syah. These included the genocidal [[Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands]], a traditional vassal of Ternate, in 1621, which secured VOC exploitation of the valuable [[nutmeg]] that grew on the islands. Furthermore, the Dutch strengthened their grip on [[Ambon]], parts of which were also Ternatan dependencies, through the equally notorious [[Amboyna massacre]] that eliminated English influence.<ref>Adam Clulow (2019) ''Amboina, 1623: Fear and conspiracy on the edge of empire''. New York: Columbia University Press, p. 36-8, 46-9.</ref> Though Mudafar Syah presided over a formally independent realm, the Dutch and Spanish regarded their respective Ternatan and Tidorese allies as mere auxiliaries whose wishes were subordinated to those of the Europeans.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 156.</ref> Mudafar was, moreover, no forceful figure and was far from popular with the Dutch. He was considered a lethargic youth sometimes capable of fits of cruelty. His first wife was a daughter of the ''Sangaji'' (sub-ruler) of Sahu in Halmahera, but she somehow displeased him, and he killed her with his [[kris]] and had her body thrown into the sea.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 151.</ref> He also asked for the daughter of the Tidorese crown prince Ngarolamo in marriage, but this was opposed by his kinsman Kapita Laut Ali, who wanted her for himself. Kapita Laut Ali was the Ternatan sea lord and was remembered by historical tradition as a forceful figure who maintained the wide influence of the Ternate kingdom.<ref>Na\u00efdah (1878) \"Geschiednis van Ternate\", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'', 4:II, p. 450-7.</ref> Mudafar Syah eventually fell sick and died on 16 June 1627, only 32 years old.

She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s.

She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[feature film]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925) as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929) was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.

He came to prominence with the [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] [[comedy film]] ''[[Clerks]]'' (1994), which he wrote, directed, co-produced, and acted in as the character Silent Bob of stoner duo [[Jay and Silent Bob]]. Jay and Silent Bob have appeared in Smith's follow-up films ''[[Mallrats]]'', ''[[Chasing Amy]]'', ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', ''[[Clerks II]]'' and ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'', which are set primarily in his home state of [[New Jersey]]. While not strictly sequential, the films frequently featured crossover plot elements, character references, and a shared [[canon (fiction)|canon]] described by fans as the \"[[View Askewniverse]]\". This is named after his production company [[View Askew Productions]], which he co-founded with [[Scott Mosier]].\n\nSince 2011, Smith has mostly made films in the horror genre, including ''[[Red State (2011 film)|Red State]]'' (2011) and the \"comedy horror films\" ''[[Tusk (2014 film)|Tusk]]'' (2014) and ''[[Yoga Hosers]]'' (2016), two in a planned series of three such films set in [[Canada]] dubbed the [[True North trilogy|''True North'' trilogy]]. He has also served as a director-for-hire for material he did not write, including the [[buddy cop]] action comedy ''[[Cop Out (2010 film)|Cop Out]]'' (2010) and various television series episodes.\n\nSmith is the owner of [[Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash]], a comic book store in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]], that is the subject of the [[reality television]] show ''[[Comic Book Men]]'' (2012\u20132018). He also hosts the movie-review television show ''[[Spoilers (TV series)|Spoilers]]''. As a podcaster, Smith co-hosts several shows on his own [[SModcast Podcast Network]], including ''[[SModcast]]'', ''[[Fatman on Batman|Fatman Beyond]]'', and the live show ''[[Hollywood Babble-On]]''. Smith is well known for participating in long, humorous Q&A sessions that are often filmed for DVD release, beginning with ''[[An Evening with Kevin Smith]]''.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/person/111916/Kevin-Smith \"Kevin Smith\"].

''Clerks'' was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1994, where it won the Filmmaker's Trophy. At a restaurant following the screening, [[Miramax]] executive [[Harvey Weinstein]] invited Smith to join him at his table, where he offered to buy the movie. In May 1994, it went to the [[Cannes International Film Festival]], where it won both the Prix de la Jeunesse and the International Critics' Week Prize.

He wrote a short [[Jay and Silent Bob]] story about Walt Flanagan's dog in ''Oni Double Feature'' No. 1, and followed it with a [[Bluntman and Chronic]] story in ''Oni Double Feature'' #12. He followed these with a series of [[Clerks (comic)|''Clerks'' comics]]. The first was simply ''Clerks: The Comic Book'', which told of Randal's attempts to corner the market on ''Star Wars'' toys. The second was ''Clerks: Holiday Special'', where Dante and Randal discover that Santa Claus lives in an apartment between the Quick Stop and RST Video. Third was ''Clerks: The Lost Scene'', showing what happened inside Poston's Funeral Parlor. This story was later animated in the TV series style and included as an extra on the 10th Anniversary ''[[Clerks]]'' DVD.\n\nSmith then wrote the mini-series ''[[Chasing Dogma]]'', which tells the story of Jay and Silent Bob between the films ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' and ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. He has also written the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] ''[[Bluntman and Chronic]]'', published by [[Image Comics|Image]], which purports to be a collection of the three issues of the series done by Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards (of ''Chasing Amy''). It includes a color reprinting of the story from ''Oni Double Feature'' No. 12, purported to be an early appearance by ''Chasing Amy'' characters Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards. These stories have all been collected in ''Tales From the Clerks'' (Graphitti Designs, {{ISBN|0-936211-78-4}}), which also includes a new ''Clerks'' story tying into the ''Clerks 2'' material, and the story from ''Oni Double Feature'' #1. They were previously collected by Image Comics in three separate volumes, one each for ''Clerks'', ''Chasing Dogma'' and ''Bluntman and Chronic''. In 1999, Smith won a [[Harvey Award]], for Best New Talent in comic books.<ref>[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/harvey99.php \"1999 Harvey Award Nominees and Winners\"], Comic Book Awards Almanac, accessed March 7, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Smith wrote \"[[Daredevil: Guardian Devil|Guardian Devil]]\", an eight-issue story arc of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' for [[Marvel Comics]], which was illustrated by [[Joe Quesada]]. He then produced a 15-issue tenure on ''[[Green Arrow]]'' for [[DC Comics]] that saw the return of [[Oliver Queen]] from the dead and the introduction of [[Mia Dearden]], a teenage girl who would become Speedy after Smith's run had ended.\n\nSmith returned to Marvel for two mini-series: ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' and ''[[Daredevil/Bullseye: The Target]]'', both of which debuted in 2002. The former was six issues long, but problems arose when the third issue was published two months after the initially scheduled release date. As a result, the final issues were delayed for at least three years, prompting Marvel to release an \"in case you missed it\" reprinting of the first three issues as one book before the remaining issues were released. The delay in part was due to Smith's movie production schedule (in this case, work on ''Jersey Girl'' and ''Clerks II''), causing him to shelve completion of the mini-series until the films were completed. He was announced as the writer of an ongoing ''[[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]'' series<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0202/24/|title=''Kevin Smith Talks Black Cat''.|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref> and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=13&t=001042|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020601183702/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=13&t=001042|archivedate=June 1, 2002|title=''Marvel Locks Up JMS/Kevin Smith.''|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=1129|title=Wednesday Marvel Conference Call Wrap Up.''|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref> in early to mid-2002.

He wrote several drafts but was dropped from the project when [[Tim Burton]] was hired to direct and brought his own team to write the script. (Burton's attempt was later abandoned as well.) Smith publicly discussed his experience working on the script at a Q&A session at [[Clark University]] shown in the 2002 DVD ''[[An Evening with Kevin Smith]]''. In the Q&A, he said that the experience was a positive one overall, since he loves the character of Superman and was paid well. However, he listed a number of unusual demands that producer [[Jon Peters]], who was in charge of the project, made, including that Superman not be shown flying or wearing tights, and that he should battle a giant spider at the end of the film. Smith then noted that he went to see the 1999 film ''[[Wild Wild West]]'', which Peters produced, and was surprised to see a giant mechanical spider at the end of the film, presumably Peters' handiwork. Smith's description of his experience gained a life of its own, with film critic [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' calling it \"extraordinary\" in 2011.<ref>Doctorow, Cory (April 27, 2009).

Seeking out advice, Smith spoke to a priest, who analogized faith to liquid filling a shot glass, and explained that the glass grows in size as a person grows older, and thus the same knowledge that satisfies a person as a child can be insufficient as an adult. Smith researched [[Christianity]] thoroughly, explored other religions, read the [[Biblical apocrypha]], and tried joining a Pentecostal congregation. The thoughts and ideas he explored during this time formed the inspiration for his film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', the beginning of which features characters using the shot glass metaphor used by the priest. Though Smith still regularly attended Mass as late as 1998,<ref name=Playboy/> he stated on \"Back to the Well\", a feature on the ''Clerks II'' documentary, that now he only goes to Mass on the day before he starts production of a film, and the day before it premieres.

On his ''Hollywood Babble-On'' podcast, he noted that \"My entire career is tied up with the man\", and added \"No fucking movie is worth all this.\" He lamented that in addition to working with Weinstein, \"I sat out there talking about this man like he was a hero, like he was my friend, like he was my father.\" He then pledged to donate all his future [[Residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]] from his Weinstein-produced films to the non-profit organization [[Women in Film]], which advocates for the inclusion of more women in film production.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kevin Smith To Donate Dividends From Weinstein-Made Movies To Women In Film |url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/harvey-weintein-kevin-smith-wif-donation-1202190654/ |first=Anthony |last=D'Alessandro |date=October 18, 2017 |work=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref> Smith later announced that, due to the declining appeal of his earlier films, the residuals from Weinstein-funded movies may be lower than expected; he decided that he would instead donate $2,000 a month to Women in Film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGPp38nM0pc|title=An Emotional Kevin Smith Pledges To Donate His Residuals From Weinstein-Made Films|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n====Frequent collaborators====\n{{Main|List of frequent Kevin Smith collaborators}}\nSmith regularly casts the same actors in his film projects.

Smith's then-girlfriend [[Joey Lauren Adams]] almost took the role of Ivy in the movie, instead of the female lead in ''[[Chasing Amy]]''. Eventually she lost out to [[Reese Witherspoon]], and ''Overnight Delivery'' was quietly released directly to video in April 1998. Smith was not credited for his contributions.

He wrote a short [[Jay and Silent Bob]] story about Walt Flanagan's dog in ''Oni Double Feature'' No. 1, and followed it with a [[Bluntman and Chronic]] story in ''Oni Double Feature'' #12. He followed these with a series of [[Clerks (comic)|''Clerks'' comics]]. The first was simply ''Clerks: The Comic Book'', which told of Randal's attempts to corner the market on ''Star Wars'' toys. The second was ''Clerks: Holiday Special'', where Dante and Randal discover that Santa Claus lives in an apartment between the Quick Stop and RST Video. Third was ''Clerks: The Lost Scene'', showing what happened inside Poston's Funeral Parlor. This story was later animated in the TV series style and included as an extra on the 10th Anniversary ''[[Clerks]]'' DVD.\n\nSmith then wrote the mini-series ''[[Chasing Dogma]]'', which tells the story of Jay and Silent Bob between the films ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' and ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. He has also written the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] ''[[Bluntman and Chronic]]'', published by [[Image Comics|Image]], which purports to be a collection of the three issues of the series done by Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards (of ''Chasing Amy''). It includes a color reprinting of the story from ''Oni Double Feature'' No. 12, purported to be an early appearance by ''Chasing Amy'' characters Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards. These stories have all been collected in ''Tales From the Clerks'' (Graphitti Designs, {{ISBN|0-936211-78-4}}), which also includes a new ''Clerks'' story tying into the ''Clerks 2'' material, and the story from ''Oni Double Feature'' #1. They were previously collected by Image Comics in three separate volumes, one each for ''Clerks'', ''Chasing Dogma'' and ''Bluntman and Chronic''. In 1999, Smith won a [[Harvey Award]], for Best New Talent in comic books.<ref>[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/harvey99.php \"1999 Harvey Award Nominees and Winners\"], Comic Book Awards Almanac, accessed March 7, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Smith wrote \"[[Daredevil: Guardian Devil|Guardian Devil]]\", an eight-issue story arc of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' for [[Marvel Comics]], which was illustrated by [[Joe Quesada]]. He then produced a 15-issue tenure on ''[[Green Arrow]]'' for [[DC Comics]] that saw the return of [[Oliver Queen]] from the dead and the introduction of [[Mia Dearden]], a teenage girl who would become Speedy after Smith's run had ended.\n\nSmith returned to Marvel for two mini-series: ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' and ''[[Daredevil/Bullseye: The Target]]'', both of which debuted in 2002. The former was six issues long, but problems arose when the third issue was published two months after the initially scheduled release date. As a result, the final issues were delayed for at least three years, prompting Marvel to release an \"in case you missed it\" reprinting of the first three issues as one book before the remaining issues were released. The delay in part was due to Smith's movie production schedule (in this case, work on ''Jersey Girl'' and ''Clerks II''), causing him to shelve completion of the mini-series until the films were completed. He was announced as the writer of an ongoing ''[[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]'' series<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0202/24/|title=''Kevin Smith Talks Black Cat''.|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref> and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=13&t=001042|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020601183702/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=13&t=001042|archivedate=June 1, 2002|title=''Marvel Locks Up JMS/Kevin Smith.''|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=1129|title=Wednesday Marvel Conference Call Wrap Up.''|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref> in early to mid-2002.

He wrote several drafts but was dropped from the project when [[Tim Burton]] was hired to direct and brought his own team to write the script. (Burton's attempt was later abandoned as well.) Smith publicly discussed his experience working on the script at a Q&A session at [[Clark University]] shown in the 2002 DVD ''[[An Evening with Kevin Smith]]''. In the Q&A, he said that the experience was a positive one overall, since he loves the character of Superman and was paid well. However, he listed a number of unusual demands that producer [[Jon Peters]], who was in charge of the project, made, including that Superman not be shown flying or wearing tights, and that he should battle a giant spider at the end of the film. Smith then noted that he went to see the 1999 film ''[[Wild Wild West]]'', which Peters produced, and was surprised to see a giant mechanical spider at the end of the film, presumably Peters' handiwork. Smith's description of his experience gained a life of its own, with film critic [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' calling it \"extraordinary\" in 2011.<ref>Doctorow, Cory (April 27, 2009).

Heh. ''Lame!''\"\n\nIn the early '00s, Smith was said to be writing ''[[Fletch Won (film)|Fletch Won]]'', a prequel to the [[Chevy Chase]] film ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'', and was set to direct with [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] in the lead role, but the plans ultimately came to nothing with Smith citing Miramax not seeing the box office appeal of Lee as a reason for its abandonment. For a time [[Ben Affleck]] was also considered for the role, with Chase framing the action as the narrator, looking back on his early adventures.\n\nIn 2004, Smith wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of ''[[The Green Hornet]]'', and announced that he intended to direct the film as well.<ref>[http://www.viewaskew.com/news/feb04/1.html 'Hornet' buzzes Smith] News Askew.

Seeking out advice, Smith spoke to a priest, who analogized faith to liquid filling a shot glass, and explained that the glass grows in size as a person grows older, and thus the same knowledge that satisfies a person as a child can be insufficient as an adult. Smith researched [[Christianity]] thoroughly, explored other religions, read the [[Biblical apocrypha]], and tried joining a Pentecostal congregation. The thoughts and ideas he explored during this time formed the inspiration for his film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', the beginning of which features characters using the shot glass metaphor used by the priest. Though Smith still regularly attended Mass as late as 1998,<ref name=Playboy/> he stated on \"Back to the Well\", a feature on the ''Clerks II'' documentary, that now he only goes to Mass on the day before he starts production of a film, and the day before it premieres.

He succeeded to the extensive east Indonesian realm built up by his father Sultan [[Babullah of Ternate|Babullah]], reigning from 1583 to 1606. His reign coincides with the arrival of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] in Maluku, which indirectly caused his deposal and exile through a Spanish invasion.\n\n==Taking over the spice empire==\n\nSaidi Berkat, also called Said Din Berkat Syah, was, according to Dutch information, born in c. 1563 in the time of his grandfather Sultan [[Hairun]].<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 119.</ref> His mother Bega was a co-wife of Prince Baab, later Sultan Babullah.<ref>Na\u00efdah (1878) \"Geschiedenis van Ternate\", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'', IV:2, p. 449.</ref> After the assassination of Hairun at the hands of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in 1570, Babullah took over and successfully fought the European intruders. Portuguese power became restricted to a few forts in [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and they lost control over the trade in spices which gave Maluku its wider significance. Babullah built up a veritable maritime empire that encompassed most of Maluku, parts of [[Sulawesi]], and even remoter territories.<ref>P.A.

Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. I, p. 47.</ref>\n\nAs Babullah passed away in July 1583, Saidi succeeded him, though not without controversy. Babullah had a half-brother Mandar Syah, whose higher birth on his mother's side gave rights to claim the throne. However, Babullah had persuaded his  oldest brother Kaicili (prince) Tolu to support Saidi's succession by letting Saidi marry Tulo's daughter Ainal-ma-lamo.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 16-7.</ref> A few years later Saidi hatched an intrigue to get rid of Mandar Syah. One of his sisters had since long been promised as consort to Gapi Baguna, the Sultan of Tidore who, although supported by the Spanish and Portuguese, still entertained relations with his neighbour. Mandar Syah showed interest in the princess, his niece, and Saidi unscrupulously encouraged him to abduct her. Mandar Syah actually eloped with her, to the furor of Gapi Baguna. Saidi now handily executed his uncle under the pretext of calming down the feelings of the Tidore ruler. This treacherous behaviour evoke the anger of other Ternatan princes.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:2, p. 186.</ref> Tolu began to plot to overthrow Saidi in 1587, and contacted the Spanish and Portuguese on the matter. The latter lacked sufficient resources at the moment to let themselves be involved, and Tolu died shortly after.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 17.</ref>\n\n==Abortive Spanish advances==\n\nThe Spanish governor in the [[Philippines]], Santiago de Vera, tried to strengthened the Iberian positions in Maluku after Babullah's demise. A small fleet of four frigates under Pedro Sarmiento was dispatched from Manila in 1584 and forced the Ternatan dependency [[Moti Island]] to submit temporarily with the help of the Tidorese allies. Three frigates were then dispatched to the [[Bacan Islands]] to take in foodstuff. However, Kaicili Tolu met them in a sea battle where one frigate exploded as a vat of gunpowder was lit, and the others withdrew to Tidore. In the next year a larger Spanish fleet appeared in Maluku, driven by fear that the [[English people|English]] might try to establish a post in the [[Spice islands]]. Saidi was requested to give up the formerly Portuguese fort on Ternate, but gave a vague answer. Supported by the rulers of Tidore, Bacan and northern Sulawesi, the Iberian forces invaded Ternate in 1585. Reinforced by the crews of 30 Javanese merchant vessels, the defenders successfully defeated an attempt to storm the fortress. The Spanish commander Juan de Morones was forced to give up the enterprise and shortly returned to Manila.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:2, p. 182-4.</ref> A new expedition with 2,000 Spanish and Filipino soldiers was dispatched in 1593 but faltered due to a mutiny among the Chinese rowers. A few years later Saidi went on the offensive, sending a strong fleet of korakoras (large outriggers) to [[Mindanao]] which was loosely claimed by Ternate. They joined local rebels and Malay raiders to fight the Spaniards, but were eventually expelled in 1596.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 114-6.</ref>\n\n==Arrival of the Dutch==\n\nThe Dutch first arrived to Indonesia in 1596 and were, like the Portuguese, bent on controlling the [[spice trade]]. Their first visit to Ternate followed in 1599 with two ships under Captain Wijbrand van Warwijk. Sultan Saidi received them in a friendly mood, hoping to use the newcomers against his indigenous and European enemies. The Dutch described him as strong, big man of about 36 years, pleasant, humorous and very curious about new things. He was a renowned warrior and a devoted Muslim. Ternate was described as almost devoid of foodstuff apart from [[sago]]. Local society was only partly monetarized. The inhabitants had a \"good and sweet\" temper though they bore a mortal hatred for the Portuguese. When Van Warwijk departed he left some crew members on the island in order to stock cloves.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 118-22.</ref> A new visit under Cornelis van Neck took place in 1601. Since Spain and Portugal were at war with the [[Dutch Republic]] in Europe, the presence of the newcomers alarmed the Iberian colonist. A Spanish-Portuguese force once again tried to conquer Ternate in 1603 but was heavily defeated by the Ternatans and Javanese mercenaries. This in turn prompted a Dutch counter-attack in 1605 under Cornelis Sebastiaansz, that captured the Iberian fort in Tidore after a furious fight. The defeated enemy was allowed to sail for the Philippines. With Saidi's consent, a Dutch token force was henceforth kept in Ternate.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 125-9.</ref>\n\n==The Spanish conquest of Maluku==\n\nIberian power in Maluku was now entirely depleted, since the Portuguese stronghold in [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] had also been captured. These losses inspired Governor Pedro de Acu\u00f1a to dare a larger enterprise. This time more than 3,000 men were sent on 37 larger and smaller vessels, departing from [[Iloilo]] in January 1606. Helped by 600 Tidorese auxiliaries, the Spaniards undertook a well-coordinated attack on Ternate on 1 April. The defenders were quickly overwhelmed and Sultan Saidi escaped to [[Halmahera]] with a number of followers. With Ternate in their hands again after 36 years, the Iberians demanded the surrender of Saidi as a condition for peace. Some Ternatans declared that their Sultan had behaved in a negligent and despotic fashion, and professed their loyalty to the Iberian Crown. Saidi complied and gave himself up, though this did not save his position. He was brought to Manila with the victorious fleet, together with most of the royal family.\n\nWith this, most of Maluku was securely under the thumb of Spain. A peace treaty was forced upon Ternate, where they promised to have no contact with the English or Dutch, allow Catholic missionizing, and abide to Spanish dispositions.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 131-5.</ref> However, a new Sultan was soon proclaimed by some Ternatan grandees. This was Saidi's son [[Mudafar Syah I]] who allied with the Dutch, who were soon to come back to northern Maluku.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 153.</ref>\n\n==Exile and Death==\n\nSaidi and his kin had to participate in a triumphal parade in Manila. His appearance on the occasion is described thus: \"That King was strong body'd, and his Limbs well Knit; his Neck, and great Part of his Arms he wore naked; his Skin being the Colour of a Cloud rather inclined to Black than Tawny. The Features of his Face were like an European. His eyes large, full, and sparkling, to which they add the Fierceness of long Eyebrows, thick Beard and Whiskers, and lank Hair. He always wore his Campilane, or Cimiter, and Criz, or Dagger, the Hilts of them resembling the Heads of Snakes gilt.\"<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 137.</ref> As most of Maluku slipped from their power in the next years, due to the intervention of the [[Dutch East India Company]], the Spanish tried to make use of their exalted prisoner. In 1611 Governor Juan de Silva appeared in front of Ternate with a fleet, accompanied by Saidi, and tried to bring about a reconciliation with the Ternatan elite. This initiative failed, however. In 1623 a Spanish embassy turned up in Ternate with letters from Saidi where his good treatment was emphasized. During a meeting the Spaniards and Ternatans agreed to make peace, under the condition that Saidi should be sent back from exile. In the end the ex-Sultan was never actually returned to Ternate, so that hostilities resumed.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 154-5.</ref> Saidi eventually passed away in his Spanish-Philippine exile in 1628.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 17.</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nSultan Saidi Berkat had the following wives:\n* Ainal-ma-lamo, daughter of Kaicili Tolu\n* Sirikaya, daughter of the ''Sangaji'' of Moti\n\nHe had the following known children:\n* Kaicili Sidang, died 1613\n* Kaicili Gapi, died 1613\n* [[Mudafar Syah I]], Sultan of Ternate\n* A daughter, married the vassal ruler Doa of Jailolo\n* A daughter, married Sultan Nur Salat of Bacan\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Babullah of Ternate|Babullah]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Sultan of Ternate|years=1583\u20131606}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Mudafar Syah I]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:Sultans of Ternate]]\n[[Category:Ternate Sultanate]]\n[[Category:People from Maluku Islands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox royalty\n|name  = Saidi Berkat\n|succession  = [[Sultan of Ternate]]\n|reign       = 1583\u20131606\n|predecessor = [[Babullah of Ternate|Babullah]]\n|successor   = [[Mudafar Syah I]]\n|regnal name =  \n|house       = \n|father      = [[Babullah of Ternate|Babullah]]\n|mother      = Bega\n|birth_date  = c. 1563\n|birth_place = \n|death_date  = 1628\n|religion    = [[Islam]]\n}}\n\n'''Sultan Saidi Berkat''' (b. c. 1563-d. 1628) was the eighth Sultan of [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]] in the [[Maluku Islands]].

His appearance on the occasion is described thus: \"That King was strong body'd, and his Limbs well Knit; his Neck, and great Part of his Arms he wore naked; his Skin being the Colour of a Cloud rather inclined to Black than Tawny. The Features of his Face were like an European. His eyes large, full, and sparkling, to which they add the Fierceness of long Eyebrows, thick Beard and Whiskers, and lank Hair. He always wore his Campilane, or Cimiter, and Criz, or Dagger, the Hilts of them resembling the Heads of Snakes gilt.\"<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 137.</ref> As most of Maluku slipped from their power in the next years, due to the intervention of the [[Dutch East India Company]], the Spanish tried to make use of their exalted prisoner. In 1611 Governor Juan de Silva appeared in front of Ternate with a fleet, accompanied by Saidi, and tried to bring about a reconciliation with the Ternatan elite. This initiative failed, however. In 1623 a Spanish embassy turned up in Ternate with letters from Saidi where his good treatment was emphasized. During a meeting the Spaniards and Ternatans agreed to make peace, under the condition that Saidi should be sent back from exile. In the end the ex-Sultan was never actually returned to Ternate, so that hostilities resumed.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 154-5.</ref> Saidi eventually passed away in his Spanish-Philippine exile in 1628.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 17.</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nSultan Saidi Berkat had the following wives:\n* Ainal-ma-lamo, daughter of Kaicili Tolu\n* Sirikaya, daughter of the ''Sangaji'' of Moti\n\nHe had the following known children:\n* Kaicili Sidang, died 1613\n* Kaicili Gapi, died 1613\n* [[Mudafar Syah I]], Sultan of Ternate\n* A daughter, married the vassal ruler Doa of Jailolo\n* A daughter, married Sultan Nur Salat of Bacan\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Babullah of Ternate|Babullah]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Sultan of Ternate|years=1583\u20131606}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Mudafar Syah I]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:Sultans of Ternate]]\n[[Category:Ternate Sultanate]]\n[[Category:People from Maluku Islands]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toAmbon(link changed toAmbon Island; link changed toAmbon Island) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saidi_Berkat"}

During his long reign, he had a shifting relation to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] who had a stronghold in Ternate and tried to dominate the spice trade in the region. This ended with his assassination at the hands of a Portuguese soldier in 1570.\n\n==Early life==\nPortuguese seafarers from [[Melaka]] had appeared in the waters of eastern [[Indonesia]] since 1512. The trade in spices and forest products made it vital for the early colonizers to secure bases in the Maluku Islands (Moluccas) and control the enormously lucrative commerce. A fort was built on Ternate in 1522\u20131523 with the approval of the local Sultan, who hoped for military assistance to expand his own power. At the time Ternate was the most powerful of the four sultanates of [[North Maluku]], the other being [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]], [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Jailolo]]. However, the Portuguese captains soon began to dominate the royal court while the garrison evoked general discontent though their behaviour. An incident in 1535, where Ternatans attacked a Christianized village in [[Halmahera]] in defiance of the Portuguese, led to the deposing of the young Sultan [[Tabariji of Ternate|Tabariji]]. The Europeans now picked up a twelve-years old half-brother of Tabariji called Hairun Jamilu, and raised him to the throne. The self-willed actions of the Portuguese captain increased the fear and resentment among the people.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, p. 121.</ref>\n\nHairun was the son of a former Sultan, [[Bayan Sirrullah]] (d. 1521) by a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] lady.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 16.</ref> His mother was a practitioner of pre-Islamic rites and did not live at the royal court. When the Portuguese soldiers came to pick up Hairun for enthronement, she violently resisted them, realizing that her son would only become a Portuguese puppet. In the ensuing tumult she died by falling from a window. Nevertheless, Hairun was installed in the end and accepted European tutelage.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 54-6.</ref> However, another half-brother of Hairun, [[Dayal]], had been deposed some years previously and fled to the rival Sultanate [[Tidore]], based on an island in the vicinity. There he was supported by his maternal uncle, Sultan Mir, who refused to surrender Dayal. An anti-Portuguese alliance was forged between Tidore, Bacan, Jailolo and dissatisfied Ternatans. In retaliation, a Portuguese army invaded Tidore in 1536, and Dayal was mortally wounded during the fighting.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 124.</ref>\n\n==Deposal and reinstatement==\n\nHairun himself was initially forced to live in the Portuguese fort, but was allowed to live among his own people after a few years. At the beginning of his reign he was seen as an unpromising figure, and the grandees of the kingdom rather wanted Tabariji to return as their Sultan.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 40.</ref> He seemed to have an interest in Christianity, though he did not actually ask for baptism. Upon his release, however, he began to strengthen his own networks by visiting villages in the islands of Ternate, [[Makian]] and [[Moti Island|Moti]]. He also obtained the daughter of Sultan Mir of Tidore as consort. The Portuguese authorities found a more promising candidate to promote Christianization in his deposed predecessor Tabariji, who lived in exile in [[Goa (India)|Goa]] and actually converted to Christianity under the name Dom Manuel. It was decided to dethrone and exile Hairun and recall Tabariji in 1544. However, Tabariji died en route in Melaka, bequeathing his kingdom to the King of Portugal. Hairun, who had already been shipped away to his exile, actually visited Goa where he was received with great honour. The Goan authorities reinstalled him as Ternatan ruler and he returned in 1546. There he had the opportunity to see the well-known [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] [[Francis Xavier]] who undertook extensive missionary work in Maluku and other parts of Asia. In fact Christianity made significant inroads in [[Halmahera]], [[Menado]], [[Siau Island]], etc.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 125-7.</ref> However, the attitude of Hairun turned increasingly Islamic and resentful of Christianity as time went by.\n\n==Ternatan-Portuguese military advances==\n\nIn spite of Hairun's increasing disillusionment with the white foreigners, he cooperated with them against external enemies. One of the four Malukan kingdoms, Jailolo on Halmahera, was led by the strongly Muslim Katarabumi who attacked newly converted Christian villages with great furor. In 1550-1551 Portuguese-Ternatan forces besieged the almost impenetrable royal seat, well defended with artillery, and took it after thee months. Jailolo's power was broken, Katarabumi was deprived of his rank as Sultan, and his son became a Sangaji (sub-ruler) under Ternate.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 130.</ref>\n\nThe main long-standing rival of Ternate was, however, Tidore. The two kingdoms coexisted in an ambivalent way, as Ternate rulers regularly married Sultans' daughters from Tidore in spite of numerous petty wars between the two. A rift appeared between Hairun and the Portuguese in 1555 since the latter confiscated the clove harvest from Makian and imprisoned the Sultan for security reasons. The enraged Ternatan chiefs now allied with the Sultan of Tidore and attacked the positions of the Portuguese, who could barely hold their own. Eventually they found reason to release Hairun and arrived to an agreement. The Tidorese ruler Kaicili Gava, however, had used the crisis to take over certain territories in Maluku which had previously been Ternatan dependencies. In a twist of events, Portuguese and Ternatan forces encircled Tolo in Halmahera and defeated the Tidorese in 1560.

During his long reign, he had a shifting relation to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] who had a stronghold in Ternate and tried to dominate the spice trade in the region. This ended with his assassination at the hands of a Portuguese soldier in 1570.\n\n==Early life==\nPortuguese seafarers from [[Melaka]] had appeared in the waters of eastern [[Indonesia]] since 1512. The trade in spices and forest products made it vital for the early colonizers to secure bases in the Maluku Islands (Moluccas) and control the enormously lucrative commerce. A fort was built on Ternate in 1522\u20131523 with the approval of the local Sultan, who hoped for military assistance to expand his own power. At the time Ternate was the most powerful of the four sultanates of [[North Maluku]], the other being [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]], [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Jailolo]]. However, the Portuguese captains soon began to dominate the royal court while the garrison evoked general discontent though their behaviour. An incident in 1535, where Ternatans attacked a Christianized village in [[Halmahera]] in defiance of the Portuguese, led to the deposing of the young Sultan [[Tabariji of Ternate|Tabariji]]. The Europeans now picked up a twelve-years old half-brother of Tabariji called Hairun Jamilu, and raised him to the throne. The self-willed actions of the Portuguese captain increased the fear and resentment among the people.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, p. 121.</ref>\n\nHairun was the son of a former Sultan, [[Bayan Sirrullah]] (d. 1521) by a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] lady.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 16.</ref> His mother was a practitioner of pre-Islamic rites and did not live at the royal court. When the Portuguese soldiers came to pick up Hairun for enthronement, she violently resisted them, realizing that her son would only become a Portuguese puppet. In the ensuing tumult she died by falling from a window. Nevertheless, Hairun was installed in the end and accepted European tutelage.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 54-6.</ref> However, another half-brother of Hairun, [[Dayal]], had been deposed some years previously and fled to the rival Sultanate [[Tidore]], based on an island in the vicinity. There he was supported by his maternal uncle, Sultan Mir, who refused to surrender Dayal. An anti-Portuguese alliance was forged between Tidore, Bacan, Jailolo and dissatisfied Ternatans. In retaliation, a Portuguese army invaded Tidore in 1536, and Dayal was mortally wounded during the fighting.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 124.</ref>\n\n==Deposal and reinstatement==\n\nHairun himself was initially forced to live in the Portuguese fort, but was allowed to live among his own people after a few years. At the beginning of his reign he was seen as an unpromising figure, and the grandees of the kingdom rather wanted Tabariji to return as their Sultan.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 40.</ref> He seemed to have an interest in Christianity, though he did not actually ask for baptism. Upon his release, however, he began to strengthen his own networks by visiting villages in the islands of Ternate, [[Makian]] and [[Moti Island|Moti]]. He also obtained the daughter of Sultan Mir of Tidore as consort. The Portuguese authorities found a more promising candidate to promote Christianization in his deposed predecessor Tabariji, who lived in exile in [[Goa (India)|Goa]] and actually converted to Christianity under the name Dom Manuel. It was decided to dethrone and exile Hairun and recall Tabariji in 1544. However, Tabariji died en route in Melaka, bequeathing his kingdom to the King of Portugal. Hairun, who had already been shipped away to his exile, actually visited Goa where he was received with great honour. The Goan authorities reinstalled him as Ternatan ruler and he returned in 1546. There he had the opportunity to see the well-known [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] [[Francis Xavier]] who undertook extensive missionary work in Maluku and other parts of Asia. In fact Christianity made significant inroads in [[Halmahera]], [[Menado]], [[Siau Island]], etc.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 125-7.</ref> However, the attitude of Hairun turned increasingly Islamic and resentful of Christianity as time went by.\n\n==Ternatan-Portuguese military advances==\n\nIn spite of Hairun's increasing disillusionment with the white foreigners, he cooperated with them against external enemies. One of the four Malukan kingdoms, Jailolo on Halmahera, was led by the strongly Muslim Katarabumi who attacked newly converted Christian villages with great furor. In 1550-1551 Portuguese-Ternatan forces besieged the almost impenetrable royal seat, well defended with artillery, and took it after thee months. Jailolo's power was broken, Katarabumi was deprived of his rank as Sultan, and his son became a Sangaji (sub-ruler) under Ternate.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 130.</ref>\n\nThe main long-standing rival of Ternate was, however, Tidore. The two kingdoms coexisted in an ambivalent way, as Ternate rulers regularly married Sultans' daughters from Tidore in spite of numerous petty wars between the two. A rift appeared between Hairun and the Portuguese in 1555 since the latter confiscated the clove harvest from Makian and imprisoned the Sultan for security reasons. The enraged Ternatan chiefs now allied with the Sultan of Tidore and attacked the positions of the Portuguese, who could barely hold their own. Eventually they found reason to release Hairun and arrived to an agreement. The Tidorese ruler Kaicili Gava, however, had used the crisis to take over certain territories in Maluku which had previously been Ternatan dependencies. In a twist of events, Portuguese and Ternatan forces encircled Tolo in Halmahera and defeated the Tidorese in 1560. Gava was forced to submit, but was soon murdered by the Ternate ruler on a state visit.<ref>P.A.

Additionally, individuals with PTSD may exhibit irritable or aggressive, self-destructive behavior, and hypervigilance, amongst other arousal-related symptoms.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nMoral injury can also be experienced by warriors who have been transgressed against and thus also in circumstances other than combat. The injury may in those cases include a sense of betrayal and anger.<ref name=\"Molendijk2019\" /> For example, when one goes to war believing that the purpose of the war is to eradicate weapons of mass destruction, but finds that not to be the case, the soldier can experience moral injury.

Additionally, individuals with PTSD may exhibit irritable or aggressive, self-destructive behavior, and hypervigilance, amongst other arousal-related symptoms.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nMoral injury can also be experienced by warriors who have been transgressed against and thus also in circumstances other than combat.

In the healthcare literature, moral injury refers to the accumulation of negative effects by continued exposure to morally distressing situations.<ref>Rushton, C. H. (2018). Moral Resilience: Transforming moral suffering in healthcare. New York: Oxford City Press.</ref>\nIn 2000 the concept of ''moral distress'' being generated by systemic issues had been termed, \"the ethical canary\".<ref>Sommerville, M. (2000). The ethical canary: Science, society and the human spirit. New York, NY: Viking.{{pn|date=January 2020}}</ref> to draw attention to the sensation of moral distress signaling a need for systemic change.\nIn 2018 it was suggested that moral injury can occur among physicians and other emergency or first responder care providers who engage in traumatic high-impact or resource-limited work environments which can affect their mental health and well-being. The concept of moral injury in healthcare is the expansion of the discussion around [[compassion fatigue]] and 'burnout.'<ref name=\":3\">{{cite news |first1=Simon G. |last1=Talbot |first2=Wendy |last2=Dean |title=Physicians aren't 'burning out.'
