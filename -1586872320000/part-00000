The beam is directed towards the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector located  295&nbsp;km away in [[Hida, Gifu|Hida]]-city [[Gifu prefecture|Gifu]]. The properties and composition of the neutrino flux are first measured by a system of near detectors located 280 m from the beam production place at the J-PARC site, and then again in the Super-Kamiokande detector. Comparison of the content of different neutrino flavours in these two locations allows measurement of the oscillations probability on the way between near and far detectors. Super-Kamiokande is able to detect interactions of both, muon and electron neutrinos, and thus measure the disappearance of muon neutrino flux, as well as electron neutrino appearance in the beam.<ref

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8&nbsp;cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2042F |language=en |issn=1742-6588|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment. The HK experiment is expected to start operation around the year 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\">{{cite news|url=http://www.j-parc.jp/c/en/topics/2020/02/12000416.html|title=The Hyper-Kamiokande project is officially approved.|date=12 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboraion |title=Physics potential of a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using a J-PARC neutrino beam and Hyper-Kamiokande |journal=Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics |date=19 May 2015 |volume=2015 |issue=5 |pages=53C02\u20130 |doi=10.1093/ptep/ptv061 |arxiv=1502.05199|bibcode=2015PTEP.2015e3C02A }}</ref>\n\n====Hyper-Kamiokande detector====\n\nThe Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be a [[water]] [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] detector, 5 times larger (258 kton of water) than the [[Super-Kamiokande]] detector. It will be a [[cylinder]] of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes of 50&nbsp;cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20&nbsp;cm diameter. It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]]. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\"/>\n\n====Intermediate Water Cherenkov====\n\nThe Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7\u20132&nbsp;km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "text_old": "'''T2K''' ('''[[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka, Gifu|Kamioka]]''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment studying the [[neutrino oscillations|oscillations]] of the [[accelerator neutrinos]].

Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam.

The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton.

The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons.

ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket.

By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment.

It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "name_user": "Batmann", "label": "safe", "comment": "sources", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2K_experiment"}
