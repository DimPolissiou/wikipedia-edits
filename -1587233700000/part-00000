Throughout the 1920s, Williams would have a string of successful films, mostly westerns.\n\nHe then appeared in ''[[The Great Meadow]]'' alongside [[Johnny Mack Brown]], which was Brown's breakout film. Throughout the 1930s, Williams acted in supporting roles, mostly in westerns, sports, or outdoor dramas.

He often played alongside [[Hoot Gibson]] and [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] during that period. In 1941, he became one of many actors cast by [[Universal Pictures]] in their large film series, ''[[Riders of Death Valley]]''. From the late 1930s to the mid-1940s, Williams appeared in supporting roles in a number of A-pictures, sometimes with high billing, such as ''You Only Live Once'', and in Columbia's first Technicolor film, ''[[The Desperadoes]]'' (1943).\n\nWilliams was frequently teamed with [[Alan Hale, Sr.]] as sidekicks to [[Errol Flynn]] in several of his pictures.

Learning the Law. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. p.&nbsp;9.</ref> that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in [[legal liability]] for the person who commits a tortious act. It can include the intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, financial losses, injuries, invasion of privacy and many other things. \n\nTort law, a suit where the purpose of a legal [[Lawsuit|action]] is to obtain a private [[civil remedy]] such as [[damages]], may be compared to [[criminal law]], which deals with [[crime|criminal wrongs]] that are punishable by the state. Tort law may also be contrasted with [[contract law]], which also provides a civil remedy after breach of duty; but whereas the contractual [[law of obligations|obligation]] is one chosen by the parties, the obligation in both tort and crime is imposed by the state{{citation needed|reason=In common law jurisdictions, it's not clear that the wrong derives from the state's determination (though the penalty may)|date=December 2019}}.

Although [[crime]]s may be torts, the [[cause of action|cause of legal action]] in civil torts is not necessarily the result of criminal action; the harm in civil torts may be due to [[negligence]], which does not amount to [[criminal negligence]]. The victim of the harm can recover their loss as [[damages]] in a [[lawsuit]]. In order to prevail, the [[plaintiff]] in the lawsuit, commonly referred to as the '''injured party''', must show that the actions or lack of action was the [[proximate cause|legally recognizable cause]] of the harm. The equivalent of tort in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law jurisdictions]] is \"[[delict]]\".\n\n'''Legal injuries''' are not limited to [[Physical injury|physical injuries]] and may include emotional, economic,{{NoteTag|[[Pure economic loss]] is rarely recoverable.}} or reputational injuries as well as violations of [[Privacy law|privacy]], property, or constitutional rights. Torts comprise such varied topics as [[auto accidents|automobile accidents]], [[false imprisonment]], [[defamation]], [[product liability]], [[copyright infringement]], and environmental pollution ([[toxic torts]]). \n\nCompared to criminal cases, tort lawsuits have a lower burden of proof, namely \"[[preponderance of evidence]]\",{{NoteTag|where the plaintiff/claimant must prove their case on \"a balance of probability\"}} rather than [[beyond a reasonable doubt]]. Sometimes a claimant may prevail in a tort case even if the defendant who allegedly caused harm were acquitted in an earlier criminal trial. For example, [[O. J. Simpson]] was acquitted in criminal court of [[murder]] but later found liable for the tort of [[wrongful death]]. \n\nBoth tort law and criminal law may impose liability where there is:\n* [[Intention in English law|intentional action]]\n* [[Recklessness (law)|reckless behaviour]]\n* [[negligence|carelessness]]\n* [[product liability]] (without negligence) in the US & the EU\n* \"innocence\" (or blameless inadvertence) ''provided'' there is [[strict liability]].\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of contract law}}\n\n[[Roman law]] contained provisions for torts in the form of [[delict]], which later influenced the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law jurisdictions]] in [[Continental Europe]], but a distinctive body of law arose in the [[common law]] word traced to [[English tort law]]. The word 'tort' was first used in a legal context in the 1580s,{{NoteTag|The word is derived from Old French and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] \"tort\" (injury), which is derived from [[Medieval Latin]] ''{{lang|la|tortum}}''.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tort&allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref>}} although different words were used for similar concepts prior to this time.\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nTorts and crimes at common law originate in the [[Germanic law|Germanic]] system of compensatory [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] for wrongs ([[Old English|OE]] ''unriht''), with no clear distinction between crimes and other wrongs.<ref name=Malone/> In [[Anglo-Saxon law]], most wrongs required payment in money or in kind (''b\u014dt'', literally 'remedy') to the wronged person or their clan.<ref>See [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.asp Medieval Sourcebook: The Anglo-Saxon Dooms, 560\u2013975].

Assessing intention was a matter for the court, but [[Alfred the Great]]'s [[Doom Book]] did distinguish unintentional injuries from intentional ones, whereas culpability depended on status, age, and gender.\n\nAfter the [[Norman Conquest]], fines were paid only to courts or the king, and quickly became a revenue source. A wrong became known as a ''tort'' or ''trespass'', and there arose a division between civil pleas and pleas of the crown.<ref>David Ibbetson, \"Tort: English Common Law\", in ''The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History'', vol. 5 (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009), 467.</ref> The petty assizes (i.e. [[Assize of novel disseisin|of novel disseisin]], [[Assize of mort d'ancestor|of mort d'ancestor]], and [[Assize of darrein presentment|of darrein presentment]]) were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land. The [[trespass]] action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim; if no payment was made, the defendant was imprisoned. The plea arose in local courts for [[slander]], [[breach of contract]], or interference with land, goods, or persons. Although the details of its exact origin are unclear, it became popular in royal courts so that in the 1250s the writ of trespass was created and made ''de cursu'' (available by right, not fee); however, it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king's peace. It may have arisen either out of the \"appeal of felony\", or assize of novel disseisin, or [[replevin]]. Later, after the [[Statute of Westminster 1285]], in the 1360s, the \"trespass on the case\" action arose for when the defendant did not direct force.<ref name=Malone/> As its scope increased, it became simply \"action on the case\". The English Judicature Act passed 1873 through 1875 abolished the separate actions of trespass and trespass on the case.<ref name=Malone/>\n\nIn 1401, the English case ''[[Beaulieu v Finglam]]'' imposed strict liability for the escape of fire; additionally, strict liability was imposed for the release of cattle.<ref name=Malone/> Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources.

In the case of the United States, a survey of trial lawyers pointed to several modern developments, including strict liability for products based on ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products'', the limitation of various immunities (e.g. [[sovereign immunity]], [[charitable immunity]]), [[comparative negligence]], broader rules for admitting evidence, increased damages for [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]], and [[toxic tort]]s and [[class action]] lawsuits. However, there has also been a reaction in terms of [[tort reform]], which in some cases have been struck down as violating state constitutions, and federal preemption of state laws.<ref name=Top10>American Association for Justice (1996).

Even among common law countries, however, significant differences exist. For example, in England legal fees of the winner are paid by the loser (the [[English rule (attorney's fees)|English rule]] versus the [[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]] of attorney fees). Common law systems include [[United States tort law]], [[Australian tort law]], [[Canadian tort law]], [[Irish tort law]], and [[Delict (Scots law)|Scots Law of Delict]]. The Jewish law of [[Damages (Jewish law)|rabbinic damages]] is another example although tort in [[Israeli law]] is technically similar to English law as it was enacted by [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] authorities in 1944 and took effect in 1947.

Particularly in the United States, \"collateral tort\" is used to refer to torts in [[labour law]] such as [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] (\"outrage\");<ref>Chamallas M, Vriggins JB. (2010).

''Texas Law Review''.</ref>\n\nThe most common action in tort is '''negligence'''. The tort of negligence provides a cause of action leading to damages, or to relief, in each case designed to protect legal rights, including those of personal safety, property, and, in some cases, intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]] in the United States. Negligence actions include claims coming primarily from car accidents and [[personal injury]] accidents of many kinds, including clinical negligence, worker's negligence and so forth. [[Product liability]] cases, such as those involving warranties, may also be considered negligence actions or, particularly in the United States, may apply regardless of negligence or intention through [[strict liability]].\n\n'''Intentional torts''' include, among others, certain torts arising from the occupation or use of land. The tort of nuisance, for example, involves strict liability for a neighbor who interferes with another's enjoyment of his real property. Trespass allows owners to sue for entrances by a person (or his structure, such as an overhanging building) on their land. Several intentional torts do not involve land. Examples include false imprisonment, the tort of unlawfully arresting or detaining someone, and defamation (in some jurisdictions split into [[libel]] and [[slander]]), where false information is broadcast and damages the plaintiff's reputation. Other intentional torts include Battery, Assault, Trespass to Chattels, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Misrepresentation, and Alienation of Affections.\n\nIn some cases, the development of tort law has spurred lawmakers to create alternative solutions to disputes. For example, in some areas, [[workers' compensation]] laws arose as a legislative response to court rulings restricting the extent to which employees could sue their employers in respect of injuries sustained during employment. In other cases, legal commentary has led to the development of new causes of action outside the traditional common law torts. These are loosely grouped into '''quasi-torts''' or liability torts.<ref name=\"Atiyah\" />\n=== Negligence ===\n{{Main article|Negligence}}\nNegligence is a tort which arises from the breach of the [[duty of care]] owed by one person to another from the perspective of a [[reasonable person]]. Although credited as appearing in the United States in ''[[Brown v. Kendall]]'', the later Scottish case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562, followed in England, brought England into line with the United States and established the 'tort of negligence' as opposed to negligence as a component in specific actions.<ref>Ferrari F. (1994). [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=annlsurvey Donoghue v. Stevenson's 60th Anniversary]. ''Annual Survey of International & Comparative Law''.</ref> In ''Donoghue'', Mrs. Donoghue drank from an opaque bottle containing a decomposed snail and claimed that it had made her ill. She could not sue Mr. Stevenson for damages for breach of contract and instead sued for negligence. The majority determined that the definition of negligence can be divided into four component parts that the plaintiff must prove to establish negligence. The elements in determining the liability for negligence are:{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n* The plaintiff was owed a '''duty of care''' through a special relationship (e.g. doctor-patient) or some other principle\n* There was a '''dereliction or breach''' of that duty\n* The tortfeasor '''directly caused''' the injury [but for the defendant's actions, the plaintiff would not have suffered an injury].\n* The plaintiff suffered '''damage''' as a result of that breach\n* The damage was not too '''remote'''; there was [[proximate cause]] to show the breach caused the damage\nIn certain cases, negligence can be assumed under the doctrine of ''[[res ipsa loquitur]]'' (Latin for \"the thing itself speaks\"); particularly in the United States, a related concept is ''[[negligence per se]]''.<ref>Twerski. (2009). Third Restatement of Torts: Issue One: Article: Negligence Per Se and Res Ipsa Loquitur: Kissing Cousins. ''Wake Forest Law Review''.

However, as per [[Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords|Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v. Peat Marwick Hungerfords]], such auditors do NOT provide a duty of care to third parties who rely on their reports. An exception is where the auditor provides the third party with a privity letter, explicitly stating the third party can rely on the report for a specific purpose. In such cases, the privity letter establishes a duty of care.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sadler|first=Pauline|date=2009|title=Liability for Negligent Misrepresentation in the Finance Industry|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/LegIssBus/2009/3.pdf}} (2009) 11 Legal Issues In Business 17.</ref>\n\nThe case ''[[Chapman v Hearse]]'' added to the precedent of negligence where in previous cases reasonable foreseeability was applied narrowly to include all predictable actions, ''Chapman v Hearse'' extended this to include all damages of the same nature which could be reasonably foreseen.<ref>''Chapman v Hearse'' (1961) 106 CLR 112</ref> \n\n==== Proximate cause ====\n{{Main article|Proximate cause}}\nProximate cause means that you must be able to show that the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for.<ref name=\"March v Stamare\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1991|litigants=[[March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/torts/torts12.htm Ch. 12, Proximate or legal cause] LexisNexis Study Outline.</ref> The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a superseding intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.

Intentional torts have several subcategories:\n*Torts against the person include [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]], [[false imprisonment]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]], and [[fraud]], although the latter is also an [[economic tort]].\n*Property torts involve any intentional interference with the property rights of the claimant (plaintiff). Those commonly recognized include trespass to land, trespass to chattels (personal property), and conversion.\nAn intentional tort requires an overt act, some form of intent, and causation. In most cases, transferred intent, which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual, will satisfy the intent requirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/torts/againstProperty/transferredIntent.asp|title=Transferred Intent - LawShelf Educational Media|website=nationalparalegal.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010010523/https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/transferred-intent|archive-date=2017-10-10|url-status=}}</ref> Causation can be satisfied as long as the defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm.\n\n=== Statutory torts ===\nA statutory tort is like any other, in that it imposes duties on private or public parties, however they are created by the legislature, not the courts. For example, the European Union's ''Product Liability Directive'' imposes strict liability for defective products that harm people; such strict liability is not uncommon although not necessarily statutory.\n\nAs another example, in England common law liability of a landowner to guests or trespassers was replaced by the [[Occupiers' Liability Act 1957]]; a similar situation occurred in the U.S. State of California in which a judicial common law rule established in ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'' was amended through a 1985 statute.<ref>''Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t714.htm 19 Cal. 4th 714] (1998).</ref> Statutory torts also spread across workplace health and safety laws and health and safety in food. In some cases federal or state statutes may preempt tort actions, which is particularly discussed in terms of the U.S. [[FDA Preemption]];<ref>Glantz LH, Annas GJ. (2008).

Medtronic, Inc.]]'' (2008), actions for medical drugs are not due to ''[[Wyeth v. Levine]]'' (2009).\n\n=== Nuisance ===\n{{Main article|Nuisance}}\n\"Nuisance\" is traditionally used to describe an activity which is harmful or annoying to others such as indecent conduct or a rubbish heap. Nuisances either affect private individuals (private nuisance) or the general public (public nuisance). The claimant can sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. In English law, whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was \"for the benefit of the commonwealth\", with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet.<ref name=Nuisance>Cavert W.

In ''[[Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc]]'' (1994), chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's water reservoirs.<ref name=\"ElworthyHolder\">{{cite book|last1=Elworthy|first1=Sue|last2=Holder|first2=Jane|title=Environmental Protection|date=1 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-406-03770-1|page=67|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/law-general-interest/environmental-protection-text-and-materials?format=PB&isbn=9780521613538|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808211159/http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/law-general-interest/environmental-protection-text-and-materials?format=PB&isbn=9780521613538|archivedate=8 August 2016}}</ref> The ''Rylands'' rule remains in use in England and Wales. In Australian law, it has been merged into negligence.<ref>''[[Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd]]''</ref>\n\n=== Defamation ===\n{{Main article|Defamation}}\nDefamation is tarnishing the reputation of someone; it has two varieties, ''slander'' and ''libel''. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is printed or broadcast defamation. The two otherwise share the same features: making a factual assertion for which evidence does not exist. Defamation does not affect or hinder the voicing of opinions, but does occupy the same fields as rights to free speech in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Related to defamation in the U.S. are the actions for misappropriation of publicity, invasion of privacy, and disclosure. Abuse of process and malicious prosecution are often classified as dignitary torts as well.\n\n=== Business torts ===\n{{Main article|Economic tort|Misrepresentation}}\nBusiness torts (i.e., economic torts) typically involve commercial transactions, and include [[tortious interference]] with trade or contract, fraud, injurious falsehood, and negligent misrepresentation. Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation in that there is no [[privity]] of contract; these torts are likely to involve [[pure economic loss]] which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the \"foreseeability\" doctrine.<ref>Christie GC. (1996).

However, in the United States, private parties are permitted in certain circumstances to sue for anticompetitive practices, including under federal or state statutes or on the basis of common law [[tortious interference]], which may be based upon the [[Restatement of Torts, Second|Restatement (Second) of Torts]] \u00a7766.<ref>Saferstein HI.

Liability may arise through [[enterprise liability]]. Other concepts include [[market share liability]].\n\n=== Vicarious liability ===\n{{Main|Vicarious liability}}\n\nIn certain cases, a person might be liable for their employee or child under the [[law of agency]] through the doctrine of [[respondeat superior]]. For example, if a shop employee spilled cleaning liquid on the supermarket floor and a victim fell and suffered injuries, the plaintiff might be able to sue either the employee or the employer. There is considerable academic debate about whether vicarious liability is justified on no better basis than the search for a solvent defendant, or whether it is well founded on the theory of efficient risk allocation.\n\n=== Defenses ===\n{{Main|Defense (legal)}}\n\nA successful defense absolves the defendant from full or partial liability for damages. Apart from proof that there was no breach of duty, there are three principal defenses to tortious liability.\n\n==== Consent and warning ====\n{{Main|Consent|Waiver}}\n\nTypically, a victim cannot hold another liable if the victim has implicitly or explicitly consented to engage in a risky activity. This is frequently summarized by the maxim \"[[volenti non fit injuria]]\" (Latin: \"to a willing person, no injury is done\" or \"no injury is done to a person who consents\"). In many cases, those engaging in risky activities will be asked to sign a [[waiver]] releasing another party from liability.\n\nFor example, spectators to certain sports are assumed to accept a risk of injury, such as a hockey puck or baseball striking a member of the audience. Warnings by the defendant may also provide a defense depending upon the jurisdiction and circumstances. This issue arises, for example, in the [[duty of care]] that landowners have for guests or trespasses, known as occupiers' liability.\n\n==== Comparative or contributory negligence ====\n{{Main article|Comparative negligence|Contributory negligence}}\nIf the victim has contributed to causing their own harm through negligent or irresponsible actions, the damages may be reduced or eliminated entirely. The English case [[Butterfield v. Forrester]] (1809) established this defense. In England, this \"[[contributory negligence]]\" became a partial defense, but in the United States, any fault by the victim completely eliminated any damages.<ref name=Little2007>Little WBL. (2007).

''Campbell Law Review''.</ref> This meant that if the plaintiff was 1% at fault, the victim would lose the entire lawsuit.<ref name=Little2007/> This was viewed as unnecessarily harsh and therefore amended to a [[comparative negligence]] system in many states; as of 2007 contributory negligence exists in only a few states such as North Carolina and Maryland.<ref name=Little2007/>\n\nIn comparative negligence, the victim's damages are reduced according to the degree of fault. Comparative negligence has been criticized as allowing a plaintiff who is recklessly 95% negligent to recover 5% of the damages from the defendant. Economists have further criticized comparative negligence as not encouraging precaution under the [[calculus of negligence]]. In response, many states now have a 50% rule where the plaintiff recovers nothing if the plaintiff is more than 50% responsible.\n\n==== Illegality ====\nIf the claimant is involved in wrongdoing at the time the alleged negligence occurred, this may extinguish or reduce the defendant's liability. The legal maxim ''[[ex turpi causa non oritur actio]]'', Latin for \"no right of action arises from a despicable cause\". Thus, if a burglar is verbally challenged by the property owner and sustains injury when jumping from a second story window to escape apprehension, there is no cause of action against the property owner even though that injury would not have been sustained but for the property owner's intervention.\n\n==== Other defenses and immunities ====\n{{Further information|Sovereign immunity|Good Samaritan law|Charitable immunity}}\n\nHistorically, immunity has been granted to governments under [[sovereign immunity]] and to charitable organizations under [[charitable immunity]], although these have eroded in the United States.<ref name=Top10/>\n\nVarious laws limit liability when giving aid to a person in need; liability can arise from a failure to help due to the [[duty to rescue]].\n\n=== Remedies ===\nThe main remedy against tortious loss is compensation in [[damages]] or money. In a limited range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defense against the tort of battery. Further, in the case of a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an [[injunction]], such as in the English case ''[[Miller v Jackson]]'' (1977). This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm. Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some [[Australia|Australian]] jurisdictions can make an order for [[specific performance]] to ensure that the [[defendant]] carries out their legal obligations, especially in relation to nuisance matters.<ref>Currie, S., & Cameron, D. (2000), \"Your Law\", ''Nelson Thomson Learning'', Melbourne, p. 225</ref>\n\n== Theory and reform ==\n{{Main article|Tort reform}}\nScholars and lawyers have identified conflicting aims for the law of tort, to some extent reflected in the different types of damages awarded by the courts: [[Damages#Compensatory damages|compensatory]], [[aggravation (law)|aggravated]],<ref>Chapman B. (2008). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1151920&download=yes Punitive Damages as Aggravated Damages: The Case of Contract]. ''Canadian Business Law Journal''.</ref> and [[punitive damages|punitive]]. British scholar [[Glanville Williams]] notes four possible bases on which different torts rested: appeasement, justice, deterrence and compensation.<ref>Williams, G. [1951] \"The Aims of the Law of Tort\", ''Current Legal Problems'' 137</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1950s a group of legally oriented economists and economically oriented lawyers known as [[law and economics]] scholars emphasized incentives and deterrence, and identified the aim of tort as being the efficient distribution of [[risk]]. [[Ronald Coase]], a principal proponent, argued in ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960) that the aim of tort law, when [[transaction cost]]s are high, should be to reflect as closely as possible the allocation of risk and liability at which private parties arrive when transaction costs are low.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Coase, R.

Some calls for reform stress the difficulties encountered by potential claimants. For example, because not all people who have accidents can find solvent defendants from which to recover damages in the courts, [[P. S. Atiyah]] has called the situation a \"damages lottery\".<ref>Atiyah, P. S. (1997) ''The Damages Lottery''</ref> Consequently, in [[New Zealand]], the government in the 1960s established a [[No-fault insurance|no-fault system]] of state compensation for [[Accident Compensation Corporation|accidents]]. Similar proposals have been the subject of [[command paper]]s in the UK and much academic debate.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the U.S., reform has typically limited the scope of tort law and damages available, such as limiting [[joint and several liability]], the [[collateral source rule]], or capping noneconomic damages for [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]] or [[punitive damages]]. These reform statutes are sometimes rejected as unconstitutional under the [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] by [[state supreme court]]s,<ref>Schwartz VE. (1997).

Circumstances such as those involving professional negligence<ref name=Harpwood/> may involve both torts and contracts. The choice may affect time limits or damages, particularly given that damages are typically relatively limited in contract cases while in tort cases noneconomic [[damages]] such as [[pain and suffering]] may be awarded.<ref name=Harpwood/> [[Punitive damage]]s are relatively uncommon in contractual cases versus tort cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Timothy J.|date=1976|title=Punitive damages in the law of contract: the reality and the illusion of legal change.|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1504&context=facpubs|journal=Minnesota Law Review|volume=61|pages=207|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216042004/http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1504&context=facpubs|archivedate=16 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, compensation for defective but not unsafe products is typically available only through contractual actions<ref name=Harpwood/> through the law of [[warranty]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, plaintiffs in professional negligence cases have some degree of choice in which law while in commercial transactions contract law applies; in unusual cases, intangible losses have been awarded in contract law cases.<ref name=Harpwood/>\n\nThe English case [[Hadley v Baxendale|''Hadley v. Baxendale'']] (1854), which was adopted in the United States, split contract and tort damages by foreseeability of the damages when the contract was made.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/publications/under_construction/2016/winter2016/economic_loss_rule.html|title=A \"Simple\" Explanation of the Economic-Loss Rule {{!}} Forum on the Construction Industry|website=www.americanbar.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506124315/http://www.americanbar.org/publications/under_construction/2016/winter2016/economic_loss_rule.html|archive-date=6 May 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-03-25|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the United States, the [[pure economic loss]] rule was adopted to further prevent negligence lawsuits in breach of contract cases.<ref name=\":1\" /> This \"economic loss rule\" was adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ''East River Steamship Corp V Transamerica Delaval Inc.'' (1986) and expanded across the country in a non-uniform manner, leading to confusion.<ref name=\":0\" /> Among other examples, the tort of [[insurance bad faith]] arises out of a contractual relationship, and \"collateral torts\" such as [[wrongful dismissal]] involving possible overlap with [[labour law]] contracts.<ref name=Gergen/>\n\n== Overlap with criminal law ==\nThere is some overlap between criminal law and tort. For example, in [[English law]] an assault is both a crime and a tort (a form of trespass to the person). A tort allows a person, usually the victim, to obtain a remedy that serves their own purposes (for example by the payment of [[damages]] to a person injured in a car accident, or the obtaining of [[injunctive relief]] to stop a person interfering with their business). Criminal actions on the other hand are pursued not to obtain remedies to assist a person{{spaced ndash}}although often criminal courts do have power to grant such remedies{{spaced ndash}}but to remove their liberty on the state's behalf. This explains why [[incarceration]] is usually available as a penalty for serious crimes, but not usually for torts. In early common law, the distinction between crime and tort was not distinct.<ref>Simmons KW. (2007). [http://www.bu.edu/lawlibrary/facultypublications/PDFs/Simons/Crim_Torts_Distinction.pdf The Crime/Tort Distinction: Legal Doctrine And Normative Perspectives]. ''Widener Law Review''.</ref>\n\nThe more severe penalties available in criminal law also means that it requires a higher [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] to be discharged than the related tort. For example, in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O. J. Simpson murder trial]], the jury was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that [[O. J. Simpson]] had committed the crime of [[murder]]; but in a later civil trial, the jury in that case decided that there was sufficient evidence to meet the standard of [[preponderance of the evidence]] required to prove the tort of [[wrongful death]].<ref>''Rufo v. Simpson'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/86CA4t573.htm 86 Cal. App. 4th 573] (2001).</ref>\n\nMany jurisdictions, especially the US, retain [[punitive damages|punitive]] elements in tort damages, for example in anti-trust and consumer-related torts, making tort blur the line with criminal acts. Also there are situations where, particularly if the defendant ignores the orders of the court, a plaintiff can obtain a punitive remedy against the defendant, including imprisonment. Some torts may have a public element{{spaced ndash}}for example, [[nuisance|public nuisance]]{{spaced ndash}}and sometimes actions in tort will be brought by a public body. Also, while criminal law is primarily punitive, many jurisdictions have developed forms of monetary compensation or restitution which criminal courts can directly order the defendant to pay to the victim.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Law and economics ==\nWilliam M.

Although [[crime]]s may be torts, the [[cause of action|cause of legal action]] in civil torts is not necessarily the result of criminal action; the harm in civil torts may be due to [[negligence]], which does not amount to [[criminal negligence]]. The victim of the harm can recover their loss as [[damages]] in a [[lawsuit]]. In order to prevail, the [[plaintiff]] in the lawsuit, commonly referred to as the '''injured party''', must show that the actions or lack of action was the [[proximate cause|legally recognizable cause]] of the harm. The equivalent of tort in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law jurisdictions]] is \"[[delict]]\".\n\n'''Legal injuries''' are not limited to [[Physical injury|physical injuries]] and may include emotional, economic,{{NoteTag|[[Pure economic loss]] is rarely recoverable.}} or reputational injuries as well as violations of [[Privacy law|privacy]], property, or constitutional rights. Torts comprise such varied topics as [[auto accidents|automobile accidents]], [[false imprisonment]], [[defamation]], [[product liability]], [[copyright infringement]], and environmental pollution ([[toxic torts]]). \n\nCompared to criminal cases, tort lawsuits have a lower burden of proof, namely \"[[preponderance of evidence]]\",{{NoteTag|where the plaintiff/claimant must prove their case on \"a balance of probability\"}} rather than [[beyond a reasonable doubt]]. Sometimes a claimant may prevail in a tort case even if the defendant who allegedly caused harm were acquitted in an earlier criminal trial. For example, [[O. J. Simpson]] was acquitted in criminal court of [[murder]] but later found liable for the tort of [[wrongful death]]. \n\nBoth tort law and criminal law may impose liability where there is:\n* [[Intention in English law|intentional action]]\n* [[Recklessness (law)|reckless behaviour]]\n* [[negligence|carelessness]]\n* [[product liability]] (without negligence) in the US & the EU\n* \"innocence\" (or blameless inadvertence) ''provided'' there is [[strict liability]].\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of contract law}}\n\n[[Roman law]] contained provisions for torts in the form of [[delict]], which later influenced the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law jurisdictions]] in [[Continental Europe]], but a distinctive body of law arose in the [[common law]] word traced to [[English tort law]]. The word 'tort' was first used in a legal context in the 1580s,{{NoteTag|The word is derived from Old French and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] \"tort\" (injury), which is derived from [[Medieval Latin]] ''{{lang|la|tortum}}''.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tort&allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref>}} although different words were used for similar concepts prior to this time.\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nTorts and crimes at common law originate in the [[Germanic law|Germanic]] system of compensatory [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] for wrongs ([[Old English|OE]] ''unriht''), with no clear distinction between crimes and other wrongs.<ref name=Malone/> In [[Anglo-Saxon law]], most wrongs required payment in money or in kind (''b\u014dt'', literally 'remedy') to the wronged person or their clan.<ref>See [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.asp Medieval Sourcebook: The Anglo-Saxon Dooms, 560\u2013975].

A wrong became known as a ''tort'' or ''trespass'', and there arose a division between civil pleas and pleas of the crown.<ref>David Ibbetson, \"Tort: English Common Law\", in ''The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History'', vol. 5 (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009), 467.</ref> The petty assizes (i.e. [[Assize of novel disseisin|of novel disseisin]], [[Assize of mort d'ancestor|of mort d'ancestor]], and [[Assize of darrein presentment|of darrein presentment]]) were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land. The [[trespass]] action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim; if no payment was made, the defendant was imprisoned. The plea arose in local courts for [[slander]], [[breach of contract]], or interference with land, goods, or persons. Although the details of its exact origin are unclear, it became popular in royal courts so that in the 1250s the writ of trespass was created and made ''de cursu'' (available by right, not fee); however, it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king's peace. It may have arisen either out of the \"appeal of felony\", or assize of novel disseisin, or [[replevin]]. Later, after the [[Statute of Westminster 1285]], in the 1360s, the \"trespass on the case\" action arose for when the defendant did not direct force.<ref name=Malone/> As its scope increased, it became simply \"action on the case\".

Even among common law countries, however, significant differences exist. For example, in England legal fees of the winner are paid by the loser (the [[English rule (attorney's fees)|English rule]] versus the [[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]] of attorney fees). Common law systems include [[United States tort law]], [[Australian tort law]], [[Canadian tort law]], [[Irish tort law]], and [[Delict (Scots law)|Scots Law of Delict]]. The Jewish law of [[Damages (Jewish law)|rabbinic damages]] is another example although tort in [[Israeli law]] is technically similar to English law as it was enacted by [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] authorities in 1944 and took effect in 1947.

Particularly in the United States, \"collateral tort\" is used to refer to torts in [[labour law]] such as [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] (\"outrage\");<ref>Chamallas M, Vriggins JB. (2010).

''Texas Law Review''.</ref>\n\nThe most common action in tort is '''negligence'''. The tort of negligence provides a cause of action leading to damages, or to relief, in each case designed to protect legal rights, including those of personal safety, property, and, in some cases, intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]] in the United States. Negligence actions include claims coming primarily from car accidents and [[personal injury]] accidents of many kinds, including clinical negligence, worker's negligence and so forth. [[Product liability]] cases, such as those involving warranties, may also be considered negligence actions or, particularly in the United States, may apply regardless of negligence or intention through [[strict liability]].\n\n'''Intentional torts''' include, among others, certain torts arising from the occupation or use of land. The tort of nuisance, for example, involves strict liability for a neighbor who interferes with another's enjoyment of his real property. Trespass allows owners to sue for entrances by a person (or his structure, such as an overhanging building) on their land. Several intentional torts do not involve land. Examples include false imprisonment, the tort of unlawfully arresting or detaining someone, and defamation (in some jurisdictions split into [[libel]] and [[slander]]), where false information is broadcast and damages the plaintiff's reputation. Other intentional torts include Battery, Assault, Trespass to Chattels, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Misrepresentation, and Alienation of Affections.\n\nIn some cases, the development of tort law has spurred lawmakers to create alternative solutions to disputes. For example, in some areas, [[workers' compensation]] laws arose as a legislative response to court rulings restricting the extent to which employees could sue their employers in respect of injuries sustained during employment. In other cases, legal commentary has led to the development of new causes of action outside the traditional common law torts. These are loosely grouped into '''quasi-torts''' or liability torts.<ref name=\"Atiyah\" />\n=== Negligence ===\n{{Main article|Negligence}}\nNegligence is a tort which arises from the breach of the [[duty of care]] owed by one person to another from the perspective of a [[reasonable person]]. Although credited as appearing in the United States in ''[[Brown v. Kendall]]'', the later Scottish case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562, followed in England, brought England into line with the United States and established the 'tort of negligence' as opposed to negligence as a component in specific actions.<ref>Ferrari F.

''Annual Survey of International & Comparative Law''.</ref> In ''Donoghue'', Mrs. Donoghue drank from an opaque bottle containing a decomposed snail and claimed that it had made her ill. She could not sue Mr. Stevenson for damages for breach of contract and instead sued for negligence. The majority determined that the definition of negligence can be divided into four component parts that the plaintiff must prove to establish negligence. The elements in determining the liability for negligence are:{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n* The plaintiff was owed a '''duty of care''' through a special relationship (e.g. doctor-patient) or some other principle\n* There was a '''dereliction or breach''' of that duty\n* The tortfeasor '''directly caused''' the injury [but for the defendant's actions, the plaintiff would not have suffered an injury].\n* The plaintiff suffered '''damage''' as a result of that breach\n* The damage was not too '''remote'''; there was [[proximate cause]] to show the breach caused the damage\nIn certain cases, negligence can be assumed under the doctrine of ''[[res ipsa loquitur]]'' (Latin for \"the thing itself speaks\"); particularly in the United States, a related concept is ''[[negligence per se]]''.<ref>Twerski. (2009). Third Restatement of Torts: Issue One: Article: Negligence Per Se and Res Ipsa Loquitur: Kissing Cousins. ''Wake Forest Law Review''.

However, as per [[Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords|Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v. Peat Marwick Hungerfords]], such auditors do NOT provide a duty of care to third parties who rely on their reports. An exception is where the auditor provides the third party with a privity letter, explicitly stating the third party can rely on the report for a specific purpose. In such cases, the privity letter establishes a duty of care.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sadler|first=Pauline|date=2009|title=Liability for Negligent Misrepresentation in the Finance Industry|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/LegIssBus/2009/3.pdf}} (2009) 11 Legal Issues In Business 17.</ref>\n\nThe case ''[[Chapman v Hearse]]'' added to the precedent of negligence where in previous cases reasonable foreseeability was applied narrowly to include all predictable actions, ''Chapman v Hearse'' extended this to include all damages of the same nature which could be reasonably foreseen.<ref>''Chapman v Hearse'' (1961) 106 CLR 112</ref> \n\n==== Proximate cause ====\n{{Main article|Proximate cause}}\nProximate cause means that you must be able to show that the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for.<ref name=\"March v Stamare\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1991|litigants=[[March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/torts/torts12.htm Ch. 12, Proximate or legal cause] LexisNexis Study Outline.</ref> The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a superseding intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.

Intentional torts have several subcategories:\n*Torts against the person include [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]], [[false imprisonment]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]], and [[fraud]], although the latter is also an [[economic tort]].\n*Property torts involve any intentional interference with the property rights of the claimant (plaintiff). Those commonly recognized include trespass to land, trespass to chattels (personal property), and conversion.\nAn intentional tort requires an overt act, some form of intent, and causation. In most cases, transferred intent, which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual, will satisfy the intent requirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/torts/againstProperty/transferredIntent.asp|title=Transferred Intent - LawShelf Educational Media|website=nationalparalegal.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010010523/https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/transferred-intent|archive-date=2017-10-10|url-status=}}</ref> Causation can be satisfied as long as the defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm.\n\n=== Statutory torts ===\nA statutory tort is like any other, in that it imposes duties on private or public parties, however they are created by the legislature, not the courts. For example, the European Union's ''Product Liability Directive'' imposes strict liability for defective products that harm people; such strict liability is not uncommon although not necessarily statutory.\n\nAs another example, in England common law liability of a landowner to guests or trespassers was replaced by the [[Occupiers' Liability Act 1957]]; a similar situation occurred in the U.S. State of California in which a judicial common law rule established in ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'' was amended through a 1985 statute.<ref>''Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t714.htm 19 Cal. 4th 714] (1998).</ref> Statutory torts also spread across workplace health and safety laws and health and safety in food. In some cases federal or state statutes may preempt tort actions, which is particularly discussed in terms of the U.S. [[FDA Preemption]];<ref>Glantz LH, Annas GJ. (2008). [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0802108 The FDA, Preemption, and the Supreme Court]. ''New England Journal of Medicine''.</ref> although actions in the United States for medical devices are preempted due to ''[[Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.]]'' (2008), actions for medical drugs are not due to ''[[Wyeth v. Levine]]'' (2009).\n\n=== Nuisance ===\n{{Main article|Nuisance}}\n\"Nuisance\" is traditionally used to describe an activity which is harmful or annoying to others such as indecent conduct or a rubbish heap. Nuisances either affect private individuals (private nuisance) or the general public (public nuisance). The claimant can sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. In English law, whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was \"for the benefit of the commonwealth\", with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet.<ref name=Nuisance>Cavert W.

In ''[[Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc]]'' (1994), chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's water reservoirs.<ref name=\"ElworthyHolder\">{{cite book|last1=Elworthy|first1=Sue|last2=Holder|first2=Jane|title=Environmental Protection|date=1 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-406-03770-1|page=67|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/law-general-interest/environmental-protection-text-and-materials?format=PB&isbn=9780521613538|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808211159/http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/law-general-interest/environmental-protection-text-and-materials?format=PB&isbn=9780521613538|archivedate=8 August 2016}}</ref> The ''Rylands'' rule remains in use in England and Wales. In Australian law, it has been merged into negligence.<ref>''[[Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd]]''</ref>\n\n=== Defamation ===\n{{Main article|Defamation}}\nDefamation is tarnishing the reputation of someone; it has two varieties, ''slander'' and ''libel''. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is printed or broadcast defamation. The two otherwise share the same features: making a factual assertion for which evidence does not exist. Defamation does not affect or hinder the voicing of opinions, but does occupy the same fields as rights to free speech in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Related to defamation in the U.S. are the actions for misappropriation of publicity, invasion of privacy, and disclosure. Abuse of process and malicious prosecution are often classified as dignitary torts as well.\n\n=== Business torts ===\n{{Main article|Economic tort|Misrepresentation}}\nBusiness torts (i.e., economic torts) typically involve commercial transactions, and include [[tortious interference]] with trade or contract, fraud, injurious falsehood, and negligent misrepresentation. Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation in that there is no [[privity]] of contract; these torts are likely to involve [[pure economic loss]] which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the \"foreseeability\" doctrine.<ref>Christie GC. (1996).

However, in the United States, private parties are permitted in certain circumstances to sue for anticompetitive practices, including under federal or state statutes or on the basis of common law [[tortious interference]], which may be based upon the [[Restatement of Torts, Second|Restatement (Second) of Torts]] \u00a7766.<ref>Saferstein HI.

Liability may arise through [[enterprise liability]]. Other concepts include [[market share liability]].\n\n=== Vicarious liability ===\n{{Main|Vicarious liability}}\n\nIn certain cases, a person might be liable for their employee or child under the [[law of agency]] through the doctrine of [[respondeat superior]]. For example, if a shop employee spilled cleaning liquid on the supermarket floor and a victim fell and suffered injuries, the plaintiff might be able to sue either the employee or the employer. There is considerable academic debate about whether vicarious liability is justified on no better basis than the search for a solvent defendant, or whether it is well founded on the theory of efficient risk allocation.\n\n=== Defenses ===\n{{Main|Defense (legal)}}\n\nA successful defense absolves the defendant from full or partial liability for damages. Apart from proof that there was no breach of duty, there are three principal defenses to tortious liability.\n\n==== Consent and warning ====\n{{Main|Consent|Waiver}}\n\nTypically, a victim cannot hold another liable if the victim has implicitly or explicitly consented to engage in a risky activity. This is frequently summarized by the maxim \"[[volenti non fit injuria]]\" (Latin: \"to a willing person, no injury is done\" or \"no injury is done to a person who consents\"). In many cases, those engaging in risky activities will be asked to sign a [[waiver]] releasing another party from liability.\n\nFor example, spectators to certain sports are assumed to accept a risk of injury, such as a hockey puck or baseball striking a member of the audience. Warnings by the defendant may also provide a defense depending upon the jurisdiction and circumstances. This issue arises, for example, in the [[duty of care]] that landowners have for guests or trespasses, known as occupiers' liability.\n\n==== Comparative or contributory negligence ====\n{{Main article|Comparative negligence|Contributory negligence}}\nIf the victim has contributed to causing their own harm through negligent or irresponsible actions, the damages may be reduced or eliminated entirely. The English case [[Butterfield v. Forrester]] (1809) established this defense. In England, this \"[[contributory negligence]]\" became a partial defense, but in the United States, any fault by the victim completely eliminated any damages.<ref name=Little2007>Little WBL. (2007). [http://law.campbell.edu/lawreview/articles/30-1-81.pdf \"It is Much Easier to Find Fault With Others, Than to be Faultless Ourselves\": Contributory Negligence as a Bar to a Claim for Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610164112/http://law.campbell.edu/lawreview/articles/30-1-81.pdf |date=10 June 2010 }}. ''Campbell Law Review''.</ref> This meant that if the plaintiff was 1% at fault, the victim would lose the entire lawsuit.<ref name=Little2007/> This was viewed as unnecessarily harsh and therefore amended to a [[comparative negligence]] system in many states; as of 2007 contributory negligence exists in only a few states such as North Carolina and Maryland.<ref name=Little2007/>\n\nIn comparative negligence, the victim's damages are reduced according to the degree of fault. Comparative negligence has been criticized as allowing a plaintiff who is recklessly 95% negligent to recover 5% of the damages from the defendant. Economists have further criticized comparative negligence as not encouraging precaution under the [[calculus of negligence]]. In response, many states now have a 50% rule where the plaintiff recovers nothing if the plaintiff is more than 50% responsible.\n\n==== Illegality ====\nIf the claimant is involved in wrongdoing at the time the alleged negligence occurred, this may extinguish or reduce the defendant's liability. The legal maxim ''[[ex turpi causa non oritur actio]]'', Latin for \"no right of action arises from a despicable cause\". Thus, if a burglar is verbally challenged by the property owner and sustains injury when jumping from a second story window to escape apprehension, there is no cause of action against the property owner even though that injury would not have been sustained but for the property owner's intervention.\n\n==== Other defenses and immunities ====\n{{Further information|Sovereign immunity|Good Samaritan law|Charitable immunity}}\n\nHistorically, immunity has been granted to governments under [[sovereign immunity]] and to charitable organizations under [[charitable immunity]], although these have eroded in the United States.<ref name=Top10/>\n\nVarious laws limit liability when giving aid to a person in need; liability can arise from a failure to help due to the [[duty to rescue]].\n\n=== Remedies ===\nThe main remedy against tortious loss is compensation in [[damages]] or money. In a limited range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defense against the tort of battery. Further, in the case of a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an [[injunction]], such as in the English case ''[[Miller v Jackson]]'' (1977). This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm. Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some [[Australia|Australian]] jurisdictions can make an order for [[specific performance]] to ensure that the [[defendant]] carries out their legal obligations, especially in relation to nuisance matters.<ref>Currie, S., & Cameron, D.

''Canadian Business Law Journal''.</ref> and [[punitive damages|punitive]]. British scholar [[Glanville Williams]] notes four possible bases on which different torts rested: appeasement, justice, deterrence and compensation.<ref>Williams, G. [1951] \"The Aims of the Law of Tort\", ''Current Legal Problems'' 137</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1950s a group of legally oriented economists and economically oriented lawyers known as [[law and economics]] scholars emphasized incentives and deterrence, and identified the aim of tort as being the efficient distribution of [[risk]]. [[Ronald Coase]], a principal proponent, argued in ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960) that the aim of tort law, when [[transaction cost]]s are high, should be to reflect as closely as possible the allocation of risk and liability at which private parties arrive when transaction costs are low.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Coase, R.

Some calls for reform stress the difficulties encountered by potential claimants. For example, because not all people who have accidents can find solvent defendants from which to recover damages in the courts, [[P. S. Atiyah]] has called the situation a \"damages lottery\".<ref>Atiyah, P. S. (1997) ''The Damages Lottery''</ref> Consequently, in [[New Zealand]], the government in the 1960s established a [[No-fault insurance|no-fault system]] of state compensation for [[Accident Compensation Corporation|accidents]]. Similar proposals have been the subject of [[command paper]]s in the UK and much academic debate.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the U.S., reform has typically limited the scope of tort law and damages available, such as limiting [[joint and several liability]], the [[collateral source rule]], or capping noneconomic damages for [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]] or [[punitive damages]]. These reform statutes are sometimes rejected as unconstitutional under the [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] by [[state supreme court]]s,<ref>Schwartz VE. (1997).

Circumstances such as those involving professional negligence<ref name=Harpwood/> may involve both torts and contracts. The choice may affect time limits or damages, particularly given that damages are typically relatively limited in contract cases while in tort cases noneconomic [[damages]] such as [[pain and suffering]] may be awarded.<ref name=Harpwood/> [[Punitive damage]]s are relatively uncommon in contractual cases versus tort cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Timothy J.|date=1976|title=Punitive damages in the law of contract: the reality and the illusion of legal change.|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1504&context=facpubs|journal=Minnesota Law Review|volume=61|pages=207|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216042004/http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1504&context=facpubs|archivedate=16 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, compensation for defective but not unsafe products is typically available only through contractual actions<ref name=Harpwood/> through the law of [[warranty]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, plaintiffs in professional negligence cases have some degree of choice in which law while in commercial transactions contract law applies; in unusual cases, intangible losses have been awarded in contract law cases.<ref name=Harpwood/>\n\nThe English case [[Hadley v Baxendale|''Hadley v. Baxendale'']] (1854), which was adopted in the United States, split contract and tort damages by foreseeability of the damages when the contract was made.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/publications/under_construction/2016/winter2016/economic_loss_rule.html|title=A \"Simple\" Explanation of the Economic-Loss Rule {{!}} Forum on the Construction Industry|website=www.americanbar.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506124315/http://www.americanbar.org/publications/under_construction/2016/winter2016/economic_loss_rule.html|archive-date=6 May 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-03-25|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the United States, the [[pure economic loss]] rule was adopted to further prevent negligence lawsuits in breach of contract cases.<ref name=\":1\" /> This \"economic loss rule\" was adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ''East River Steamship Corp V Transamerica Delaval Inc.'' (1986) and expanded across the country in a non-uniform manner, leading to confusion.<ref name=\":0\" /> Among other examples, the tort of [[insurance bad faith]] arises out of a contractual relationship, and \"collateral torts\" such as [[wrongful dismissal]] involving possible overlap with [[labour law]] contracts.<ref name=Gergen/>\n\n== Overlap with criminal law ==\nThere is some overlap between criminal law and tort. For example, in [[English law]] an assault is both a crime and a tort (a form of trespass to the person). A tort allows a person, usually the victim, to obtain a remedy that serves their own purposes (for example by the payment of [[damages]] to a person injured in a car accident, or the obtaining of [[injunctive relief]] to stop a person interfering with their business). Criminal actions on the other hand are pursued not to obtain remedies to assist a person{{spaced ndash}}although often criminal courts do have power to grant such remedies{{spaced ndash}}but to remove their liberty on the state's behalf. This explains why [[incarceration]] is usually available as a penalty for serious crimes, but not usually for torts. In early common law, the distinction between crime and tort was not distinct.<ref>Simmons KW. (2007). [http://www.bu.edu/lawlibrary/facultypublications/PDFs/Simons/Crim_Torts_Distinction.pdf The Crime/Tort Distinction: Legal Doctrine And Normative Perspectives]. ''Widener Law Review''.</ref>\n\nThe more severe penalties available in criminal law also means that it requires a higher [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] to be discharged than the related tort. For example, in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O. J. Simpson murder trial]], the jury was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that [[O. J. Simpson]] had committed the crime of [[murder]]; but in a later civil trial, the jury in that case decided that there was sufficient evidence to meet the standard of [[preponderance of the evidence]] required to prove the tort of [[wrongful death]].<ref>''Rufo v. Simpson'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/86CA4t573.htm 86 Cal. App. 4th 573] (2001).</ref>\n\nMany jurisdictions, especially the US, retain [[punitive damages|punitive]] elements in tort damages, for example in anti-trust and consumer-related torts, making tort blur the line with criminal acts. Also there are situations where, particularly if the defendant ignores the orders of the court, a plaintiff can obtain a punitive remedy against the defendant, including imprisonment. Some torts may have a public element{{spaced ndash}}for example, [[nuisance|public nuisance]]{{spaced ndash}}and sometimes actions in tort will be brought by a public body. Also, while criminal law is primarily punitive, many jurisdictions have developed forms of monetary compensation or restitution which criminal courts can directly order the defendant to pay to the victim.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Law and economics ==\nWilliam M.

As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, [[comedies]], [[musicals]] (albeit in non-singing and non-dancing roles), adventure tales, [[war films]], and a few [[Horror film|horror]] and [[fantasy]] films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances over 60 were in Westerns; thus, \"of all the major stars whose name was associated with the Western, Scott most closely identified with it.\"<ref name=\"BFI\">Boscombe 1988.{{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nScott's more than 30 years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working with many acclaimed screen directors, including [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], [[Rouben Mamoulian]], [[Michael Curtiz]], [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], [[King Vidor]], [[Allan Dwan]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Sam Peckinpah]], [[Henry Hathaway]] (eight times), [[Ray Enright]] (seven), [[Edwin L. Marin]] (seven), [[Andre DeToth]] (six), and most notably, his seven film collaborations with [[Budd Boetticher]]. Scott also worked with a diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from [[Shirley Temple]] and [[Irene Dunne]] to [[Mae West]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]].\n\nTall (6&nbsp;ft 2\u00bd in; 189&nbsp;cm), lanky and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or \"lumbering\".<ref>Mueller 1985, p. 65.</ref> As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal \"strong, silent\" type of stoic hero. ''The BFI Companion to the Western'' noted:<blockquote>In his earlier Westerns&nbsp;... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change.

His father was George Grant Scott, born in [[Franklin, Virginia]], an administrative engineer in a textile firm. His mother was Lucille Crane Scott, born in [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]], Virginia, a member of a wealthy North Carolina family.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\">Nott 2004, p. 7.</ref> The Scott children in order of birth were: Margaret, Randolph, Katherine, Virginia, Joseph and Barbara, most born in North Carolina.<ref>U.S. Census 1900\u20131920.</ref>\n\nBecause of his family's financial status, young Randolph was able to attend private schools such as [[Woodberry Forest School]]. From an early age, Scott developed and displayed his athleticism, excelling in [[american football|football]], baseball, horse racing, and swimming.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\"/>\n\n==World War I==\nIn April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]] and shortly afterwards, Scott, then  19 years old, joined the [[United States Army]]. He served in France as an artillery observer with the 2nd Trench Mortar Battalion, [[19th Field Artillery Regiment]].<ref>Nott 2004, p. 1.</ref> His wartime experience gave him training that was put to use in his later film career,  including [[horsemanship]] and the use of [[firearms]].\n\n==After World War I==\nAfter the [[Armistice]] brought [[World War I]] to an end, Scott stayed in France and  enrolled in an artillery officers' school. Although he eventually received a commission, Scott decided to return to America and thus journeyed home around 1919.<ref name=\"Nott p. 8\">Nott 2004, p. 8.</ref>\n\nWith his military career over, Scott continued his education at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order and set his sights on becoming an all-American football player.

Fortunately, Scott's father had become acquainted with [[Howard Hughes]] and provided a letter of introduction for his son to present to the eccentric millionaire filmmaker.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] film called ''[[Sharp Shooters]]'' (1928). Despite its title and the presence of O'Brien, ''Sharp Shooters'' is not a western, as some film historians claimed. Rather, it's a romantic comedy. A print of the film survives in the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].\n\nIn the next few years, Scott continued working as an extra and bit player in several films, including ''Weary River'' (1929) with [[Richard Barthelmess]], ''[[The Far Call]]'' (1929), ''[[The Black Watch]]'' (1929) (directed by [[John Ford]] with [[John Wayne]] also uncredited) and uncredited as the Rider in ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]'' (1929) with [[Gary Cooper]]. Reputedly, Scott also served as Cooper's dialect coach in this latter film.\n\nScott was also uncredited on ''[[Dynamite (1929 film)|Dynamite]]'' (1929) directed by [[Cecil B. De Mille]], and ''[[Born Reckless (1930 film)|Born Reckless]]'' (1930).\n\n===Stage===\nOn the advice of director [[Cecil B. DeMille]], Scott gained much-needed acting experience by performing in stage plays with the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. Scott's stage roles during this period include:<ref>Nott 2004, p. 136.</ref>\n* A minister in ''Gentlemen Be Seated''\n* A butler in ''Nellie, the Beautiful Model''\n* Metellus Cimber in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''\n* Hector Malone in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Man and Superman]]''\n\nIn 1931 Scott played his first leading role (with [[Sally Blane]]) in ''[[Women Men Marry]]'' (1931), a [[lost film|film]], now apparently lost, that was made by a [[Poverty Row]] studio called Headline Pictures. A silent film by the same name from 1922, directed by Edward Dillon, has apparently been preserved, however, at Filmmuseum Amsterdam. The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:..Women Men Marry.\n\nHe followed that movie with a supporting part in a [[Warner Bros.]] production starring [[George Arliss]], ''[[A Successful Calamity]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1932 Scott appeared in a play at the Vine Street Theatre in [[Hollywood]] entitled ''Under a Virginia Moon''. His performance in this play resulted in several offers for screen tests by the major movie studios.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Scott eventually signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] at a salary of USD $400 per week ({{Inflation|USD|400|1932|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Paramount==\n===Zane Grey apprenticeship===\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 02.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Verna Hillie]] in ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 05 (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Barton MacLane]], [[Tom Kennedy (actor)|Tom Kennedy]], [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], Scott and [[Verna Hillie]] in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Noah Beery, Sr.]] and Scott in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\nScott's first role under his new [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] contract was a small supporting part in a comedy called ''[[Sky Bride]]'' (1932) starring [[Richard Arlen]] and [[Jack Oakie]].\n\nFollowing that, however, Paramount cast him as the lead in ''[[Heritage of the Desert (1932 film)|Heritage of the Desert]]'' (1932), his first significant starring role and also the one that established him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. As with ''Women Men Marry'', [[Sally Blane]] was his leading lady. [[Henry Hathaway]] made his directorial debut with ''Heritage of the Desert''. The film was popular and Scott would go on to make ten \"B\" [[Western (genre)|Western]] films loosely based on the novels of [[Zane Grey]].\n\n(Around the same time, [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] also remade some [[Zane Grey]] titles that they owned, with [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as their star.)\n\nMany of these Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films. In an effort to save on production costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired some of the same actors, such as [[Raymond Hatton]] and [[Noah Beery, Sr.|Noah Beery]], to repeat their roles. For the 1933 films ''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' and ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'', Scott's hair was darkened and he sported a trim moustache so that he could easily be matched to footage of [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], the star of the silent versions.\n\nIn his book, ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers'', film historian [[William K. Everson]] refers to the Zane Grey series as being \"uniformly good\".<ref name=\"Everson\">Everson, William K. ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers.'' New York. Citadel Press, 1992, First edition 1969.</ref> He also writes:<blockquote>''To the Last Man'' was almost a model of its kind, an exceptionally strong story of feuding families in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, with a cast worthy of an \"A\" feature, excellent direction by [[Henry Hathaway]], and an unusual climactic fight between the villain (Jack LaRue) and the ''heroine'' ([[Esther Ralston]], in an exceptionally appealing performance).\n\n''Sunset Pass''...&nbsp;was not only one of the best but also one of the most surprising in presenting Randolph Scott and [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]] as ''heavies.''</blockquote>\n\nThe Zane Grey series were a boon for Scott, as they provided him with \"an excellent training ground for both action and acting\".<ref>Nott 2005, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn between his work in the Zane Grey [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, Paramount cast Scott in several non-[[Western (genre)|Western]] roles, such as \"the other man\" in ''[[Hot Saturday]]'' (1932), with [[Nancy Carroll]] and [[Cary Grant]].\n\nScott returned to Zane Grey Westerns with ''[[Wild Horse Mesa (1932 film)|Wild Horse Mesa]]'' (1932), then was the romantic male lead in ''[[Hello, Everybody!]]'' (1933), an odd one-shot attempt to make a film star out of the popular but heavy-set radio singer [[Kate Smith]].\n\n''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' (1933) was another Zane Grey Western with Hathaway, then he was in two horror movies, ''[[Murders in the Zoo]]'' (1933) with [[Lionel Atwill]] and ''[[Supernatural (film)|Supernatural]]'' (1933) with [[Carole Lombard]].\n\nAfter the Western ''[[Sunset Pass (1933 film)|Sunset Pass]]'' (1933), Paramount loaned Scott to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], to play [[Bebe Daniels]]'s love interest in a minor romantic comedy called ''[[Cocktail Hour (film)|Cocktail Hour]]'' (1933).\n\nBack at Paramount Scott did the Westerns ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'' (1933) and ''[[To the Last Man (1933 film)|To the Last Man]]'' (1933), both with Hathaway from Grey novels. He was loaned to [[Monogram Pictures]] for ''[[Broken Dreams (1933 film)|Broken Dreams]]'' (1933) then was back with Hathaway for ''[[The Last Round-Up (1934 film)|The Last Round-Up]]'' (1934).\n\nScott did three more Zane Grey Westerns without Hathaway: ''[[Wagon Wheels (film)|Wagon Wheels]]'' (1934) directed by [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]], ''[[Home on the Range (1935 film)|Home on the Range]]'' (1935) from [[Arthur Jacobson]], and ''[[Rocky Mountain Mystery]]'' (1935) with Barton.\n\n===RKO and \"A\" Films===\nParamount loaned Scott to [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] to support [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] in ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), a hugely popular adaptation of the Broadway musical.\n\nRKO liked Scott and kept him on for ''[[Village Tale]]'' (1935), directed by John Cromwell, and ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' (1935), an adaptation of [[She (novel)|the classic novel]] by [[H. Rider Haggard]] from the makers of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.\n\nScott went back to Paramount for ''[[So Red the Rose (film)|So Red the Rose]]'' (1935) with [[Margaret Sullavan]], then was reunited with Astaire and Rogers at RKO in ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 43.</ref> It was another big hit.<ref name=\"rko\">Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', ''Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television'', Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p55</ref>\n\nScott was in a car drama at Paramount, ''[[And Sudden Death]]'' (1936), directed by Barton, then was loaned to independent producer [[Edward Small]], to play [[Natty Bumppo|Hawkeye]] in another adventure classic, ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1936 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'', adapted from the 1826 [[The Last of the Mohicans|novel]] by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. A big hit in its day, the film \"gave Scott his first unqualified 'A' picture success as a lead.\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 58.</ref>\n\nParamount now only put Scott in \"A\" films. He was a love interest for [[Mae West]] in ''[[Go West, Young Man]]'' (1936) and was reunited with Irene Dunne in a musical, ''[[High, Wide, and Handsome]]'' (1937). This last film, a musical directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], featured Scott in his \"most ambitious performance,\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 59.</ref> The film is&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;set in 1859 in [[Pennsylvania]], and follows the exploits of oil prospector Scott as he struggles against various varmints and vested interests out to wreck his business, and tries to keep his marriage to [[Irene Dunne]] intact, despite the tempting presence of saloon singer [[Dorothy Lamour]].<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nScott went to [[20th Century Fox]] to play the romantic male lead in a [[Shirley Temple]] film, ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938). At Paramount he made a well budgeted Western ''[[The Texans]]'' (1938) with [[Joan Bennett]] then he starred in ''[[The Road to Reno (1938 film)|The Road to Reno]]'' (1938) at Universal.\n\nOne missed opportunity came about around this time. Due to his Southern background, Scott was considered for the role of [[Ashley Wilkes]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but it was [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] who eventually got the part.\n\n==20th Century Fox==\nScott's contract with Paramount ended and he signed a deal with Fox. They put him in ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939), a lavish highly romanticized account of the famous [[Jesse James|outlaw]] ([[Tyrone Power]]) and his brother [[Frank James|Frank]] ([[Henry Fonda]]). Scott was billed fourth as a sympathetic marshal after the James brothers; it was his first film in color.\n\nScott was reunited with Temple in ''[[Susannah of the Mounties (film)|Susannah of the Mounties]]'' (1939), Temple's last profitable film for Fox. The studio gave him the lead in ''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939), playing [[Wyatt Earp]].\n\nScott went to Columbia to star in a medium budget action film, ''[[Coast Guard (film)|Coast Guard]]'' (1939). Back at Fox he was in a war movie, ''[[20,000 Men a Year]]'' (1939).\n\nScott went over to Warner Bros to make ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940), billed third after [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]], playing Flynn's antagonist, a Confederate officer - but a sympathetic one, and not the actual villain (he was played by [[Humphrey Bogart]]). There were frequent disputes between director [[Michael Curtiz]], actors and producer [[Hal Wallis]] about script changes. But Curtiz recalled that Scott tried to stay out of those arguments: \"Randy Scott is a complete anachronism,\" said Curtiz. \"He's a gentleman. And so far he's the only one I've met in this business...\"<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\">Nott 2004 p. 84</ref> According to Nott, Curtiz and Scott got along well both personally and creatively, with Scott giving one of the top performances in his career.<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\"/>\n\nScott went back to RKO to play the \"other man\" role in the [[Irene Dunne]]\u2013[[Cary Grant]] romantic comedy ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940), a huge hit for RKO. For [[Universal Studios|Universal]], he starred with [[Kay Francis]] in ''[[When the Daltons Rode]]'' (1940).\n\nBack at Fox, Scott returned to [[Zane Grey]] country by co-starring with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the [[Technicolor]] production ''[[Western Union (film)|Western Union]]'', directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. Scott played a \"good bad man\" in this film and gave one of his finest performances. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:\n<blockquote>Randolph Scott, who begins to look and act more and more like [[William S. Hart]], herein shapes one of the truest and most appreciable characters of his career as the party's scout.<ref>''[[The New York Times]],'' February 7, 1941.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1941, Scott also co-starred with a young [[Gene Tierney]] in another western, ''[[Belle Starr (film)|Belle Starr]]''.  After a spy film with [[Elisabeth Bergner]], ''[[Paris Calling]]'' (1941), he was in a hugely popular war film at Fox with John Payne and [[Maureen O'Hara]], ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' (1942).\n\n==Universal==\nScott's only role as a truly evil villain was in [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'' (1942), an adaptation of [[Rex Beach]]'s 1905 tale of the [[Klondike gold rush|Alaskan gold rush]] also starring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[John Wayne]]. \n\nThe [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-Scott-[[John Wayne|Wayne]] combination led to [[Universal Studios|Universal]] casting the trio that same year in ''[[Pittsburgh (1942 film)|Pittsburgh]]'', a war-time action-melodrama.  Scott was billed above Wayne in both films but Wayne actually played the heroic [[leading man]] roles and enjoyed more screen time in each movie.\n\n==World War II==\nShortly after the United States entered World War II, Scott attempted to obtain an officer's commission in the [[United States Marines|Marines]], but because of a back injury years earlier, he was rejected.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> However, he did his part for the war effort by touring in a comedy act with [[Joe DeRita]] (who later became a member of [[the Three Stooges]]) for the Victory Committee showcases, and he also raised food for the government on a ranch that he owned.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn 1942 and 1943, Scott appeared in several war films, notably ''To the Shores of Tripoli'' (1942) at Fox, ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' (1943) at RKO, the Canadian warship drama ''[[Corvette K-225]]'' (1943) (produced by [[Howard Hawks]]), ''[[Gung Ho!

The film was produced by [[Harry Joe Brown]], with whom Scott would form a business partnership several years later.\n\nScott was one of many Universal stars who made a cameo in ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944). He was in a \"northern\" with [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], ''[[Belle of the Yukon]]'' (1944), and made a [[swashbuckler]] film for producer [[Benedict Bogeaus]] alongside [[Charles Laughton]]: the cheaply made production ''[[Captain Kidd (1945 film)|Captain Kidd]]'' (1945).\n\n==Post-World War II career==\n===Tall in the saddle===\n[[File:Abilene Town 1946 (2).jpg|thumb|With Jack Lambert in ''Abilene Town'', 1946]]\nIn 1946, after playing roles that had him wandering in and out of the saddle for many years, Scott appeared in ''[[Abilene Town]]'', a [[United Artists|UA]]<ref>Gritten  2008, p. 8.</ref> release which cast him in what would become one of his classic images, the fearless lawman cleaning up a lawless town. The film \"cemented Scott's position as a cowboy hero\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 15.</ref> and from this point on all but two of his starring films would be [[Westerns]]. The Scott Westerns of the late 1940s would each be budgeted around US$1,000,000, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1946|r=-5}}}} today. Scott mostly made Westerns for producers [[Nat Holt]] or [[Harry Joe Brown]] or at [[Warner Bros]], although he did make ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) at Paramount.\n\n===Non-Westerns===\nScott's last non-Westerns were a mystery with [[Peggy Ann Garner]] at Fox, ''[[Home Sweet Homicide]]'' (1947), and a family drama for Bogeaus, ''[[Christmas Eve (1947 film)|Christmas Eve]]'' (1947). He also had a cameo in Warners' ''[[Starlift]]'' (1951).\n\n===Nat Holt===\nScott did two Westerns for Nat Holt at RKO, ''[[Badman's Territory]]'' (1946) and ''[[Trail Street]]'' (1947). He followed it with another pair for Holt at that studio, ''[[Return of the Bad Men]]'' (1948) at RKO and ''[[Canadian Pacific (film)|Canadian Pacific]]'' (1949), then they did ''[[Fighting Man of the Plains]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Cariboo Trail]]'' (1950) at Fox.\n\nScott also made ''[[Rage at Dawn]]'' in 1955 for Nat Holt, which was released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] starring Scott and [[Forrest Tucker]], and featuring [[Denver Pyle]], [[Edgar Buchanan]], and [[J. Carrol Naish]]. It purports to tell the true story of the [[Reno Gang|Reno Brothers]], an outlaw gang which terrorized the American Midwest, particularly Southern [[Indiana]], soon after the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Harry Joe Brown===\nScott renewed his acquaintance with producer [[Harry Joe Brown]] at Columbia with ''[[Gunfighters (film)|Gunfighters]]'' (1947). They began producing many of Scott's Westerns, including several that were shot in the two-color [[Cinecolor]] process. Their collaboration resulted in the film ''[[Coroner Creek]]'' (1948) with Scott as a vengeance-driven cowpoke who \"predates the [[Budd Boetticher]]/[[Burt Kennedy]] heroes by nearly a decade,\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 29.</ref> and ''[[The Walking Hills]]'' (1949), a modern-day tale of gold hunters directed by [[John Sturges]].\n\nThey followed it with ''[[The Doolins of Oklahoma]]'' (1949), ''[[The Nevadan]]'' (1950), ''[[Santa Fe (film)|Santa Fe]]'' (1951), ''[[Man in the Saddle (1951 film)|Man in the Saddle]]'' (1951), ''[[Hangman's Knot]]'' (1952), ''[[The Stranger Wore a Gun]]'' (1953) (shot in 3-D), ''[[Ten Wanted Men]]'' (1955), and ''[[A Lawless Street]]'' (1955) (with [[Angela Lansbury]].)\n\n===Warner Bros.===\nScott did ''[[Colt .45 (film)|Colt .45]]'' (1950) at [[Warner Bros.]] where his salary was US$100,000 per picture (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1949|r=-5}}}} today). He stayed at the studio to do ''[[Sugarfoot (film)|Sugarfoot]]'' (1951), ''[[Fort Worth (film)|Fort Worth]]'' (1951), ''[[Carson City (film)|Carson City]]'' (1952), ''[[The Man Behind the Gun]]'' (1953), ''[[Thunder Over the Plains]]'' (1953), ''[[Riding Shotgun (film)|Riding Shotgun]]'' (1954), ''[[Tall Man Riding]]'' (1955) Most of  these were directed by [[Andr\u00e9 de Toth]].\n\nAlso of interest is ''[[Shootout at Medicine Bend]]'' shot in 1955, but released in 1957, which was Scott's last movie in black and white. The movie co-stars [[James Garner]] and [[Angie Dickinson]].<ref>Gritten 2008, p. 1071.</ref>\n\nBy 1956, Scott turned 58, an age where the careers of most leading men would be winding down. Scott, however, was about to enter his finest and most acclaimed period.\n\n===Boetticher and Kennedy films===\n[[File:Nancy Gates and Randolph Scott in Comanche Station.png|thumb|upright=1.3|With Nancy Gates in ''[[Comanche Station]]'', 1960]]\nIn 1955, screenwriter [[Burt Kennedy]] wrote a script entitled ''[[Seven Men from Now]]'' which was scheduled to be filmed by [[John Wayne]]'s [[Batjac Productions]] with Wayne as the film's star and [[Budd Boetticher]] as its director. However, Wayne was already committed to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. Wayne therefore suggested Scott as his replacement.<ref>Nott 2005, p. 131.</ref> The resulting film, released in 1956, did not make a great impact at the time but is now regarded by many as one of Scott's best, as well as the one that launched Scott and Boetticher into a successful collaboration that totaled seven films.\n\nWhile each film is independent and there are no shared characters or settings, this set of films is often called the Ranown Cycle, for the production company run by Scott and Harry Joe Brown, which was involved in their production.<ref>Wilmington, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-29/entertainment/ca-2438_1_budd-boetticher \"Tall in the director's chair Budd Boetticher made some of the best-remembered westerns of '50s and '60s; they don't make 'em like that (or him) anymore.\"] ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 29, 1992, p. 4.</ref> Kennedy scripted four of them. In these films&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>Boetticher achieved works of great beauty, formally precise in structure and visually elegant, notably for their use of the distinctive landscape of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|California Sierras]]. As the hero of these \"floating poker games\" (as [[Andrew Sarris]] calls them), Scott tempers their innately pessimistic view with quiet, stoical humour, as he pits his wits against such charming villains as [[Richard Boone]] in ''[[The Tall T]]'' and [[Claude Akins]] in ''[[Comanche Station]].''<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter ''[[7th Cavalry (film)|7th Cavalry]]'' (1956), Boetticher, Kennedy and Scott were reunited for their second film, ''[[The Tall T]]'' (1957) which co-starred [[Richard Boone]].\n\nThe third in the series was ''[[Decision at Sundown]]'' (1957), although that script was not written by Kennedy. The unofficial series continued with ''[[Buchanan Rides Alone]]'' (1958).\n\n''[[Westbound (film)|Westbound]]'' (1959) is not considered part of the official cycle although Boetticher directed it. However the last two, both written by Kennedy, definitely were: ''[[Ride Lonesome]]'' (1959) and ''[[Comanche Station]]'' (1960)\n\n===Last film: ''Ride the High Country''===\nIn 1962 Scott made his final film appearance in ''[[Ride the High Country]]'', a film now regarded as a classic. It was directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]] and co-starred [[Joel McCrea]], an actor who had a screen image similar to Scott's and who also from the mid-1940s on devoted his career almost exclusively to [[Westerns]].\n\n<blockquote>Scott and [[Joel McCrea|McCrea's]] farewell Western is characterized by a nostalgic sense of the passing of the Old West; a preoccupation with the emotionality of male bonding and of the experiential 'gap' between the young and the old; and the fearful evocation, in the form of the Hammonds (the villains in the film), of these preoccupations transmuted into brutal and perverse forms.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>[[Joel McCrea|McCrea]], like Scott, retired from filmmaking after this picture, although he returned to the screen twice in later years.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages===\nScott married twice. In 1936, he became the second husband of heiress [[Marion duPont Scott|Marion duPont]], daughter of William Du Pont Sr., and great-granddaughter of \u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Du Pont de Nemours, the founder of the [[E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]]. Marion had previously married George Somerville, with Scott serving as best man at the wedding. The Scotts' marriage ended in divorce three years later, in 1939. The union produced no children. Though divorced, she kept his last name nearly five decades, until her death in 1983.<ref>Sargent, Sarah.

As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, [[comedies]], [[musicals]] (albeit in non-singing and non-dancing roles), adventure tales, [[war films]], and a few [[Horror film|horror]] and [[fantasy]] films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances over 60 were in Westerns; thus, \"of all the major stars whose name was associated with the Western, Scott most closely identified with it.\"<ref name=\"BFI\">Boscombe 1988.{{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nScott's more than 30 years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working with many acclaimed screen directors, including [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], [[Rouben Mamoulian]], [[Michael Curtiz]], [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], [[King Vidor]], [[Allan Dwan]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Sam Peckinpah]], [[Henry Hathaway]] (eight times), [[Ray Enright]] (seven), [[Edwin L. Marin]] (seven), [[Andre DeToth]] (six), and most notably, his seven film collaborations with [[Budd Boetticher]]. Scott also worked with a diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from [[Shirley Temple]] and [[Irene Dunne]] to [[Mae West]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]].\n\nTall (6&nbsp;ft 2\u00bd in; 189&nbsp;cm), lanky and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or \"lumbering\".<ref>Mueller 1985, p. 65.</ref> As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal \"strong, silent\" type of stoic hero. ''The BFI Companion to the Western'' noted:<blockquote>In his earlier Westerns&nbsp;... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes the man who has seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Scott was a consistent box-office draw. In the annual ''Motion Picture Herald'' [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll|Top Ten Polls]], he ranked 10th in 1950, seventh in 1951, and 10th in both 1952 and 1953.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 4.</ref> Scott also appeared in the Quigley's ''Top Ten Money Makers Poll'' from 1950 to 1953.<ref>[http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html \"Top Ten Money Making Stars of the past 79 years.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221063625/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |date=2014-12-21 }} ''quigleypublishing.com.''

His father was George Grant Scott, born in [[Franklin, Virginia]], an administrative engineer in a textile firm. His mother was Lucille Crane Scott, born in [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]], Virginia, a member of a wealthy North Carolina family.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\">Nott 2004, p. 7.</ref> The Scott children in order of birth were: Margaret, Randolph, Katherine, Virginia, Joseph and Barbara, most born in North Carolina.<ref>U.S. Census 1900\u20131920.</ref>\n\nBecause of his family's financial status, young Randolph was able to attend private schools such as [[Woodberry Forest School]]. From an early age, Scott developed and displayed his athleticism, excelling in [[american football|football]], baseball, horse racing, and swimming.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\"/>\n\n==World War I==\nIn April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]] and shortly afterwards, Scott, then  19 years old, joined the [[United States Army]]. He served in France as an artillery observer with the 2nd Trench Mortar Battalion, [[19th Field Artillery Regiment]].<ref>Nott 2004, p. 1.</ref> His wartime experience gave him training that was put to use in his later film career,  including [[horsemanship]] and the use of [[firearms]].\n\n==After World War I==\nAfter the [[Armistice]] brought [[World War I]] to an end, Scott stayed in France and  enrolled in an artillery officers' school. Although he eventually received a commission, Scott decided to return to America and thus journeyed home around 1919.<ref name=\"Nott p. 8\">Nott 2004, p. 8.</ref>\n\nWith his military career over, Scott continued his education at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order and set his sights on becoming an all-American football player. However a back injury prevented him from achieving this goal.<ref name=\"Thomas\">Thomas 1981 {{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref> Scott then transferred to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he majored in [[textile engineering]] and manufacturing.<ref name=\"Nott p. 8\"/> As with his military career, however, he eventually dropped out of college and went to work as an accountant in the textile firm where his father was employed.<ref>Ringgold, Gene. \"Randolph Scott: Everyone's Idea of a Southern Gentleman.\" ''Films in Review.'' 1972.</ref>\n\n==Stage and early film appearances==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Early films===\nAround 1927, Scott developed an interest in acting and decided to make his way to Los Angeles and seek a career in the motion picture industry. Fortunately, Scott's father had become acquainted with [[Howard Hughes]] and provided a letter of introduction for his son to present to the eccentric millionaire filmmaker.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] film called ''[[Sharp Shooters]]'' (1928). Despite its title and the presence of O'Brien, ''Sharp Shooters'' is not a western, as some film historians claimed. Rather, it's a romantic comedy. A print of the film survives in the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].\n\nIn the next few years, Scott continued working as an extra and bit player in several films, including ''Weary River'' (1929) with [[Richard Barthelmess]], ''[[The Far Call]]'' (1929), ''[[The Black Watch]]'' (1929) (directed by [[John Ford]] with [[John Wayne]] also uncredited) and uncredited as the Rider in ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]'' (1929) with [[Gary Cooper]]. Reputedly, Scott also served as Cooper's dialect coach in this latter film.\n\nScott was also uncredited on ''[[Dynamite (1929 film)|Dynamite]]'' (1929) directed by [[Cecil B. De Mille]], and ''[[Born Reckless (1930 film)|Born Reckless]]'' (1930).\n\n===Stage===\nOn the advice of director [[Cecil B. DeMille]], Scott gained much-needed acting experience by performing in stage plays with the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. Scott's stage roles during this period include:<ref>Nott 2004, p. 136.</ref>\n* A minister in ''Gentlemen Be Seated''\n* A butler in ''Nellie, the Beautiful Model''\n* Metellus Cimber in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''\n* Hector Malone in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Man and Superman]]''\n\nIn 1931 Scott played his first leading role (with [[Sally Blane]]) in ''[[Women Men Marry]]'' (1931), a [[lost film|film]], now apparently lost, that was made by a [[Poverty Row]] studio called Headline Pictures. A silent film by the same name from 1922, directed by Edward Dillon, has apparently been preserved, however, at Filmmuseum Amsterdam. The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:..Women Men Marry.\n\nHe followed that movie with a supporting part in a [[Warner Bros.]] production starring [[George Arliss]], ''[[A Successful Calamity]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1932 Scott appeared in a play at the Vine Street Theatre in [[Hollywood]] entitled ''Under a Virginia Moon''. His performance in this play resulted in several offers for screen tests by the major movie studios.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Scott eventually signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] at a salary of USD $400 per week ({{Inflation|USD|400|1932|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Paramount==\n===Zane Grey apprenticeship===\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 02.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Verna Hillie]] in ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 05 (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Barton MacLane]], [[Tom Kennedy (actor)|Tom Kennedy]], [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], Scott and [[Verna Hillie]] in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Noah Beery, Sr.]] and Scott in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\nScott's first role under his new [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] contract was a small supporting part in a comedy called ''[[Sky Bride]]'' (1932) starring [[Richard Arlen]] and [[Jack Oakie]].\n\nFollowing that, however, Paramount cast him as the lead in ''[[Heritage of the Desert (1932 film)|Heritage of the Desert]]'' (1932), his first significant starring role and also the one that established him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. As with ''Women Men Marry'', [[Sally Blane]] was his leading lady. [[Henry Hathaway]] made his directorial debut with ''Heritage of the Desert''. The film was popular and Scott would go on to make ten \"B\" [[Western (genre)|Western]] films loosely based on the novels of [[Zane Grey]].\n\n(Around the same time, [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] also remade some [[Zane Grey]] titles that they owned, with [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as their star.)\n\nMany of these Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films. In an effort to save on production costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired some of the same actors, such as [[Raymond Hatton]] and [[Noah Beery, Sr.|Noah Beery]], to repeat their roles. For the 1933 films ''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' and ''[[Man of the Forest]]'', Scott's hair was darkened and he sported a trim moustache so that he could easily be matched to footage of [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], the star of the silent versions.\n\nIn his book, ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers'', film historian [[William K. Everson]] refers to the Zane Grey series as being \"uniformly good\".<ref name=\"Everson\">Everson, William K.

Citadel Press, 1992, First edition 1969.</ref> He also writes:<blockquote>''To the Last Man'' was almost a model of its kind, an exceptionally strong story of feuding families in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, with a cast worthy of an \"A\" feature, excellent direction by [[Henry Hathaway]], and an unusual climactic fight between the villain (Jack LaRue) and the ''heroine'' ([[Esther Ralston]], in an exceptionally appealing performance).\n\n''Sunset Pass''...&nbsp;was not only one of the best but also one of the most surprising in presenting Randolph Scott and [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]] as ''heavies.''</blockquote>\n\nThe Zane Grey series were a boon for Scott, as they provided him with \"an excellent training ground for both action and acting\".<ref>Nott 2005, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn between his work in the Zane Grey [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, Paramount cast Scott in several non-[[Western (genre)|Western]] roles, such as \"the other man\" in ''[[Hot Saturday]]'' (1932), with [[Nancy Carroll]] and [[Cary Grant]].\n\nScott returned to Zane Grey Westerns with ''[[Wild Horse Mesa (1932 film)|Wild Horse Mesa]]'' (1932), then was the romantic male lead in ''[[Hello, Everybody!]]'' (1933), an odd one-shot attempt to make a film star out of the popular but heavy-set radio singer [[Kate Smith]].\n\n''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' (1933) was another Zane Grey Western with Hathaway, then he was in two horror movies, ''[[Murders in the Zoo]]'' (1933) with [[Lionel Atwill]] and ''[[Supernatural (film)|Supernatural]]'' (1933) with [[Carole Lombard]].\n\nAfter the Western ''[[Sunset Pass (1933 film)|Sunset Pass]]'' (1933), Paramount loaned Scott to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], to play [[Bebe Daniels]]'s love interest in a minor romantic comedy called ''[[Cocktail Hour (film)|Cocktail Hour]]'' (1933).\n\nBack at Paramount Scott did the Westerns ''[[Man of the Forest]]'' (1933) and ''[[To the Last Man (1933 film)|To the Last Man]]'' (1933), both with Hathaway from Grey novels. He was loaned to [[Monogram Pictures]] for ''[[Broken Dreams (1933 film)|Broken Dreams]]'' (1933) then was back with Hathaway for ''[[The Last Round-Up (1934 film)|The Last Round-Up]]'' (1934).\n\nScott did three more Zane Grey Westerns without Hathaway: ''[[Wagon Wheels (film)|Wagon Wheels]]'' (1934) directed by [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]], ''[[Home on the Range (1935 film)|Home on the Range]]'' (1935) from [[Arthur Jacobson]], and ''[[Rocky Mountain Mystery]]'' (1935) with Barton.\n\n===RKO and \"A\" Films===\nParamount loaned Scott to [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] to support [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] in ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), a hugely popular adaptation of the Broadway musical.\n\nRKO liked Scott and kept him on for ''[[Village Tale]]'' (1935), directed by John Cromwell, and ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' (1935), an adaptation of [[She (novel)|the classic novel]] by [[H.

A big hit in its day, the film \"gave Scott his first unqualified 'A' picture success as a lead.\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 58.</ref>\n\nParamount now only put Scott in \"A\" films. He was a love interest for [[Mae West]] in ''[[Go West, Young Man]]'' (1936) and was reunited with Irene Dunne in a musical, ''[[High, Wide, and Handsome]]'' (1937). This last film, a musical directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], featured Scott in his \"most ambitious performance,\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 59.</ref> The film is&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;set in 1859 in [[Pennsylvania]], and follows the exploits of oil prospector Scott as he struggles against various varmints and vested interests out to wreck his business, and tries to keep his marriage to [[Irene Dunne]] intact, despite the tempting presence of saloon singer [[Dorothy Lamour]].<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nScott went to [[20th Century Fox]] to play the romantic male lead in a [[Shirley Temple]] film, ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938). At Paramount he made a well budgeted Western ''[[The Texans]]'' (1938) with [[Joan Bennett]] then he starred in ''[[The Road to Reno (1938 film)|The Road to Reno]]'' (1938) at Universal.\n\nOne missed opportunity came about around this time. Due to his Southern background, Scott was considered for the role of [[Ashley Wilkes]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but it was [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] who eventually got the part.\n\n==20th Century Fox==\nScott's contract with Paramount ended and he signed a deal with Fox. They put him in ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939), a lavish highly romanticized account of the famous [[Jesse James|outlaw]] ([[Tyrone Power]]) and his brother [[Frank James|Frank]] ([[Henry Fonda]]). Scott was billed fourth as a sympathetic marshal after the James brothers; it was his first film in color.\n\nScott was reunited with Temple in ''[[Susannah of the Mounties (film)|Susannah of the Mounties]]'' (1939), Temple's last profitable film for Fox. The studio gave him the lead in ''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939), playing [[Wyatt Earp]].\n\nScott went to Columbia to star in a medium budget action film, ''[[Coast Guard (film)|Coast Guard]]'' (1939). Back at Fox he was in a war movie, ''[[20,000 Men a Year]]'' (1939).\n\nScott went over to Warner Bros to make ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940), billed third after [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]], playing Flynn's antagonist, a Confederate officer - but a sympathetic one, and not the actual villain (he was played by [[Humphrey Bogart]]). There were frequent disputes between director [[Michael Curtiz]], actors and producer [[Hal Wallis]] about script changes. But Curtiz recalled that Scott tried to stay out of those arguments: \"Randy Scott is a complete anachronism,\" said Curtiz. \"He's a gentleman. And so far he's the only one I've met in this business...\"<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\">Nott 2004 p. 84</ref> According to Nott, Curtiz and Scott got along well both personally and creatively, with Scott giving one of the top performances in his career.<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\"/>\n\nScott went back to RKO to play the \"other man\" role in the [[Irene Dunne]]\u2013[[Cary Grant]] romantic comedy ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940), a huge hit for RKO. For [[Universal Studios|Universal]], he starred with [[Kay Francis]] in ''[[When the Daltons Rode]]'' (1940).\n\nBack at Fox, Scott returned to [[Zane Grey]] country by co-starring with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the [[Technicolor]] production ''[[Western Union (film)|Western Union]]'', directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. Scott played a \"good bad man\" in this film and gave one of his finest performances. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:\n<blockquote>Randolph Scott, who begins to look and act more and more like [[William S. Hart]], herein shapes one of the truest and most appreciable characters of his career as the party's scout.<ref>''[[The New York Times]],'' February 7, 1941.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1941, Scott also co-starred with a young [[Gene Tierney]] in another western, ''[[Belle Starr (film)|Belle Starr]]''.  After a spy film with [[Elisabeth Bergner]], ''[[Paris Calling]]'' (1941), he was in a hugely popular war film at Fox with John Payne and [[Maureen O'Hara]], ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' (1942).\n\n==Universal==\nScott's only role as a truly evil villain was in [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'' (1942), an adaptation of [[Rex Beach]]'s 1905 tale of the [[Klondike gold rush|Alaskan gold rush]] also starring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[John Wayne]]. \n\nThe [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-Scott-[[John Wayne|Wayne]] combination led to [[Universal Studios|Universal]] casting the trio that same year in ''[[Pittsburgh (1942 film)|Pittsburgh]]'', a war-time action-melodrama.  Scott was billed above Wayne in both films but Wayne actually played the heroic [[leading man]] roles and enjoyed more screen time in each movie.\n\n==World War II==\nShortly after the United States entered World War II, Scott attempted to obtain an officer's commission in the [[United States Marines|Marines]], but because of a back injury years earlier, he was rejected.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> However, he did his part for the war effort by touring in a comedy act with [[Joe DeRita]] (who later became a member of [[the Three Stooges]]) for the Victory Committee showcases, and he also raised food for the government on a ranch that he owned.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn 1942 and 1943, Scott appeared in several war films, notably ''To the Shores of Tripoli'' (1942) at Fox, ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' (1943) at RKO, the Canadian warship drama ''[[Corvette K-225]]'' (1943) (produced by [[Howard Hawks]]), ''[[Gung Ho! (1943 film)|Gung Ho!]]'' at Universal <ref>{{Citation|title=Bugs Bunny-War Bonds|date=1943|url=https://archive.org/details/GungHo-1943Trailer|accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref> and ''[[China Sky (film)|China Sky]]'' (1945) at RKO.\n\nHe also made ''[[The Desperadoes]]'' (1943), [[Columbia Pictures]]' first feature in [[Technicolor]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Joe Brown]], with whom Scott would form a business partnership several years later.\n\nScott was one of many Universal stars who made a cameo in ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944). He was in a \"northern\" with [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], ''[[Belle of the Yukon]]'' (1944), and made a [[swashbuckler]] film for producer [[Benedict Bogeaus]] alongside [[Charles Laughton]]: the cheaply made production ''[[Captain Kidd (1945 film)|Captain Kidd]]'' (1945).\n\n==Post-World War II career==\n===Tall in the saddle===\n[[File:Abilene Town 1946 (2).jpg|thumb|With Jack Lambert in ''Abilene Town'', 1946]]\nIn 1946, after playing roles that had him wandering in and out of the saddle for many years, Scott appeared in ''[[Abilene Town]]'', a [[United Artists|UA]]<ref>Gritten  2008, p. 8.</ref> release which cast him in what would become one of his classic images, the fearless lawman cleaning up a lawless town. The film \"cemented Scott's position as a cowboy hero\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 15.</ref> and from this point on all but two of his starring films would be [[Westerns]]. The Scott Westerns of the late 1940s would each be budgeted around US$1,000,000, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1946|r=-5}}}} today. Scott mostly made Westerns for producers [[Nat Holt]] or [[Harry Joe Brown]] or at [[Warner Bros]], although he did make ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) at Paramount.\n\n===Non-Westerns===\nScott's last non-Westerns were a mystery with [[Peggy Ann Garner]] at Fox, ''[[Home Sweet Homicide]]'' (1947), and a family drama for Bogeaus, ''[[Christmas Eve (1947 film)|Christmas Eve]]'' (1947). He also had a cameo in Warners' ''[[Starlift]]'' (1951).\n\n===Nat Holt===\nScott did two Westerns for Nat Holt at RKO, ''[[Badman's Territory]]'' (1946) and ''[[Trail Street]]'' (1947). He followed it with another pair for Holt at that studio, ''[[Return of the Bad Men]]'' (1948) at RKO and ''[[Canadian Pacific (film)|Canadian Pacific]]'' (1949), then they did ''[[Fighting Man of the Plains]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Cariboo Trail]]'' (1950) at Fox.\n\nScott also made ''[[Rage at Dawn]]'' in 1955 for Nat Holt, which was released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] starring Scott and [[Forrest Tucker]], and featuring [[Denver Pyle]], [[Edgar Buchanan]], and [[J. Carrol Naish]]. It purports to tell the true story of the [[Reno Gang|Reno Brothers]], an outlaw gang which terrorized the American Midwest, particularly Southern [[Indiana]], soon after the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Harry Joe Brown===\nScott renewed his acquaintance with producer [[Harry Joe Brown]] at Columbia with ''[[Gunfighters (film)|Gunfighters]]'' (1947). They began producing many of Scott's Westerns, including several that were shot in the two-color [[Cinecolor]] process. Their collaboration resulted in the film ''[[Coroner Creek]]'' (1948) with Scott as a vengeance-driven cowpoke who \"predates the [[Budd Boetticher]]/[[Burt Kennedy]] heroes by nearly a decade,\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 29.</ref> and ''[[The Walking Hills]]'' (1949), a modern-day tale of gold hunters directed by [[John Sturges]].\n\nThey followed it with ''[[The Doolins of Oklahoma]]'' (1949), ''[[The Nevadan]]'' (1950), ''[[Santa Fe (film)|Santa Fe]]'' (1951), ''[[Man in the Saddle (1951 film)|Man in the Saddle]]'' (1951), ''[[Hangman's Knot]]'' (1952), ''[[The Stranger Wore a Gun]]'' (1953) (shot in 3-D), ''[[Ten Wanted Men]]'' (1955), and ''[[A Lawless Street]]'' (1955) (with [[Angela Lansbury]].)\n\n===Warner Bros.===\nScott did ''[[Colt .45 (film)|Colt .45]]'' (1950) at [[Warner Bros.]] where his salary was US$100,000 per picture (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1949|r=-5}}}} today). He stayed at the studio to do ''[[Sugarfoot (film)|Sugarfoot]]'' (1951), ''[[Fort Worth (film)|Fort Worth]]'' (1951), ''[[Carson City (film)|Carson City]]'' (1952), ''[[The Man Behind the Gun]]'' (1953), ''[[Thunder Over the Plains]]'' (1953), ''[[Riding Shotgun (film)|Riding Shotgun]]'' (1954), ''[[Tall Man Riding]]'' (1955) Most of  these were directed by [[Andr\u00e9 de Toth]].\n\nAlso of interest is ''[[Shootout at Medicine Bend]]'' shot in 1955, but released in 1957, which was Scott's last movie in black and white. The movie co-stars [[James Garner]] and [[Angie Dickinson]].<ref>Gritten 2008, p. 1071.</ref>\n\nBy 1956, Scott turned 58, an age where the careers of most leading men would be winding down. Scott, however, was about to enter his finest and most acclaimed period.\n\n===Boetticher and Kennedy films===\n[[File:Nancy Gates and Randolph Scott in Comanche Station.png|thumb|upright=1.3|With Nancy Gates in ''[[Comanche Station]]'', 1960]]\nIn 1955, screenwriter [[Burt Kennedy]] wrote a script entitled ''[[Seven Men from Now]]'' which was scheduled to be filmed by [[John Wayne]]'s [[Batjac Productions]] with Wayne as the film's star and [[Budd Boetticher]] as its director. However, Wayne was already committed to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. Wayne therefore suggested Scott as his replacement.<ref>Nott 2005, p. 131.</ref> The resulting film, released in 1956, did not make a great impact at the time but is now regarded by many as one of Scott's best, as well as the one that launched Scott and Boetticher into a successful collaboration that totaled seven films.\n\nWhile each film is independent and there are no shared characters or settings, this set of films is often called the Ranown Cycle, for the production company run by Scott and Harry Joe Brown, which was involved in their production.<ref>Wilmington, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-29/entertainment/ca-2438_1_budd-boetticher \"Tall in the director's chair Budd Boetticher made some of the best-remembered westerns of '50s and '60s; they don't make 'em like that (or him) anymore.\"] ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 29, 1992, p. 4.</ref> Kennedy scripted four of them. In these films&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>Boetticher achieved works of great beauty, formally precise in structure and visually elegant, notably for their use of the distinctive landscape of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|California Sierras]]. As the hero of these \"floating poker games\" (as [[Andrew Sarris]] calls them), Scott tempers their innately pessimistic view with quiet, stoical humour, as he pits his wits against such charming villains as [[Richard Boone]] in ''[[The Tall T]]'' and [[Claude Akins]] in ''[[Comanche Station]].''<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter ''[[7th Cavalry (film)|7th Cavalry]]'' (1956), Boetticher, Kennedy and Scott were reunited for their second film, ''[[The Tall T]]'' (1957) which co-starred [[Richard Boone]].\n\nThe third in the series was ''[[Decision at Sundown]]'' (1957), although that script was not written by Kennedy. The unofficial series continued with ''[[Buchanan Rides Alone]]'' (1958).\n\n''[[Westbound (film)|Westbound]]'' (1959) is not considered part of the official cycle although Boetticher directed it. However the last two, both written by Kennedy, definitely were: ''[[Ride Lonesome]]'' (1959) and ''[[Comanche Station]]'' (1960)\n\n===Last film: ''Ride the High Country''===\nIn 1962 Scott made his final film appearance in ''[[Ride the High Country]]'', a film now regarded as a classic. It was directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]] and co-starred [[Joel McCrea]], an actor who had a screen image similar to Scott's and who also from the mid-1940s on devoted his career almost exclusively to [[Westerns]].\n\n<blockquote>Scott and [[Joel McCrea|McCrea's]] farewell Western is characterized by a nostalgic sense of the passing of the Old West; a preoccupation with the emotionality of male bonding and of the experiential 'gap' between the young and the old; and the fearful evocation, in the form of the Hammonds (the villains in the film), of these preoccupations transmuted into brutal and perverse forms.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>[[Joel McCrea|McCrea]], like Scott, retired from filmmaking after this picture, although he returned to the screen twice in later years.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages===\nScott married twice. In 1936, he became the second husband of heiress [[Marion duPont Scott|Marion duPont]], daughter of William Du Pont Sr., and great-granddaughter of \u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Du Pont de Nemours, the founder of the [[E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]]. Marion had previously married George Somerville, with Scott serving as best man at the wedding. The Scotts' marriage ended in divorce three years later, in 1939. The union produced no children. Though divorced, she kept his last name nearly five decades, until her death in 1983.<ref>Sargent, Sarah.

To Ananthram's satisfaction, the 1965 Kannada ACK venture was a great commercial success which led to Mirchandani in the head office in Mumbai pursuing the Amar Chitra Katha idea in English diligently. \"They brought in Anant Pai\" says Ananthram. \"And he built a wonderful team and a great brand.\"<ref>[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?270843 A Pandit Had A Dream&nbsp;...
