In around 1000 BCE it was conquered by [[Marsi]] and Marrucini people. The city was also lived in by the Greeks, who named it Teate. It was conquered by the Romans in 305 BCE but after the fall of Rome in 476 CE, [[Theoderic the Great]] gained ownership of the city and it was subsequently used as a Lombard fortress.

Presumably, it was first inhabited by the [[Frentani]], an [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] population. In 2005, during works near the Castle, a [[Bronze Age]] settlement was discovered, and the Roman town largely coincided with this first settlement. Some sections of paved roads and urban walls, as well as some archaeological findings are the only remains of this period. Ortona remained a part of the [[Roman Empire]] (i.e., the [[Byzantine Empire]]) for several centuries, before it was annexed by the Kingdom of the [[Lombards]]. In 803 the [[Franks]] incorporated Ortona into the county of [[Chieti]]. From that date on, the town remained tied to Chieti and its territory.\n[[File:Ortona 2005 -Castello Aragonese- by-RaBoe 01.jpg|thumb|The Aragonese castle in Ortona.]]\n[[File:Basilica san tommaso.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The [[Basilica of San Tommaso Apostolo]], where are the remains of the saint]]\nIn 1258 the relics of the [[Thomas the Apostle|Apostle Thomas]] were brought to Ortona by the sailor Leone Acciaiuoli.  In the first half of the 15th century its walls were built, and during this period Ortona fought with the nearby town of [[Lanciano]] in a fierce war that ended in 1427. On June 30, 1447, ships from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] destroyed the port of Ortona; consequently the [[King of Sicily]] at that time commissioned the construction of a Castle to dominate the renovated port. In 1582 the town was acquired by [[Margaret of Parma]], daughter of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and Duchess of [[Parma]]. In 1584 Margaret decided to build a great mansion (known as Palazzo Farnese), which was never completed due to her death.\n\nAfter the establishment of the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1860, Ortona became one of the first sea resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. On 9 September 1943, the royal family of the [[House of Savoy]] left [[Nazi Germany|German]]-occupied Italy from the port of Ortona. The defensive [[Gustav Line]] was established by the Germans at Ortona (extending towards [[Cassino]] on the opposite side of Italy). Ortona offered the Allies a supply port on the Adriatic and was fiercely defended by the Germans attracted the attention of that the international press in the struggle between the German paratroopers and the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade. This led to this battle being known as \"Little Stalingrad.\"\n\n=== Guardiagrele ===\n[[File:Guardiagrele Santa Maria Maggiore Occidentale.jpg|thumb|left|West view of Santa Maria Maggiore]]\n\nThe biggest church in Guardiagrele is Santa Maria Maggiore of which it has been written:<ref>[http://www.borghitalia.it/html/vedere_en.php?codice_borgo=619 I Borghi pi\u00f9 belli d'Italia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n{{quote|text=The fa\u00e7ade presents a splendid 14th-century gothic portal, among the most elegant in the Abruzzi Gothic style.

In around 1000 BCE it was conquered by [[Marsi]] and Marrucini people. The city was also lived in by the Greeks, who named it Teate. It was conquered by the Romans in 305 BCE but after the fall of Rome in 476 CE, [[Theoderic the Great]] gained ownership of the city and it was subsequently used as a Lombard fortress. The city was then owned by the Franks, the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]], the [[Hohenstaufen]], the Angevins and Aragonese rulers until strong control over the city was gained by [[Charles V of France]]. Chieti was made the capital of Abruzzo Citra under its period of rule by the [[House of Bourbon]].<ref name=\"2002d\">{{cite book|author=Roy Palmer Domenico|title=The Regions of Italy: A Reference Guide to History and Culture|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30733-1|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nThe province of Chieti contains Ortona, a town founded by Fretani people for trading with the Greeks, which was the scene of a World War II battle between German and predominantly British and Canadian forces; over 2,000 civilians died and the town was largely destroyed.<ref name=\"2002d\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nThe province of Chieti is one of four provinces in the region of [[Abruzzo]] on the eastern coast of Italy. It is the most easternmost province in the region and is bounded to the northeast by the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The [[Province of Pescara]] lies to the north and the [[Province of L'Aquila]] to the northwest. To the south lies the [[Province of Isernia]] and the [[Province of Campobasso]] lies to the south east, both these provinces being part of the region of [[Molise]]. The provincial capital is [[Chieti]], situated on a ridge a few miles inland and just south of the [[Aterno-Pescara|Aterno-Pescara River]] which flows into the sea at nearby [[Pescara]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World |edition=13 |year=2011 |publisher=Times Books |isbn=9780007419135 |page=76}}</ref>\n\nThere has been a movement by farmers away from the land and the area.

Presumably, it was first inhabited by the [[Frentani]], an [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] population. In 2005, during works near the Castle, a [[Bronze Age]] settlement was discovered, and the Roman town largely coincided with this first settlement. Some sections of paved roads and urban walls, as well as some archaeological findings are the only remains of this period. Ortona remained a part of the [[Roman Empire]] (i.e., the [[Byzantine Empire]]) for several centuries, before it was annexed by the Kingdom of the [[Lombards]]. In 803 the [[Franks]] incorporated Ortona into the county of [[Chieti]]. From that date on, the town remained tied to Chieti and its territory.\n[[File:Ortona 2005 -Castello Aragonese- by-RaBoe 01.jpg|thumb|The Aragonese castle in Ortona.]]\n[[File:Basilica san tommaso.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The [[Basilica of San Tommaso Apostolo]], where are the remains of the saint]]\nIn 1258 the relics of the [[Thomas the Apostle|Apostle Thomas]] were brought to Ortona by the sailor Leone Acciaiuoli.  In the first half of the 15th century its walls were built, and during this period Ortona fought with the nearby town of [[Lanciano]] in a fierce war that ended in 1427. On June 30, 1447, ships from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] destroyed the port of Ortona; consequently the [[King of Sicily]] at that time commissioned the construction of a Castle to dominate the renovated port. In 1582 the town was acquired by [[Margaret of Parma]], daughter of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and Duchess of [[Parma]]. In 1584 Margaret decided to build a great mansion (known as Palazzo Farnese), which was never completed due to her death.\n\nAfter the establishment of the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1860, Ortona became one of the first sea resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. On 9 September 1943, the royal family of the [[House of Savoy]] left [[Nazi Germany|German]]-occupied Italy from the port of Ortona. The defensive [[Gustav Line]] was established by the Germans at Ortona (extending towards [[Cassino]] on the opposite side of Italy). Ortona offered the Allies a supply port on the Adriatic and was fiercely defended by the Germans attracted the attention of that the international press in the struggle between the German paratroopers and the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade. This led to this battle being known as \"Little Stalingrad.\"\n\n=== Guardiagrele ===\n[[File:Guardiagrele Santa Maria Maggiore Occidentale.jpg|thumb|left|West view of Santa Maria Maggiore]]\n\nThe biggest church in Guardiagrele is Santa Maria Maggiore of which it has been written:<ref>[http://www.borghitalia.it/html/vedere_en.php?codice_borgo=619 I Borghi pi\u00f9 belli d'Italia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n{{quote|text=The fa\u00e7ade presents a splendid 14th-century gothic portal, among the most elegant in the Abruzzi Gothic style.
