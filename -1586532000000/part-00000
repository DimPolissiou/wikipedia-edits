In particular, during [[rapid eye movement sleep]], a brain state rich in dreaming activity in humans and whose electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from the waking brain, this directional signal moves as if the animal is awake: that is, HD neurons are sequentially activated, and the individual neurons representing a common direction during wake are still active, or silent, at the same time.\n\n== Vestibular influences ==\n\nThe HD network makes use of inertial and other movement-related inputs, and thus continues to operate even in the absence of light.  These inertial properties are dependent on the [[vestibular system]], especially the [[semicircular canals]] of the [[inner ear]], which signal rotations of the head.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Ryan M.|last2=Taube|first2=Jeffrey S.|date=2014-01-01|title=The vestibular contribution to the head direction signal and navigation|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=32|doi=10.3389/fnint.2014.00032|pmc=4001061|pmid=24795578}}</ref> The HD system integrates the vestibular output to maintain a signal reflecting cumulative rotation.  The integration is less than perfect, though, especially for slow head rotations.  If an animal is placed on an isolated platform and slowly rotated in the dark, the alignment of the HD system usually shifts a little bit for each rotation.  If an animal explores a dark environment with no directional cues, the HD alignment tends to drift slowly and randomly over time.\n\n== Visual and other sensory influences ==\nOne of the most interesting aspects of head direction cells is that their firing is not fully determined by sensory features of the environment.  When an animal comes into a novel environment for the first time, the alignment of the head direction system is arbitrary.  Over the first few minutes of exploration, the animal learns to associate the landmarks in the environment with directions.  When the animal comes back into the same environment at a later time, if the head direction system is misaligned, the learned associations serve to realign it.\n\nIt is possible to temporarily disrupt the alignment of the HD system, for example by turning out the lights for a few minutes.  Even in the dark, the HD system continues to operate, but its alignment to the environment may gradually drift.  When the lights are turned back on and the animal can once more see landmarks, the HD system usually comes rapidly back into the normal alignment.  Occasionally the realignment is delayed:  the HD cells may maintain an abnormal alignment for as long as a few minutes, but then abruptly snap back. Consistent with the drifting in the dark, HD cells are not sensitive to the polarity of geomagnetic fields.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tryon|first=Valerie L.|last2=Kim|first2=Esther U.|last3=Zafar|first3=Talal J.|last4=Unruh|first4=April M.|last5=Staley|first5=Shelly R.|last6=Calton|first6=Jeffrey L.|date=2012-12-01|title=Magnetic field polarity fails to influence the directional signal carried by the head direction cell network and the behavior of rats in a task requiring magnetic field orientation|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=126|issue=6|pages=835\u2013844|doi=10.1037/a0030248|issn=1939-0084|pmid=23025828}}</ref>\n\nIf these sorts of misalignment experiments are done too often, the system may break down.  If an animal is repeatedly disoriented, and then placed into an environment for a few minutes each time, the landmarks gradually lose their ability to control the HD system, and eventually, the system goes into a state where it shows a different, and random, alignment on each trial {{Citation needed|reason= |date=October 2016}}.\n\nThere is evidence that the visual control of HD cells is mediated by the postsubiculum.  Lesions of the postsubiculum do not eliminate thalamic HD cells, but they often cause the directionality to drift over time, even when there are plenty of visual cues.  Thus, HD cells in postsub{{typo help inline|reason=similar to postbus|date=November 2019}}-lesioned animals behave like HD cells in intact animals in the absence of light.  Also, only a minority of cells recorded in the postsubiculum are HD cells, and many of the others show visual responses. In familiar environments, HD cells show consistent preferred directions across time as long as there is a polarizing cue of some sort that allows directions to be identified (in a cylinder with unmarked walls and no cues in the distance, preferred directions may drift over time){{Citation needed|reason=Skaggs et al?!|date=October 2016}}.\n\n== Theoretical models ==\nThe properties of the head direction system - particularly its persistence in the dark, and also the constant relationship of firing directions between cells regardless of environmental changes - suggested to early theoreticians the still-accepted notion that the cells might be organized in the form of a ring attractor,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=K.|date=1996-03-15|title=Representation of spatial orientation by the intrinsic dynamics of the head-direction cell ensemble: a theory|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=16|issue=6|pages=2112\u20132126|issn=0270-6474|pmid=8604055|pmc=6578512|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-06-02112.1996}}</ref> which is a type of [[attractor network]]. In an attractor network, interactions between neurons cause activity to stabilize, such that one state is preferred and other states suppressed. In the case of head direction, the cells are conceptualized as forming an imaginary ring, with each cell exciting cells coding for its own or neighboring directions, and suppressing cells coding for other directions. Direct evidence for such an organization in insects was recently reported:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seelig|first=JD|date=May 14, 2015|title=Neural dynamics for landmark orientation and angular path integration|journal=Nature|volume=521|issue=7551|pages=186\u2013191|doi=10.1038/nature14446|pmid=25971509|author2=Jayaraman V|pmc=4704792}}</ref> in mammals it is assumed that the \"ring\" is distributed, and not a geometric anatomical form. However, anatomical evidence for such excitatory interconnections between head direction cells is lacking.

Limited numbers of robust HD cells have also been observed in the hippocampus and dorsal striatum.

In particular, during [[rapid eye movement sleep]], a brain state rich in dreaming activity in humans and whose electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from the waking brain, this directional signal moves as if the animal is awake: that is, HD neurons are sequentially activated, and the individual neurons representing a common direction during wake are still active, or silent, at the same time.\n\n== Vestibular influences ==\n\nThe HD network makes use of inertial and other movement-related inputs, and thus continues to operate even in the absence of light.  These inertial properties are dependent on the [[vestibular system]], especially the [[semicircular canals]] of the [[inner ear]], which signal rotations of the head.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Ryan M.|last2=Taube|first2=Jeffrey S.|date=2014-01-01|title=The vestibular contribution to the head direction signal and navigation|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=32|doi=10.3389/fnint.2014.00032|pmc=4001061|pmid=24795578}}</ref> The HD system integrates the vestibular output to maintain a signal reflecting cumulative rotation.  The integration is less than perfect, though, especially for slow head rotations.  If an animal is placed on an isolated platform and slowly rotated in the dark, the alignment of the HD system usually shifts a little bit for each rotation.  If an animal explores a dark environment with no directional cues, the HD alignment tends to drift slowly and randomly over time.\n\n== Visual and other sensory influences ==\nOne of the most interesting aspects of head direction cells is that their firing is not fully determined by sensory features of the environment.  When an animal comes into a novel environment for the first time, the alignment of the head direction system is arbitrary.  Over the first few minutes of exploration, the animal learns to associate the landmarks in the environment with directions.  When the animal comes back into the same environment at a later time, if the head direction system is misaligned, the learned associations serve to realign it.\n\nIt is possible to temporarily disrupt the alignment of the HD system, for example by turning out the lights for a few minutes.  Even in the dark, the HD system continues to operate, but its alignment to the environment may gradually drift.  When the lights are turned back on and the animal can once more see landmarks, the HD system usually comes rapidly back into the normal alignment.  Occasionally the realignment is delayed:  the HD cells may maintain an abnormal alignment for as long as a few minutes, but then abruptly snap back. Consistent with the drifting in the dark, HD cells are not sensitive to the polarity of geomagnetic fields.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tryon|first=Valerie L.|last2=Kim|first2=Esther U.|last3=Zafar|first3=Talal J.|last4=Unruh|first4=April M.|last5=Staley|first5=Shelly R.|last6=Calton|first6=Jeffrey L.|date=2012-12-01|title=Magnetic field polarity fails to influence the directional signal carried by the head direction cell network and the behavior of rats in a task requiring magnetic field orientation|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=126|issue=6|pages=835\u2013844|doi=10.1037/a0030248|issn=1939-0084|pmid=23025828}}</ref>\n\nIf these sorts of misalignment experiments are done too often, the system may break down.  If an animal is repeatedly disoriented, and then placed into an environment for a few minutes each time, the landmarks gradually lose their ability to control the HD system, and eventually, the system goes into a state where it shows a different, and random, alignment on each trial {{Citation needed|reason= |date=October 2016}}.\n\nThere is evidence that the visual control of HD cells is mediated by the postsubiculum.  Lesions of the postsubiculum do not eliminate thalamic HD cells, but they often cause the directionality to drift over time, even when there are plenty of visual cues.  Thus, HD cells in postsub{{typo help inline|reason=similar to postbus|date=November 2019}}-lesioned animals behave like HD cells in intact animals in the absence of light.  Also, only a minority of cells recorded in the postsubiculum are HD cells, and many of the others show visual responses. In familiar environments, HD cells show consistent preferred directions across time as long as there is a polarizing cue of some sort that allows directions to be identified (in a cylinder with unmarked walls and no cues in the distance, preferred directions may drift over time){{Citation needed|reason=Skaggs et al?!|date=October 2016}}.\n\n== Theoretical models ==\nThe properties of the head direction system - particularly its persistence in the dark, and also the constant relationship of firing directions between cells regardless of environmental changes - suggested to early theoreticians the still-accepted notion that the cells might be organized in the form of a ring attractor,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=K.|date=1996-03-15|title=Representation of spatial orientation by the intrinsic dynamics of the head-direction cell ensemble: a theory|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=16|issue=6|pages=2112\u20132126|issn=0270-6474|pmid=8604055|pmc=6578512|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-06-02112.1996}}</ref> which is a type of [[attractor network]]. In an attractor network, interactions between neurons cause activity to stabilize, such that one state is preferred and other states suppressed. In the case of head direction, the cells are conceptualized as forming an imaginary ring, with each cell exciting cells coding for its own or neighboring directions, and suppressing cells coding for other directions. Direct evidence for such an organization in insects was recently reported:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seelig|first=JD|date=May 14, 2015|title=Neural dynamics for landmark orientation and angular path integration|journal=Nature|volume=521|issue=7551|pages=186\u2013191|doi=10.1038/nature14446|pmid=25971509|author2=Jayaraman V|pmc=4704792}}</ref> in mammals it is assumed that the \"ring\" is distributed, and not a geometric anatomical form.

Limited numbers of robust HD cells have also been observed in the hippocampus and dorsal striatum.  Recently, substantial numbers of HD cells have been found in the medial entorhinal cortex, intermingled with spatially tuned [[grid cells]].\n\nThe remarkable properties of HD cells, most particularly their conceptual simplicity and their ability to maintain firing when visual cues were removed or perturbed, led to considerable interest from theoretical neuroscientists.  Several mathematical models were developed, which differed on details but had in common a dependence on mutually excitatory feedback to sustain activity patterns:  a type of [[working memory]], as it were.<ref>{{cite journal \n| last =Zhang\n| first =K\n| title =Representation of spatial orientation by the intrinsic dynamics of the head-direction cell ensemble: a theory.\n|journal =J.

He died in 1970, aged 65. As he had left nothing to her, George's estranged wife, Selina Whittle, began legal proceedings in May 1972 to obtain money from her husband's estate. The story was picked up by the ''[[Daily Express]]''.\n\n=='''''Kidnapping :''''' ==\n'''''Requiring money, Neilson read about a dispute between Whittle and Selina. He decided he was going to kidnap either Ronald or Dorothy Whittle and hold them until a \u00a350,000 ransom had been paid. He had estimated that the Whittles could easily afford \u00a350,000.

But a series of police bungles and other circumstances delayed the investigation.<ref name=Telg8060030/>\n\nThe story quickly leaked to the press, and was carried on the evening television news that day. No telephone call came to the Swan shopping centre phonebox in Kidderminster.\n\nAt 11:45 pm on 16 January, in a tape played by Neilson over the telephone, a message recorded by Lesley told her family that she was alright, and that someone from her family was to go to the phonebox in [[Kidsgrove]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], to retrieve a second message that was behind the back-board of the phonebox. Verifying the voice as Lesley's, it was agreed that Ronald Whittle would undertake the drop, monitored by a police radio network that could give him assistance within two minutes. After the police had taken two hours to make extensive arrangements, Ronald left [[Bridgnorth]] police station at 1:30 am on 17 January, with a suitcase packed with \u00a350,000 to drive to Kidsgrove. But being unfamiliar with the area he got lost, eventually arriving at Kidsgrove Post Office phonebox late. After searching for thirty minutes, he found a Dymotape message that directed him to Bathpool Park, which was situated about {{convert|1.5|mi}} away. The message instructed him to:<ref name=Kidsinfo>{{cite web |url=http://www.kidsgrove.info/legend.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407020508/http://www.kidsgrove.info/legend.htm |archivedate=7 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{cquote|''GO TO THE TOP OF THE LANE AND TURN INTO NO ENTRY GO TO THE WALL AND FLASH LIGHTS LOOK FOR TORCHLIGHT RUN TO TORCH FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS ON TORCH''}}\nArriving at Bathpool Park 90 minutes late, Ronald turned into the \"No Entry\" sign as instructed, but in the dark he did not see the low wall that edged the railway bridge, and drove to the end of the lane. He stopped, flashed his lights and then got out of the car and shouted; there was no-one there. Ronald left the park and met up again with the police at an arranged meeting point. West Mercia police officers put the blame for the failed operation onto [[Staffordshire Police]], after a patrol car was seen driving through the area. A courting couple in a car had also parked near where the ransom was to have been left.<ref name=BBC8365884/> A subsequent search of Bathpool Park by police revealed no clues.\n\nA week later, [[West Midlands Police]] contacted West Mercia. On the same night of the failed ransom drop, a car had been left near a [[Freightliner Group Limited|Freightliner]] railway terminal in [[Dudley]], where security guard Gerald Smith had been shot in the back six times, and was now in hospital recovering. In the car were a cassette tape with Lesley Whittle's voice on it, asking her relatives to co-operate with the kidnapper, her slippers, and a roll of plastic tape, all of which linked Neilson to the kidnapping. Ballistics evidence and finger prints on the cartridges also linked the same man to the Freightliner shooting, the previous post office robberies and thus the Black Panther murders.<ref name=BBC8365884/>\n\nOn 10 February 1975, the news black-out was lifted. On 5 March, Chief Superintendent Booth and Ronald Whittle appeared together on both national and local television. The next day a headmaster at a local school told police that a pupil had brought him a piece of Dymotape that read ''\"DROP SUITCASE INTO HOLE\"'' and, subsequently, other pupils had found a [[torch]] wedged in the grilles of what was locally known as the \"glory-hole\", one of the capped ventilation shafts of the old [[Harecastle Tunnel]]. The boys who found the torch in Bathpool Park had given it to the headmaster several weeks before, but neither had realised the significance of the find until the television broadcast.\n\nOn 6 March 1975, police started a second thorough search of Bathpool Park, starting with the glory-hole, within which a detective constable found a Dymotape machine and a roll of Dymotape. An inspection of the second shaft revealed nothing. The third shaft, the deepest of the three and once an air ventilation shaft for Nelson's Coal Mine, was then uncapped. As it was subject to [[HM Inspectorate of Mines]] regulations it had to be checked for gas, and so late in the day the investigation was suspended. On Friday, 7 March 1975, after gas tests had been passed, police officers and mine rescue staff entered the third shaft. Accessed by a vertical ladder, {{convert|22|ft}} down on the first landing, a broken police torch was found from the previous day's work. A further {{convert|45|ft}} down on a second landing, a cassette tape recorder was found. A further {{convert|54|ft}} down on a third landing, the team found a rolled up sleeping bag that was acting as a pillow, a yellow foam mattress and a survival blanket. Lesley's body was found hanging from a steel wire, only {{convert|7|inch}} from the bottom of the shaft.<ref name=BBC2516085>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/7/newsid_2516000/2516085.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=1975: Kidnapped heiress found strangled | date=7 March 1975}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent inspection of the floor of the shaft, {{convert|7|ft}} below the third landing, found 3 inch strips of [[elastoplast]] which had been used as a blindfold; a pair of brown size 7 trainers; more Dymotape; a cassette tape; a microphone and lead; a Thermos flask; blue cord trousers; and a reporter's note pad. Out of all of the items recovered from the three shafts which were later forensically inspected by the police, there was only one partial fingerprint, on the reporter's notepad. After four months of every other fingerprint investigation in the nation practically being put on hold, no match could be found.<ref name=Kidsinfo/>\n\n===Consequent actions===\nChief Superintendent Bob Booth, who led the investigation into Lesley's kidnapping, was subsequently demoted from CID to a uniformed beat officer.<ref name=BBC2516085/> DCI Walter Boreham later recalled that, although the Scotland Yard team finished up with several million handwritten index cards, as well as tens of thousands of statements and other documents, [[Home Office]] computer scientists were sceptical that computerising the case, then a rarity, would be an improvement.<ref name=Telg8060030/> Alex Rennie, who was Chief Constable of West Mercia Police when Lesley Whittle was murdered,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westmercia.police.uk/news/news-articles/former-police-chief-visits-hq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505175520/http://www.westmercia.police.uk/news/news-articles/former-police-chief-visits-hq.html |archivedate=5 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> had all of the notes not used during the trial destroyed when he retired.

An alternative scenario is that Neilson was not present when Whittle died and that he fled on the night of the failed ransom collection without returning to the shaft, believing the police were closing in on him, leaving Whittle alive in the dark for a considerable period of time before falling to her death.\n\nPost-mortem examination showed that Whittle had not died from strangulation but had died instantly from [[vagal]] inhibition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&dat=19750310&id=E9AhAAAAIBAJ&pg=2881,3660456|title=Police say heiress died from shock|publisher=Daytona Beach Morning Journal/Google|date=10 March 1975|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref> The shock of the fall had caused her heart to stop beating. The pathologist, Dr John Brown, reported that this would have been induced by high blood pressure in her [[carotid artery]], caused by the constrictive wire loop around her neck triggering an alarm to her brain via the vagus nerve. The brain's response to this urgent signal for reduction in artery pressure would be to radically slow down the heart, and when that failed, her heart stopped altogether. The pathologist reported that Lesley weighed only 7 stone (98&nbsp;lb or 44&nbsp;kg) when found; her stomach and intestines were completely empty, she had lost a considerable amount of weight and she was emaciated.<ref name=BBC2516085/>\n\n==Arrest and conviction==\n{{main|Donald Neilson}}\nNeilson subsequently became Britain's most wanted man.<ref name=EASDeath/> In December 1975, two police officers spotted a man seen acting suspiciously in [[Mansfield]], who turned out to be Neilson. Armed with a [[sawn-off shotgun]], he was arrested with the help of several customers in a nearby [[Fish and chips|fish and chip]] shop.\n\nIn the subsequent investigation, Neilson's fingerprints were found to match one of those in the drain shaft. In the interview at [[Kidsgrove]] police station when he confessed to the kidnapping of Lesley, Neilson gave an 18-page statement to DCS Harold Wright, head of Staffordshire CID, and Commander Morrison of Scotland Yard, with the statement hand-written by DCI Walter Boreham.<ref name=Telg8060030>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8060030/Walter-Boreham.html |title=Walter Boreham |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 12 October 2010|accessdate=19 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nDuring his trial at Oxford Crown Court, Neilson's defence lawyer suggested that Lesley had accidentally fallen from the ledge and had hanged herself, and that Neilson had cared for her, feeding her [[chicken soup]], [[spaghetti]] and meatballs, and buying her fish and chips and chicken legs. In July 1976, Neilson was convicted of the murder of Lesley Whittle, for which he was given a life sentence; and a total of 61 years (running concurrently, with the longest being 21 years) for other offences. Three weeks later he was convicted of the murder of three post office workers, and given three further life sentences.

She drove to Ronald's house and then returned with Ronald and his wife, Gaynor, back to the Whittle family home, where they found a second copy of the Dymotape ransom note tucked inside a box of [[Turkish Delight]] in the lounge. After finding that Lesley's dressing gown and slippers were missing, confirming that she had been kidnapped, Ronald Whittle immediately called the police.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/14/newsid_2530000/2530669.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1975: Heiress Lesley Whittle kidnapped |publisher=BBC News |date= 14 January 1975|accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Investigation==\nAn investigation led by [[Chief superintendent|Detective Chief Superintendent]] Robert Booth of [[West Mercia Police]], with assistance from [[Scotland Yard]] sent a team led by Commander John Morrison that included DCI Walter Boreham.<ref name=Telg8060030/> During the height of the investigation, it involved over 250 officers from the Shropshire, Staffordshire and West Midlands police forces, plus Scotland Yard. But a series of police bungles and other circumstances delayed the investigation.<ref name=Telg8060030/>\n\nThe story quickly leaked to the press, and was carried on the evening television news that day. No telephone call came to the Swan shopping centre phonebox in Kidderminster.\n\nAt 11:45 pm on 16 January, in a tape played by Neilson over the telephone, a message recorded by Lesley told her family that she was alright, and that someone from her family was to go to the phonebox in [[Kidsgrove]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], to retrieve a second message that was behind the back-board of the phonebox. Verifying the voice as Lesley's, it was agreed that Ronald Whittle would undertake the drop, monitored by a police radio network that could give him assistance within two minutes. After the police had taken two hours to make extensive arrangements, Ronald left [[Bridgnorth]] police station at 1:30 am on 17 January, with a suitcase packed with \u00a350,000 to drive to Kidsgrove. But being unfamiliar with the area he got lost, eventually arriving at Kidsgrove Post Office phonebox late. After searching for thirty minutes, he found a Dymotape message that directed him to Bathpool Park, which was situated about {{convert|1.5|mi}} away. The message instructed him to:<ref name=Kidsinfo>{{cite web |url=http://www.kidsgrove.info/legend.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407020508/http://www.kidsgrove.info/legend.htm |archivedate=7 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{cquote|''GO TO THE TOP OF THE LANE AND TURN INTO NO ENTRY GO TO THE WALL AND FLASH LIGHTS LOOK FOR TORCHLIGHT RUN TO TORCH FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS ON TORCH''}}\nArriving at Bathpool Park 90 minutes late, Ronald turned into the \"No Entry\" sign as instructed, but in the dark he did not see the low wall that edged the railway bridge, and drove to the end of the lane. He stopped, flashed his lights and then got out of the car and shouted; there was no-one there. Ronald left the park and met up again with the police at an arranged meeting point. West Mercia police officers put the blame for the failed operation onto [[Staffordshire Police]], after a patrol car was seen driving through the area. A courting couple in a car had also parked near where the ransom was to have been left.<ref name=BBC8365884/> A subsequent search of Bathpool Park by police revealed no clues.\n\nA week later, [[West Midlands Police]] contacted West Mercia. On the same night of the failed ransom drop, a car had been left near a [[Freightliner Group Limited|Freightliner]] railway terminal in [[Dudley]], where security guard Gerald Smith had been shot in the back six times, and was now in hospital recovering. In the car were a cassette tape with Lesley Whittle's voice on it, asking her relatives to co-operate with the kidnapper, her slippers, and a roll of plastic tape, all of which linked Neilson to the kidnapping. Ballistics evidence and finger prints on the cartridges also linked the same man to the Freightliner shooting, the previous post office robberies and thus the Black Panther murders.<ref name=BBC8365884/>\n\nOn 10 February 1975, the news black-out was lifted. On 5 March, Chief Superintendent Booth and Ronald Whittle appeared together on both national and local television. The next day a headmaster at a local school told police that a pupil had brought him a piece of Dymotape that read ''\"DROP SUITCASE INTO HOLE\"'' and, subsequently, other pupils had found a [[torch]] wedged in the grilles of what was locally known as the \"glory-hole\", one of the capped ventilation shafts of the old [[Harecastle Tunnel]]. The boys who found the torch in Bathpool Park had given it to the headmaster several weeks before, but neither had realised the significance of the find until the television broadcast.\n\nOn 6 March 1975, police started a second thorough search of Bathpool Park, starting with the glory-hole, within which a detective constable found a Dymotape machine and a roll of Dymotape. An inspection of the second shaft revealed nothing. The third shaft, the deepest of the three and once an air ventilation shaft for Nelson's Coal Mine, was then uncapped. As it was subject to [[HM Inspectorate of Mines]] regulations it had to be checked for gas, and so late in the day the investigation was suspended. On Friday, 7 March 1975, after gas tests had been passed, police officers and mine rescue staff entered the third shaft. Accessed by a vertical ladder, {{convert|22|ft}} down on the first landing, a broken police torch was found from the previous day's work. A further {{convert|45|ft}} down on a second landing, a cassette tape recorder was found. A further {{convert|54|ft}} down on a third landing, the team found a rolled up sleeping bag that was acting as a pillow, a yellow foam mattress and a survival blanket. Lesley's body was found hanging from a steel wire, only {{convert|7|inch}} from the bottom of the shaft.<ref name=BBC2516085>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/7/newsid_2516000/2516085.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=1975: Kidnapped heiress found strangled | date=7 March 1975}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent inspection of the floor of the shaft, {{convert|7|ft}} below the third landing, found 3 inch strips of [[elastoplast]] which had been used as a blindfold; a pair of brown size 7 trainers; more Dymotape; a cassette tape; a microphone and lead; a Thermos flask; blue cord trousers; and a reporter's note pad. Out of all of the items recovered from the three shafts which were later forensically inspected by the police, there was only one partial fingerprint, on the reporter's notepad. After four months of every other fingerprint investigation in the nation practically being put on hold, no match could be found.<ref name=Kidsinfo/>\n\n===Consequent actions===\nChief Superintendent Bob Booth, who led the investigation into Lesley's kidnapping, was subsequently demoted from CID to a uniformed beat officer.<ref name=BBC2516085/> DCI Walter Boreham later recalled that, although the Scotland Yard team finished up with several million handwritten index cards, as well as tens of thousands of statements and other documents, [[Home Office]] computer scientists were sceptical that computerising the case, then a rarity, would be an improvement.<ref name=Telg8060030/> Alex Rennie, who was Chief Constable of West Mercia Police when Lesley Whittle was murdered,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westmercia.police.uk/news/news-articles/former-police-chief-visits-hq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505175520/http://www.westmercia.police.uk/news/news-articles/former-police-chief-visits-hq.html |archivedate=5 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> had all of the notes not used during the trial destroyed when he retired. Rennie, in retirement, later explained:<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/8156721.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Chief had Panther notes destroyed | date=17 July 2009}}</ref>\n{{cquote|We took thousands of notes and interviewed hundreds of witnesses and potential suspects. The reason (that I had the notes destroyed) being it might have been poking our noses into the private lives of people and upsetting families. Journalists and others had virtually demanded to be given the information, and that would have been dishonest and might have caused irreparable damage to families.}}\n\n==Cause of Whittle's death and post mortem findings==\nIt is widely believed that Neilson pushed Lesley off the ledge in the drainage shaft, strangling her. An alternative scenario is that Neilson was not present when Whittle died and that he fled on the night of the failed ransom collection without returning to the shaft, believing the police were closing in on him, leaving Whittle alive in the dark for a considerable period of time before falling to her death.\n\nPost-mortem examination showed that Whittle had not died from strangulation but had died instantly from [[vagal]] inhibition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&dat=19750310&id=E9AhAAAAIBAJ&pg=2881,3660456|title=Police say heiress died from shock|publisher=Daytona Beach Morning Journal/Google|date=10 March 1975|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref> The shock of the fall had caused her heart to stop beating. The pathologist, Dr John Brown, reported that this would have been induced by high blood pressure in her [[carotid artery]], caused by the constrictive wire loop around her neck triggering an alarm to her brain via the vagus nerve. The brain's response to this urgent signal for reduction in artery pressure would be to radically slow down the heart, and when that failed, her heart stopped altogether. The pathologist reported that Lesley weighed only 7 stone (98&nbsp;lb or 44&nbsp;kg) when found; her stomach and intestines were completely empty, she had lost a considerable amount of weight and she was emaciated.<ref name=BBC2516085/>\n\n==Arrest and conviction==\n{{main|Donald Neilson}}\nNeilson subsequently became Britain's most wanted man.<ref name=EASDeath/> In December 1975, two police officers spotted a man seen acting suspiciously in [[Mansfield]], who turned out to be Neilson. Armed with a [[sawn-off shotgun]], he was arrested with the help of several customers in a nearby [[Fish and chips|fish and chip]] shop.\n\nIn the subsequent investigation, Neilson's fingerprints were found to match one of those in the drain shaft. In the interview at [[Kidsgrove]] police station when he confessed to the kidnapping of Lesley, Neilson gave an 18-page statement to DCS Harold Wright, head of Staffordshire CID, and Commander Morrison of Scotland Yard, with the statement hand-written by DCI Walter Boreham.<ref name=Telg8060030>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8060030/Walter-Boreham.html |title=Walter Boreham |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 12 October 2010|accessdate=19 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nDuring his trial at Oxford Crown Court, Neilson's defence lawyer suggested that Lesley had accidentally fallen from the ledge and had hanged herself, and that Neilson had cared for her, feeding her [[chicken soup]], [[spaghetti]] and meatballs, and buying her fish and chips and chicken legs. In July 1976, Neilson was convicted of the murder of Lesley Whittle, for which he was given a life sentence; and a total of 61 years (running concurrently, with the longest being 21 years) for other offences. Three weeks later he was convicted of the murder of three post office workers, and given three further life sentences. The offences regarding the shooting of security guard Gerald Smith were [[Lie on file|left on file]], as Smith had died more than a year and a day after the shooting.<ref name=BBC8365884>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/shropshire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8365000/8365884.stm |title=BBC \u2013 Legacy of Black Panther murders |publisher=BBC News |date=27 January 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2008 appeal and Neilson's death===\nIn 2008, Neilson was suffering from [[motor neurone disease]] and appealed against his sentence, requesting it be commuted to a maximum of 30 years.

However the [[Audi RS 6|Audi ''RS 6'']] (C6) was never exported to the United States due to emissions regulations, leaving the Audi S6 (C6) as the top performing trim to compete against the BMW M5 (E60) in that market [http://www.roadandtrack.com/2013-audi-s7 2013 Audi S7].\n\nThere used to be only one RS model in production at a time, but recently Audi has revised its policies and decided to make more than one RS model at a time, claiming that \"customers want them, then why not give it to them\". \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;

His name may be translated as \"Earth Treasury\", \"Earth Store\", \"Earth Matrix\", or \"Earth Womb\".  K\u1e63itigarbha is known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the [[Desire realm|six worlds]] between the death of [[Gautama Buddha]] and the rise of [[Maitreya]], as well as his vow not to achieve [[Buddhahood]] until all [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]s are emptied. He is therefore often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell-beings, as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children and aborted fetuses in Japanese culture, where he is known as Jiz\u014d or Ojiz\u014d-sama.\n\nUsually depicted as a monk with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around his shaved head, he carries a [[khakkhara|staff]] to force open the gates of hell and a [[Cintamani|wish-fulfilling jewel]] to light up the darkness.\n\n== Overview ==\nK\u1e63itigarbha is one of the four principal [[bodhisattva]]s in East Asian [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. The others are [[Samantabhadra]], [[Manjusri]], and [[Avalokite\u015bvara]].\n\nAt the pre-[[Tang dynasty]] grottos in [[Dunhuang]] and [[Longmen Grottoes|Longmen]], he is depicted in a classical bodhisattva form. After the Tang, he became increasingly depicted as a monk carrying [[Buddhist prayer beads]] and a staff. \n\nHis full name in Chinese is ''Dayuan Dizang Pusa'' ({{zh|t=\u5927\u9858\u5730\u85cf\u83e9\u85a9|p=D\u00e0yu\u00e0n D\u00ecz\u00e0ng P\u00fas\u00e0}}), or \"Bodhisattva King K\u1e63itigarbha of the Great Vow,\" pronounced ''Daigan Jiz\u014d Bosatsu'' in Japanese and ''Jijang Bosal'' in Korean. This name is a reference to his pledge, as recorded in the [[sutra]]s, to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the [[Desire realm|six worlds]] in the era between the [[parinirvana]] of the Buddha and the rise of Maitreya. Because of this important role, shrines to K\u1e63itigarbha often occupy a central role in temples, especially within the memorial halls or mausoleums.\n\n== Sources ==\n\n=== As a Brahmin maiden ===\nThe story of K\u1e63itigarbha was first described in the ''[[K\u1e63itigarbha Bodhisattva P\u016brvapra\u1e47idh\u0101na S\u016btra]]'', one of the most popular [[Mahayana sutras]]. This sutra is said to have been spoken by the Buddha towards the end of his life to the beings of the [[Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba]] Heaven as a mark of gratitude and remembrance for his beloved mother, [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]]. The ''[[K\u1e63itigarbha Bodhisattva P\u016brvapra\u1e47idh\u0101na S\u016btra]]'' begins, \"[[Thus have I heard]]. Once the Buddha was abiding in Trayastrimsas Heaven in order to expound the Dharma to his mother.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 1. The Sutra of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha's Fundamental Vows|url=http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/ksitigarbha/chap1.html|website=www.sinc.sunysb.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe ''K\u1e63itigarbha Bodhisattva P\u016brvapra\u1e47idh\u0101na S\u016btra'' was first translated from [[Sanskrit]] into Chinese between 695-700 CE, during the [[Tang dynasty]], by the [[Tripi\u1e6daka]] master [[\u015aik\u1e63\u0101nanda]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Buswell|first=Robert E., ed.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2014|isbn=|page=448}}</ref> a Buddhist monk from [[Hotan|Khotan]] who also provided a new translation of the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra]]'' and the ''[[La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra]]''. However, some scholars have suspected that instead of being translated, this text may have originated in [[China]], since no Sanskrit manuscripts of this text have been found. Part of the reason for suspicion is that the text advocates [[filial piety in Buddhism|filial piety]], which was stereotypically associated with [[Chinese culture]]. It stated that K\u1e63itigarbha practised filial piety as a mortal, which eventually led to making great vows to save all sentient beings. Since then, other scholars such as [[Gregory Schopen]] have pointed out that Indian Buddhism also had traditions of filial piety.<ref>Schopen, Gregory. ''Filial Piety and the Monk in the Practice of Buddhism: A Question of 'Sinicization' Viewed from the Other Side.''</ref> Currently there is no definitive evidence indicating either an Indian or Chinese origin for the text.\n\nIn the ''K\u1e63itigarbha S\u016btra'', the Buddha states that in the distant past eons, K\u1e63itigarbha was a maiden of the [[Brahmin]] caste by the name of ''Sacred Girl''.<ref>Frederic, Louis. ''Buddhism: Flammarion Iconographic Guides.'' 1995. pp. 184-185</ref><ref>Edkins, Joseph. ''Chinese Buddhism.'' 2003. pp. 225-226</ref> This maiden was deeply troubled upon the death of her mother - who had often been slanderous towards the [[Three Jewels]]. To save her mother from the great tortures of hell, the girl sold whatever she had and used the money to buy offerings that she offered daily to the Buddha of her time, known as the Buddha of the Flower of Meditation and Enlightenment. She prayed fervently that her mother be spared the pains of hell and appealed to the Buddha for help.<ref name=\"buddhanet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/tstang-txt.htm |title=Ti Tsang P'usa: Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva |publisher=Buddhanet.net |accessdate=2012-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103093104/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/tstang-txt.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWhile she was pleading for help at the temple, she heard the Buddha telling her to go home, sit down, and recite his name if she wanted to know where her mother was. She did as she was told and her consciousness was transported to a Hell realm, where she met a guardian who informed her that through her fervent prayers and pious offerings, her mother had accumulated much [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] and had already ascended to heaven. Sacred Girl was greatly relieved and would have been extremely happy, but the sight of the suffering she had seen in Hell touched her heart. She vowed to do her best to relieve beings of their suffering in her future lives for [[kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]].<ref name=\"buddhanet1\"/>\n\n=== As a Buddhist monk ===\n[[File:Goryeo-Kshitigarbha (Chijang)-late.14c.jpg|thumb|K\u1e63itigarbha painting, [[Goryeo]], late 14th century]]\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n\nThere is a legend about how K\u1e63itigarbha manifested himself in China and chose his [[bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da]] to be [[Mount Jiuhua]], one of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Four Sacred Mountains of China]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Emperor Ming of Han]], Buddhism started to flourish, reaching its peak in the Tang and eventually spreading to Korea. At the time, monks and scholars arrived from those countries to seek the [[dharma]] in China. One of these pilgrims was a former prince from [[Silla]] named [[Kim Gyo-gak]], who became a monk under the Chinese name Dizang \"K\u1e63itigarbha,\" pronounced ''Jijang'' in Korean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fo365.cn/jswz_view.asp?id=230 |script-title=zh:\u91ca\u5730\u85cf\u91d1\u4e54\u89c9\u8003 |publisher=Fo365.cn |accessdate=2012-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209002310/http://www.fo365.cn/jswz_view.asp?id=230 |archivedate=December 9, 2011 }}</ref> He went to Mount Jiuhua in present-day [[Anhui]]. After ascending, he decided to build a hut in a deep mountain area so that he could cultivate the dharma.\n\nAccording to records, Jijang was bitten by a poisonous snake but he did not move, thus letting the snake go. A woman happened to pass by and gave the monk medicines to cure him of the venom, as well as a spring on her son's behalf. For a few years, Jijang continued to meditate in his hut, until one day, a scholar named Chu-Ke led a group of friends and family to visit the mountain. Noticing the monk meditating in the hut, they went and took a look at his condition. They had noticed that his bowl did not contain any food, and that his hair had grown back.\n\nTaking pity on the monk, Chu-Ke decided to build a temple as an offering to him. The whole group descended the mountain immediately to discuss plans to build the temple. Mount Jiuhua was also property of a wealthy person called Elder Wen-Ke, who obliged to build a temple on his mountain. Therefore, Wen-Ke and the group ascended the mountain once more and asked Jijang how much land he needed.\n\nJijang replied that he needed a piece of land that could be covered fully by his [[Kasaya (clothing)|kasaya]]. Initially believing that a piece of sash could not provide enough land to build a temple, they were surprised when Jijang threw the kasaya in the air, and the robe expanded in size, covering the entire mountain. Elder Wen-Ke had then decided to renounce the entire mountain to Jijang, and became his protector. Sometime later, Wen-Ke's son also left secular life to become a monk.\n\nJijang lived in Mount Jiuhua for 75 years before passing away at the age of 99. Three years after his [[nirvana]], his tomb was opened, only to reveal that the body [[incorruptibility|had not decayed]]. Because Jijang led his wayplace with much difficulty, most people had the intuition to believe that he was indeed an incarnation of K\u1e63itigarbha.\n\nJijang's well-preserved, dehydrated body may still be viewed today at the monastery he built on Mount Jiuhua.\n\n== Iconography ==\n[[File:Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Wood Statue.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|<!--K\u1e63itigarbha Bodhisattva statue-->Depicted with a crown, staff, and jewel (cintamani). Chinese temple in England.]]\n\n=== Traditional iconography ===\nIn Buddhist iconography, K\u1e63itigarbha is typically depicted with a shaven head, dressed in a monk's simple robes (unlike most other [[bodhisattva]]s, who are dressed like Indian royalty).\n\nIn his left hand, K\u1e63itigarbha holds a tear-shaped jewel or [[cintamani]] (''nyoi h\u014dju'' \u5982\u610f\u5b9d\u73e0 in Japanese);{{sfnp|Bargen|1992|p=344}} in his right hand, he holds a [[khakkhara|staff]] (''shakuj\u014d'' \u932b\u6756 in Japanese{{sfnp|Bargen|1992|p=344}}), which is used to alert insects and small animals of his approach, so that he will not accidentally harm them. This staff is traditionally carried by Buddhist monks. In the Chinese tradition, K\u1e63itigarbha is sometimes depicted wearing a crown like the one worn by [[Vairocana]]. His image is similar to that of the fictional character [[Tang Sanzang]] from the classical novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', so observers sometimes mistake K\u1e63itigarbha for the latter.\n\nLike other bodhisattvas, K\u1e63itigarbha usually is seen standing on a lotus base, symbolising his release from [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. K\u1e63itigarbha's face and head are also idealised, featuring the [[third eye]], elongated ears and the other standard attributes of a [[Buddhahood|buddha]].\n\n=== Iconography in Japan ===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n\n | image1 = Jizo Children.jpg\n | width1 = \n | alt1 = Jiz\u014d\n | caption1 = Jiz\u014d [[bodhisattva]] statue at [[Mibu-dera]] temple, depicted with children and bibs.\n\n | image2 = Jizo Bosatsu Horyuji.JPG\n | width2 = \n | alt2 = Jiz\u014d\n | caption2  = [[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]]\n\n | footer = Jiz\u014d statues in Japan.\n}}\n\nJiz\u014d statues are often adorned with bibs, kerchiefs or [[Kasa (hat)|kasa]] hat on his head, and sometimes dressed with a [[haori]].\n\n[[T\u014dsen-ji]] in [[Katsushika]], [[Tokyo]], contains the \"Bound Jiz\u014d\" of [[\u014coka Tadasuke]] fame, dating from the [[Edo period]]. When petitions are requested before Jiz\u014d, the petitioner ties a rope about the statue. When the wish is granted, the petitioner unties the rope. At the new year, the ropes of the ungranted wishes are cut by the temple priest.\n\n=== K\u1e63itigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways ===\n[[File:K\u1e63itigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways (Stein Painting 19).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of K\u1e63itigarbha as the Lord of the Six Ways from [[Mogao Grottoes]] in [[Dunhuang]]]]\nAnother category of iconographic depiction is K\u1e63itigarbha as the Lord of the Six Ways, an allegorical representation of the [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (Buddhism)|Six Paths of Rebirth]] of the [[Desire realm]] (rebirth into hell, or as pretas, animals, asuras, men, and devas). The Six Paths are often depicted as six rays or beams radiating from the bodhisattva and accompanied by figurative representations of the Six Paths. Many of these depictions in China can be found in [[Shaanxi]] province, perhaps a result of Sanjie Jiao worship in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zhiru|title=The making of a savior bodhisattva: Dizang in Medieval China|year=2007|publisher=University of Hawai'i press|location=Honolulu (T.H.)|isbn=0824830458|pages=68|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref>\n\nA Japanese variation of this depiction is the Six Jiz\u014d, six full sculptural manifestations of the bodhisattva. An example of this can be found in Konjikid\u014d, the \u2018Hall of Gold,\u2019 in the [[Ch\u016bson-ji]] temple.\n\n==In Buddhist traditions==\n\n=== Chinese traditions ===\n\n[[Mount Jiuhua]] in [[Anhui]] is regarded as K\u1e63itigarbha's [[bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da]]. It is one of the Four Sacred Buddhism Mountains in China, and at one time housed more than 300 temples. Today, 95 of these are open to the public. The mountain is a popular destination for pilgrims offering dedications to K\u1e63itigarbha.\n\nIn some areas, the admixture of traditional religions has led to K\u1e63itigarbha being also regarded as a [[Taoist]] deity, albeit his duties differ to what K\u1e63itigarbha does.{{citation needed| reason= For example, in Hong Kong and among [[overseas Chinese]] communities, his images are usually found in the memorial halls of Buddhist and Taoist temples.|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== Japanese traditions ===\n[[File:Jizo_at_Osorezan.jpg|thumb|left|K\u1e63itigarbha (or in Japanese, Jiz\u014d) statue at Osorezan ([[Mount Osore|Mt.

K\u1e63itigarbha is known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the [[Desire realm|six worlds]] between the death of [[Gautama Buddha]] and the rise of [[Maitreya]], as well as his vow not to achieve [[Buddhahood]] until all [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]s are emptied. He is therefore often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell-beings, as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children and aborted fetuses in Japanese culture, where he is known as Jiz\u014d or Ojiz\u014d-sama.\n\nUsually depicted as a monk with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around his shaved head, he carries a [[khakkhara|staff]] to force open the gates of hell and a [[Cintamani|wish-fulfilling jewel]] to light up the darkness.\n\n== Overview ==\nK\u1e63itigarbha is one of the four principal [[bodhisattva]]s in East Asian [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. The others are [[Samantabhadra]], [[Manjusri]], and [[Avalokite\u015bvara]].\n\nAt the pre-[[Tang dynasty]] grottos in [[Dunhuang]] and [[Longmen Grottoes|Longmen]], he is depicted in a classical bodhisattva form. After the Tang, he became increasingly depicted as a monk carrying [[Buddhist prayer beads]] and a staff. \n\nHis full name in Chinese is ''Dayuan Dizang Pusa'' ({{zh|t=\u5927\u9858\u5730\u85cf\u83e9\u85a9|p=D\u00e0yu\u00e0n D\u00ecz\u00e0ng P\u00fas\u00e0}}), or \"Bodhisattva King K\u1e63itigarbha of the Great Vow,\" pronounced ''Daigan Jiz\u014d Bosatsu'' in Japanese and ''Jijang Bosal'' in Korean. This name is a reference to his pledge, as recorded in the [[sutra]]s, to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the [[Desire realm|six worlds]] in the era between the [[parinirvana]] of the Buddha and the rise of Maitreya. Because of this important role, shrines to K\u1e63itigarbha often occupy a central role in temples, especially within the memorial halls or mausoleums.\n\n== Sources ==\n\n=== As a Brahmin maiden ===\nThe story of K\u1e63itigarbha was first described in the ''[[K\u1e63itigarbha Bodhisattva P\u016brvapra\u1e47idh\u0101na S\u016btra]]'', one of the most popular [[Mahayana sutras]]. This sutra is said to have been spoken by the Buddha towards the end of his life to the beings of the [[Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba]] Heaven as a mark of gratitude and remembrance for his beloved mother, [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]]. The ''[[K\u1e63itigarbha Bodhisattva P\u016brvapra\u1e47idh\u0101na S\u016btra]]'' begins, \"[[Thus have I heard]]. Once the Buddha was abiding in Trayastrimsas Heaven in order to expound the Dharma to his mother.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 1.

However, some scholars have suspected that instead of being translated, this text may have originated in [[China]], since no Sanskrit manuscripts of this text have been found. Part of the reason for suspicion is that the text advocates [[filial piety in Buddhism|filial piety]], which was stereotypically associated with [[Chinese culture]]. It stated that K\u1e63itigarbha practised filial piety as a mortal, which eventually led to making great vows to save all sentient beings. Since then, other scholars such as [[Gregory Schopen]] have pointed out that Indian Buddhism also had traditions of filial piety.<ref>Schopen, Gregory. ''Filial Piety and the Monk in the Practice of Buddhism: A Question of 'Sinicization' Viewed from the Other Side.''</ref> Currently there is no definitive evidence indicating either an Indian or Chinese origin for the text.\n\nIn the ''K\u1e63itigarbha S\u016btra'', the Buddha states that in the distant past eons, K\u1e63itigarbha was a maiden of the [[Brahmin]] caste by the name of ''Sacred Girl''.<ref>Frederic, Louis. ''Buddhism: Flammarion Iconographic Guides.'' 1995. pp. 184-185</ref><ref>Edkins, Joseph. ''Chinese Buddhism.'' 2003. pp. 225-226</ref> This maiden was deeply troubled upon the death of her mother - who had often been slanderous towards the [[Three Jewels]]. To save her mother from the great tortures of hell, the girl sold whatever she had and used the money to buy offerings that she offered daily to the Buddha of her time, known as the Buddha of the Flower of Meditation and Enlightenment. She prayed fervently that her mother be spared the pains of hell and appealed to the Buddha for help.<ref name=\"buddhanet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/tstang-txt.htm |title=Ti Tsang P'usa: Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva |publisher=Buddhanet.net |accessdate=2012-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103093104/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/tstang-txt.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWhile she was pleading for help at the temple, she heard the Buddha telling her to go home, sit down, and recite his name if she wanted to know where her mother was. She did as she was told and her consciousness was transported to a Hell realm, where she met a guardian who informed her that through her fervent prayers and pious offerings, her mother had accumulated much [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] and had already ascended to heaven. Sacred Girl was greatly relieved and would have been extremely happy, but the sight of the suffering she had seen in Hell touched her heart. She vowed to do her best to relieve beings of their suffering in her future lives for [[kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]].<ref name=\"buddhanet1\"/>\n\n=== As a Buddhist monk ===\n[[File:Goryeo-Kshitigarbha (Chijang)-late.14c.jpg|thumb|K\u1e63itigarbha painting, [[Goryeo]], late 14th century]]\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n\nThere is a legend about how K\u1e63itigarbha manifested himself in China and chose his [[bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da]] to be [[Mount Jiuhua]], one of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Four Sacred Mountains of China]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Emperor Ming of Han]], Buddhism started to flourish, reaching its peak in the Tang and eventually spreading to Korea. At the time, monks and scholars arrived from those countries to seek the [[dharma]] in China. One of these pilgrims was a former prince from [[Silla]] named [[Kim Gyo-gak]], who became a monk under the Chinese name Dizang \"K\u1e63itigarbha,\" pronounced ''Jijang'' in Korean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fo365.cn/jswz_view.asp?id=230 |script-title=zh:\u91ca\u5730\u85cf\u91d1\u4e54\u89c9\u8003 |publisher=Fo365.cn |accessdate=2012-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209002310/http://www.fo365.cn/jswz_view.asp?id=230 |archivedate=December 9, 2011 }}</ref> He went to Mount Jiuhua in present-day [[Anhui]]. After ascending, he decided to build a hut in a deep mountain area so that he could cultivate the dharma.\n\nAccording to records, Jijang was bitten by a poisonous snake but he did not move, thus letting the snake go. A woman happened to pass by and gave the monk medicines to cure him of the venom, as well as a spring on her son's behalf. For a few years, Jijang continued to meditate in his hut, until one day, a scholar named Chu-Ke led a group of friends and family to visit the mountain. Noticing the monk meditating in the hut, they went and took a look at his condition. They had noticed that his bowl did not contain any food, and that his hair had grown back.\n\nTaking pity on the monk, Chu-Ke decided to build a temple as an offering to him. The whole group descended the mountain immediately to discuss plans to build the temple. Mount Jiuhua was also property of a wealthy person called Elder Wen-Ke, who obliged to build a temple on his mountain. Therefore, Wen-Ke and the group ascended the mountain once more and asked Jijang how much land he needed.\n\nJijang replied that he needed a piece of land that could be covered fully by his [[Kasaya (clothing)|kasaya]]. Initially believing that a piece of sash could not provide enough land to build a temple, they were surprised when Jijang threw the kasaya in the air, and the robe expanded in size, covering the entire mountain. Elder Wen-Ke had then decided to renounce the entire mountain to Jijang, and became his protector. Sometime later, Wen-Ke's son also left secular life to become a monk.\n\nJijang lived in Mount Jiuhua for 75 years before passing away at the age of 99. Three years after his [[nirvana]], his tomb was opened, only to reveal that the body [[incorruptibility|had not decayed]]. Because Jijang led his wayplace with much difficulty, most people had the intuition to believe that he was indeed an incarnation of K\u1e63itigarbha.\n\nJijang's well-preserved, dehydrated body may still be viewed today at the monastery he built on Mount Jiuhua.\n\n== Iconography ==\n[[File:Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Wood Statue.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|<!--K\u1e63itigarbha Bodhisattva statue-->Depicted with a crown, staff, and jewel (cintamani). Chinese temple in England.]]\n\n=== Traditional iconography ===\nIn Buddhist iconography, K\u1e63itigarbha is typically depicted with a shaven head, dressed in a monk's simple robes (unlike most other [[bodhisattva]]s, who are dressed like Indian royalty).\n\nIn his left hand, K\u1e63itigarbha holds a tear-shaped jewel or [[cintamani]] (''nyoi h\u014dju'' \u5982\u610f\u5b9d\u73e0 in Japanese);{{sfnp|Bargen|1992|p=344}} in his right hand, he holds a [[khakkhara|staff]] (''shakuj\u014d'' \u932b\u6756 in Japanese{{sfnp|Bargen|1992|p=344}}), which is used to alert insects and small animals of his approach, so that he will not accidentally harm them. This staff is traditionally carried by Buddhist monks. In the Chinese tradition, K\u1e63itigarbha is sometimes depicted wearing a crown like the one worn by [[Vairocana]]. His image is similar to that of the fictional character [[Tang Sanzang]] from the classical novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', so observers sometimes mistake K\u1e63itigarbha for the latter.\n\nLike other bodhisattvas, K\u1e63itigarbha usually is seen standing on a lotus base, symbolising his release from [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. K\u1e63itigarbha's face and head are also idealised, featuring the [[third eye]], elongated ears and the other standard attributes of a [[Buddhahood|buddha]].\n\n=== Iconography in Japan ===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n\n | image1 = Jizo Children.jpg\n | width1 = \n | alt1 = Jiz\u014d\n | caption1 = Jiz\u014d [[bodhisattva]] statue at [[Mibu-dera]] temple, depicted with children and bibs.\n\n | image2 = Jizo Bosatsu Horyuji.JPG\n | width2 = \n | alt2 = Jiz\u014d\n | caption2  = [[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]]\n\n | footer = Jiz\u014d statues in Japan.\n}}\n\nJiz\u014d statues are often adorned with bibs, kerchiefs or [[Kasa (hat)|kasa]] hat on his head, and sometimes dressed with a [[haori]].\n\n[[T\u014dsen-ji]] in [[Katsushika]], [[Tokyo]], contains the \"Bound Jiz\u014d\" of [[\u014coka Tadasuke]] fame, dating from the [[Edo period]]. When petitions are requested before Jiz\u014d, the petitioner ties a rope about the statue. When the wish is granted, the petitioner unties the rope. At the new year, the ropes of the ungranted wishes are cut by the temple priest.\n\n=== K\u1e63itigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways ===\n[[File:K\u1e63itigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways (Stein Painting 19).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of K\u1e63itigarbha as the Lord of the Six Ways from [[Mogao Grottoes]] in [[Dunhuang]]]]\nAnother category of iconographic depiction is K\u1e63itigarbha as the Lord of the Six Ways, an allegorical representation of the [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (Buddhism)|Six Paths of Rebirth]] of the [[Desire realm]] (rebirth into hell, or as pretas, animals, asuras, men, and devas). The Six Paths are often depicted as six rays or beams radiating from the bodhisattva and accompanied by figurative representations of the Six Paths. Many of these depictions in China can be found in [[Shaanxi]] province, perhaps a result of Sanjie Jiao worship in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zhiru|title=The making of a savior bodhisattva: Dizang in Medieval China|year=2007|publisher=University of Hawai'i press|location=Honolulu (T.H.)|isbn=0824830458|pages=68|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref>\n\nA Japanese variation of this depiction is the Six Jiz\u014d, six full sculptural manifestations of the bodhisattva. An example of this can be found in Konjikid\u014d, the \u2018Hall of Gold,\u2019 in the [[Ch\u016bson-ji]] temple.\n\n==In Buddhist traditions==\n\n=== Chinese traditions ===\n\n[[Mount Jiuhua]] in [[Anhui]] is regarded as K\u1e63itigarbha's [[bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da]]. It is one of the Four Sacred Buddhism Mountains in China, and at one time housed more than 300 temples. Today, 95 of these are open to the public. The mountain is a popular destination for pilgrims offering dedications to K\u1e63itigarbha.\n\nIn some areas, the admixture of traditional religions has led to K\u1e63itigarbha being also regarded as a [[Taoist]] deity, albeit his duties differ to what K\u1e63itigarbha does.{{citation needed| reason= For example, in Hong Kong and among [[overseas Chinese]] communities, his images are usually found in the memorial halls of Buddhist and Taoist temples.|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== Japanese traditions ===\n[[File:Jizo_at_Osorezan.jpg|thumb|left|K\u1e63itigarbha (or in Japanese, Jiz\u014d) statue at Osorezan ([[Mount Osore|Mt.

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

[[Let's Play]] videos and comedic formatted shows. Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays.

{"title_page": "Surge (glacier)", "text_new": "'''Glacial surges''' are short-lived events where a [[glacier]] can advance substantially, moving at velocities up to 100 times faster than normal.  Surging glaciers cluster around a few areas. High concentrations of surging glaciers occur in [[Svalbard]], the [[Canadian Arctic islands]], [[Alaska]] and [[Iceland]]. In some glaciers, surges can occur in fairly regular cycles, with 15 to 100 or more surge events per year. In other glaciers, surging remains unpredictable.<ref>Summerfield, Michael A., 1991, ''Global Geomorphology, an introduction to the study of landforms,'' Pearson, Prentice Hall. Harlow, England</ref> In some glaciers, however, the period of stagnation and build-up between two surges typically lasts 10 to 200 years and is called the quiescent phase.<ref name=Dowdeswell>\nDowdeswell, J.

Glaciers in Alaska exhibit surges with a sudden onset, an extremely high maximum flow rate (tens of meters/day) and a sudden termination, often with a discharge of stored water. These are called Alaskan-type surges and it is suspected that these surges are hydrologically controlled.<ref>Sharp, M., 1988, ''Surging glaciers: geomorphic effects,'' Progress in Physical geography, http://ppg.sagepub.com</ref>\n\nSurges in Svalbard typically exhibit different behavior. Svalbard surges are typically associated with slower onset with an acceleration phase, rising to a maximum velocity which is typically slower (up to four or five meters per day) than Alaskan surges, and a return to quiescence often taking years.<ref name=JJ>Jiskoot, H. and D.

Mini surges typically show lag times of [[basal flow]] of 5\u201310 hours, which correlates to differences between the surging part of a glacier and the output of water and sediment.<ref name=Humphrey/> When the 1982 surge ended on July 5, there was a large flood event that day, and more flooding in the following days.

University of Washington, 1987</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nThere have been many theories of why glacial surges occur.\n\n===Hydrological control===\nSurges may be caused by the supply of meltwater to the base of a glacier. Meltwater is important in reducing frictional forces to glacial ice flow. The distribution and pressure of water at the bed modulates the glacier's velocity and therefore mass balance. Meltwater may come from a number of sources, including [[supraglacial lake]]s, geothermal heating of the bed, conduction of heat into the glacier and latent heat transfers. There is a positive feedback between velocity and friction at the bed, high velocities will generate more frictional heat and create more meltwater. [[crevasse|Crevassing]] is also enhanced by greater velocity flow which will provide further rapid transmission paths for meltwater flowing towards the bed. However, Humphrey found no precise correlation between ice-slow down and the release of water inside of a glacier.<ref name=Humphrey/>\n\nThe evolution of the drainage system under the glacier plays a key role in surge cycles.\n\n===Thermal regime===\n\nGlaciers that exhibit surges like those in Svalbard; with slower onset phase, and a longer termination phase may be thermally controlled rather than hydrologically controlled.<ref>Fowler, A. C., Murray, T. and Ng, F.S.L., ''Thermal regulation of glacier surging,'' Journal of Glaciology, 47(159), 527-538, 2001</ref><ref name=JJ/> These surges tend to last for longer periods of time than hydrologically controlled surges.\n\n===Deformable bed hypothesis===\nIn other cases, the [[geology]] of the underlying [[country rock (geology)|country rock]] may dictate surge frequency.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  For example, poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks are more prone to failure under stress; a sub-glacial \"landslip\" may permit the glacier to slide.  This explains why surging glaciers tend to cluster{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} in certain areas.\n\n===Critical mass===\n\nMeier and Post<ref>Meier, M.F. and Post, A.S., 1969, ''What are glacier surges?'' Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 6, 807-817</ref> suggest that once mass accumulates to a critical point, basal melting begins to occur.

[[Alphonso (mango)|Alphonso mangoes]] and [[coconut]]s are grown commercially in this area.\n\n==Transport==\nAnjarle is connected to Dapoli, the closest town, by [[MSRTC]] buses, private taxis and [[autorickshaw]]s.\n\nAnjarle is situated around 18&nbsp;km from Dapoli.
