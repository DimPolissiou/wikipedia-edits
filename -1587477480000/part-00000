The micro-structure can be broken up into the following zones:\n\n* The ''stir zone'' (also known as the dynamically recrystallised zone) is a region of heavily deformed material that roughly corresponds to the location of the pin during welding. The [[Crystallite|grains]] within the stir zone are roughly equiaxed and often an order of magnitude smaller than the grains in the parent material.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Murr, L.

In this region the strain and temperature are lower and the effect of welding on the micro-structure is correspondingly smaller. Unlike the stir zone, the micro-structure is recognizably that of the parent material, albeit significantly deformed and rotated. Although the term TMAZ technically refers to the entire deformed region, it is often used to describe any region not already covered by the terms stir zone and flow arm.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n* The ''[[heat-affected zone]]'' (HAZ) is common to all welding processes. As indicated by the name, this region is subjected to a thermal cycle but is not deformed during welding. The temperatures are lower than those in the TMAZ but may still have a significant effect if the micro-structure is thermally unstable. In fact, in [[Precipitation hardening|age-hardened]] aluminum alloys this region commonly exhibits the poorest mechanical properties.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = M.

Issues such as [[porosity]], [[solution|solute]] redistribution, [[solidification cracking]] and [[liquation cracking]] do not arise during FSW. In general, FSW has been found to produce a low concentration of defects and is very tolerant to variations in parameters and materials.\n\nNevertheless, FSW is associated with a number of unique defects if it isn't done properly. Insufficient weld temperatures, due to low rotational speeds or high traverse speeds, for example, mean that the weld material is unable to accommodate the extensive deformation during welding. This may result in long, tunnel-like defects running along the weld, which may occur on the surface or subsurface. Low temperatures may also limit the forging action of the tool and so reduce the continuity of the bond between the material from each side of the weld. The light contact between the material has given rise to the name \"kissing bond\". This defect is particularly worrying, since it is very difficult to detect using nondestructive methods such as [[X-ray]] or [[ultrasonic testing]]. If the pin is not long enough or the tool rises out of the plate, then the interface at the bottom of the weld may not be disrupted and forged by the tool, resulting in a lack-of-penetration defect. This is essentially a notch in the material, which can be a potential source of [[fatigue crack]]s.\n\nA number of potential advantages of FSW over conventional fusion-welding processes have been identified:<ref>{{cite conference | author=Nicholas, E. D. | title=Developments in the friction-stir welding of metals | booktitle=ICAA-6: 6th International Conference on Aluminium Alloys | year=1998| location=Toyohashi, Japan}}</ref><ref name=\"Technologie \u2013 StirWeld\"/>\n* Good mechanical properties in the as-welded condition.\n* Improved safety due to the absence of toxic fumes or the spatter of molten material.\n* No consumables&nbsp;\u2014 A threaded pin made of conventional [[tool steel]], e.g., hardened H13, can weld over {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} of aluminium, and no filler or gas shield is required for aluminium.\n* Easily automated on simple milling machines&nbsp;\u2014 lower setup costs and less training.\n* Can operate in all positions (horizontal, vertical, etc.), as there is no weld pool.\n* Generally good weld appearance and minimal thickness under/over-matching, thus reducing the need for expensive machining after welding.\n* Can use thinner materials with same joint strength.\n* Low environmental impact.\n* General performance and cost benefits from switching from fusion to friction.\n\nHowever, some disadvantages of the process have been identified:\n* Exit hole left when tool is withdrawn.\n* Large down forces required with heavy-duty clamping necessary to hold the plates together.\n* Less flexible than manual and arc processes (difficulties with thickness variations and non-linear welds).\n* Often slower traverse rate than some fusion welding techniques, although this may be offset if fewer welding passes are required.\n\n==Important welding parameters==\n\n===Tool design===\n[[File:Advanced friction stir welding and processing tools by MegaStir.JPG|thumb|Advanced friction stir welding and processing tools by MegaStir shown upside down]]\n\nThe design of the tool<ref name=\"Mishra\">By Rajiv S.

Further, it should have a good oxidation resistance and a low [[thermal conductivity]] to minimise heat loss and thermal damage to the machinery further up the drive train. Hot-worked [[tool steel]] such as AISI H13 has proven perfectly acceptable for welding aluminium alloys within thickness ranges of 0.5\u201350&nbsp;mm <ref>{{cite journal |author1=Prado, R.

TWI has developed tools specifically designed to increase the penetration depth and thus increasing the plate thicknesses that can be successfully welded. An example is the \"whorl\" design that uses a tapered pin with re-entrant features or a variable-pitch thread to improve the downwards flow of material. Additional designs include the Triflute and Trivex series. The Triflute design has a complex system of three tapering, threaded re-entrant flutes that appear to increase material movement around the tool. The Trivex tools use a simpler, non-cylindrical, pin and have been found to reduce the forces acting on the tool during welding.\n\nThe majority of tools have a concave shoulder profile, which acts as an escape volume for the material displaced by the pin, prevents material from extruding out of the sides of the shoulder and maintains downwards pressure and hence good forging of the material behind the tool. The Triflute tool uses an alternative system with a series of concentric grooves machined into the surface, which are intended to produce additional movement of material in the upper layers of the weld.\n\nWidespread commercial applications of friction stir welding process for steels and other hard alloys such as [[titanium alloy]]s will require the development of cost-effective and durable tools.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bhadeshia H.

These two parameters have considerable importance and must be chosen with care to ensure a successful and efficient welding cycle. The relationship between the rotation speed, the welding speed and the heat input during welding is complex, but in general, it can be said that increasing the rotation speed or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld, it is necessary that the material surrounding the tool is hot enough to enable the extensive plastic flow required and minimize the forces acting on the tool. If the material is too cold, then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases the tool may break.\n\nExcessively high heat input, on the other hand, may be detrimental to the final properties of the weld. Theoretically, this could even result in defects due to the liquation of low-melting-point phases (similar to liquation cracking in fusion welds). These competing demands lead onto the concept of a \"processing window\": the range of processing parameters viz. tool rotation and traverse speed, that will produce a good quality weld.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2007.10.031 | volume=58 | issue=5 | title=A flow-partitioned deformation zone model for defect formation during friction stir welding | journal=Scripta Materialia | pages=372\u2013376| date=March 2008 | last1=Arbegast | first1=William J. | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259355 }}</ref> Within this window the resulting weld will have a sufficiently high heat input to ensure adequate material plasticity but not so high that the weld properties are excessively deteriorated.\n\n===Tool tilt and plunge depth===\n[[File:Friction_Stir_Weld_Schematic_Canted.png|thumb|A drawing showing the plunge depth and tilt of the tool. The tool is moving to the left.]]\nThe plunge depth is defined as the depth of the lowest point of the shoulder below the surface of the welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality.<ref>{{cite conference | author=Leonard, A. J. | title=Microstructure and aging behaviour of FSW in Al alloys 2014A-T651 and 7075-T651 | booktitle=2nd International Symposium on FSW (CD ROM) | year=2000 | location=Gothenburg, Sweden}}</ref> Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2\u20134 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable-load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement, while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.\n\n==Welding forces==\nDuring welding, a number of forces will act on the tool:<ref>{{cite journal | author1= V Buchibabu. |author2= G M Reddy. | author3= A De. | doi= 10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2016.11.008 | volume=241 | issue=1 |title= Probing torque, traverse force and tool durability in friction stir welding of aluminum alloys | journal= Journal of Materials Processing Technology | pages=86\u201392|date= March 2017 }}</ref>\n* A downwards force is necessary to maintain the position of the tool at or below the material surface. Some friction-stir welding machines operate under load control, but in many cases the vertical position of the tool is preset, and so the load will vary during welding.\n* The traverse force acts parallel to the tool motion and is positive in the traverse direction. Since this force arises as a result of the resistance of the material to the motion of the tool, it might be expected that this force will decrease as the temperature of the material around the tool is increased.\n* The lateral force may act perpendicular to the tool traverse direction and is defined here as positive towards the advancing side of the weld.\n* Torque is required to rotate the tool, the amount of which will depend on the down force and [[friction coefficient]] (sliding friction) and/or the flow strength of the material in the surrounding region ([[stiction]]).\n\nIn order to prevent tool fracture and to minimize excessive wear and tear on the tool and associated machinery, the welding cycle is modified so that the forces acting on the tool are as low as possible, and abrupt changes are avoided. In order to find the best combination of welding parameters, it is likely that a compromise must be reached, since the conditions that favour low forces (e.g. high heat input, low travel speeds) may be undesirable from the point of view of productivity and weld properties.\n\n==Flow of material==\nEarly work on the mode of material flow around the tool used inserts of a different alloy, which had a different contrast to the normal material when viewed through a microscope, in an effort to determine where material was moved as the tool passed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reynolds, A.

In this model the rotation of the tool draws little or no material around the front of the probe; instead, the material parts in front of the pin and passes down either side. After the material has passed the probe, the side pressure exerted by the \"die\" forces the material back together, and consolidation of the join occurs, as the rear of the tool shoulder passes overhead and the large down force forges the material.\n\nMore recently, an alternative theory has been advanced that advocates considerable material movement in certain locations.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Guerra, M. |author2=Schmidt, C. |author3=McClure, J.

The researchers used a combination of thin copper strip inserts and a \"frozen pin\" technique, where the tool is rapidly stopped in place. They suggested that material motion occurs by two processes:\n# Material on the advancing side of a weld enters into a zone that rotates and advances with the profiled probe. This material was very highly deformed and sloughs off behind the pin to form arc-shaped features when viewed from above (i.e. down the tool axis). It was noted that the copper entered the rotational zone around the pin, where it was broken up into fragments. These fragments were only found in the arc-shaped features of material behind the tool.\n# The lighter material came from the retreating side in front of the pin and was dragged around to the rear of the tool and filled in the gaps between the arcs of advancing side material. This material did not rotate around the pin, and the lower level of deformation resulted in a larger grain size.\n\nThe primary advantage of this explanation is that it provides a plausible explanation for the production of the onion-ring structure.\n\nThe marker technique for friction stir welding provides data on the initial and final positions of the marker in the welded material. The flow of material is then reconstructed from these positions. Detailed material flow field during friction stir welding can also be calculated from theoretical considerations based on fundamental scientific principles. Material flow calculations are routinely used in numerous engineering applications.

At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the temperature around the tool is sufficiently high to permit adequate material flow and prevent flaws or tool damage.\n\nWhen the traverse speed is increased, for a given heat input, there is less time for heat to conduct ahead of the tool, and the thermal gradients are larger. At some point the speed will be so high that the material ahead of the tool will be too cold, and the flow stress too high, to permit adequate material movement, resulting in flaws or tool fracture. If the \"hot zone\" is too large, then there is scope to increase the traverse speed and hence productivity.\n\nThe welding cycle can be split into several stages, during which the heat flow and thermal profile will be different:<ref name=\"frigaard2001\">{{cite journal |author1=Frigaard, O. |author2=Grong, O. |author3=Midling, O. T. |title=A process model for friction-stir welding of age hardening aluminium alloys |journal=Metallurgical and Materials Transactions |year= 2001 |volume=32A |issue=5 |pages=1189\u20131200 |doi=10.1007/s11661-001-0128-4}}</ref> \n* ''Dwell''. The material is preheated by a stationary, rotating tool to achieve a sufficient temperature ahead of the tool to allow the traverse. This period may also include the plunge of the tool into the workpiece.\n* ''Transient heating''. When the tool begins to move, there will be a transient period where the heat production and temperature around the tool will alter in a complex manner until an essentially steady state is reached.\n* ''Pseudo steady state''. Although fluctuations in heat generation will occur, the thermal field around the tool remains effectively constant, at least on the macroscopic scale.\n* ''Post steady state''. Near the end of the weld, heat may \"reflect\" from the end of the plate, leading to additional heating around the tool.\n\nHeat generation during friction-stir welding arises from two main sources: friction at the surface of the tool and the deformation of the material around the tool.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Chao, Y. J. |last=Qi, X. |year=1999 |title=Heat transfer and Thermo-Mechanical analysis of FSW joining of 6061-T6 plates |booktitle=1st International Symposium on FSW (CD ROM) |publisher=TWI| location=Thousand Oaks, USA}}</ref> The heat generation is often assumed to occur predominantly under the shoulder, due to its greater surface area, and to be equal to the power required to overcome the contact forces between the tool and the workpiece. The contact condition under the shoulder can be described by sliding friction, using a friction coefficient \u03bc and interfacial pressure ''P'', or sticking friction, based on the interfacial shear strength at an appropriate temperature and strain rate. Mathematical approximations for the total heat generated by the tool shoulder ''Q''<sub>total</sub> have been developed using both sliding and sticking friction models:<ref name=\"frigaard2001\"/>\n\n:<math>Q_\\text{total} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi P \\mu \\omega \\left(R_\\text{shoulder}^3 - R_\\text{pin}^3\\right),</math> &emsp; (sliding)\n\n:<math>Q_\\text{total} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi \\tau \\omega \\left(R_\\text{shoulder}^3 - R_\\text{pin}^3\\right),</math> &emsp; (sticking)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular velocity of the tool, ''R''<sub>shoulder</sub> is the radius of the tool shoulder, and ''R''<sub>pin</sub> is that of the pin. Several other equations have been proposed to account for factors such as the pin, but the general approach remains the same.\n\nA major difficulty in applying these equations is determining suitable values for the friction coefficient or the interfacial shear stress. The conditions under the tool are both extreme and very difficult to measure. To date, these parameters have been used as \"fitting parameters\", where the model works back from measured thermal data to obtain a reasonable simulated thermal field. While this approach is useful for creating process models to predict, for example, residual stresses, it is less useful for providing insights into the process itself.\n\n==Applications==\nThe FSW process has initially been patented by TWI in most industrialised countries and licensed for over 183 users.

The micro-structure can be broken up into the following zones:\n\n* The ''stir zone'' (also known as the dynamically recrystallised zone) is a region of heavily deformed material that roughly corresponds to the location of the pin during welding. The [[Crystallite|grains]] within the stir zone are roughly equiaxed and often an order of magnitude smaller than the grains in the parent material.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Murr, L.

In this region the strain and temperature are lower and the effect of welding on the micro-structure is correspondingly smaller. Unlike the stir zone, the micro-structure is recognizably that of the parent material, albeit significantly deformed and rotated. Although the term TMAZ technically refers to the entire deformed region, it is often used to describe any region not already covered by the terms stir zone and flow arm.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n* The ''[[heat-affected zone]]'' (HAZ) is common to all welding processes. As indicated by the name, this region is subjected to a thermal cycle but is not deformed during welding. The temperatures are lower than those in the TMAZ but may still have a significant effect if the micro-structure is thermally unstable. In fact, in [[Precipitation hardening|age-hardened]] aluminum alloys this region commonly exhibits the poorest mechanical properties.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = M.

Issues such as [[porosity]], [[solution|solute]] redistribution, [[solidification cracking]] and [[liquation cracking]] do not arise during FSW. In general, FSW has been found to produce a low concentration of defects and is very tolerant to variations in parameters and materials.\n\nNevertheless, FSW is associated with a number of unique defects if it isn't done properly. Insufficient weld temperatures, due to low rotational speeds or high traverse speeds, for example, mean that the weld material is unable to accommodate the extensive deformation during welding. This may result in long, tunnel-like defects running along the weld, which may occur on the surface or subsurface. Low temperatures may also limit the forging action of the tool and so reduce the continuity of the bond between the material from each side of the weld. The light contact between the material has given rise to the name \"kissing bond\". This defect is particularly worrying, since it is very difficult to detect using nondestructive methods such as [[X-ray]] or [[ultrasonic testing]]. If the pin is not long enough or the tool rises out of the plate, then the interface at the bottom of the weld may not be disrupted and forged by the tool, resulting in a lack-of-penetration defect. This is essentially a notch in the material, which can be a potential source of [[fatigue crack]]s.\n\nA number of potential advantages of FSW over conventional fusion-welding processes have been identified:<ref>{{cite conference | author=Nicholas, E.

Further, it should have a good oxidation resistance and a low [[thermal conductivity]] to minimise heat loss and thermal damage to the machinery further up the drive train.

TWI has developed tools specifically designed to increase the penetration depth and thus increasing the plate thicknesses that can be successfully welded. An example is the \"whorl\" design that uses a tapered pin with re-entrant features or a variable-pitch thread to improve the downwards flow of material. Additional designs include the Triflute and Trivex series. The Triflute design has a complex system of three tapering, threaded re-entrant flutes that appear to increase material movement around the tool. The Trivex tools use a simpler, non-cylindrical, pin and have been found to reduce the forces acting on the tool during welding.\n\nThe majority of tools have a concave shoulder profile, which acts as an escape volume for the material displaced by the pin, prevents material from extruding out of the sides of the shoulder and maintains downwards pressure and hence good forging of the material behind the tool. The Triflute tool uses an alternative system with a series of concentric grooves machined into the surface, which are intended to produce additional movement of material in the upper layers of the weld.\n\nWidespread commercial applications of friction stir welding process for steels and other hard alloys such as [[titanium alloy]]s will require the development of cost-effective and durable tools.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bhadeshia H.

These two parameters have considerable importance and must be chosen with care to ensure a successful and efficient welding cycle. The relationship between the rotation speed, the welding speed and the heat input during welding is complex, but in general, it can be said that increasing the rotation speed or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld, it is necessary that the material surrounding the tool is hot enough to enable the extensive plastic flow required and minimize the forces acting on the tool. If the material is too cold, then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases the tool may break.\n\nExcessively high heat input, on the other hand, may be detrimental to the final properties of the weld. Theoretically, this could even result in defects due to the liquation of low-melting-point phases (similar to liquation cracking in fusion welds). These competing demands lead onto the concept of a \"processing window\": the range of processing parameters viz. tool rotation and traverse speed, that will produce a good quality weld.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2007.10.031 | volume=58 | issue=5 | title=A flow-partitioned deformation zone model for defect formation during friction stir welding | journal=Scripta Materialia | pages=372\u2013376| date=March 2008 | last1=Arbegast | first1=William J. | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259355 }}</ref> Within this window the resulting weld will have a sufficiently high heat input to ensure adequate material plasticity but not so high that the weld properties are excessively deteriorated.\n\n===Tool tilt and plunge depth===\n[[File:Friction_Stir_Weld_Schematic_Canted.png|thumb|A drawing showing the plunge depth and tilt of the tool. The tool is moving to the left.]]\nThe plunge depth is defined as the depth of the lowest point of the shoulder below the surface of the welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality.<ref>{{cite conference | author=Leonard, A. J. | title=Microstructure and aging behaviour of FSW in Al alloys 2014A-T651 and 7075-T651 | booktitle=2nd International Symposium on FSW (CD ROM) | year=2000 | location=Gothenburg, Sweden}}</ref> Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2\u20134 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable-load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement, while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.\n\n==Welding forces==\nDuring welding, a number of forces will act on the tool:<ref>{{cite journal | author1= V Buchibabu. |author2= G M Reddy. | author3= A De. | doi= 10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2016.11.008 | volume=241 | issue=1 |title= Probing torque, traverse force and tool durability in friction stir welding of aluminum alloys | journal= Journal of Materials Processing Technology | pages=86\u201392|date= March 2017 }}</ref>\n* A downwards force is necessary to maintain the position of the tool at or below the material surface. Some friction-stir welding machines operate under load control, but in many cases the vertical position of the tool is preset, and so the load will vary during welding.\n* The traverse force acts parallel to the tool motion and is positive in the traverse direction. Since this force arises as a result of the resistance of the material to the motion of the tool, it might be expected that this force will decrease as the temperature of the material around the tool is increased.\n* The lateral force may act perpendicular to the tool traverse direction and is defined here as positive towards the advancing side of the weld.\n* Torque is required to rotate the tool, the amount of which will depend on the down force and [[friction coefficient]] (sliding friction) and/or the flow strength of the material in the surrounding region ([[stiction]]).\n\nIn order to prevent tool fracture and to minimize excessive wear and tear on the tool and associated machinery, the welding cycle is modified so that the forces acting on the tool are as low as possible, and abrupt changes are avoided. In order to find the best combination of welding parameters, it is likely that a compromise must be reached, since the conditions that favour low forces (e.g. high heat input, low travel speeds) may be undesirable from the point of view of productivity and weld properties.\n\n==Flow of material==\nEarly work on the mode of material flow around the tool used inserts of a different alloy, which had a different contrast to the normal material when viewed through a microscope, in an effort to determine where material was moved as the tool passed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reynolds, A.

In this model the rotation of the tool draws little or no material around the front of the probe; instead, the material parts in front of the pin and passes down either side. After the material has passed the probe, the side pressure exerted by the \"die\" forces the material back together, and consolidation of the join occurs, as the rear of the tool shoulder passes overhead and the large down force forges the material.\n\nMore recently, an alternative theory has been advanced that advocates considerable material movement in certain locations.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Guerra, M. |author2=Schmidt, C. |author3=McClure, J.

The researchers used a combination of thin copper strip inserts and a \"frozen pin\" technique, where the tool is rapidly stopped in place. They suggested that material motion occurs by two processes:\n# Material on the advancing side of a weld enters into a zone that rotates and advances with the profiled probe. This material was very highly deformed and sloughs off behind the pin to form arc-shaped features when viewed from above (i.e. down the tool axis). It was noted that the copper entered the rotational zone around the pin, where it was broken up into fragments. These fragments were only found in the arc-shaped features of material behind the tool.\n# The lighter material came from the retreating side in front of the pin and was dragged around to the rear of the tool and filled in the gaps between the arcs of advancing side material. This material did not rotate around the pin, and the lower level of deformation resulted in a larger grain size.\n\nThe primary advantage of this explanation is that it provides a plausible explanation for the production of the onion-ring structure.\n\nThe marker technique for friction stir welding provides data on the initial and final positions of the marker in the welded material. The flow of material is then reconstructed from these positions. Detailed material flow field during friction stir welding can also be calculated from theoretical considerations based on fundamental scientific principles. Material flow calculations are routinely used in numerous engineering applications.

At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the temperature around the tool is sufficiently high to permit adequate material flow and prevent flaws or tool damage.\n\nWhen the traverse speed is increased, for a given heat input, there is less time for heat to conduct ahead of the tool, and the thermal gradients are larger. At some point the speed will be so high that the material ahead of the tool will be too cold, and the flow stress too high, to permit adequate material movement, resulting in flaws or tool fracture. If the \"hot zone\" is too large, then there is scope to increase the traverse speed and hence productivity.\n\nThe welding cycle can be split into several stages, during which the heat flow and thermal profile will be different:<ref name=\"frigaard2001\">{{cite journal |author1=Frigaard, O. |author2=Grong, O. |author3=Midling, O.

The contact condition under the shoulder can be described by sliding friction, using a friction coefficient \u03bc and interfacial pressure ''P'', or sticking friction, based on the interfacial shear strength at an appropriate temperature and strain rate. Mathematical approximations for the total heat generated by the tool shoulder ''Q''<sub>total</sub> have been developed using both sliding and sticking friction models:<ref name=\"frigaard2001\"/>\n\n:<math>Q_\\text{total} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi P \\mu \\omega \\left(R_\\text{shoulder}^3 - R_\\text{pin}^3\\right),</math> &emsp; (sliding)\n\n:<math>Q_\\text{total} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi \\tau \\omega \\left(R_\\text{shoulder}^3 - R_\\text{pin}^3\\right),</math> &emsp; (sticking)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular velocity of the tool, ''R''<sub>shoulder</sub> is the radius of the tool shoulder, and ''R''<sub>pin</sub> is that of the pin. Several other equations have been proposed to account for factors such as the pin, but the general approach remains the same.\n\nA major difficulty in applying these equations is determining suitable values for the friction coefficient or the interfacial shear stress. The conditions under the tool are both extreme and very difficult to measure. To date, these parameters have been used as \"fitting parameters\", where the model works back from measured thermal data to obtain a reasonable simulated thermal field. While this approach is useful for creating process models to predict, for example, residual stresses, it is less useful for providing insights into the process itself.\n\n==Applications==\nThe FSW process has initially been patented by TWI in most industrialised countries and licensed for over 183 users.

It harmonises the treatment of [[database]]s under copyright law and the\n''[[sui generis]]'' right for the creators of databases which do not qualify for copyright.\n\n== Definition of database ==\nArticle&nbsp;1(2) defines a database as \"a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic \nor methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means\". Non-electronic databases are also covered \n(para.&nbsp;14 of the preamble). Any computer program used to create the database is not included (para.&nbsp;23 of the \npreamble). Copyright protection of software is governed by [[Directive 91/250/EEC]].{{ref|91\u2013250}}\n\n== Copyright ==\nUnder Article&nbsp;3, databases which, \"by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents, constitute the author's own intellectual creation\" are protected by copyright as collections: no other criterion may be used by Member States. This follows from the 1994 [[TRIPS Agreement|Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS), a widely adopted treaty to which all [[World Trade Organization]] members are party. TRIPS clarifies and arguably relaxes the criterion for protection of collections in the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]],{{ref|Berne}} which covers \"collections of literary and artistic works\" and requires creativity in the \"selection ''and'' arrangement\" of the contents: in practice the difference is likely to be slight. Any copyright in the database is separate from and without prejudice to the copyright in the entries.\n\nThe acts restricted by copyright are similar to those for other types of work (Art.&nbsp;5):\n\n* temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part;\n* translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration;\n* any form of distribution to the public of the database or of copies thereof, subject to the [[exhaustion of rights]];\n* any communication, display or performance to the public;\n* any reproduction, distribution, communication, display or performance to the public of a translation, adaptation, etc.\n\nThis shall not prevent the lawful use of the database by a lawful user [Art.&nbsp;6(1)]: Member States may provide for any or \nall of the following limitations [Art.&nbsp;6(2)], as well as applying any traditional limitations to copyright:\n\n* reproduction for private purposes of a non-electronic database;\n* use for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source is indicated and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved;\n* use for the purposes of public security or for the purposes of an administrative or judicial procedure.\n\nCopyright protection usually lasts for seventy years after the death of the last publicly identified author. Anonymous or pseudonymous works gain protection for the later of 70 years after the work is lawfully made available to the public or 70 years from creation. If national legislation makes particular provision for collective works or for a legal person (i.e. a body corporate) to be a rights holder the term of protection of calculated in the same way as for anonymous or pseudonymous works, with the exception that if any natural persons who created the work are given credit in versions made available to the public, the term of protection is calculated according to the lives of those authors. Art.&nbsp;1, [[Directive 93/98/EEC]]{{ref|93\u201398}}).\n\n== ''Sui generis'' right ==\nCopyright protection is not available for databases which aim to be \"complete\", that is where the entries are selected by objective criteria: these are covered by ''[[sui generis]]'' [[database rights]]. While copyright protects the creativity of an author, database rights specifically protect the \"qualitatively and/or quantitatively [a] substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\": if there has not been substantial investment (which need not be financial), the database will not be protected [Art.&nbsp;7(1)]. Database rights are held in the first instance by the person or corporation which made the substantial investment, so long as:\n\n* the person is a national or domiciliary of a Member State or \n* the corporation is formed according to the laws of a Member State and has its registered office or principal place of business within the European Union.\n\nArticle&nbsp;11(3) provides for the negotiation of treaties to ensure reciprocal treatment outside the EU: as of 2006, no such treaty exists.\n\nThe holder of database rights may prohibit the extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part of the contents: the \"substantial part\" is evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively and reutilisation is subject to the exhaustion of rights. Public lending is not an act of extraction or re-utilization. The lawful user of a database which is available to the public may freely extract and/or re-use insubstantial parts of the database (Art.&nbsp;8): the holder of database rights may not place restrictions of the purpose to which the insubstantial parts are used. However, users may not \"perform acts which conflict with normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the maker of the database\", nor prejudice any copyright in the entries. The same limitations may be provided to database rights as to \ncopyright in databases (Art.&nbsp;9):\n\n* extraction for private purposes of the contents of a non-electronic database;\n* extraction for the purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source is indicated and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved;\n* extraction and/or re-utilization for the purposes of public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.\n\nDatabase rights last for fifteen years from the end of the year that the database was made available to the public, or from the end of the year of completion for private databases (Art.&nbsp;10). Any substantial change which could be considered to be a substantial new investment will lead to a new term of database rights, which could, in principle, be perpetual. Database rights are independent of any copyright in the database, and the two could, in principle, be held by different people (especially in jurisdictions which prohibit the corporate ownership of copyright): as such, database rights can be compared to the rights of [[Sound recording and reproduction|phonogram]] and film producers.\n\n== \u3142\u3134\u314c\u3134\u3146\u3147\u3145 ==\n<nowiki>{{\nBG= (</nowiki>''Zakon za avtorskoto pravo i srodnite mu prava''), as amended in State Gazette 77/2002, entry into force 1 January 2003|\nCZ= |\nDE=[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=126233 Law of 22.07.1997] |\nDK = Probably implemented by Ophavsretsloven 2008-06-20 (especially \u00a771) |\nFI = <br>\nt\n== See also ==\n*[[Copyright law of the European Union]]\n*[[Related rights]]\n\n== References ==\n#{{note|91\u2013250}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070615133751/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/docs/1991-250_en.pdf Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs], OJ L 122, 17 May 1991, p.&nbsp;9.\n#{{note|Berne}} [http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]\n#{{note|93\u201398}} [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993L0083:EN:HTML Council Directive 93/98/EEC of 29 October 1993 harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights], OJ L 290, 24 November 1993, p.&nbsp;9.\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0009:EN:HTML Text of the directive]\n*[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/databases/evaluation_report_en.pdf  First evaluation of Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases], 2005-12-12.\n*Gasaway, L.: ''[http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006spring/law/357c/001/projects/dougf/index.html Databases and The Law]'', Cyberspace law course, Spring 2006, [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

Any copyright in the database is separate from and without prejudice to the copyright in the entries.\n\nThe acts restricted by copyright are similar to those for other types of work (Art.&nbsp;5):\n\n* temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part;\n* translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration;\n* any form of distribution to the public of the database or of copies thereof, subject to the [[exhaustion of rights]];\n* any communication, display or performance to the public;\n* any reproduction, distribution, communication, display or performance to the public of a translation, adaptation, etc.\n\nThis shall not prevent the lawful use of the database by a lawful user [Art.&nbsp;6(1)]: Member States may provide for any or \nall of the following limitations [Art.&nbsp;6(2)], as well as applying any traditional limitations to copyright:\n\n* reproduction for private purposes of a non-electronic database;\n* use for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source is indicated and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved;\n* use for the purposes of public security or for the purposes of an administrative or judicial procedure.\n\nCopyright protection usually lasts for seventy years after the death of the last publicly identified author. Anonymous or pseudonymous works gain protection for the later of 70 years after the work is lawfully made available to the public or 70 years from creation. If national legislation makes particular provision for collective works or for a legal person (i.e. a body corporate) to be a rights holder the term of protection of calculated in the same way as for anonymous or pseudonymous works, with the exception that if any natural persons who created the work are given credit in versions made available to the public, the term of protection is calculated according to the lives of those authors. Art.&nbsp;1, [[Directive 93/98/EEC]]{{ref|93\u201398}}).\n\n== ''Sui generis'' right ==\nCopyright protection is not available for databases which aim to be \"complete\", that is where the entries are selected by objective criteria: these are covered by ''[[sui generis]]'' [[database rights]]. While copyright protects the creativity of an author, database rights specifically protect the \"qualitatively and/or quantitatively [a] substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\": if there has not been substantial investment (which need not be financial), the database will not be protected [Art.&nbsp;7(1)]. Database rights are held in the first instance by the person or corporation which made the substantial investment, so long as:\n\n* the person is a national or domiciliary of a Member State or \n* the corporation is formed according to the laws of a Member State and has its registered office or principal place of business within the European Union.\n\nArticle&nbsp;11(3) provides for the negotiation of treaties to ensure reciprocal treatment outside the EU: as of 2006, no such treaty exists.\n\nThe holder of database rights may prohibit the extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part of the contents: the \"substantial part\" is evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively and reutilisation is subject to the exhaustion of rights. Public lending is not an act of extraction or re-utilization. The lawful user of a database which is available to the public may freely extract and/or re-use insubstantial parts of the database (Art.&nbsp;8): the holder of database rights may not place restrictions of the purpose to which the insubstantial parts are used. However, users may not \"perform acts which conflict with normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the maker of the database\", nor prejudice any copyright in the entries. The same limitations may be provided to database rights as to \ncopyright in databases (Art.&nbsp;9):\n\n* extraction for private purposes of the contents of a non-electronic database;\n* extraction for the purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source is indicated and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved;\n* extraction and/or re-utilization for the purposes of public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.\n\nDatabase rights last for fifteen years from the end of the year that the database was made available to the public, or from the end of the year of completion for private databases (Art.&nbsp;10). Any substantial change which could be considered to be a substantial new investment will lead to a new term of database rights, which could, in principle, be perpetual. Database rights are independent of any copyright in the database, and the two could, in principle, be held by different people (especially in jurisdictions which prohibit the corporate ownership of copyright): as such, database rights can be compared to the rights of [[Sound recording and reproduction|phonogram]] and film producers.\n\n== Implementation ==\n{{M\u00e9xico =[http://www.internet4jurists.at/gesetze/bg_urhg_anhang01.htm#ur-4-98 BGBI Nr. 25/1998], entry in force on 1 January 1998 |\n BE=[http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs_new/fr/be/be067fr.html Law of 31.08.1998] |\n BG=[http://lex.bg/laws/ldoc/2133094401 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u0441\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430] (''Zakon za avtorskoto pravo i srodnite mu prava''), as amended in State Gazette 77/2002, entry into force 1 January 2003|\n CZ=[https://web.archive.org/web/20041128030156/http://www.wipo.int:80/clea/docs_new/en/cz/cz029en.html Law No.&nbsp;121/2000&nbsp;Coll. of 7&nbsp;April 2000 on Copyright, Rights Related to Copyright and on the Amendment of Certain Laws] |\n DE=[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=126233 Law of 22.07.1997] |\n DK = Probably implemented by Ophavsretsloven 2008-06-20 (especially \u00a771) |\n FI = [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1998/19980250 Laki tekij\u00e4noikeuslain muuttamisesta (250/1998)]<br>[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1998/19980251 Laki rikoslain 49 luvun 1 \u00a7:n muuttamisesta (251/1998)] |\n FR=[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000573438&dateTexte=&categorieLien=id Law No. 98-536 of July 1, 1998], entry in force on 1 January 1998 |\nGR=Law 2121/1993, as amended by law 2819/2000 [http://www.opi.gr/index.php/en/library/law-2121-1993]|\n HU=[http://www.hpo.hu/English/szerzoijog/jogforras_szjog/#magyar Act LXXVII of 2001 on the modification of Copyright Act], entry in force on 1 January 2002 |\n IE=[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0028/index.html Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000], entry in force on 1 January 2001|\n IT=[http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs_new/en/it/it107en.html Decree No.&nbsp;169 of 1999]<br/>[http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs_new/en/it/it004en.html Decree No.&nbsp;244 of 1994]<br/>[http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs_new/en/it/it027en.html Decree No.&nbsp;205 of 1996] |\n LT=[https://web.archive.org/web/20041120001448/http://www.wipo.int:80/clea/docs_new/en/lv/lv017en.html Autorties\u012bbu likums] (2000-04-06) |\n LI=[http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs_new/en/lt/lt002en.html Autori\u0173 teisi\u0173 ir gretutini\u0173 teisi\u0173 \u012fstatimas N.
