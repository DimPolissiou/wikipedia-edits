Kutz first laid out his plans for the town in 1779. The first lots in the new town of Cootstown (later renamed Kutztown) were purchased in 1785 by Adam Dietrich and Henry Schweier.\n\nKutztown was incorporated as a borough on April 7, 1815, and is the second oldest borough in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] after Reading, which became a borough in 1783 and became a city in 1847.\n\nAs with the rest of Berks County, Kutztown was settled mainly by [[Germans]], most of whom came from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] region of southwest Germany, which borders the [[Rhine]] river.\n\nThe Kutztown area, broadly defined, encompasses an area of land also known as the [[East Penn Valley]], a broad [[limestone]] valley situated in northern and eastern Berks County, bounded by the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]] and [[South Mountain (eastern Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] ranges to the north and south, respectively, by the [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]] border to the east, and by [[Ontelaunee Creek]] ([[Maiden Creek]]) to the west.

The first lots in the new town of Cootstown (later renamed Kutztown) were purchased in 1785 by Adam Dietrich and Henry Schweier.\n\nKutztown was incorporated as a borough on April 7, 1815, and is the second oldest borough in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] after Reading, which became a borough in 1783 and became a city in 1847.\n\nAs with the rest of Berks County, Kutztown was settled mainly by [[Germans]], most of whom came from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] region of southwest Germany, which borders the [[Rhine]] river.\n\nThe Kutztown area, broadly defined, encompasses an area of land also known as the [[East Penn Valley]], a broad [[limestone]] valley situated in northern and eastern Berks County, bounded by the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]] and [[South Mountain (eastern Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] ranges to the north and south, respectively, by the [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]] border to the east, and by [[Ontelaunee Creek]] ([[Maiden Creek]]) to the west.

The borough and its bridge have been used as a setting for several recent films.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Kittanning Citizen's Bridge.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Kittanning Citizens Bridge]]]]\nThe borough is located on the east bank of the Allegheny River, founded on the site of the eighteenth-century [[Lenape]] (Delaware) village of [[Kittanning (village)|Kittanning]] at the western end of the [[Kittanning Path]], an ancient Native American path.\n\nIn 1756, the village was destroyed by [[John Armstrong, Sr.]] at the [[Kittanning Expedition|Battle of Kittanning]] during the [[French and Indian War]]. During the attack, a blast from the explosion of gunpowder stored in [[Captain Jacobs]]'s house was heard in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], 44 miles away.\n\nKittanning was designated as the seat of Armstrong County when the county was organized. It was settled by European Americans largely after the [[American Revolutionary War]], although [[Anthony Sadowski]] (also recorded by the anglicized name of Sandusky), a prominent Polish-American trader, and other Native American traders operated here before the war.\n\nBy the early in the 20th century, the city had developed considerable industry: large iron and steel works, foundries, and coal mines, all associated with the steel and iron industries of Pittsburgh; glassworks, flour and lumber mills; china, pottery, brick, lime, and clay works; and mirror and typewriter factories, breweries, etc. It reached its peak of population in 1930 and was adversely affected by the [[Great Depression]]. After World War II, changes in industry and restructuring of heavy industry caused a loss of jobs in many of these works, with an associated population decline.\n\nThe playground on North Jefferson Street was developed on the former site of the historic Kittanning Cemetery. In order to enable this, the city moved 274 graves in 1960 to a new cemetery formed along Troy Hill Road.\n\n[[File:Kittanning, PA Keystone Marker.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Keystone Marker]] for Kittanning]]\nIn 1900, 3,902 people lived in Kittanning, and in 1910, there were 4,311 inhabitants.

The borough and its bridge have been used as a setting for several recent films.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Kittanning Citizen's Bridge.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Kittanning Citizens Bridge]]]]\nThe borough is located on the east bank of the Allegheny River, founded on the site of the eighteenth-century [[Lenape]] (Delaware) village of [[Kittanning (village)|Kittanning]] at the western end of the [[Kittanning Path]], an ancient Native American path. \n\nIn 1756, the village was destroyed by [[John Armstrong, Sr.]] at the [[Kittanning Expedition|Battle of Kittanning]] during the [[French and Indian War]]. During the attack, a blast from the explosion of gunpowder stored in [[Captain Jacobs]]'s house was heard in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], 44 miles away. \n\nKittanning was designated as the seat of Armstrong County when the county was organized. It was settled by European Americans largely after the [[American Revolutionary War]], although [[Anthony Sadowski]] (also recorded by the anglicized name of Sandusky), a prominent Polish-American trader, and other Native American traders operated here before the war.\n\nBy the early in the 20th century, the city had developed considerable industry: large iron and steel works, foundries, and coal mines, all associated with the steel and iron industries of Pittsburgh; glassworks, flour and lumber mills; china, pottery, brick, lime, and clay works; and mirror and typewriter factories, breweries, etc. It reached its peak of population in 1930 and was adversely affected by the [[Great Depression]]. After World War II, changes in industry and restructuring of heavy industry caused a loss of jobs in many of these works, with an associated population decline.\n\nThe playground on North Jefferson Street was developed on the former site of the historic Kittanning Cemetery. In order to enable this, the city moved 274 graves in 1960 to a new cemetery formed along Troy Hill Road.\n\n[[File:Kittanning, PA Keystone Marker.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Keystone Marker]] for Kittanning]]\nIn 1900, 3,902 people lived in Kittanning, and in 1910, there were 4,311 inhabitants. After Kittanning merged with Wickboro (1910 population 2,775), in 1914, the population was estimated at 10,000, which was likely high. The 1920 census counted 7,153 residents. In 1930, there were 7,808 residents; in 1940, 7,550. Since late 20th century industrial decline, the population was 4,044 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. <ref name=\"GR6\" />\n\nThe [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 7]] and [[Armstrong County Courthouse and Jail]] are each listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nKittanning is located at {{Coord|40|49|12|N|79|31|17|W|type:city}} (40.820085, -79.521398).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.0|sqmi|km2}}, all land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 318\n|1830= 526\n|1850= 1561\n|1860= 1696\n|1870= 1889\n|1880= 2624\n|1890= 3095\n|1900= 3902\n|1910= 4311\n|1920= 7153\n|1930= 7808\n|1940= 7550\n|1950= 7731\n|1960= 6793\n|1970= 6231\n|1980= 5432\n|1990= 5120\n|2000= 4787\n|2010= 4044\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3773\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 4,787 people, 2,032 households, and 1,117 families residing in the borough.
