{"title_page": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1919 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 11th. It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros.

Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

the opponent. As a result, Newton players did not arrive at the ground. Eventually Newton found enough substitutes but they still began the game 2-3 players short. In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = A Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Isles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = A Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities. The Newton v North Shore match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Ponsonby v Maritime match on Auckland Domain 1. When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = Iles 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.

As a result, some of the scoring lists are inaccurate. For example, George Isles was known to have scored 5 tries however 6 other tries were attributed to \"Isles\" which may have been him or his brother A Isles. Likewise City Rovers featured [[George Paki]] and his brother B Paki. B Paki was attributed a try while \"Paki\" scored 2 tries, while for Ponsonby L Cadman scored 1, A Cadman scored 2, and \"Cadman\" scored 3.

It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities.

When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = Iles 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.

Both nines set out from the clubhouse on level ground before veering into the 40-foot dune ridge that runs alongside the western edge of the property.<ref name=Top100>{{cite web |url=https://www.top100golfcourses.com/golf-course/seminole|title=Seminole Golf Club|author=Top 100 Golf Courses|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe greens at Seminole are the main line of defense for the course and many of them are cleverly angled, narrowing towards the back which makes rear pin positions extremely tough.  Fairway bunkers are generally shallow but sand traps adjacent to the putting surfaces are often deep and troublesome.<ref name=Top100/> The course is also noted for its clever routing on a fairly rectangular site, with results in a new wind direction on each hole.<ref name=GolfDigest>{{cite web |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/seminole-golf-club|title=Seminole Golf Club|author=Golf Digest|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe layout occupies a flat-bottomed bowl set between a high ridge of dunes to the west and the dunes along the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east.  In the middle lie the necessary ponds to handle the drainage.  Ross' layout managed to have 14 of the 18 holes touch these two lines of dunes (the 1st, 8th, 9th and 10th holes do not).<ref name=GCA>{{cite web |url=https://golfclubatlas.com/courses-by-country/usa/seminole-golf-club/|title=Seminole Golf Club|author=Golf Club Atlas|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>  To reflect and complement the sweep of the sandy property, Ross also used bunkering that was not typical of his other work. Instead of the more standard low-profile bunkering, Ross used flashed-face sand traps that are reminiscent of a [[George C. Thomas Jr.|George Thomas]] course rather than a Donald Ross work.<ref name=GCA/>\n\nThroughout its history, the club has long been known as a golf club for the corporate elite. In 1947, the club's members included [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.|Joseph P. Kennedy]], [[Henry Ford II]], Jack Chrysler, [[Paul Mellon]], Phillip Armour, [[John Sargent Pillsbury Sr.|John Pillsbury]] and Robert Vanderbilt.

Both nines set out from the clubhouse on level ground before veering into the 40-foot dune ridge that runs alongside the western edge of the property.<ref name=Top100>{{cite web |url=https://www.top100golfcourses.com/golf-course/seminole|title=Seminole Golf Club|author=Top 100 Golf Courses|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe greens at Seminole are the main line of defense for the course and many of them are cleverly angled, narrowing towards the back which makes rear pin positions extremely tough.  Fairway bunkers are generally shallow but sand traps adjacent to the putting surfaces are often deep and troublesome.<ref name=Top100/> The course is also noted for its clever routing on a fairly rectangular site, with results in a new wind direction on each hole.<ref name=GolfDigest>{{cite web |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/seminole-golf-club|title=Seminole Golf Club|author=Golf Digest|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe layout occupies a flat-bottomed bowl set between a high ridge of dunes to the west and the dunes along the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east.  In the middle lie the necessary ponds to handle the drainage.

Instead of the more standard low-profile bunkering, Ross used flashed-face sand traps that are reminiscent of a [[George C.

The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies.

The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.

They initially consisted of four musicians \u2013 [[Graham Gouldman]], [[Eric Stewart]], [[Kevin Godley]] and [[Lol Creme]] \u2013 who had written and recorded together since 1968. The group featured two songwriting teams. Stewart and Gouldman were predominantly pop songwriters, who created most of the band's accessible songs. By contrast, Godley and Creme were the predominantly experimental half of 10cc, featuring art school and cinematically-inspired writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://50connect.co.uk/index.asp?main=http://www.50connect.co.uk/50c/articlepages/entertainment_index.asp?sc%3Dmusic%26aID%3D15566|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071017093923/http://50connect.co.uk/index.asp?main=http://www.50connect.co.uk/50c/articlepages/entertainment_index.asp%3Fsc=music&aID=15566|title=50 connect.co.uk - The leading website for the over 50's|archivedate=17 October 2007|work=50connect.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nEvery member of 10cc was a multi-instrumentalist, singer, writer and producer, and the writing teams frequently switched partners, so that Godley/Gouldman or Creme/Stewart compositions were not uncommon (although compositions credited to Creme/Gouldman and Godley/Stewart are rare, only found on 1974's ''[[Sheet Music (album)|Sheet Music]]''). Most of the band's records were recorded at their own [[Strawberry Studios]] (North) in [[Stockport]] and Strawberry Studios (South) in [[Dorking]], with most of those engineered by Stewart.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1978, 10cc had five consecutive UK top-ten albums: ''Sheet Music'', ''[[The Original Soundtrack]]'' (1975), ''[[How Dare You! (album)|How Dare You!]]'' (1976), ''[[Deceptive Bends]]'' (1977) and ''[[Bloody Tourists]]'' (1978). They also had twelve singles reach the UK Top 40, three of which were the chart-toppers \"[[Rubber Bullets]]\" (1973), \"[[I'm Not in Love]]\" (1975) and \"[[Dreadlock Holiday]]\" (1978). \"I'm Not in Love\" was their breakthrough worldwide hit and is known for its innovative backing track. Godley and Creme quit the band in 1976 due to artistic disagreements and [[Godley & Creme|became a duo act]]. Stewart left the band in 1995. Since 1999, Gouldman has led a touring version of 10cc.\n\n==First collaborations==\nThree of the founding members of 10cc were childhood friends in the [[Manchester]] area. As boys, Godley and Creme knew each other; Gouldman and Godley attended the same secondary school; their musical enthusiasm led to playing at the local [[Jewish Lads' Brigade]].<ref>Lester, Paul \"Heirs to The Beatles: The story of 10cc\". The Jewish Chronicle</ref>\n\n===1964\u20131969: Early bands===\nTheir first recorded collaboration was in 1964, when Gouldman's band The Whirlwinds recorded the Lol Creme composition, \"Baby Not Like You\", as the B-side of their only single, \"Look At Me\". The Whirlwinds then changed members and name, becoming The Mockingbirds (including singer-guitarist Gouldman, bassist Bernard Basso and drummer Kevin Godley, formerly of The Sabres with Creme). The Mockingbirds recorded five singles in 1965\u201366 without any success, before dissolving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tencc.fan-site.net/ggearly.html |title=Complete Mockingbirds discography at 10cc fan club website |publisher=Tencc.fan-site.net |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> The guitarist in both The Whirlwinds and The Mockingbirds was Stephen Jacobson, brother of well-known writer [[Howard Jacobson]].<ref>Egan, Shaun (2004), ''The Guys Who Wrote 'em: Songwriting Geniuses of Rock and Pop'', Askill Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-9545750-1-4}}, Graham Gouldman.</ref>\n\nIn June 1967, Godley and Creme reunited and recorded a solitary single (\"Seeing Things Green\" b/w \"Easy Life\" on UK CBS) under the name \"The Yellow Bellow Room Boom\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tencc.fan-site.net/premarma.html#yellowbellow |title=See |publisher=Tencc.fan-site.net |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> In 1969, Gouldman took them to a [[Marmalade Records]] recording session.

Gouldman's track was \"The Late Mr. Late\"; a year later, Godley's song \"To Fly Away\" reappeared as \"Fly Away\", in the debut [[Hotlegs]] album, ''[[Thinks: School Stinks]]''.\n\nGouldman, meanwhile, had made a name for himself as a hit songwriter, penning \"[[Heart Full of Soul]]\", \"[[Evil Hearted You]]\" and \"[[For Your Love]]\" for [[The Yardbirds]], \"[[Look Through Any Window]]\" and \"[[Bus Stop (song)|Bus Stop]]\" for [[The Hollies]] and \"[[No Milk Today]]\", \"East West\" and \"[[Listen People]]\" for [[Herman's Hermits]].\n\n===1965\u20131968: The Mindbenders===\nMeanwhile, the fourth future member of 10cc was also tasting significant pop music success: guitarist Eric Stewart was a member of [[Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders]], a group that hit No.1 with \"[[The Game of Love (Wayne Fontana song)|The Game of Love]]\", and scored a number of other mid-1960s hits. When Fontana left the band in October 1965, the group became known simply as [[The Mindbenders]], with Stewart as their lead vocalist. The band scored a hit with \"[[A Groovy Kind of Love]]\" (released December 1965) and made an appearance in the 1967 film ''[[To Sir, with Love]]'' with \"It's Getting Harder All the Time\" and \"Off and Running.\"\n\nIn March 1968, Gouldman joined Stewart in The Mindbenders, replacing bassist Bob Lang and playing on some tour dates. Gouldman wrote two of the band's last three singles, \"Schoolgirl\" (released November 1967) and \"Uncle Joe the Ice Cream Man\" (August 1968). Those singles did not chart and The Mindbenders broke up after a short tour of England in November.<ref name=\"Tremlett\">{{cite book | author=George Tremlett | title=The 10cc Story | year= 1976 | isbn=978-0-86007-378-9 | publisher=Futura }}</ref>\n\n===1968\u20131970: Birth of Strawberry Studios; the bubblegum era===\nIn the dying days of The Mindbenders, Stewart began recording demos of new material at Inner City Studios, a Stockport studio then owned by Peter Tattersall, a former road manager for [[Billy J.

He had become much more in demand as a songwriter than as a performer. By the end of the year, he too was a financial partner in the studios.<ref name=\"Strawberry\" />\n\nBy 1969, all four members of the original 10cc line-up were working together regularly at Strawberry Studios. Around the same time, noted American [[bubblegum pop]] writer-producers [[Jerry Kasenetz]] and [[Jeffry Katz]] of [[Super K Productions]] came to England and commissioned Gouldman to write and produce formula bubblegum songs, many of which were recorded at Strawberry Studios, and were either augmented or performed entirely by varying combinations of the future 10cc line-up.\n\nAmong the recordings from this period was \"Sausalito\", a No.&nbsp;86 US hit credited to [[Ohio Express]] and released in July 1969. In fact the song featured Gouldman on lead vocal, and vocal and instrumental backing by the other three future 10cc members.\n\nIn December 1969, Kasenetz and Katz agreed to a proposal by Gouldman that he work solely at Strawberry, rather than move constantly between Stockport, London and New York. Gouldman convinced the pair that these throwaway two-minute songs could all be written, performed and produced by him and his three colleagues, Stewart, Godley and Creme, at a fraction of the cost of hiring outside session musicians. Kasenetz and Katz booked the studio for three months.\n\nKevin Godley recalled:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minestrone.org/zigzag44.htm |title=\"Zigzag\" magazine, January&nbsp;1975 |publisher=Minestrone.org |accessdate=10 August 2010|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080828065835/http://www.minestrone.org/zigzag44.htm |archivedate = 28 August 2008|url-status=dead }}</ref><blockquote>We did a lot of tracks in a very short time \u2013 it was really like a machine.

We even did the female backing vocals.</blockquote>\nThe three-month project resulted in a number of tracks that appeared under various band names owned by Kasenetz-Katz, including \"There Ain't No Umbopo\" by [[Crazy Elephant]], \"When He Comes\" by Fighter Squadron and \"Come on Plane\" by Silver Fleet (all three with lead vocals by Godley), and \"Susan's Tuba\" by [[Freddie and the Dreamers]] (which was a monster hit in France and featured lead vocals by [[Freddie Garrity]], despite claims by some that it was Gouldman).<ref name=\"Strawberry\" />\n\nLol Creme remembered: \"Singles kept coming out under strange names that had really been recorded by us. I've no idea how many there were, or what happened to them all.\"\n\nBut Stewart described the Kasenetz-Katz deal as a breakthrough: \"That allowed us to get the extra equipment to turn it into a real studio. To begin with they were interested in Graham's songwriting and when they heard that he was involved in a studio I think they thought the most economical thing for them to do would be to book his studio and then put him to work there \u2013 but they ended up recording Graham's songs and then some of Kevin and Lol's songs, and we were all working together.\"<ref name=\"Tremlett\" />\n\n===1970\u20131971: Hotlegs; Doctor Father; The New Wave Band; Festival===\nWhen the three-month production deal with Kasenetz-Katz ended, Gouldman returned to New York to work as a staff songwriter for [[Super K Productions]] and the remaining three continued to dabble in the studio.\n\nWith Gouldman absent, Godley, Creme and Stewart continued recording singles. The first, \"[[Neanderthal Man (song)|Neanderthal Man]]\", released under the name [[Hotlegs]], began life as a test of drum layering at the new Strawberry Studios mixing desk,<ref name=\"Tremlett\" /> but when released as a single by [[Fontana Records]] in July 1970, climbed to No.&nbsp;2 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]] and became a worldwide hit, selling more than two million copies. Around the same time, the trio released \"Umbopo\" under the name of [[Doctor Father]]. The song, a slower, longer and more melancholic version of the track earlier released under the name of Crazy Elephant, failed to chart.\n\nReverting to the successful band name Hotlegs, in early 1971 Godley, Creme and Stewart recorded the album ''[[Thinks: School Stinks]]'', which included \"Neanderthal Man\". They then recalled Gouldman for a short tour supporting [[The Moody Blues]], before releasing a follow-up single \"Lady Sadie\" b/w \"The Loser\". Philips reworked their sole album, removed \"Neanderthal Man\" and added \"Today\" and issued it as ''Song''. Stewart, Creme and Godley released another single in February 1971 under yet another name, The New Wave Band, this time with former [[Herman's Hermits]] member [[Derek Leckenby|Derek \"Lek\" Leckenby]] on guitar. The song, a cover version of [[Paul Simon]]'s \"[[Cecilia (Simon & Garfunkel song)|Cecilia]]\", was one of the few tracks the band released that they had not written. It also failed to chart.<ref>[http://www.manchesterbeat.com/bands/newwaveband/newwaveband.php \"Manchester Beat\" website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115060858/http://www.manchesterbeat.com/bands/newwaveband/newwaveband.php |date=15 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe band also continued outside production work at Strawberry, working with [[Dave Berry (musician)|Dave Berry]], [[Wayne Fontana]], Peter Cowap and [[Herman's Hermits]], and doing original compositions for various UK football (soccer) teams. In 1971 they produced and played on ''Space Hymns'', an album by New Age musician [[Ramases]]; in 1972\u201373 they co-produced and played on two [[Neil Sedaka]] albums, ''[[Solitaire (Neil Sedaka album)|Solitaire]]'' and ''[[The Tra-La Days Are Over]]''.\n\nThe experience of working on ''Solitaire'', which became a success for Sedaka, was enough to prompt the band to seek recognition on their own merits. Gouldman\u2014who by 1972 was back at Strawberry Studios\u2014said:\n\n{{quote|text=It was Neil Sedaka's success that did it, I think.

He waited months before receiving a note from the label saying the song was not commercial enough to release as a single.\n\n==1972\u20131976: Original line-up==\nUndeterred by Apple's rejection, the group decided to plug another song which had been written as a possible B-side to \"Waterfall\", a Godley/Creme composition titled \"[[Donna (10cc song)|Donna]]\". The song was a [[Frank Zappa]]-influenced 1950s [[doo-wop]] parody, a sharp mix of commercial pop and irony with a chorus sung in falsetto. Stewart said: \"We knew it had something. We only knew of one person who was mad enough to release it, and that was [[Jonathan King]].\" Stewart called King, a flamboyant entrepreneur, producer and recording artist, who drove to Strawberry, listened to the track and \"fell about laughing\", declaring: \"It's fabulous, it's a hit.\"<ref name=\"Tremlett\" />\n\n[[File:Tencca.jpg|250px|thumb|10cc in 1973 (l-r): Gouldman, Godley, Stewart, Creme (from ''[[10cc (album)|10cc]]'' press-kit)]]\nKing signed the band to his [[UK Records]] label in July 1972 and dubbed them 10cc. By his own account, King chose the name after having a dream in which he was standing in front of the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in London where the boarding read \"10cc The Best Band in the World\". A widely repeated claim, disputed by King<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/10cc.asp |title=Snopes.com, \"10cc\" |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> and Godley,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rocknrolluniverse.com/rocknrolluniverse_456.htm |title=Interview with Kevin Godley, Rock N Roll Universe online interview, April&nbsp;2007 |publisher=Rocknrolluniverse.com |accessdate=10 August 2010}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref> but confirmed in a 1988 interview by Creme,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minestrone.org/pulse.htm |title=Godley & Creme interviewed in ''Pulse'' magazine, April&nbsp;1988 |publisher=Minestrone.org |accessdate=10 August 2010|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081120165059/http://www.minestrone.org/pulse.htm |archivedate = 20 November 2008|url-status=dead }}</ref> and also on the webpage of Gouldman's current line-up,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.10cc.world/biography.html |title=Biography section of 10ccworld |publisher=10cc.world |accessdate=10 August 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> is that the band name represented a volume of [[semen]] that was more than the average amount ejaculated by men, thus emphasising their potency or prowess.\n\n\"Donna\", released as the first 10cc single, was chosen by [[BBC Radio 1]] disc jockey [[Tony Blackburn]] as his Record of the Week, helping to launch it into the Top 30. The song peaked at No.&nbsp;2 in the UK in October 1972.\n\nAlthough their second single, a similarly 1950s-influenced song called \"Johnny Don't Do It\", was not a major chart success, \"[[Rubber Bullets]]\", a catchy satirical take on the \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\" concept, became a hit internationally and gave 10cc their first British No.1 single in June 1973. They consolidated their success a few months later with \"[[The Dean and I]]\", which peaked at No.10 in September. They released two singles, \"Headline Hustler\" (in the US) and the self-mocking \"The Worst Band in the World\" (in the UK) and launched a UK tour on 26 August 1973, joined by second drummer [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]], before returning to Strawberry Studios in November to record the remainder of their second LP, ''[[Sheet Music (album)|Sheet Music]]'' (1974), which included \"The Worst Band in the World\" along with other hits \"[[The Wall Street Shuffle]]\" (No.10, 1974) and \"Silly Love\" (No.24, 1974). ''Sheet Music'' became the band's breakthrough album, remaining on the UK charts for six months and paving the way for a US tour in February 1974.\n\nIn February 1975, the band announced they were splitting with [[Jonathan King]] and that they had signed with [[Mercury Records]] for US$1&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dave Thompson|title=The Music Lover's Guide to Record Collecting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVVMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT465+|year=2002|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-1-61713-202-5|page=465}}</ref> The catalyst for the deal was one song \u2013 \"[[I'm&nbsp;Not&nbsp;in&nbsp;Love]]\". Stewart recalled:<blockquote>At that point in time we were still on Jonathan King's label, but struggling. We were absolutely skint, the lot of us, we were really struggling seriously, and [[Phonogram Inc.|Philips Phonogram]] wanted to do a deal with us. They wanted to buy Jonathan's contract. Our manager Ric Dixon invited them to listen to what we've done. Head of A & R [[Ensign Records|Nigel Grainge]] came up to our Strawberry Studio, heard the album and freaked. He said \"This is a masterpiece, it's a done deal!\". We did a five-year deal with them for five albums and they paid us a serious amount of money. It was Grainge's idea to release 'Life Is A Minestrone' as the first single holding back the big one to give us more longevity for the album.<ref name=\"Wales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/esiwts.htm |title=Eric Stewart interview, Radio Wales, \"I Write the Songs\" |publisher=The10ccfanclub.com |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpeaking in the [[BBC Four]] documentary ''I'm Not in Love: The Story of 10cc'' in 2015, Stewart explained that the band, three years into a five-year contract with King were earning a mere 4% of royalties. Creme made it clear that the band had fully intended to sign with [[Richard Branson]]'s fledgling [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] label, with the band's records to be released in the US through [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]. Stewart and Creme were about to go on holiday with their wives (Stewart and Creme are brothers-in-law through marriage), however, and had left their manager Harvey Lisberg with [[power of attorney]] to accept the Branson offer. No sooner had they left the country, but another higher bid arrived from Phonogram and was accepted by the management team, including Lisberg. Creme said that he felt \"horrified, embarrassed and disgusted - to this day I still am\".<ref name=story/>\n\n''[[The Original Soundtrack]]'', which was already complete, was released just weeks later. It was both a critical and commercial success and featured distinctive cover art created by the [[Hipgnosis]] team and drawn by musician and artist [[Humphrey Ocean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/academicians/painters/humphrey-ocean-ra,195,AR.html |title=Humphrey Ocean biography at Royal Academy website |publisher=Royalacademy.org.uk |date=22 June 1951 |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> It is also notable for its opening track, Godley & Creme's \"[[Une Nuit A Paris]] (One Night in Paris)\", an eight-minute, multi-part \"mini-operetta\" that is thought to have been an influence on \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name=\"10cc_reviews\" />\n[[File:Crowd at Knebworth House - Rolling Stones 1976.jpg|thumb|left| 10cc Crowd at [[Knebworth]] concert - 120.000 - 1976]]\n\nAlthough it bore an unlikely title (picked up from a radio talk show), \"[[Life Is a Minestrone]]\" (1975) was another UK Top 10 placing, peaking at No.7. Their biggest success came with the dreamy \"[[I'm Not in Love]]\", which gave the band their second UK No. 1 in June 1975. The song provided them with their first US chart success when the song reached No. 2. A collaborative effort built around a title by Stewart, \"I'm Not in Love\" is notable for its innovative production, especially its richly overdubbed choral backing. Godley stated:<blockquote>If I was to pick one track from everything we've done, \"I'm Not in Love\" would be my favourite. It's got something that none of our other tracks have at all. It's not clever in a conscious way but it says it all so simply in, what, six minutes. \u2013 ''[[NME]]'', February 1976<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2\">{{Citation |first=John |last=Tobler |year=1992 |title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |edition=1 |publisher=Reed International Books Ltd |location=London |page=285 |id=CN 5585 }}</ref></blockquote>\nDuring this time 10cc also collaborated with [[Justin Hayward]] on the single \"Blue Guitar\", being a backing band and doing production work. The song was also released on later reissues of ''[[Blue Jays (album)|Blue Jays]]'' album by Hayward and [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]].\n\n[[File:Eric-Stewart 1976.jpg|250px|thumb|Eric Stewart performing live in [[Oslo]], April 1976]]\n10cc's fourth LP, ''[[How Dare You! (album)|How Dare You!]]'' (1976), featuring another Hipgnosis cover, furnished two more UK Top Ten hits\u2014the witty \"[[Art for Art's Sake (10cc song)|Art for Art's Sake]]\" (No.5 in January 1976) and \"[[I'm Mandy Fly Me|I'm Mandy, Fly Me]]\" (No.6, April 1976). But by this time the once close personal and working relationships between the four members had begun to fray, and it was the last album with the original line-up.\n\n10cc's success prompted the 1976 re-release of the Hotlegs album under the new title ''[[You Didn't Like It Because You Didn't Think of It]]'' with two additional tracks. The title track was the epic B-side of \"Neanderthal Man\", a section of which had been reworked as \"Fresh Air for My Mama\" on the ''[[10cc (album)|10cc]]'' album.\n\n==1976: Split==\nFrictions mounted between the group's two creative teams during the recording of ''How Dare You'', with each pair realising how far apart their ideas had become.<ref name=\"pop\">''Pop Scene \u2013 Australia's International Pop Magazine'', issue No 2, Gordon and Gotch, 1977.</ref> When the sessions finished, Godley and Creme left 10cc to work on a project that eventually evolved into the triple LP set ''[[Consequences (Godley & Creme album)|Consequences]]'' (1977), a sprawling concept album that featured contributions from satirist [[Peter Cook]] and jazz vocalist [[Sarah Vaughan]].\n\nThe first of a series of albums by [[Godley & Creme]], ''Consequences'' began as a demonstration record for the \"[[The Gizmo|Gizmotron]]\", an electric guitar effect they had invented. The device, which fitted over the bridge of an electric guitar, contained six small motor-driven wheels attached to small keys (four wheels for electric basses); when the key was depressed, the Gizmotron wheels bowed the guitar strings, producing notes and [[Chord (music)|chords]] with endless [[sustain]]. First used during the recording of the ''Sheet Music'' track \"Old Wild Men\", the device was designed to further cut their recording costs: by using it on an electric guitar with studio effects, they could effectively simulate strings and other sounds, enabling them to dispense with expensive orchestral overdubs.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with the ProGGnosis\u2014Progressive Rock & Fusion website,<ref>[http://www.proggnosis.com/interview.asp?theInterview=23 ProgGnosis website interview with Kevin Godley, 23 June 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017021830/http://www.proggnosis.com/interview.asp?theInterview=23 |date=17 October 2007 }}</ref> Godley explained: \"We left because we no longer liked what Gouldman and Stewart were writing. We left because 10cc was becoming safe and predictable and we felt trapped.\"\n\nBut speaking to ''Uncut'' magazine 10 years earlier,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.othermachines.org/blint/kev.shtml |title=Kevin Godley interview, \"Uncut\", 1997 |publisher=Othermachines.org |date=15 December 1997 |accessdate=10 August 2010 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820154425/http://www.othermachines.org/blint/kev.shtml |archivedate=20 August 2008 |df= }}</ref> he expressed regret about the band breaking up as they embarked on the ''Consequences'' project:\n\n{{quote|text=We'd reached a certain crossroads with 10cc and already spent three weeks on the genesis of what turned out to be ''Consequences''&nbsp;... The stuff that we were coming up with didn't have any home, we couldn't import it into 10cc. And we were kind of constrained by 10cc live&nbsp;... We felt like creative people who should give ourselves the opportunity to be as creative as possible and leaving seemed to be the right thing to do at that moment.\n\nUnfortunately, the band wasn't democratic or smart enough at that time to allow us the freedom to go ahead and do this project and we were placed in the unfortunate position of having to leave to do it. Looking back, it was a very northern work ethic being applied to the group, all for one and one for all. If we'd been a little more free in our thinking with regard to our work practices, the band as a corporate and creative entity could have realised that it could have been useful rather than detrimental for two members to spend some time developing and then bring whatever they'd learned back to the corporate party. Unfortunately, that wasn't to be.\n\nOur contemporaries were people like [[Roxy Music]] who allowed that to happen and they gained from that&nbsp;... Had we been allowed to get it out of our system and come back home, who knows what would have happened.}}\n\nIn a BBC Radio Wales interview<ref name=\"Wales\" /> Stewart gave his side of the split:\n\n{{quote|text=I was sorry to see them go. But we certainly did fall out at the time. I thought they were crazy. They were just walking away from something so big and successful. We'd had great success around the world and I thought we were just breaking in a very, very big way. The collective dynamite of those four people, four people who could all write, who could all sing a hit song. In one band.\n\n(Yet) I think it becomes claustrophobic, in the fact that you're trying to perfect things and you're looking at each other and eventually you maybe say this relationship is a little too tight for me now, and I need to break away. And that's what in retrospect, I found out long after because I still speak to Godley and Creme who \u2013 Lol is my brother-in-law, so I've got to see him \u2013 but for quite a while we didn't talk. I just said you're out of your minds for leaving this band. We were on such a winning curve, Graham Gouldman and I had to decide, are we going to be 5cc? Are we gonna scrap the name completely? Well, we thought we, no, we'd better carry on because we, this is 10cc, we are 10cc, this band. Two of our members are leaving us and that's not our problem, but we've got to carry it on.}}\n\nStewart said there were immediate benefits in the absence of Godley and Creme. \"It became clear things went much smoother and the atmosphere was much more pleasant than with Lol and Kevin,\" he said.<ref name=\"pop\" />\n\nGodley & Creme went on to achieve cult success as a songwriting and recording duo, scoring several hits and releasing a string of innovative LPs and singles. Having honed their skills on the equally innovative clips that they made to promote their own singles (e.g. their 1985 single \"[[Cry (Godley & Creme song)|Cry]]\") they returned to their visual arts roots and became better-known as directors of music videos in the 1980s, creating acclaimed videos for chart-topping acts including [[George Harrison]] (\"[[When We Was Fab]]\"), [[Asia (band)|Asia]] (\"[[Heat of the Moment (Asia song)|Heat of the Moment]]\", \"[[Only Time Will Tell (song)|Only Time Will Tell]]\") [[The Police]] (\"[[Every Breath You Take]]\"), [[Duran Duran]] (\"[[Girls on Film]]\"), [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] (\"[[Two Tribes]]\"), [[Peter Gabriel]]'s duet with [[Kate Bush]] (\"[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]\"), and [[Herbie Hancock]] (\"[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]\"). They also directed a video for Stewart and Gouldman's \"Feel the Love\".\n\n==1977\u20131983: Second era==\nAfter the departure of Godley and Creme, Stewart and Gouldman opted to continue as 10cc, working with drummer [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]], who had up to that point been their tour backup drummer. Their first album as a three piece band was ''[[Deceptive Bends]]'' (1977), named after a sign on the [[Mickleham, Surrey|Mickleham]] bends on the [[A24 road (England)|A24]] between [[Leatherhead]] and [[Dorking]] in Surrey.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The album, recorded at the newly completed Strawberry South Studio in Dorking, Surrey, reached No.&nbsp;3 in Britain and No.&nbsp;31 in the US and also yielded three hit singles, \"[[The Things We Do for Love (song)|The Things We Do for Love]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;6, US No.&nbsp;5), \"Good Morning Judge\" (UK No.&nbsp;5, US No.&nbsp;69) and \"[[People in Love]]\" (US No.&nbsp;40). Stewart later said he and Gouldman felt vindicated by its success: \"I was out to prove also that we could write a hit album without Kevin and Lol&nbsp;... we did!\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions12.htm |title=Questions and Answers |first=Eric |last=Stewart |author-link=Eric Stewart |work=ericstewart.uk.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525074543/http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions12.htm |archive-date=2006-05-25 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, 10cc embarked on an international tour with guitarist [[Rick Fenn]], keyboardist [[Tony O'Malley (musician)|Tony O'Malley]] and an additional drummer [[Stuart Tosh]] (ex-[[Pilot (band)|Pilot]]) and recorded a live album, \"[[Live and Let Live (10cc album)|Live and Let Live]]\" (1977), which mixed the hits with material from the previous three LPs.\n\nFenn, Tosh, Burgess and keyboardist Duncan Mackay (who in 1977 made a solo album entitled \"Score\") were now full members of the band and performed on 1978's ''[[Bloody Tourists]]'', which provided the band with their third UK No.&nbsp;1 single, the reggae-styled \"[[Dreadlock Holiday]]\". It was their last hit, with the second single \"Reds in My Bed\", featuring lead vocals by Stuart Tosh, failing to chart.\n\nThe band suffered a major setback in January 1979 when Stewart was seriously injured in a car crash. He told the BBC:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/esiwts.htm |title=Stewart's BBC Radio Wales interview |publisher=The10ccfanclub.com |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It flattened me completely. I damaged my left ear, I damaged my eye very badly. I couldn't go near music. I couldn't go near anything loud and I love music and motor-racing. I had to stay away from both things for a long time, for about six months. And the momentum of this big machine that we'd had rolling slowed and slowed and slowed. And on the music scene, the punk thing had come in a big way. [[The Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], lots of things like that. So by the time I was fit again to play, I think we'd just missed the bus. It'd gone. And whatever we did after that, we got a few tickles here and there and we could continue touring forever on the strength of the past hits, but it didn't feel right again, we just didn't have that public with us.}}\n\nGouldman, too, considered the aftermath of Stewart's accident to be a turning point. In a 1995 BBC interview<ref name=\"Hayward\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minestrone.org/wellabove.htm |title=Graham Gouldman interviewed by Justin Hayward, BBC2, 1995 |publisher=Minestrone.org |accessdate=10 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004538/http://www.minestrone.org/wellabove.htm |archivedate=12 March 2007 |url-status=dead  |df=dmy-all }}</ref> he said:\n\n{{quote|text=Really, after '78 things went downhill for us. I don't know what it was. We'd been doing it for so long, maybe we should have had a break then, rather than in '83 when we did have a break, or brought new blood in or done something. And even as the things were getting bad, we thought, 'Ah, it's gonna be all right, don't worry about it, it'll be great'.}}\n\nWhile Stewart recovered, Gouldman recorded the title track to the film ''Sunburn'', which became a minor UK hit in 1979. The band also issued a greatest hits compilation in late 1979 ''[[Greatest Hits 1972\u20131978]]'', and released a single, coupling \"I'm Not in Love\" with \"For You and I\", which failed to chart.\n\nBoth produced soundtrack albums in 1980 with the help of some of the 10cc band members: Gouldman recorded [[Animalympics (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to the animated film ''[[Animalympics]]'', while Stewart produced the soundtrack to the film ''[[Girls (Eric Stewart album)|Girls]]''. The band signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], producing a new 10cc offering entitled ''[[Look Hear?]]'', featuring the single \"One Two Five\". All three albums featured musicians from 10cc's ''Bloody Tourists'' line-up, and all were released between February and April 1980. Only ''Look Hear?'' appeared on charts in the UK or US.\n\nGouldman and Stewart subsequently jettisoned most of the band before returning to the Mercury label to record ''[[Ten Out of 10]]'' (1981).  The band was, at least according to the album credits, now officially a duo augmented by session musicians, including Fenn and Burgess on a couple of tracks. The UK release of the album (and its associated singles \"Les Nouveaux Riches\" and \"Don't Turn Me Away\") failed to chart.\n\nIn a bid to inject an American flavour to the album and bolster its commercial appeal, Warner Bros. invited singer-songwriter [[Andrew Gold]] to contribute to a revised North American version of the LP. Gold wound up co-writing and playing on three new tracks which appeared on the North American release of ''[[Ten Out of 10]]''.  This ultimately led to an offer from Gouldman and Stewart to officially join 10cc; an offer Gold declined because of other commitments. Gouldman later admitted greater involvement by Gold might have lifted the band's early 1980s output from its mediocrity:\n\n{{quote|text=We should either have tried to change direction, which we didn't, or got someone else in the band, which we almost did.

However, the single \"Don't Turn Me Away\" was a surprise minor hit in Canada, reaching No. 38. Ironically, this track was one that appeared on the original \"less commercial\" UK version of the LP, and was ''not'' one of the tracks that had been specially added to the North American release.\n\nThe band embarked on their 10th anniversary tour in early 1982, with Fenn, Burgess and Tosh joining Stewart and Gouldman, along with new keyboardist Vic Emerson. They released \"The Power of Love\", co-written with Andrew Gold, as a single, which did not chart. \"Run Away\", released as a single in June 1982, reached No.50 in the UK; \"We've Heard it all Before\" (October 1982) did not chart.  All three of these singles were tracks from the revised North American version of ''Ten Out of 10'', and had not previously been issued in the UK.\n\nStewart also released a 1982 solo album ''[[Frooty Rooties]]'' with Burgess as a drummer and participation from Gouldman and Fenn on one track.\n\n10cc began a UK tour in March 1983, coinciding with the release of the single \"24 Hours\". The song was made available both as a 7\" and 10\" single, with live versions of \"Dreadlock Holiday\" and \"I'm Not in Love\" on the b-sides. It failed to chart, as did a further single, \"Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma)\"/\"She Gives Me Pain\" issued in July 1983.  \"Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma)\" was promoted by a tennis-themed video clip, directed by none other than former 10cc members Godley and Creme, by now well into their joint careers as noted music video pioneers.\n\nThe next 10cc LP, ''[[Windows in the Jungle]]'', (October 1983) used session heavyweights including drummer [[Steve Gadd]], but the album was dominated by Stewart; Gouldman only performed partial lead vocals on one song. It reached No.70 on the UK charts. The band toured the UK in October, with drummer Jamie Lane in place of Paul Burgess (who was working with [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]). This turned out to be their last tour until they reformed eight years later.\n\n==1984\u20131991: Separate projects==\nAfter 1983, the band went into recess as Stewart produced recordings for [[Sad Caf\u00e9 (band)|Sad Caf\u00e9]] and Gouldman produced tracks for the [[Ramones]].<ref>The Ramones namechecked 10cc on the Gouldman-produced song \"It's Not My Place (in the 9 to 5 World)\", a track on the ''[[Pleasant Dreams]]'' album.</ref> Stewart continued his association with [[Paul McCartney]]; He had already appeared on ''[[Tug of War (Paul McCartney album)|Tug of War]]'' in 1982 and ''[[Pipes of Peace]]'' in 1983.

Released in 1985, the single reached No.1 in the UK charts.\n\nA compilation album ''[[Changing Faces \u2013 The Very Best of 10cc and Godley & Creme]]'' was released in 1987 and gave the band their biggest hit album since 1978.\n\nA four CD box set, ''[[Greatest Songs and More (Great Box)|Greatest Songs and More]]'' was issued in Japan in 1991, which included many b-sides available on CD for the first time.\n\n==1991\u20131995: 10cc reunited==\nIn 1991, the original four members reunited to record ''[[...Meanwhile]]'' (1992), an album produced by [[Gary Katz]] of [[Steely Dan]] fame. Katz was suggested by the record label Polydor who wanted 10cc to enjoy success in America, and because of his links to Steely Dan\u2014a similar-sounding 1970s band. However, the album was not a \"reunion\" in the strict sense of the word. All the album's songs were written by Stewart and Gouldman (with the exception of one track which was co-written by Stewart and [[Paul McCartney]] in the late 1980s with additional writing from Gouldman). Creme and Godley agreed to guest on the album to fulfil their obligation to Polydor\u2014both had owed Polydor one album when they split in the late 1980s. Godley and Creme sang background vocals on several tracks on the album. Godley also sang the lead on one song, \"The Stars Didn't Show\". The record label did everything it could to make it appear that it was a genuine reunion album to generate publicity&nbsp;... to little effect.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n''...Meanwhile'' did not spawn any major hits, but was relatively well received in Japan and in Europe. It prominently featured session musicians [[Jeff Porcaro]] of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] on drums, Freddie Washington on bass, [[Michael Landau]] on lead and rhythm guitar, and Bashiri Johnson on percussion. Also appearing on the album were [[Dr. John]] (Mac Rebennack) on piano, [[David Paich]] (also of Toto fame) on keyboards, longtime 10cc collaborator [[Andrew Gold]] on guitar and many other renowned session musicians and singers. ''...Meanwhile'' is believed to be Porcaro's last session work before he died of a heart attack. [[Dr. John]] was recommended by producer Gary Katz and invited along to the sessions.\n\nGouldman, in a 1995 interview,<ref name=\"Hayward\" /> was philosophical about the album: \"When we finally did come back to record again, it was based on market research that our record company had done, that said a new 10cc album would do really, really well. And, ah, history has proved that wrong.\" Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. \"We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs. Every day we were coming up with new ideas, and they were getting better and better, as far as we were concerned. And they sounded like 10cc songs again.\"\n\nThe album was followed by a tour in 1993, with former members Rick Fenn and Stuart Tosh returning alongside new players Steve Piggot (keyboards, synthesisers) and Gary Wallis (drum, percussion). This tour was captured on the live album and DVD ''[[Alive (10cc album)|Alive]]''.\n\nIn 1995 the band released ''[[Mirror Mirror (10cc album)|Mirror Mirror]]'', produced by Gouldman, Stewart and [[Adrian Lee]] of [[Mike + The Mechanics]], and without participation from Godley or Creme. Despite initial objections by Gouldman,<ref name=\"Inject12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/injection012.htm |title=10cc: A Pure Injection Of Pop by Dave Thompson, Goldmine magazine, 11&nbsp;April 1997 |publisher=The10ccfanclub.com |date=11 April 1997 |accessdate=10 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100801214459/http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/injection012.htm| archivedate= 1 August 2010 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> ''Mirror Mirror'' included an acoustic version of \"[[I'm Not in Love]]\" which became a No.&nbsp;29 UK hit single, but overall the album did not fare very well. Gouldman has described ''Mirror Mirror'' as \"almost like two-halves of an album\", largely a result of the fact that he and Stewart recorded in separate countries. \"I don't like to say we hoodwinked the people, but you could say it's not quite what it appears to be, and anyone with any sense, who reads the credits, could see that,\" he told ''Goldmine'' magazine.<ref name=\"Inject12\" /> Their recording arrangement also provided further evidence of a fractured relationship between Stewart and Gouldman: aside from \"I'm Not in Love\", Stewart did not appear on any of the tracks Gouldman played or sang on, while Gouldman did not appear on any of Stewart's tracks.\n\nIn the spring of 1995, the band toured Europe and Japan with a line-up of Stewart, Gouldman, Fenn, Tosh, Alan Park (keyboards, synthesisers) and Geoff Dunn (drums, percussion)\n\nStewart left the band after this tour, and has since commented:<ref name=\"band dead\">[http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions4.htm Reply to question by Eric Stewart at his website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207015146/http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions4.htm |date=7 December 2008 }}</ref> \"10cc is well and truly finished as far as I am concerned.\" Married to a pair of sisters, Stewart and Creme have kept in touch, though neither are on speaking terms with their erstwhile writing partners.<ref>Lester,Paul (2012). \"10cc: It Was A Tragedy We Didn't Stay Together\".

This version of the band played their first gig at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]] in Birmingham and then began touring regularly in 2002. The same five members have been associated with the group ever since. A new member, Keith Hayman (keyboards), switched with Mike Stevens in 2006 and continued to do so until 2011. This iteration of the group also featured occasional guest appearances by Kevin Godley, and toured both the UK and overseas, playing 10cc hits plus a section of Gouldman's hits written for others.  Wilson handled the majority of the lead vocals, taking over from Eric Stewart on that front. Although popular with audiences, Stewart is critical of the band continuing without him.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Founding guitarist Lol Creme, discussing his newest live act in 2012, opined:\n\n{{quote|author=Lol Cr\u00e8me|text=I understand Graham's need and want to go on the road and tour but maybe he could call the show, 'Graham Gouldman of 10cc' instead of just 10cc.

They initially consisted of four musicians \u2013 [[Graham Gouldman]], [[Eric Stewart]], [[Kevin Godley]] and [[Lol Creme]] \u2013 who had written and recorded together since 1968. The group featured two songwriting teams. Stewart and Gouldman were predominantly pop songwriters, who created most of the band's accessible songs. By contrast, Godley and Creme were the predominantly experimental half of 10cc, featuring art school and cinematically-inspired writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://50connect.co.uk/index.asp?main=http://www.50connect.co.uk/50c/articlepages/entertainment_index.asp?sc%3Dmusic%26aID%3D15566|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071017093923/http://50connect.co.uk/index.asp?main=http://www.50connect.co.uk/50c/articlepages/entertainment_index.asp%3Fsc=music&aID=15566|title=50 connect.co.uk - The leading website for the over 50's|archivedate=17 October 2007|work=50connect.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nEvery member of 10cc was a multi-instrumentalist, singer, writer and producer, and the writing teams frequently switched partners, so that Godley/Gouldman or Creme/Stewart compositions were not uncommon (although compositions credited to Creme/Gouldman and Godley/Stewart are rare, only found on 1974's ''[[Sheet Music (album)|Sheet Music]]''). Most of the band's records were recorded at their own [[Strawberry Studios]] (North) in [[Stockport]] and Strawberry Studios (South) in [[Dorking]], with most of those engineered by Stewart.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1978, 10cc had five consecutive UK top-ten albums: ''Sheet Music'', ''[[The Original Soundtrack]]'' (1975), ''[[How Dare You! (album)|How Dare You!]]'' (1976), ''[[Deceptive Bends]]'' (1977) and ''[[Bloody Tourists]]'' (1978). They also had twelve singles reach the UK Top 40, three of which were the chart-toppers \"[[Rubber Bullets]]\" (1973), \"[[I'm Not in Love]]\" (1975) and \"[[Dreadlock Holiday]]\" (1978). \"I'm Not in Love\" was their breakthrough worldwide hit and is known for its innovative backing track. Godley and Creme quit the band in 1976 due to artistic disagreements and [[Godley & Creme|became a duo act]]. Stewart left the band in 1995. Since 1999, Gouldman has led a touring version of 10cc.\n\n==First collaborations==\nThree of the founding members of 10cc were childhood friends in the [[Manchester]] area. As boys, Godley and Creme knew each other; Gouldman and Godley attended the same secondary school; their musical enthusiasm led to playing at the local [[Jewish Lads' Brigade]].<ref>Lester, Paul \"Heirs to The Beatles: The story of 10cc\". The Jewish Chronicle</ref>\n\n===1964\u20131969: Early bands===\nTheir first recorded collaboration was in 1964, when Gouldman's band The Whirlwinds recorded the Lol Creme composition, \"Baby Not Like You\", as the B-side of their only single, \"Look At Me\". The Whirlwinds then changed members and name, becoming The Mockingbirds (including singer-guitarist Gouldman, bassist Bernard Basso and drummer Kevin Godley, formerly of The Sabres with Creme). The Mockingbirds recorded five singles in 1965\u201366 without any success, before dissolving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tencc.fan-site.net/ggearly.html |title=Complete Mockingbirds discography at 10cc fan club website |publisher=Tencc.fan-site.net |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> The guitarist in both The Whirlwinds and The Mockingbirds was Stephen Jacobson, brother of well-known writer [[Howard Jacobson]].<ref>Egan, Shaun (2004), ''The Guys Who Wrote 'em: Songwriting Geniuses of Rock and Pop'', Askill Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-9545750-1-4}}, Graham Gouldman.</ref>\n\nIn June 1967, Godley and Creme reunited and recorded a solitary single (\"Seeing Things Green\" b/w \"Easy Life\" on UK CBS) under the name \"The Yellow Bellow Room Boom\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tencc.fan-site.net/premarma.html#yellowbellow |title=See |publisher=Tencc.fan-site.net |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> In 1969, Gouldman took them to a [[Marmalade Records]] recording session. The boss, [[Giorgio Gomelsky]], was impressed with Godley's falsetto voice and offered them a recording contract. In September 1969, Godley & Creme recorded some basic tracks at [[Strawberry Studios]], with Stewart on guitar and Gouldman on bass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/injection004.htm |title=10cc : A Pure Injection of Pop, chapter 4, by Dave Thompson,  |publisher=The10ccfanclub.com |work=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]] magazine, 11 April 1997|accessdate=10 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100803002653/http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/injection004.htm| archivedate= 3 August 2010 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> The song, \"I'm Beside Myself\" b/w \"Animal Song\", was issued as a single, credited to Frabjoy and Runcible Spoon.\n\nGomelsky (an ex-manager of [[The Yardbirds]]) planned to market Godley & Creme as a duo, in the vein of [[Simon & Garfunkel]].<ref name=\"Strawberry\">Liner notes to ''[[Strawberry Bubblegum]]'' CD, written by David Wells, June 2003</ref> Plans for an album by Frabjoy and Runcible Spoon faltered, however, when Marmalade ran out of funds.<ref name=\"Strawberry\" /> Solo tracks by Godley and Gouldman, however - both involved Stewart and Creme \u2013 were released on a 1969 Marmalade Records compilation album, ''100 Proof''. Gouldman's track was \"The Late Mr. Late\"; a year later, Godley's song \"To Fly Away\" reappeared as \"Fly Away\", in the debut [[Hotlegs]] album, ''[[Thinks: School Stinks]]''.\n\nGouldman, meanwhile, had made a name for himself as a hit songwriter, penning \"[[Heart Full of Soul]]\", \"[[Evil Hearted You]]\" and \"[[For Your Love]]\" for [[The Yardbirds]], \"[[Look Through Any Window]]\" and \"[[Bus Stop (song)|Bus Stop]]\" for [[The Hollies]] and \"[[No Milk Today]]\", \"East West\" and \"[[Listen People]]\" for [[Herman's Hermits]].\n\n===1965\u20131968: The Mindbenders===\nMeanwhile, the fourth future member of 10cc was also tasting significant pop music success: guitarist Eric Stewart was a member of [[Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders]], a group that hit No.1 with \"[[The Game of Love (Wayne Fontana song)|The Game of Love]]\", and scored a number of other mid-1960s hits. When Fontana left the band in October 1965, the group became known simply as [[The Mindbenders]], with Stewart as their lead vocalist. The band scored a hit with \"[[A Groovy Kind of Love]]\" (released December 1965) and made an appearance in the 1967 film ''[[To Sir, with Love]]'' with \"It's Getting Harder All the Time\" and \"Off and Running.\"\n\nIn March 1968, Gouldman joined Stewart in The Mindbenders, replacing bassist Bob Lang and playing on some tour dates. Gouldman wrote two of the band's last three singles, \"Schoolgirl\" (released November 1967) and \"Uncle Joe the Ice Cream Man\" (August 1968). Those singles did not chart and The Mindbenders broke up after a short tour of England in November.<ref name=\"Tremlett\">{{cite book | author=George Tremlett | title=The 10cc Story | year= 1976 | isbn=978-0-86007-378-9 | publisher=Futura }}</ref>\n\n===1968\u20131970: Birth of Strawberry Studios; the bubblegum era===\nIn the dying days of The Mindbenders, Stewart began recording demos of new material at Inner City Studios, a Stockport studio then owned by Peter Tattersall, a former road manager for [[Billy J. Kramer]] and the [[The Dakotas (band)|Dakotas]]. In July 1968, Stewart joined Tattersall as a partner in the studio, where he could further hone his skills as a recording engineer.<ref>[http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions4.htm Eric Stewart comment on his website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207015146/http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions4.htm |date=7 December 2008 }}</ref> In October 1968, the studio was moved to bigger premises and renamed [[Strawberry Studios]], after [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\".<ref>[http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions9.htm Eric Stewart comment on his website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207015211/http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions9.htm |date=7 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Gouldman also began using Strawberry to record demos of songs he was writing for [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]]. He had become much more in demand as a songwriter than as a performer. By the end of the year, he too was a financial partner in the studios.<ref name=\"Strawberry\" />\n\nBy 1969, all four members of the original 10cc line-up were working together regularly at Strawberry Studios. Around the same time, noted American [[bubblegum pop]] writer-producers [[Jerry Kasenetz]] and [[Jeffry Katz]] of [[Super K Productions]] came to England and commissioned Gouldman to write and produce formula bubblegum songs, many of which were recorded at Strawberry Studios, and were either augmented or performed entirely by varying combinations of the future 10cc line-up.\n\nAmong the recordings from this period was \"Sausalito\", a No.&nbsp;86 US hit credited to [[Ohio Express]] and released in July 1969. In fact the song featured Gouldman on lead vocal, and vocal and instrumental backing by the other three future 10cc members.\n\nIn December 1969, Kasenetz and Katz agreed to a proposal by Gouldman that he work solely at Strawberry, rather than move constantly between Stockport, London and New York. Gouldman convinced the pair that these throwaway two-minute songs could all be written, performed and produced by him and his three colleagues, Stewart, Godley and Creme, at a fraction of the cost of hiring outside session musicians. Kasenetz and Katz booked the studio for three months.\n\nKevin Godley recalled:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minestrone.org/zigzag44.htm |title=\"Zigzag\" magazine, January&nbsp;1975 |publisher=Minestrone.org |accessdate=10 August 2010|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080828065835/http://www.minestrone.org/zigzag44.htm |archivedate = 28 August 2008|url-status=dead }}</ref><blockquote>We did a lot of tracks in a very short time \u2013 it was really like a machine. Twenty tracks in about two weeks \u2013 a lot of crap really \u2013 really shit. We used to do the voices, everything \u2013 it saved 'em money. We even did the female backing vocals.</blockquote>\nThe three-month project resulted in a number of tracks that appeared under various band names owned by Kasenetz-Katz, including \"There Ain't No Umbopo\" by [[Crazy Elephant]], \"When He Comes\" by Fighter Squadron and \"Come on Plane\" by Silver Fleet (all three with lead vocals by Godley), and \"Susan's Tuba\" by [[Freddie and the Dreamers]] (which was a monster hit in France and featured lead vocals by [[Freddie Garrity]], despite claims by some that it was Gouldman).<ref name=\"Strawberry\" />\n\nLol Creme remembered: \"Singles kept coming out under strange names that had really been recorded by us. I've no idea how many there were, or what happened to them all.\"\n\nBut Stewart described the Kasenetz-Katz deal as a breakthrough: \"That allowed us to get the extra equipment to turn it into a real studio. To begin with they were interested in Graham's songwriting and when they heard that he was involved in a studio I think they thought the most economical thing for them to do would be to book his studio and then put him to work there \u2013 but they ended up recording Graham's songs and then some of Kevin and Lol's songs, and we were all working together.\"<ref name=\"Tremlett\" />\n\n===1970\u20131971: Hotlegs; Doctor Father; The New Wave Band; Festival===\nWhen the three-month production deal with Kasenetz-Katz ended, Gouldman returned to New York to work as a staff songwriter for [[Super K Productions]] and the remaining three continued to dabble in the studio.\n\nWith Gouldman absent, Godley, Creme and Stewart continued recording singles. The first, \"[[Neanderthal Man (song)|Neanderthal Man]]\", released under the name [[Hotlegs]], began life as a test of drum layering at the new Strawberry Studios mixing desk,<ref name=\"Tremlett\" /> but when released as a single by [[Fontana Records]] in July 1970, climbed to No.&nbsp;2 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]] and became a worldwide hit, selling more than two million copies. Around the same time, the trio released \"Umbopo\" under the name of [[Doctor Father]]. The song, a slower, longer and more melancholic version of the track earlier released under the name of Crazy Elephant, failed to chart.\n\nReverting to the successful band name Hotlegs, in early 1971 Godley, Creme and Stewart recorded the album ''[[Thinks: School Stinks]]'', which included \"Neanderthal Man\". They then recalled Gouldman for a short tour supporting [[The Moody Blues]], before releasing a follow-up single \"Lady Sadie\" b/w \"The Loser\". Philips reworked their sole album, removed \"Neanderthal Man\" and added \"Today\" and issued it as ''Song''. Stewart, Creme and Godley released another single in February 1971 under yet another name, The New Wave Band, this time with former [[Herman's Hermits]] member [[Derek Leckenby|Derek \"Lek\" Leckenby]] on guitar. The song, a cover version of [[Paul Simon]]'s \"[[Cecilia (Simon & Garfunkel song)|Cecilia]]\", was one of the few tracks the band released that they had not written. It also failed to chart.<ref>[http://www.manchesterbeat.com/bands/newwaveband/newwaveband.php \"Manchester Beat\" website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115060858/http://www.manchesterbeat.com/bands/newwaveband/newwaveband.php |date=15 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe band also continued outside production work at Strawberry, working with [[Dave Berry (musician)|Dave Berry]], [[Wayne Fontana]], Peter Cowap and [[Herman's Hermits]], and doing original compositions for various UK football (soccer) teams. In 1971 they produced and played on ''Space Hymns'', an album by New Age musician [[Ramases]]; in 1972\u201373 they co-produced and played on two [[Neil Sedaka]] albums, ''[[Solitaire (Neil Sedaka album)|Solitaire]]'' and ''[[The Tra-La Days Are Over]]''.\n\nThe experience of working on ''Solitaire'', which became a success for Sedaka, was enough to prompt the band to seek recognition on their own merits. Gouldman\u2014who by 1972 was back at Strawberry Studios\u2014said:\n\n{{quote|text=It was Neil Sedaka's success that did it, I think. We'd just been accepting any job we were offered and were getting really frustrated. We knew that we were worth more than that, but it needed something to prod us into facing that.

Stewart offered the [[Acetate disc|acetate]] to [[Apple Records]]. He waited months before receiving a note from the label saying the song was not commercial enough to release as a single.\n\n==1972\u20131976: Original line-up==\nUndeterred by Apple's rejection, the group decided to plug another song which had been written as a possible B-side to \"Waterfall\", a Godley/Creme composition titled \"[[Donna (10cc song)|Donna]]\". The song was a [[Frank Zappa]]-influenced 1950s [[doo-wop]] parody, a sharp mix of commercial pop and irony with a chorus sung in falsetto. Stewart said: \"We knew it had something. We only knew of one person who was mad enough to release it, and that was [[Jonathan King]].\" Stewart called King, a flamboyant entrepreneur, producer and recording artist, who drove to Strawberry, listened to the track and \"fell about laughing\", declaring: \"It's fabulous, it's a hit.\"<ref name=\"Tremlett\" />\n\n[[File:Tencca.jpg|250px|thumb|10cc in 1973 (l-r): Gouldman, Godley, Stewart, Creme (from ''[[10cc (album)|10cc]]'' press-kit)]]\nKing signed the band to his [[UK Records]] label in July 1972 and dubbed them 10cc.

The song peaked at No.&nbsp;2 in the UK in October 1972.\n\nAlthough their second single, a similarly 1950s-influenced song called \"Johnny Don't Do It\", was not a major chart success, \"[[Rubber Bullets]]\", a catchy satirical take on the \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\" concept, became a hit internationally and gave 10cc their first British No.1 single in June 1973. They consolidated their success a few months later with \"[[The Dean and I]]\", which peaked at No.10 in September. They released two singles, \"Headline Hustler\" (in the US) and the self-mocking \"The Worst Band in the World\" (in the UK) and launched a UK tour on 26 August 1973, joined by second drummer [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]], before returning to Strawberry Studios in November to record the remainder of their second LP, ''[[Sheet Music (album)|Sheet Music]]'' (1974), which included \"The Worst Band in the World\" along with other hits \"[[The Wall Street Shuffle]]\" (No.10, 1974) and \"Silly Love\" (No.24, 1974). ''Sheet Music'' became the band's breakthrough album, remaining on the UK charts for six months and paving the way for a US tour in February 1974.\n\nIn February 1975, the band announced they were splitting with [[Jonathan King]] and that they had signed with [[Mercury Records]] for US$1&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dave Thompson|title=The Music Lover's Guide to Record Collecting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVVMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT465+|year=2002|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-1-61713-202-5|page=465}}</ref> The catalyst for the deal was one song \u2013 \"[[I'm&nbsp;Not&nbsp;in&nbsp;Love]]\". Stewart recalled:<blockquote>At that point in time we were still on Jonathan King's label, but struggling. We were absolutely skint, the lot of us, we were really struggling seriously, and [[Phonogram Inc.|Philips Phonogram]] wanted to do a deal with us. They wanted to buy Jonathan's contract.

He said \"This is a masterpiece, it's a done deal!\". We did a five-year deal with them for five albums and they paid us a serious amount of money. It was Grainge's idea to release 'Life Is A Minestrone' as the first single holding back the big one to give us more longevity for the album.<ref name=\"Wales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/esiwts.htm |title=Eric Stewart interview, Radio Wales, \"I Write the Songs\" |publisher=The10ccfanclub.com |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpeaking in the [[BBC Four]] documentary ''I'm Not in Love: The Story of 10cc'' in 2015, Stewart explained that the band, three years into a five-year contract with King were earning a mere 4% of royalties. Creme made it clear that the band had fully intended to sign with [[Richard Branson]]'s fledgling [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] label, with the band's records to be released in the US through [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]. Stewart and Creme were about to go on holiday with their wives (Stewart and Creme are brothers-in-law through marriage), however, and had left their manager Harvey Lisberg with [[power of attorney]] to accept the Branson offer. No sooner had they left the country, but another higher bid arrived from Phonogram and was accepted by the management team, including Lisberg. Creme said that he felt \"horrified, embarrassed and disgusted - to this day I still am\".<ref name=story/>\n\n''[[The Original Soundtrack]]'', which was already complete, was released just weeks later. It was both a critical and commercial success and featured distinctive cover art created by the [[Hipgnosis]] team and drawn by musician and artist [[Humphrey Ocean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/academicians/painters/humphrey-ocean-ra,195,AR.html |title=Humphrey Ocean biography at Royal Academy website |publisher=Royalacademy.org.uk |date=22 June 1951 |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> It is also notable for its opening track, Godley & Creme's \"[[Une Nuit A Paris]] (One Night in Paris)\", an eight-minute, multi-part \"mini-operetta\" that is thought to have been an influence on \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name=\"10cc_reviews\" />\n[[File:Crowd at Knebworth House - Rolling Stones 1976.jpg|thumb|left| 10cc Crowd at [[Knebworth]] concert - 120.000 - 1976]]\n\nAlthough it bore an unlikely title (picked up from a radio talk show), \"[[Life Is a Minestrone]]\" (1975) was another UK Top 10 placing, peaking at No.7. Their biggest success came with the dreamy \"[[I'm Not in Love]]\", which gave the band their second UK No. 1 in June 1975. The song provided them with their first US chart success when the song reached No. 2. A collaborative effort built around a title by Stewart, \"I'm Not in Love\" is notable for its innovative production, especially its richly overdubbed choral backing. Godley stated:<blockquote>If I was to pick one track from everything we've done, \"I'm Not in Love\" would be my favourite. It's got something that none of our other tracks have at all. It's not clever in a conscious way but it says it all so simply in, what, six minutes. \u2013 ''[[NME]]'', February 1976<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2\">{{Citation |first=John |last=Tobler |year=1992 |title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |edition=1 |publisher=Reed International Books Ltd |location=London |page=285 |id=CN 5585 }}</ref></blockquote>\nDuring this time 10cc also collaborated with [[Justin Hayward]] on the single \"Blue Guitar\", being a backing band and doing production work. The song was also released on later reissues of ''[[Blue Jays (album)|Blue Jays]]'' album by Hayward and [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]].\n\n[[File:Eric-Stewart 1976.jpg|250px|thumb|Eric Stewart performing live in [[Oslo]], April 1976]]\n10cc's fourth LP, ''[[How Dare You! (album)|How Dare You!]]'' (1976), featuring another Hipgnosis cover, furnished two more UK Top Ten hits\u2014the witty \"[[Art for Art's Sake (10cc song)|Art for Art's Sake]]\" (No.5 in January 1976) and \"[[I'm Mandy Fly Me|I'm Mandy, Fly Me]]\" (No.6, April 1976). But by this time the once close personal and working relationships between the four members had begun to fray, and it was the last album with the original line-up.\n\n10cc's success prompted the 1976 re-release of the Hotlegs album under the new title ''[[You Didn't Like It Because You Didn't Think of It]]'' with two additional tracks. The title track was the epic B-side of \"Neanderthal Man\", a section of which had been reworked as \"Fresh Air for My Mama\" on the ''[[10cc (album)|10cc]]'' album.\n\n==1976: Split==\nFrictions mounted between the group's two creative teams during the recording of ''How Dare You'', with each pair realising how far apart their ideas had become.<ref name=\"pop\">''Pop Scene \u2013 Australia's International Pop Magazine'', issue No 2, Gordon and Gotch, 1977.</ref> When the sessions finished, Godley and Creme left 10cc to work on a project that eventually evolved into the triple LP set ''[[Consequences (Godley & Creme album)|Consequences]]'' (1977), a sprawling concept album that featured contributions from satirist [[Peter Cook]] and jazz vocalist [[Sarah Vaughan]].\n\nThe first of a series of albums by [[Godley & Creme]], ''Consequences'' began as a demonstration record for the \"[[The Gizmo|Gizmotron]]\", an electric guitar effect they had invented. The device, which fitted over the bridge of an electric guitar, contained six small motor-driven wheels attached to small keys (four wheels for electric basses); when the key was depressed, the Gizmotron wheels bowed the guitar strings, producing notes and [[Chord (music)|chords]] with endless [[sustain]]. First used during the recording of the ''Sheet Music'' track \"Old Wild Men\", the device was designed to further cut their recording costs: by using it on an electric guitar with studio effects, they could effectively simulate strings and other sounds, enabling them to dispense with expensive orchestral overdubs.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with the ProGGnosis\u2014Progressive Rock & Fusion website,<ref>[http://www.proggnosis.com/interview.asp?theInterview=23 ProgGnosis website interview with Kevin Godley, 23 June 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017021830/http://www.proggnosis.com/interview.asp?theInterview=23 |date=17 October 2007 }}</ref> Godley explained: \"We left because we no longer liked what Gouldman and Stewart were writing. We left because 10cc was becoming safe and predictable and we felt trapped.\"\n\nBut speaking to ''Uncut'' magazine 10 years earlier,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.othermachines.org/blint/kev.shtml |title=Kevin Godley interview, \"Uncut\", 1997 |publisher=Othermachines.org |date=15 December 1997 |accessdate=10 August 2010 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820154425/http://www.othermachines.org/blint/kev.shtml |archivedate=20 August 2008 |df= }}</ref> he expressed regret about the band breaking up as they embarked on the ''Consequences'' project:\n\n{{quote|text=We'd reached a certain crossroads with 10cc and already spent three weeks on the genesis of what turned out to be ''Consequences''&nbsp;... The stuff that we were coming up with didn't have any home, we couldn't import it into 10cc. And we were kind of constrained by 10cc live&nbsp;... We felt like creative people who should give ourselves the opportunity to be as creative as possible and leaving seemed to be the right thing to do at that moment.\n\nUnfortunately, the band wasn't democratic or smart enough at that time to allow us the freedom to go ahead and do this project and we were placed in the unfortunate position of having to leave to do it. Looking back, it was a very northern work ethic being applied to the group, all for one and one for all. If we'd been a little more free in our thinking with regard to our work practices, the band as a corporate and creative entity could have realised that it could have been useful rather than detrimental for two members to spend some time developing and then bring whatever they'd learned back to the corporate party. Unfortunately, that wasn't to be.\n\nOur contemporaries were people like [[Roxy Music]] who allowed that to happen and they gained from that&nbsp;... Had we been allowed to get it out of our system and come back home, who knows what would have happened.}}\n\nIn a BBC Radio Wales interview<ref name=\"Wales\" /> Stewart gave his side of the split:\n\n{{quote|text=I was sorry to see them go. But we certainly did fall out at the time. I thought they were crazy. They were just walking away from something so big and successful. We'd had great success around the world and I thought we were just breaking in a very, very big way. The collective dynamite of those four people, four people who could all write, who could all sing a hit song. In one band.\n\n(Yet) I think it becomes claustrophobic, in the fact that you're trying to perfect things and you're looking at each other and eventually you maybe say this relationship is a little too tight for me now, and I need to break away. And that's what in retrospect, I found out long after because I still speak to Godley and Creme who \u2013 Lol is my brother-in-law, so I've got to see him \u2013 but for quite a while we didn't talk. I just said you're out of your minds for leaving this band. We were on such a winning curve, Graham Gouldman and I had to decide, are we going to be 5cc? Are we gonna scrap the name completely? Well, we thought we, no, we'd better carry on because we, this is 10cc, we are 10cc, this band. Two of our members are leaving us and that's not our problem, but we've got to carry it on.}}\n\nStewart said there were immediate benefits in the absence of Godley and Creme. \"It became clear things went much smoother and the atmosphere was much more pleasant than with Lol and Kevin,\" he said.<ref name=\"pop\" />\n\nGodley & Creme went on to achieve cult success as a songwriting and recording duo, scoring several hits and releasing a string of innovative LPs and singles. Having honed their skills on the equally innovative clips that they made to promote their own singles (e.g. their 1985 single \"[[Cry (Godley & Creme song)|Cry]]\") they returned to their visual arts roots and became better-known as directors of music videos in the 1980s, creating acclaimed videos for chart-topping acts including [[George Harrison]] (\"[[When We Was Fab]]\"), [[Asia (band)|Asia]] (\"[[Heat of the Moment (Asia song)|Heat of the Moment]]\", \"[[Only Time Will Tell (song)|Only Time Will Tell]]\") [[The Police]] (\"[[Every Breath You Take]]\"), [[Duran Duran]] (\"[[Girls on Film]]\"), [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] (\"[[Two Tribes]]\"), [[Peter Gabriel]]'s duet with [[Kate Bush]] (\"[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]\"), and [[Herbie Hancock]] (\"[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]\"). They also directed a video for Stewart and Gouldman's \"Feel the Love\".\n\n==1977\u20131983: Second era==\nAfter the departure of Godley and Creme, Stewart and Gouldman opted to continue as 10cc, working with drummer [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]], who had up to that point been their tour backup drummer. Their first album as a three piece band was ''[[Deceptive Bends]]'' (1977), named after a sign on the [[Mickleham, Surrey|Mickleham]] bends on the [[A24 road (England)|A24]] between [[Leatherhead]] and [[Dorking]] in Surrey.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The album, recorded at the newly completed Strawberry South Studio in Dorking, Surrey, reached No.&nbsp;3 in Britain and No.&nbsp;31 in the US and also yielded three hit singles, \"[[The Things We Do for Love (song)|The Things We Do for Love]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;6, US No.&nbsp;5), \"Good Morning Judge\" (UK No.&nbsp;5, US No.&nbsp;69) and \"[[People in Love]]\" (US No.&nbsp;40). Stewart later said he and Gouldman felt vindicated by its success: \"I was out to prove also that we could write a hit album without Kevin and Lol&nbsp;... we did!\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions12.htm |title=Questions and Answers |first=Eric |last=Stewart |author-link=Eric Stewart |work=ericstewart.uk.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525074543/http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions12.htm |archive-date=2006-05-25 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, 10cc embarked on an international tour with guitarist [[Rick Fenn]], keyboardist [[Tony O'Malley (musician)|Tony O'Malley]] and an additional drummer [[Stuart Tosh]] (ex-[[Pilot (band)|Pilot]]) and recorded a live album, \"[[Live and Let Live (10cc album)|Live and Let Live]]\" (1977), which mixed the hits with material from the previous three LPs.\n\nFenn, Tosh, Burgess and keyboardist Duncan Mackay (who in 1977 made a solo album entitled \"Score\") were now full members of the band and performed on 1978's ''[[Bloody Tourists]]'', which provided the band with their third UK No.&nbsp;1 single, the reggae-styled \"[[Dreadlock Holiday]]\". It was their last hit, with the second single \"Reds in My Bed\", featuring lead vocals by Stuart Tosh, failing to chart.\n\nThe band suffered a major setback in January 1979 when Stewart was seriously injured in a car crash. He told the BBC:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/esiwts.htm |title=Stewart's BBC Radio Wales interview |publisher=The10ccfanclub.com |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It flattened me completely. I damaged my left ear, I damaged my eye very badly. I couldn't go near music. I couldn't go near anything loud and I love music and motor-racing.

And on the music scene, the punk thing had come in a big way. [[The Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], lots of things like that. So by the time I was fit again to play, I think we'd just missed the bus. It'd gone. And whatever we did after that, we got a few tickles here and there and we could continue touring forever on the strength of the past hits, but it didn't feel right again, we just didn't have that public with us.}}\n\nGouldman, too, considered the aftermath of Stewart's accident to be a turning point. In a 1995 BBC interview<ref name=\"Hayward\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minestrone.org/wellabove.htm |title=Graham Gouldman interviewed by Justin Hayward, BBC2, 1995 |publisher=Minestrone.org |accessdate=10 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004538/http://www.minestrone.org/wellabove.htm |archivedate=12 March 2007 |url-status=dead  |df=dmy-all }}</ref> he said:\n\n{{quote|text=Really, after '78 things went downhill for us. I don't know what it was. We'd been doing it for so long, maybe we should have had a break then, rather than in '83 when we did have a break, or brought new blood in or done something. And even as the things were getting bad, we thought, 'Ah, it's gonna be all right, don't worry about it, it'll be great'.}}\n\nWhile Stewart recovered, Gouldman recorded the title track to the film ''Sunburn'', which became a minor UK hit in 1979. The band also issued a greatest hits compilation in late 1979 ''[[Greatest Hits 1972\u20131978]]'', and released a single, coupling \"I'm Not in Love\" with \"For You and I\", which failed to chart.\n\nBoth produced soundtrack albums in 1980 with the help of some of the 10cc band members: Gouldman recorded [[Animalympics (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to the animated film ''[[Animalympics]]'', while Stewart produced the soundtrack to the film ''[[Girls (Eric Stewart album)|Girls]]''. The band signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], producing a new 10cc offering entitled ''[[Look Hear?]]'', featuring the single \"One Two Five\". All three albums featured musicians from 10cc's ''Bloody Tourists'' line-up, and all were released between February and April 1980. Only ''Look Hear?'' appeared on charts in the UK or US.\n\nGouldman and Stewart subsequently jettisoned most of the band before returning to the Mercury label to record ''[[Ten Out of 10]]'' (1981).  The band was, at least according to the album credits, now officially a duo augmented by session musicians, including Fenn and Burgess on a couple of tracks. The UK release of the album (and its associated singles \"Les Nouveaux Riches\" and \"Don't Turn Me Away\") failed to chart.\n\nIn a bid to inject an American flavour to the album and bolster its commercial appeal, Warner Bros. invited singer-songwriter [[Andrew Gold]] to contribute to a revised North American version of the LP. Gold wound up co-writing and playing on three new tracks which appeared on the North American release of ''[[Ten Out of 10]]''.  This ultimately led to an offer from Gouldman and Stewart to officially join 10cc; an offer Gold declined because of other commitments. Gouldman later admitted greater involvement by Gold might have lifted the band's early 1980s output from its mediocrity:\n\n{{quote|text=We should either have tried to change direction, which we didn't, or got someone else in the band, which we almost did.

However, the single \"Don't Turn Me Away\" was a surprise minor hit in Canada, reaching No. 38. Ironically, this track was one that appeared on the original \"less commercial\" UK version of the LP, and was ''not'' one of the tracks that had been specially added to the North American release.\n\nThe band embarked on their 10th anniversary tour in early 1982, with Fenn, Burgess and Tosh joining Stewart and Gouldman, along with new keyboardist Vic Emerson. They released \"The Power of Love\", co-written with Andrew Gold, as a single, which did not chart. \"Run Away\", released as a single in June 1982, reached No.50 in the UK; \"We've Heard it all Before\" (October 1982) did not chart.  All three of these singles were tracks from the revised North American version of ''Ten Out of 10'', and had not previously been issued in the UK.\n\nStewart also released a 1982 solo album ''[[Frooty Rooties]]'' with Burgess as a drummer and participation from Gouldman and Fenn on one track.\n\n10cc began a UK tour in March 1983, coinciding with the release of the single \"24 Hours\". The song was made available both as a 7\" and 10\" single, with live versions of \"Dreadlock Holiday\" and \"I'm Not in Love\" on the b-sides. It failed to chart, as did a further single, \"Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma)\"/\"She Gives Me Pain\" issued in July 1983.  \"Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma)\" was promoted by a tennis-themed video clip, directed by none other than former 10cc members Godley and Creme, by now well into their joint careers as noted music video pioneers.\n\nThe next 10cc LP, ''[[Windows in the Jungle]]'', (October 1983) used session heavyweights including drummer [[Steve Gadd]], but the album was dominated by Stewart; Gouldman only performed partial lead vocals on one song. It reached No.70 on the UK charts. The band toured the UK in October, with drummer Jamie Lane in place of Paul Burgess (who was working with [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]). This turned out to be their last tour until they reformed eight years later.\n\n==1984\u20131991: Separate projects==\nAfter 1983, the band went into recess as Stewart produced recordings for [[Sad Caf\u00e9 (band)|Sad Caf\u00e9]] and Gouldman produced tracks for the [[Ramones]].<ref>The Ramones namechecked 10cc on the Gouldman-produced song \"It's Not My Place (in the 9 to 5 World)\", a track on the ''[[Pleasant Dreams]]'' album.</ref> Stewart continued his association with [[Paul McCartney]]; He had already appeared on ''[[Tug of War (Paul McCartney album)|Tug of War]]'' in 1982 and ''[[Pipes of Peace]]'' in 1983. During 1984 he appeared in the video for the US single \"So Bad\" which also featured [[Ringo Starr]] and the feature film/soundtrack for ''[[Give My Regards to Broad Street]]''.

Katz was suggested by the record label Polydor who wanted 10cc to enjoy success in America, and because of his links to Steely Dan\u2014a similar-sounding 1970s band. However, the album was not a \"reunion\" in the strict sense of the word. All the album's songs were written by Stewart and Gouldman (with the exception of one track which was co-written by Stewart and [[Paul McCartney]] in the late 1980s with additional writing from Gouldman). Creme and Godley agreed to guest on the album to fulfil their obligation to Polydor\u2014both had owed Polydor one album when they split in the late 1980s. Godley and Creme sang background vocals on several tracks on the album. Godley also sang the lead on one song, \"The Stars Didn't Show\". The record label did everything it could to make it appear that it was a genuine reunion album to generate publicity&nbsp;... to little effect.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n''...Meanwhile'' did not spawn any major hits, but was relatively well received in Japan and in Europe. It prominently featured session musicians [[Jeff Porcaro]] of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] on drums, Freddie Washington on bass, [[Michael Landau]] on lead and rhythm guitar, and Bashiri Johnson on percussion. Also appearing on the album were [[Dr. John]] (Mac Rebennack) on piano, [[David Paich]] (also of Toto fame) on keyboards, longtime 10cc collaborator [[Andrew Gold]] on guitar and many other renowned session musicians and singers. ''...Meanwhile'' is believed to be Porcaro's last session work before he died of a heart attack. [[Dr. John]] was recommended by producer Gary Katz and invited along to the sessions.\n\nGouldman, in a 1995 interview,<ref name=\"Hayward\" /> was philosophical about the album: \"When we finally did come back to record again, it was based on market research that our record company had done, that said a new 10cc album would do really, really well. And, ah, history has proved that wrong.\" Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. \"We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs. Every day we were coming up with new ideas, and they were getting better and better, as far as we were concerned. And they sounded like 10cc songs again.\"\n\nThe album was followed by a tour in 1993, with former members Rick Fenn and Stuart Tosh returning alongside new players Steve Piggot (keyboards, synthesisers) and Gary Wallis (drum, percussion). This tour was captured on the live album and DVD ''[[Alive (10cc album)|Alive]]''.\n\nIn 1995 the band released ''[[Mirror Mirror (10cc album)|Mirror Mirror]]'', produced by Gouldman, Stewart and [[Adrian Lee]] of [[Mike + The Mechanics]], and without participation from Godley or Creme.

Gouldman has described ''Mirror Mirror'' as \"almost like two-halves of an album\", largely a result of the fact that he and Stewart recorded in separate countries. \"I don't like to say we hoodwinked the people, but you could say it's not quite what it appears to be, and anyone with any sense, who reads the credits, could see that,\" he told ''Goldmine'' magazine.<ref name=\"Inject12\" /> Their recording arrangement also provided further evidence of a fractured relationship between Stewart and Gouldman: aside from \"I'm Not in Love\", Stewart did not appear on any of the tracks Gouldman played or sang on, while Gouldman did not appear on any of Stewart's tracks.\n\nIn the spring of 1995, the band toured Europe and Japan with a line-up of Stewart, Gouldman, Fenn, Tosh, Alan Park (keyboards, synthesisers) and Geoff Dunn (drums, percussion)\n\nStewart left the band after this tour, and has since commented:<ref name=\"band dead\">[http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions4.htm Reply to question by Eric Stewart at his website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207015146/http://www.ericstewart.uk.com/questions4.htm |date=7 December 2008 }}</ref> \"10cc is well and truly finished as far as I am concerned.\" Married to a pair of sisters, Stewart and Creme have kept in touch, though neither are on speaking terms with their erstwhile writing partners.<ref>Lester,Paul (2012). \"10cc: It Was A Tragedy We Didn't Stay Together\".

This version of the band played their first gig at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]] in Birmingham and then began touring regularly in 2002. The same five members have been associated with the group ever since. A new member, Keith Hayman (keyboards), switched with Mike Stevens in 2006 and continued to do so until 2011. This iteration of the group also featured occasional guest appearances by Kevin Godley, and toured both the UK and overseas, playing 10cc hits plus a section of Gouldman's hits written for others.  Wilson handled the majority of the lead vocals, taking over from Eric Stewart on that front. Although popular with audiences, Stewart is critical of the band continuing without him.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Founding guitarist Lol Creme, discussing his newest live act in 2012, opined:\n\n{{quote|author=Lol Cr\u00e8me|text=I understand Graham's need and want to go on the road and tour but maybe he could call the show, 'Graham Gouldman of 10cc' instead of just 10cc. I feel that as things are, the name is quite misleading to the fans. I know that Eric still gets emails from fans who were disappointed that he wasn't at these \"10cc\" shows. It really gets under his skin. I've still got a lot of respect for Graham and he was certainly an integral part of 10cc.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Man on the Moon  |work=Low Down: The definitive Liverpool Listings Guide |url=http://www.thelowdownmagazine.com/Man_on_the_Moon-4918.html}}</ref>}}\n\nIn January 2004, Godley and Gouldman reconvened to write more songs.

Here, she offers advice and [[psychoanalysis]] for a [[nickel (United States coin)|nickel (five cents)]], usually to an anxious Charlie Brown. The \"advice\" is often worthless. Sometimes however, Lucy\u2019s advice may range from street-smart popular psychology, hilarious obvious truths, to insightful investigation. One example is when, while treating Snoopy, Lucy asks him how he related, during his childhood, to the other (if you allow the expression) \"dogs\" in his family. Needless to say, Snoopy was quick to disallow the expression.\n\nA sign on the front of the booth declares that \"The Doctor is\" in or out, depending on which side of the \"In/Out\" placard is displayed.  In ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'', Lucy reverses the placard from displaying its \"Out\" side to reveal the words \"Real In\".\n\n===Baseball===\nOn Charlie Brown's baseball team Lucy plays right field (or occasionally center field), and is characterized as a bad player, who, when temporarily kicked off the team, turns to heckling the games. Lucy has a knack for coming up with a nonsensical excuse for every fly ball she misses, such as \"The moons of Saturn got in my eyes\" or \"I think there were toxic substances coming from my glove, and they made me dizzy.\" Other times, she finds an excuse to have one-sided conversations with Charlie Brown at the pitcher's mound, often over some trivial thing she noticed, which usually result in Charlie Brown blowing his top and yelling at her to \"Get back in rightfield where you belong!\"{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==History==\nThe third new character in ''Peanuts'' after [[Violet (Peanuts)|Violet]] and [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]], Lucy made her debut on March 3, 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/03/03|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for March 03, 1952 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1952-03-03|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> She was originally a goggle-eyed toddler who continually annoys her parents and the older kids, but aged up over the next two years so that by 1954, she appeared to be about the same age as Charlie Brown (the early strips with toddler-age Lucy were not reprinted until after Charles Schulz\u2019s death). Within a few months of her introduction, Schulz altered Lucy's eyes to have the same appearance as that of the other characters, except for small extra lines around them which were also later sported by her two siblings.\n\nLucy has short, black hair and wears a blue dress with blue socks and [[saddle shoes]] until the late 1970s when Schulz began showing the strip's female characters in pants and shirts in order to keep their outfits more contemporary. By the late 1980s, she had switched to this look permanently.\n\nLucy frequently pulls the [[American football|football]] away from Charlie Brown right as he is about to kick it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Inge |first=M.

One infamous example of this is the animated special ''[[It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown]]'', where her actions (she pulled the ball away four times) cost the school football team a win in the Homecoming game, yet Charlie Brown is blamed even though he is clearly not at fault. Charlie Brown did in fact kick the football in the September 12, 1956 strip, but only because Schroeder was holding the ball.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1956/09/12|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for September 12, 1956 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1956-09-12|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\nLucy was named after Louanne van Pelt, a former neighbor of Charles Schulz in Colorado Springs and, according to David Michaelis of Time Magazine, was modeled after Schulz's first wife, Joyce.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Holiday TV: Mariemont woman inspired Lucy Van Pelt |url=http://cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2012/12/18/holiday-tv-mariemont-woman-inspired-lucy-van-pelt/ |date=December 18, 2012 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219144958/http://cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2012/12/18/holiday-tv-mariemont-woman-inspired-lucy-van-pelt/ |archivedate=December 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n* Lucy, along with other ''Peanuts'' characters made appearances on ''[[Family Guy]]''.

In ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'', Lucy reverses the placard from displaying its \"Out\" side to reveal the words \"Real In\".\n\n===Baseball===\nOn Charlie Brown's baseball team Lucy plays right field (or occasionally center field), and is characterized as a bad player, who, when temporarily kicked off the team, turns to heckling the games. Lucy has a knack for coming up with a nonsensical excuse for every fly ball she misses, such as \"The moons of Saturn got in my eyes\" or \"I think there were toxic substances coming from my glove, and they made me dizzy.\" Other times, she finds an excuse to have one-sided conversations with Charlie Brown at the pitcher's mound, often over some trivial thing she noticed, which usually result in Charlie Brown blowing his top and yelling at her to \"Get back in rightfield where you belong!\"{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==History==\nThe third new character in ''Peanuts'' after [[Violet (Peanuts)|Violet]] and [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]], Lucy made her debut on March 3, 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1952/03/03|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for March 03, 1952 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1952-03-03|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> She was originally a goggle-eyed toddler who continually annoys her parents and the older kids, but aged up over the next two years so that by 1954, she appeared to be about the same age as Charlie Brown (the early strips with toddler-age Lucy were not reprinted until after Charles Schulz\u2019s death). Within a few months of her introduction, Schulz altered Lucy's eyes to have the same appearance as that of the other characters, except for small extra lines around them which were also later sported by her two siblings.\n\nLucy has short, black hair and wears a blue dress with blue socks and [[saddle shoes]] until the late 1970s when Schulz began showing the strip's female characters in pants and shirts in order to keep their outfits more contemporary. By the late 1980s, she had switched to this look permanently.\n\nLucy frequently pulls the [[American football|football]] away from Charlie Brown right as he is about to kick it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Inge |first=M.

He attended [[Phillips Academy]], Andover followed by the [[University of Virginia]] for his undergraduate degree before earning a [[Bachelor of Philosophy|PhB]] in 1895 from [[Yale University]]. He was a member of the [[Book and Snake]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.frankhinkey.com/The-Vault.php |title = Frank Hinkey}}</ref> secret society, president of his class, and a member of noted the Yale Football teams from 1892\u20131895 that went a combined 52\u20131\u20132 and were national champions four years in a row. Immediately following graduation, he joined the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] where he worked briefly before being commissioned in the [[Rough Riders|1st Volunteer Cavalry]] of the [[United States Volunteers|U.S. Volunteers]] at the outset of the Spanish\u2013American War.\n\nAfter being removed from active duty at the end of the Spanish\u2013American War in 1899, Greenway returned to steel and mining and held executive positions in a number of mine, steel, and railroad companies. He supervised development of [[United States Steel]]'s open pit Canisteo Mine and Trout Lake Washing Plant in [[Coleraine, Minnesota]], one of the first large-scale iron ore benefication plants in the world.  Following the successful commissioning of the Trout Lake plant, in 1911 Greenway was recruited by the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company (led by [[US Steel]] executives, the combined entity created by [[J.P. Morgan]] which included Carnegie Steel) to develop their newly acquired New Cornelia Mine in [[Ajo, Arizona]]. He developed the Ajo townsite and developed the New Cornelia into the first large open pit copper mine in [[Arizona]].

He was a member of the [[Book and Snake]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.frankhinkey.com/The-Vault.php |title = Frank Hinkey}}</ref> secret society, president of his class, and a member of noted the Yale Football teams from 1892\u20131895 that went a combined 52\u20131\u20132 and were national champions four years in a row. Immediately following graduation, he joined the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] where he worked briefly before being commissioned in the [[Rough Riders|1st Volunteer Cavalry]] of the [[United States Volunteers|U.S. Volunteers]] at the outset of the Spanish\u2013American War.\n\nAfter being removed from active duty at the end of the Spanish\u2013American War in 1899, Greenway returned to steel and mining and held executive positions in a number of mine, steel, and railroad companies. He supervised development of [[United States Steel]]'s open pit Canisteo Mine and Trout Lake Washing Plant in [[Coleraine, Minnesota]], one of the first large-scale iron ore benefication plants in the world.  Following the successful commissioning of the Trout Lake plant, in 1911 Greenway was recruited by the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company (led by [[US Steel]] executives, the combined entity created by [[J.P. Morgan]] which included Carnegie Steel) to develop their newly acquired New Cornelia Mine in [[Ajo, Arizona]]. He developed the Ajo townsite and developed the New Cornelia into the first large open pit copper mine in [[Arizona]]. He also served one year as a regent of the [[University of Arizona]] before the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]].\n\n== Military career ==\n\n=== Spanish\u2013American War ===\n[[File:MV5BNzYyZTNmNDctMzg0YS00MzM4LTkzMjctMmMxMTlkNTIxYWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg3NjMxMzc@.

He is referenced on numerous occasions by Roosevelt in his book ''The Rough Riders'' and a book of Greenway's own correspondence was turned into a book entitled ''It Was the Grandest Sight I Ever Saw: Experiences of a Rough Rider As Recorded in the Letters of Lieutenant John Campbell Greenway''. In his book, \"The Rough Riders\", Roosevelt said about Lieutenant Greenway:\n<blockquote>\"''A strapping fellow, entirely fearless, modest and quiet, with the ability to take care of the men under him so as to bring them to the highest point of soldierly perfection, to be counted upon with absolute certainty in every emergency; not only doing his duty, but always on the watch to find some new duty which he could construe to be his, ready to respond with eagerness to the slightest suggestion of doing something, whether it was dangerous or merely difficult and laborious''.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Thomas|first= Clara Chapline |date=1908|title=The Young Man Strenuous |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VF0wAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=%22A+strapping+fellow,+entirely+fearless,+modest+and+quiet,+with+the+ability+to+take+care+of+the+men+under+him+so+as+to+bring+them+to+the+highest+point+of+soldierly+perfection,+to+be+counted+upon+with+absolute+certainty+in+every+emergency+;+not+only+doing+hi&source=bl&ots=6nLRehsni3&sig=bO-Dn5gjFRap_mlEg0KZGcF0jBs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC1-CG__PeAhWmw1QKHda2BygQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22A%20strapping%20fellow%2C%20entirely%20fearless%2C%20modest%20and%20quiet%2C%20with%20the%20ability%20to%20take%20care%20of%20the%20men%20under%20him%20so%20as%20to%20bring%20them%20to%20the%20highest%20point%20of%20soldierly%20perfection%2C%20to%20be%20counted%20upon%20with%20absolute%20certainty%20in%20every%20emergency%20%3B%20not%20only%20doing%20hi&f=false|magazine=The World To-Day |location=United States|publisher=Hearst International |access-date=22 November 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== World War I ===\nGreenway was returned to active service as a [[lieutenant colonel]] at the dawn of America entering World War I.

During the war, Greenway would fight in numerous battles including [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]] and the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry (1918)|Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry]]. He was especially praised for his heroic conduct in battle and was cited for bravery at [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Cambrai]]. France awarded him the [[Croix de Guerre]], the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]], and the [[Ordre de l'\u00c9toile Noire]] for commanding the [[101st Infantry Regiment (United States)|101st Infantry]], [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th Division]], during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Arthur Barksdale |last1=Kinsolving |title=The Story of a Southern School |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-w_8r4S67p8C&pg=PA305&lpg=PA305&dq=%22legion+of+honour%22+greenway#v=onepage&q=%22legion%20of%20honour%22%20greenway&f=false |year=1922 |publisher=The Norman, Remington Co. |page=305 |isbn=9781331302483}}</ref> He also received a [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and the [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]].\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nIn 1919 Greenway was promoted to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the infantry, and three years later he was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].

[[Brompton Cemetery]] in London.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nCharlotte was born to parents General Francis Hugonin (d. 1836), who was later described as highly intelligent by his daughter Charlotte, and Charlotte Hugonin n\u00e9e Edgar (d. 1838), who was a talented florist and botanist according to her daughter.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> At age 27, she met Roderick Impey Murchison, a soldier, and they married later that year, on 29 August 1815.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" />\n\nIn 1816, the young couple went on a tour of France, the Alps, and Italy where Charlotte took care observing the various plant life distinct to rock formations in the areas.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> After spending the winter in Genoa, they traveled to Rome and stayed into the summer, where Charlotte caught ill and nearly died of a malarian fever.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> Though she recovered, the effects of the illness persisted throughout her life.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> While in Rome the Murchison's became lifelong friends with [[Mary Somerville]] (1780\u20131872), who would later write of them in her autobiography, stating specifically that Charlotte was \"an amiable accomplished woman, drew prettily & what was rare at the time she had studied science, especially geology and it was chiefly owing to her example that her husband turned his mind to those pursuits in which he afterwards obtained such distinction.\"<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" />\n\nFollowing their trip to Europe the Murchisons moved to [[Barnard Castle]], County Durham.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> During their time here Charlotte continued her collecting and studying of minerals although her husband had settled into a life away from Geology.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> After spending years in this lifestyle Charlotte, along with [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]], convinced Roderick to continue his study of Geology and in 1824 the couple moved to London in order for Roderick to attend lectures on the subject.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" />\n\nWith her husband now focused on the study of Geology Charlotte was a consistent companion to her husband's travels, studies, and fieldwork, participating in the work alongside him. On one such trip, specifically their voyage to the southern coast of England, Charlotte went fossil hunting with [[Mary Anning]] (1799\u20131847) and the two became close friends from then on.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> Throughout travels with her husband, Charlotte would purchase or hunt for fossils to add to her personal collection, oftentimes studying them independently as well.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> Charlotte's collection was so well kept and educational that specimens of her collection were studied and published into the works of [[James De Carle Sowerby|James de Carle Sowerby]] (1788\u20131871) and, later, [[William Buckland]] (1784\u20131856).<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> In recognition of Charlotte's contribution Sowerby named an ammonite fossil, Ammonites Murchisonae, sketched by her on one of her trips to Yorkshire, after her.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" />\n\nDespite all her self-study and time working in the field alongside her husband, Charlotte desired higher education. By 1831, [[Charles Lyell]] (1797\u20131875), a friend of her and her husband's whom they had worked and traveled with, was giving geological lectures at King's College.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> Despite his refusal to admit women to his lectures, Charlotte persisted in her attendance, leading to Lyell's opening of his lectures to both men and women.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> Charlotte would also attend the meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when able, despite her continued health issues.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" />\n\nIn 1838, when her mother died, Charlotte was left a significant fortune. The couple was able to move to a prestigious house in Belgravia, London.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> Their soirees became a meeting place for scientists and politicians and it was noted that much of the success of these parties was due to Charlotte's attendance.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" />\n\nEventually, after years of struggling with illness, she became too ill to travel with her husband and later died of her continued health issues.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" />\n\n== Travels through Continental Europe ==\n\n=== Travels with Roderick from 1816 to 1818 ===\nDuring her lifetime Charlotte accompanied her husband on several trips of Continental Europe.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> Their first trip of Continental Europe was in the spring of 1816 and involved visits to locations in France and Italy, as well as a trip to the Alps.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> Among the cities they visited was Genoa, during the winter of 1816, and Rome, in the following spring.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> The purpose of this trip was not specifically for geological purposes, although that is not to say no geological activities occurred, but instead the couple engaged in other activities including learning Italian and visiting prominent cultural cities.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> This trip is notable as it was during this trip, when in Rome, that Charlotte caught malaria, an event which would lead to difficulties for her throughout her life.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> Prior to this trip, the Murchisons had little experience in geological work and this lack of knowledge is written in Mary Somerville's recounting of the couple.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" /> After spending the summer of 1818 in Italy, the couple returned to England.<ref name=\"K\u00f6lbl-Ebert 1997\" />\n\n=== Travels with Roderick and Charles Lyell in 1828 ===\nThe next notable trip the couple took to Continental Europe would begin in April 1828.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Dennis|date=1999|title=Lyell and Murchison in France|url=|journal=Modern Geology|volume=21|pages=313\u2013334|via=}}</ref> On 7 May they would be joined by Charles Lyell in Paris and from there they would begin their tour of Europe together.<ref name=\":1\" /> For this trip, they began in France and traveled through the [[Massif Central]], stopping in Nizza before continuing on to Southern Germany.

Greenway took part in the expedition from April to August 1929, after which he and Delacour left Madagascar for Delacour's fifth expedition to [[Indochina]], where they collected zoological specimens in [[Tonkin]] and [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]].<ref name=fv/>\n\n===Museum of Comparative Zoology===\nIn 1932 Greenway joined the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] (MCZ) at [[Harvard University]] as Assistant Curator of Birds until 1952 and then, succeeding [[James Lee Peters]], as Curator until 1960.  During the 1930s he participated in several collecting expeditions to the [[Caribbean]], especially the [[Bahamas]].

The novel was about \"Jim Kennoway\" who, like Greenway, was stationed in the Solomon Islands, went on natural history expeditions to far-flung locations, and worked at the American Museum of Natural History.  The one key difference is that in the novel, the fictional \"Kennoway\" mourned \"the death of his beautiful wife,\" who died young.  The real Greenway, in contrast, divorced his first wife in order to marry his mistress.  The fact that ''The Bird Skinner'' is a semi-fictionalized account of the author's grandfather's life \u2014 with a sanitized version of his marital life \u2014 gives readers a much better appreciation of the book and the author's motivations.<ref>http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy1507/2014434614-d.html Publisher's description; based on an earlier version of the book which used \"Jim Carroway\" instead of \"Jim Kennoway\"</ref>\n\n{{Portal bar|Science|Birds|New York State|Connecticut}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greenway, James}}\n[[Category:1903 births]]\n[[Category:1989 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lauder Greenway Family]]\n[[Category:People from Greenwich, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Scientists from New York City]]\n[[Category:Phillips Exeter Academy alumni]]\n[[Category:Yale University alumni]]\n[[Category:American ornithologists]]\n[[Category:Harvard University staff]]\n[[Category:People associated with the American Museum of Natural History]]\n[[Category:20th-century zoologists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American scientists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific_prefix   = [[Lt.
