He acted as leader of the [[Culper Ring]] during the war, a celebrated network of spies in New York where major British forces were based. He also led a successful raid across [[Long Island]] that culminated in the [[Battle of Fort St. George]]. Following the war, Tallmadge was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the [[Federalist Party]].\n\n==Early life==\nTallmadge was born February 25, 1754, the son of Susannah Smith (1729\u20131768) and Rev.

Benedict Arnold's British contact [[John Andr\u00e9]] was caught and taken to North Castle, where commander Colonel Jameson ordered lieutenant Allen to take the incriminating documents found with Andr\u00e9 to their commander Benedict Arnold at West Point. Tallmadge suspected Andr\u00e9 to be a spy and Benedict Arnold to be his accomplice, and he tried to have Jameson reverse his orders. He was unsuccessful, but did convince Jameson to send a rider and take Andre to Salem, eight miles east of the Hudson River and to send the documents to George Washington. Allen still reported to Benedict Arnold with Jameson's note outlining the events. Later, Jameson was chastised by Washington for warning Arnold and allowing his escape. Andr\u00e9 was placed in Tallmadge's custody awaiting execution.\n\nOn November 21, 1780, Tallmadge and his dragoons rowed across Long Island Sound from [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] to [[Cedar Beach (Brookhaven, New York)|Cedar Beach]] in [[Mount Sinai, New York]]. The next day, they proceeded to the south shore where they captured and burned down [[Manor St. George]]. On their march back to Mt. Sinai, Tallmadge stopped in [[Coram, New York]] and ordered the burning of 300 tons of hay which the British had been stockpiling for the winter. George Washington, on hearing the news, sent the following letter to Tallmadge:\n<blockquote>I have received with much pleasure the report of your successful enterprise upon fort St. George, and was pleased with the destruction of the hay at Coram, which must be severely felt by the enemy at this time. I beg you to accept my thanks for your spirited execution of this business.<ref>Bayles, Thomas R. \"The Early Years in Middle Island, Coram, Yaphank, and Ridge.\" Ed. Suzanne Johnson.

He acted as leader of the [[Culper Ring]] during the war, a celebrated network of spies in New York where major British forces were based. He also led a successful raid across [[Long Island]] that culminated in the [[Battle of Fort St. George]]. Following the war, Tallmadge was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the [[Federalist Party]].\n\n==Early life==\nTallmadge was born February 25, 1754, the son of Susannah Smith (1729\u20131768) and Rev.

Benedict Arnold's British contact [[John Andr\u00e9]] was caught and taken to North Castle, where commander Colonel Jameson ordered lieutenant Allen to take the incriminating documents found with Andr\u00e9 to their commander Benedict Arnold at West Point. Tallmadge suspected Andr\u00e9 to be a spy and Benedict Arnold to be his accomplice, and he tried to have Jameson reverse his orders. He was unsuccessful, but did convince Jameson to send a rider and take Andre to Salem, eight miles east of the Hudson River and to send the documents to George Washington. Allen still reported to Benedict Arnold with Jameson's note outlining the events. Later, Jameson was chastised by Washington for warning Arnold and allowing his escape. Andr\u00e9 was placed in Tallmadge's custody awaiting execution.\n\nOn November 21, 1780, Tallmadge and his dragoons rowed across Long Island Sound from [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] to [[Cedar Beach (Brookhaven, New York)|Cedar Beach]] in [[Mount Sinai, New York]]. The next day, they proceeded to the south shore where they captured and burned down [[Manor St. George]]. On their march back to Mt. Sinai, Tallmadge stopped in [[Coram, New York]] and ordered the burning of 300 tons of hay which the British had been stockpiling for the winter. George Washington, on hearing the news, sent the following letter to Tallmadge:\n<blockquote>I have received with much pleasure the report of your successful enterprise upon fort St. George, and was pleased with the destruction of the hay at Coram, which must be severely felt by the enemy at this time. I beg you to accept my thanks for your spirited execution of this business.<ref>Bayles, Thomas R. \"The Early Years in Middle Island, Coram, Yaphank, and Ridge.\" Ed. Suzanne Johnson.

She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first [[algorithm]] intended to be carried out by such a machine.

Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived [[insanity]]. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married [[William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King]] in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\n\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as [[Andrew Crosse]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]], contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=234\u2013235}} and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician [[Charles Babbage]], who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, [[Mary Somerville]].\n\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer [[Luigi Menabrea]] on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ''Notes''. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ventana al Conocimiento |url=https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/ada-lovelace-original-and-visionary-but-no-programmer/ |title=Ada Lovelace: Original and Visionary, but No Programmer |date=9 December 2015 }}</ref> Lovelace's notes are important in the early [[history of computers]]. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003|pp=19, 25}} Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.<ref name=ABCL>{{Citation|last=Toole|first=Betty Alexandra|title=Poetical Science|journal=The Byron Journal|volume=15|year=1987|pages=55\u201365|doi=10.3828/bj.1987.6}}.</ref>\n\nShe died of [[uterine cancer]] in 1852 at the age of 36.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Miniature of Ada Byron.jpg|thumb|Ada Byron, aged four]]\n[[Lord Byron]] expected his child to be a \"glorious boy\" and was disappointed when [[Lady Byron]] gave birth to a girl.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=35}} The child was named after Byron's half-sister, [[Augusta Leigh]], and was called \"Ada\" by Byron himself.{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=17}} On 16 January 1816, at Lord Byron's command, Lady Byron left for her parents' home at [[Kirkby Mallory]], taking their five-week-old daughter with her.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=35}} Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights,{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=16}} but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=80}}\n\n[[File:Ada Lovelace child portrait Somerville College.jpg|thumb|Ada Byron, aged seven, by [[Alfred d'Orsay]], 1822, [[Somerville College, Oxford]].]]\nOn 21 April, Lord Byron signed the [[deed of separation]], although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=36\u201338}} Aside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband's immoral behaviour.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=74\u201377}} This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society. She did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.<ref name=\"Turney p. 138\">{{Harvnb|Turney|1972|p=138}}.</ref> Lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=10}}\n\nLovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother. She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=85\u201387}} In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=86}} Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation. Lovelace dubbed these observers the \"Furies\" and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=119}}\n\n[[File:Ada Byron aged seventeen (1832).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Ada Byron, aged seventeen, 1832]]\nLovelace was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.{{Sfn | Stein|1985|p=17}} In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of [[measles]]. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills.\n\n{{Quote|text=When Ada was twelve years old, this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the [[anatomy of birds]] to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, ''Flyology,'' illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".<ref name=ABCL/>}}\n\nAda Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=120\u201321}} Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, [[Allegra Byron|Allegra]], the daughter of Lord Byron and [[Claire Clairmont]]. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]], the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=155}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Adult years===\n[[File:Ada Lovelace portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Watercolour portrait of Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, circa 1840, possibly by [[Alfred Edward Chalon]]]]\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor [[Mary Somerville]], who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=138\u201340}} and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists [[Andrew Crosse]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]]. She was [[debutante|presented at Court]] at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], Byron's friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\".{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=138\u201339}} This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=139}}\n\nOn 8 July 1835, she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William, 8th Baron King]], becoming Lady King.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2744.htm#i27434|title=Hon.

She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]], [[William King (physician)|William King]],<ref name=williamkings group=lower-alpha>William King, her tutor, and William King, her future husband, were not related.</ref> and [[Mary Somerville]], the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician [[Augustus De Morgan]]. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=82}}\n\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying [[differential calculus]], she wrote to De Morgan:\n<blockquote>I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in ''one'' shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar{{Sfn|Toole|1998|p=99}}</blockquote>\nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathsmatical and scientific concepts.

Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=370}} She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=369}} She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.\n\n==Work==\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including [[phrenology]]{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=198}} and [[mesmerism]].{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=232\u201333}} After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\").{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=305}} She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=310\u201314}} In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron [[Karl von Reichenbach]], ''Researches on Magnetism'', but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=315\u201317}} In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=335}}\n\n[[File:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Ada by British painter [[Margaret Sarah Carpenter]] (1836)]]\nLovelace first met [[Charles Babbage]] in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville.

She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do ''whatever we know how to order it'' to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by [[Alan Turing]] in his paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEMYUU_HFMAC&pg=PA67&f=false |journal=The Turing Test: Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |editor=Stuart Shieber |title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence |author=Turing, Alan |pages=67\u2013104 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Taylor]]'s ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian [[Benjamin Woolley]] theorised that: \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her&nbsp;... because of her 'celebrated name'.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=277\u201380}} Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as ''Philosopher's Walk'', as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=307}}\n\n===First computer program===\n[[File:Diagram for the computation of Bernoulli numbers.jpg|thumb|Lovelace's diagram from \"note G\", the first published computer [[algorithm]]]]\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the [[University of Turin]] about his Analytical Engine. [[Luigi Menabrea]], a young Italian engineer and the future [[Prime Minister of Italy]], transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve]] in October 1842.\nBabbage's friend [[Charles Wheatstone]] commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' under the [[initialism]] ''AAL''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Christopher|url=http://www.yorku.ca/christo/papers/Babbage-CogSci.htm|title=Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine, and the Possibility of a 19th-Century Cognitive Science|publisher=York University|year=2001|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAda Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G.

So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation\u2014to general-purpose computation\u2014and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}}</blockquote>\n\n===Controversy over her actual contribution===\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.\n\n[[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan G.

Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence \"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine\u2014something which Babbage never did.\"<ref name=\"Wolfram\">{{cite book|last1=Wolfram|first1=Stephen|title=Idea Makers: Personal Perspectives on the Lives & Ideas of Some Notable People|date=2016|publisher=Wolfram Media|isbn=1579550037|pages=45\u201398}}</ref>\n\n[[Doron Swade]], a specialist on [[history of computing]] known for his work on Babbage, analysed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbage's analytical engine:\n#She was a mathematical genius\n#She made an influential contribution to the analytical engine\n#She was the first computer programmer\n#She was a prophet of the computer age\n\nAccording to him, only the fourth claim had \"any substance at all\". He explained that Ada was only a \"promising beginner\" instead of genius in mathematics, that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it, and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it. But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.<ref>{{cite speech |last=Swade |first=Doron |author-link=Doron Swade |title=Charles Babbage and Difference Engine No. 2 |event=Talks at Google |date=12 May 2008 |location=Mountain View, CA |publisher=Talks at Google via YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K5p_tBcrd0&t=36m29s |access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Ada Lovelace color.svg|thumb|upright|An illustration inspired by the [[A.

She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first [[algorithm]] intended to be carried out by such a machine.

Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived [[insanity]]. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married [[William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King]] in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\n\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as [[Andrew Crosse]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]], contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=234\u2013235}} and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician [[Charles Babbage]], who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, [[Mary Somerville]].\n\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer [[Luigi Menabrea]] on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ''Notes''. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ventana al Conocimiento |url=https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/ada-lovelace-original-and-visionary-but-no-programmer/ |title=Ada Lovelace: Original and Visionary, but No Programmer |date=9 December 2015 }}</ref> Lovelace's notes are important in the early [[history of computers]]. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003|pp=19, 25}} Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.<ref name=ABCL>{{Citation|last=Toole|first=Betty Alexandra|title=Poetical Science|journal=The Byron Journal|volume=15|year=1987|pages=55\u201365|doi=10.3828/bj.1987.6}}.</ref>\n\nShe died of [[uterine cancer]] in 1852 at the age of 36.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Miniature of Ada Byron.jpg|thumb|Ada Byron, aged four]]\n[[Lord Byron]] expected his child to be a \"glorious boy\" and was disappointed when [[Lady Byron]] gave birth to a girl.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=35}} The child was named after Byron's half-sister, [[Augusta Leigh]], and was called \"Ada\" by Byron himself.{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=17}} On 16 January 1816, at Lord Byron's command, Lady Byron left for her parents' home at [[Kirkby Mallory]], taking their five-week-old daughter with her.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=35}} Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights,{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=16}} but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=80}}\n\n[[File:Ada Lovelace child portrait Somerville College.jpg|thumb|Ada Byron, aged seven, by [[Alfred d'Orsay]], 1822, [[Somerville College, Oxford]].]]\nOn 21 April, Lord Byron signed the [[deed of separation]], although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=36\u201338}} Aside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband's immoral behaviour.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=74\u201377}} This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society. She did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.<ref name=\"Turney p. 138\">{{Harvnb|Turney|1972|p=138}}.</ref> Lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=10}}\n\nLovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother. She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=85\u201387}} In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=86}} Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation. Lovelace dubbed these observers the \"Furies\" and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=119}}\n\n[[File:Ada Byron aged seventeen (1832).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Ada Byron, aged seventeen, 1832]]\nLovelace was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.{{Sfn | Stein|1985|p=17}} In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of [[measles]]. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills.\n\n{{Quote|text=When Ada was twelve years old, this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the [[anatomy of birds]] to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, ''Flyology,'' illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".<ref name=ABCL/>}}\n\nAda Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=120\u201321}} Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, [[Allegra Byron|Allegra]], the daughter of Lord Byron and [[Claire Clairmont]]. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]], the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=155}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Adult years===\n[[File:Ada Lovelace portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Watercolour portrait of Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, circa 1840, possibly by [[Alfred Edward Chalon]]]]\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor [[Mary Somerville]], who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=138\u201340}} and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists [[Andrew Crosse]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]]. She was [[debutante|presented at Court]] at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], Byron's friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\".{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=138\u201339}} This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=139}}\n\nOn 8 July 1835, she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William, 8th Baron King]], becoming Lady King.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2744.htm#i27434|title=Hon.

She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]], [[William King (physician)|William King]],<ref name=williamkings group=lower-alpha>William King, her tutor, and William King, her future husband, were not related.</ref> and [[Mary Somerville]], the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician [[Augustus De Morgan]]. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=82}}\n\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying [[differential calculus]], she wrote to De Morgan:\n<blockquote>I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in ''one'' shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar{{Sfn|Toole|1998|p=99}}</blockquote>\nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts.

Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=370}} She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=369}} She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.\n\n==Work==\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including [[phrenology]]{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=198}} and [[mesmerism]].{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=232\u201333}} After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\").{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=305}} She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=310\u201314}} In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron [[Karl von Reichenbach]], ''Researches on Magnetism'', but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=315\u201317}} In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=335}}\n\n[[File:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Ada by British painter [[Margaret Sarah Carpenter]] (1836)]]\nLovelace first met [[Charles Babbage]] in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his [[difference engine]].{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=36\u201338}} She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could.

With the article, she appended a set of notes.{{Sfn|Menabrea|1843}} Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=265}} Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=267}} Her work was well received at the time; the scientist [[Michael Faraday]] described himself as a supporter of her writing.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p = 307}}\n\nThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in ''Note G''),<ref name=\"fourmilab.ch\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html|title=Sketch of ''The Analytical Engine'', with notes upon the Memoir by the Translator|publisher=fourmilab.ch|place=Switzerland|date=October 1842|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of [[Bernoulli numbers]] using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built<ref name=\"adaslegacy\" /> (only Babbage's Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage|title=The Babbage Engine|publisher=Computer History Museum|year=2008}}</ref> Based on this work, Lovelace is now widely considered to be the first computer programmer{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}} and her method is recognised as the world's first computer program.<ref>Gleick, J.

She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do ''whatever we know how to order it'' to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by [[Alan Turing]] in his paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEMYUU_HFMAC&pg=PA67&f=false |journal=The Turing Test: Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |editor=Stuart Shieber |title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence |author=Turing, Alan |pages=67\u2013104 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Taylor]]'s ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian [[Benjamin Woolley]] theorised that: \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her&nbsp;... because of her 'celebrated name'.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=277\u201380}} Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as ''Philosopher's Walk'', as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=307}}\n\n===First computer program===\n[[File:Diagram for the computation of Bernoulli numbers.jpg|thumb|Lovelace's diagram from \"note G\", the first published computer [[algorithm]]]]\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the [[University of Turin]] about his Analytical Engine. [[Luigi Menabrea]], a young Italian engineer and the future [[Prime Minister of Italy]], transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve]] in October 1842.\nBabbage's friend [[Charles Wheatstone]] commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' under the [[initialism]] ''AAL''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Christopher|url=http://www.yorku.ca/christo/papers/Babbage-CogSci.htm|title=Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine, and the Possibility of a 19th-Century Cognitive Science|publisher=York University|year=2001|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAda Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an [[algorithm]] for the Analytical Engine to compute [[Bernoulli number]]s.

In her notes, she wrote:\n{{Quote|[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides ''number'', were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lovelace|first1=Ada|last2=Menabrea|first2=Luigi|title=Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage Esq.|year=1842|journal=[[Scientific Memoirs]]|publisher=Richard Taylor|page=694}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=Rowan|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22385-ada-lovelace-my-brain-is-more-than-merely-mortal.html|title=Ada Lovelace: My brain is more than merely mortal|work=New Scientist|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. [[Walter Isaacson]] ascribes Lovelace's insight regarding the application of computing to ''any'' process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used [[punched cards|punchcards]] to direct the weaving of beautiful [[pattern]]s, it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson\">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/09/18/walter-isaacson-the-women-of-eniac/ |title=Walter Isaacson on the Women of ENIAC |last=Isaacson |first=Walter |date=18 September 2014 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]}}</ref> This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer [[John Graham-Cumming]], whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=2\u20133, 14}}{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=272\u201377}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Kent|first=Leo|url=http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|title=The 10-year-plan to build Babbage's Analytical Engine|publisher=Humans Invent|date=17 September 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014123843/http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|archive-date=14 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist [[Doron Swade]]: <blockquote>Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw\u2014what Ada Byron saw\u2014was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation\u2014to general-purpose computation\u2014and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}}</blockquote>\n\n===Controversy over her actual contribution===\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.\n\n[[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan G.
