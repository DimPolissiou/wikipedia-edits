It is a saprophytic [[fungus]] that primarily resides on plants, soil, straw, and dung. [[Endophyte|Endophytic]] ''C. globosum'' assists in [[cellulose]] decomposition of plant cells.<ref name=germination /> They are found in habitats ranging from forest plants to mountain soils across various biomes.<ref name=hsp /><ref name=thermo /><ref name=book1/> ''C. globosum'' colonies can also be found indoors and on wooden products.<ref name=broad /><ref name=allergy/>\n\n''C. globosum'' are human allergens and opportunistic agents of [[Nail (anatomy)|ungual]] mycosis and neurological infections. However such illnesses occur at low rates.<ref name=allergy/><ref name=onycho/>\n\n== Description ==\n\n===Metabolism===\nLike most ''[[Chaetomium]]'' species, ''C. globosum'' decomposes plant cells using hyphal cellulase activity.<ref name=diff/> Even though they are known to cause soft rot rather than brown rot, ''C. globosum'' plant decomposition leaves behind [[lignin]] residues.<ref name=diff/> They can decay a variety of wood types such as aspen and pine and even change the colour of paper and books.<ref name=diff/> The [[cellulase]] activity of ''C. globosum'' functions best at temperatures ranging from 25-32 degrees Celsius and is stimulated by nitrogen and [[biotin]]. Cellulase is inhibited by ethyl malonate.<ref name=book1/>\n\nLike many fungal species, ''C. globosum'' obtains their energy from carbon sources such as glucose, mannitol and fructose.<ref name=book1 /> [[Fructose]] is usually digested outside the hyphae using fructokinase activity, whereas [[glucose]] enters the cell undigested for [[cellular metabolism]]. Even though glucose is the most preferred carbon source, ''C. globosum'' [[mycelium]] growth occurs at a higher rate when treated with acetate rather than glucose. Carbohydrates can also be stored within the fungus as [[glycogen]] and [[trehalose]] energy reserves.<ref name=book1 />\n\n===Sporulation===\n[[Homothallic]] ''C.globosum'' sexual sporulation produces flat lemon-shaped [[ascospores]] within clavate ascomata. The appearance of ''C.globosum'' fruiting bodies are similar to the [[pycnidia]] of the genus ''[[Pyrenochaeta]]''.<ref name=book2 /> The [[ascomata]] optimally fructify at temperatures ranging from 18-20 degrees Celsius and develop [[ascus|asci]] with 8 ascospores each.<ref name=doctorf/> Additional conditions such as neutral pH, mild levels of [[carbon dioxide]], the presence of calcium ions, and soluble sugar media also assist in the development of fruiting bodies.<ref name=book1/> The soluble sugar media consists of glucose, [[maltose]], [[sucrose]], and cellulose.\n\nSporulation preferably occurs in the dark and at high temperatures around 26 degrees Celsius.<ref name=book1/> The presence of cellulose is also crucial for sporulation. The smooth ascospores are initially red in colour, however upon maturation both the fruiting body and ascospores are [[dematiaceous]].<ref name=thermo/><ref name=rom/> Dark [[perithecia]] with unbrached radiating hairs can be seen as well.<ref name=doctorf/> ''C. globosum'' perithicia are similar in appearance to the related species of ''Chaetomium elatum'', however the latter is distinguished by its branched perithecial hairs.<ref name=rom /> ''C. globosum'' ascospores can withstand temperatures slightly higher than optimal, however temperatures exceeding their thermal death point of 55 degrees Celsius, is lethal for the spores.<ref name=germination/>\n\n===Germination===\nAscospores germinate by releasing globose vesicles from their apical germ pores which later develop into germ tubes. The germ tubes then grow into hyaline septate hyphae.<ref name=doctorf/> Filamentous irregular hyphal growth allows the colony to spread and develop into pale aerial mycelium.<ref name=rom/><ref name=spanish/> Hyphal growth increases the diameter of the fungal colony which is often a parameter for fungal growth.<ref name=germination /> According to Domsch et al., ''C. globosum'' species are fast growing colonies and can grow up to 5.5&nbsp;cm in diameter over a period of 10 days.<ref name=book1 /> \nThe germination of ascospores can be inhibited by [[tannin]] and species of ''[[Streptomyces]]''. On the other hand, germination is stimulated by glucose. Glucose deprivation can result in reduced levels of germination.<ref name=germination /><ref name=book1 />\n\n== Pathology ==\n\n=== Indoor Allergen ===\n''C. globosum'' can be commonly found contaminating damp buildings throughout North America and Europe.<ref name=canada/> Approximately 10-30% of North American homes contain moisture induced molds.<ref name=allergy/> This poses a health concern due to the allergic nature of these fungi.<ref name=diff/> Both the ''C. globosum'' hyphae and the spores contain antigens such as Chg45, to induce IgE and IgG antibody production in allergic individuals. Although the IgE upsurge is transient, increased IgG levels persist in the serum.<ref name=allergy/> This can lead to non-atopic asthma, sinusitis, and respiratory illnesses in the residents of contaminated buildings.<ref name=allergy/><ref name=canada/> Such allergic onsets can be prevented with the use of potassium chlorate in building materials. [[Chlorate]], toxic to many fungal strains, disrupts nitrate reduction in fungi by using fungal nitrate reductase to produce the toxic chlorite. Although it is unclear as to whether ''C. globosum'' contains nitrate reductase, chlorate is still a well known ''C. globosum'' toxin. However, even though chlorate suppresses perithecia formation, it does not affect hyphal growth nor sporulation.<ref name=diff/>\n\n''C. globosum'' colonies are potential [[allergens]], and when residing on damp buildings, they are usually the casual agents of poor indoor air quality.<ref name=diff/><ref name=spanish/> Colonies can be detected on wet building wood and also on tiles. Even though spores are usually not detected in the air, inhalation can trigger allergic response and respiratory illnesses.<ref name=diff/><ref name=growth/><ref name=canada/>\n\n=== Onychomycosis ===\nAlthough ''C. globosum'' are [[Saprotroph|saprophytes]], they can cause opportunistic human [[onychomycosis]] and cutaneous infections. Such non-dermatophytic species are responsible for a small percentage of onychomycosis cases.<ref name=spanish/> Nonetheless, such pathology is rare in humans. The first well known case of ''C. globosum'' onychomycosis appeared in Korea where the patient developed [[hyperkeratosis]] of the nails. The disease symptoms were cured with antifungal [[terbinafine]] and amorolfine treatment.<ref name=onycho/> Amphotercin B is ineffective towards pathogenic species of the Chaetomium genus.<ref name=phae/>\n\nCerebral and pulmonary infections due to Chaetomium species are not uncommon. They are known to cause superficial mycoses in immunocompromised patients.<ref name=spanish/> ''C. globosum'' can induce [[petechia]] and skin lesions, as well as phaeohyphomycosis and brain abscess. The latter diseases are very rare.<ref name=phae/> In one case, an immunocompromised renal transplant patient developed fatal brain abscess due to a ''C. globosum'' infection. It was unclear as to how the strain disseminated to the brain.<ref name=cerebral/> To identify the pathogen, infected tissue was treated with KOH. The resultant displayed septate dark hyphae, characteristic of ''C. globosum''.<ref name=phae/>\n\n=== Mycotoxins ===\n''C. globosum'' produce [[emodin]]s, [[chrysophanol]]s, chaetoglobosins A, B, C D, E and F, as well as chetomins, and the azaphilones, chaetoviridins. Chetomins induce mammalian and gram positive bacterial toxicity.<ref name=book1 /><ref name=alka/> This allows plants infected with ''C.globosum'' to resist bacterial diseases. The [[cytochalasin]] mycotoxins, chaetoglobosins A and C, disrupt cellular division and movement in mammalian cells. These cytochalasins bind to [[actin]] and affect actin polymerization. In fact, chaetoglobosin A is highly toxic in animal cells, even at minimal doses.<ref name=growth />\n\nThe [[mycotoxins]] benefit ''C. globosum'' colonies by assisting their growth. This usually occurs at neutral pH when the mycotoxins are produced at optimal levels.<ref name=onycho /><ref name=growth />\n\nMycotoxic chaetoviridins, are known to suppress tumor formation in mice treated with ''C. globosum''.<ref name=aza/> Their cytotoxic activity disrupts cancer cells.<ref name=alka/><ref name=cyto/> Understanding the role of such mycotoxins could lead to novel drug applications.<ref name=aza/>\n\n== Agricultural use ==\n''C. globosum'' are endophytic to many plants. Their asymptomatic colonization supports plant tolerance to metal toxicity.<ref name=maize/> Heavy metals such as copper, suppress plant growth and disrupt metabolic processes, e.g. photosynthesis. When maize plants were treated with ''C. globosum'', they expressed less growth inhibition and increased biomass.<ref name=maize/> ''C. globosum'' is also known to reside in ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'' plants.<ref name=alka/> Such plants use this endophytic fungus to suppress bacterial pathogens. In fact, ascospore inoculation reduces bacterial disease symptoms such as wilting, apple scabs, and seed blight in treated plants.<ref name=plant/> Enhancing plant stress tolerance and microbial defense, renders ''C. globosum'' application beneficial for agricultural use.<ref name=maize/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=broad>[http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/chaetomium_globosum.2/GenomeDescriptions.html \"www.broadinstitute.org\"] Retrieved on 17 October 2014.</ref>\n\n<ref name=hsp>Liu, Z.; Yang, Q.; Ma, J.

This is also representative of Fernando Ortiz's concept of [[transculturation]].

She demonstrated this concept of dualism in her project \"Loteria.\" By using images of the well known Mexican card game, she projected these images on the naked bodies of her New York friends and loved ones. This is also representative of Fernando Ortiz's concept of [[transculturation]]. By using the images of \"Loteria\" onto the human bodies of New York residents, she demonstrates how culture [[counter-flows]] through people's migration patterns, which is a form of [[cultural remittances]].\n\n== Awards ==\n2012 -

A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the United States), 1G1 represents [[Chevrolet]] passenger cars; 1G2, [[Pontiac]] passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet [[truck]]s.\n\nThe [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) in the US assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.<ref name=ISO3780>{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/45844.html |title=ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles \u2013 World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code |publisher=[[ISO]] |date=2009-10-05 |access-date=2010-09-27}}</ref>\n\nThe first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of ''W0L'' because Adam Opel AG is based in R\u00fcsselsheim, Germany).\n\nIn the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number. For example, 8X\u201382 denotes the range 8X, 8Y, 8Z, 81, 82, excluding 80.<ref name=ISO3780/>\n\n====Country or region codes====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''A\u2013H = [[Africa]]'''\n!'''J\u2013R = [[Asia]]'''\n!'''S\u2013Z = [[Europe]]'''\n!'''1\u20135 = [[North America]]'''\n!'''6\u20137 = [[Oceania]]'''\n!'''8\u20139 = [[South America]]'''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n'''AA-AH'''\tSouth Africa<br>\n'''AJ-AN'''\tCote d'Ivoire<br>\n'''AP-A0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''BA-BE'''\tAngola<br>\n'''BF-BK'''\tKenya<br>\n'''BL-BR'''\tTanzania<br>\n'''BS-B0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''CA-CE'''\tBenin<br>\n'''CF-CK'''\tMadagascar<br>\n'''CL-CR'''\tTunisia<br>\n'''CS-C0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''DA-DE'''\tEgypt<br>\n'''DF-DK'''\tMorocco<br>\n'''DL-DR'''\tZambia<br>\n'''DS-D0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''EA-EE'''\tEthiopia<br>\n'''EF-EK'''\tMozambique<br>\n'''EL-E0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''FA-FE'''\tGhana<br>\n'''FF-FK'''\tNigeria<br>\n'''FL-F0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''GA-G0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''HA-H0'''\tunassigned<br>\n|\n'''J'''\t    Japan<br>\n'''KA-KE'''\tSri Lanka<br>\n'''KF-KK'''\tIsrael<br>\n'''KL-KR'''\tKorea (South)<br>\n'''KS-K0'''\tKazakhstan<br>\n'''L'''\t    China (Mainland)<br>\n'''MA-ME,MZ'''\tIndia<br>\n'''MF-MK'''\tIndonesia<br>\n'''ML-MR'''\tThailand<br>\n'''MS-M0'''\tMyanmar<br>\n'''NA-NE'''\tIran<br>\n'''NF-NK'''\tPakistan<br>\n'''NL-NR'''\tTurkey<br>\n'''NS-N0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''PA-PE'''\tPhilippines<br>\n'''PF-PK'''\tSingapore<br>\n'''PL-PR'''\tMalaysia<br>\n'''PS-P0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''RA-RE'''\tUnited Arab Emirates<br>\n'''RF-RK'''\tTaiwan<br>\n'''RL-RR'''\tVietnam<br>\n'''RS-R0'''\tSaudi Arabia<br>\n|\n'''SA-SM'''\tUnited Kingdom<br>\n'''SN-ST'''\tGermany <small>(formerly East Germany)</small><br>\n'''SU-SZ'''\tPoland<br>\n'''S1-S4'''\tLatvia<br>\n'''S5-S0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''TA-TH'''\tSwitzerland<br>\n'''TJ-TP'''\tCzech Republic<br>\n'''TR-TV'''\tHungary<br>\n'''TW-T1'''\tPortugal<br>\n'''T2-T0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''UA-UG''' unassigned<br>\n'''UH-UM''' Denmark<br>\n'''UN-UT'''\tIreland<br>\n'''UU-UZ'''\tRomania<br>\n'''U1-U4'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''U5-U7'''\tSlovakia<br>\n'''U8-U0'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''VA-VE'''\tAustria<br>\n'''VF-VR'''\tFrance<br>\n'''VS-VW''' Spain<br>\n'''VX-V2'''\tSerbia<br>\n'''V3-V5'''\tCroatia<br>\n'''V6-V0'''\tEstonia<br>\n'''W''' Germany <small>(formerly West Germany)</small><br>\n'''XA-XE'''\tBulgaria<br>\n'''XF-XK'''\tGreece<br>\n'''XL-XR'''\tNetherlands<br>\n'''XS-XW''' Russia <small>(former USSR)</small><br>\n'''XX-X2'''\tLuxembourg<br>\n'''X3-X0'''\tRussia<br>\n'''YA-YE'''\tBelgium<br>\n'''YF-YK'''\tFinland<br>\n'''YL-YR'''\tMalta<br>\n'''YS-YW''' Sweden<br>\n'''YX-Y2'''\tNorway<br>\n'''Y3-Y5'''\tBelarus<br>\n'''Y6-Y0'''\tUkraine<br>\n'''ZA-ZR'''\tItaly<br>\n'''ZS-ZW''' unassigned<br>\n'''ZX-Z2'''\tSlovenia<br>\n'''Z3-Z5'''\tLithuania<br>\n'''Z6-Z0'''\tunassigned<br>\n|\n'''1, 4, or 5''' United States<br>\n'''2''' Canada<br>\n'''3A-3W'''\tMexico<br>\n'''3X-37''' Costa Rica<br>\n'''38-39''' Cayman Islands<br>\n'''30'''\tunassigned<br>\n|\n'''6'''\tAustralia<br>\n'''7'''\tNew Zealand<br>\n|\n'''8A-8E'''\tArgentina<br>\n'''8F-8K'''\tChile<br>\n'''8L-8R'''\tEcuador<br>\n'''8S-8W'''\tPeru<br>\n'''8X-82'''\tVenezuela<br>\n'''82-82'''\tBolivia<br>\n'''83-80'''\tunassigned<br>\n'''9A-9E'''\tBrazil<br>\n'''9F-9K'''\tColombia<br>\n'''9L-9R'''\tParaguay<br>\n'''9S-9W'''\tUruguay<br>\n'''9X-92'''\tTrinidad & Tobago<br>\n'''93\u201399'''\tBrazil<br>\n'''90'''\tunassigned<br>\n|}\n\n===Vehicle descriptor section===\nThe fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the [[automobile platform]] used, the model, and the [[car body styles|body style]]. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette]], U is for a 6.0-liter [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, and E is for a 7.0&nbsp;L V8.\n\n====North American check digits====\nOne element that is inconsistent is the use of position nine as a [[#Check-digit calculation|check digit]], compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, but not Europe.\n\n===Vehicle identifier section===\nThe 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS). This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In North America, the last five digits must be numeric.\n\n====Model year encoding====\nOne consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit, which is required worldwide to encode the [[#Model year encoding|model year]] of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the [[model year]] code. The year code is the model year for the vehicle.\n\nThe year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], as \"A\" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the \"A\" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that \"Y\" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:\n* The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.\n* In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980\u20132009.{{Citation needed|reason=Seems wrong as e.g. a 2013 Volvo V60 has YV1xxx7xxDxxxxxxx|date=May 2017}} If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010\u20132039.\n* The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1\u20138 and 10 that were assigned from 1980\u20132009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.\n\n====Plant code====\nCompulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the assembly plant at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.\n\n====Production number====\nIn the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.\n\n==Check-digit calculation==\nA check-digit validation is used for all road vehicles sold in the United States and Canada.\n\nWhen trying to validate a VIN with a [[check digit]], first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see [[#Weights used in calculation|below]]) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0\u20139, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs <tt>5GZCZ43D13S812715</tt> (correct with leading five) and <tt>SGZCZ43D13S812715</tt> (incorrect with leading character \"S\"). The VINs in the Porsche image, <tt>WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124</tt>, and the GM-T body image, <tt>KLATF08Y1VB363636</tt>, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.\n\n===Transliterating the numbers===\nTransliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's [[EBCDIC]]) are in the following chart. ''I'', ''O'', and ''Q'' are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with ''N/A'' (''not applicable''). Numerical digits use their own values.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Transliteration key:&nbsp;values for VIN decoding\n|'''A''': 1 ||'''B''': 2 ||'''C''': 3 ||'''D''': 4 ||'''E''': 5 ||'''F''': 6 ||'''G''': 7 ||'''H''': 8 ||'''I''': {{n/a}}\n|-\n|'''J''': 1 ||'''K''': 2 ||'''L''': 3 ||'''M''': 4 ||'''N''': 5 ||'''O''': {{n/a}} ||'''P''': 7 ||'''Q''': {{n/a}} ||'''R''': 9\n|-\n|{{n/a}} ||'''S''': 2 ||'''T''': 3 ||'''U''': 4 ||'''V''': 5 || '''W''': 6||'''X''': 7 ||'''Y''': 8 || '''Z''': 9\n|}\n\n''S'' is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.\n\n===Weights used in calculation===\nThe following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+style=\"white-space:nowrap\"| Weight factor table\n|-\n!Position\n||1||2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9||10||11||12||13||14||15||16||17\n|-\n!Weight\n||8||7||6||5||4||3||2||10||{{no2}}0||9||8||7||6||5||4||3||2\n|}\n\n===Worked example===\nConsider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be the check digit.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;font-family:monospace\"\n|-\n!VIN\n||1||M||8||G||D||M||9||A|| ||K||P||0||4||2||7||8||8\n|-\n!Value\n||1||4||8||7||4||4||9||1||0||2||7||0||4||2||7||8||8\n|-\n!Weight\n||8||7||6||5||4||3||2||10||0||9||8||7||6||5||4||3||2\n|-\n!Products\n||8&nbsp;||28||48||35||16||12||18||10||0&nbsp;||18||56||0&nbsp;||24||10||28||24||16\n|}\n\n# The VIN's value is calculated from the above transliteration table. This number is used in the rest of the calculation.\n# Copy the ''weights'' from the above weight factor table.\n# The ''products'' row is the result of the multiplication of the vertical columns: ''Value'' and ''Weight.''\n# The products (8, 28, 48, 35 ... 24, 16) are all added together to yield a sum, ''351''.\n# Find the remainder after dividing by 11<br/>351 [[modulo operation|MOD]] 11 = 10<br/>351 \u00f7 11 = 31 <sup>'''10'''</sup>/<sub>11</sub>\n# The remainder is the check digit. If the remainder is 10, the check digit is X. In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as ''X''.\n\nWith a check digit of ''X'', the VIN <tt>1M8GDM9A_KP042788</tt> is written <tt>1M8GDM9A''X''KP042788</tt>.\n\nA VIN with ''straight-ones'' (seventeen consecutive ''1''s) has the nice feature that its check digit ''1'' matches the calculated value ''1''. This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder {{frac|1|11}}; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.\n\n\n==VIN scanning==\nVIN is printed on locations like bottom corner of the windshield on the driver\u2019s side, under the bonnet next to latch, the front end of the vehicle frame and inside the door pillar on the driver\u2019s side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.gapless.app/en/blog/what-is-a-vin-why-its-important-to-know-your-cars-vehicle-identification-number/|title=What is a VIN?

A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the United States), 1G1 represents [[Chevrolet]] passenger cars; 1G2, [[Pontiac]] passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet [[truck]]s.\n\nThe [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) in the US assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.<ref name=ISO3780>{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/45844.html |title=ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles \u2013 World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code |publisher=[[ISO]] |date=2009-10-05 |access-date=2010-09-27}}</ref>\n\nThe first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of ''W0L'' because Adam Opel AG is based in R\u00fcsselsheim, Germany).\n\nIn the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number.

This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the [[automobile platform]] used, the model, and the [[car body styles|body style]]. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette]], U is for a 6.0-liter [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, and E is for a 7.0&nbsp;L V8.\n\n====North American check digits====\nOne element that is inconsistent is the use of position nine as a [[#Check-digit calculation|check digit]], compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, but not Europe.\n\n===Vehicle identifier section===\nThe 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS). This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In North America, the last five digits must be numeric.\n\n====Model year encoding====\nOne consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit, which is required worldwide to encode the [[#Model year encoding|model year]] of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the [[model year]] code. The year code is the model year for the vehicle.\n\nThe year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], as \"A\" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the \"A\" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that \"Y\" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:\n* The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.\n* In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980\u20132009.{{Citation needed|reason=Seems wrong as e.g. a 2013 Volvo V60 has YV1xxx7xxDxxxxxxx|date=May 2017}} If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010\u20132039.\n* The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1\u20138 and 10 that were assigned from 1980\u20132009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.\n\n====Plant code====\nCompulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the assembly plant at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.\n\n====Production number====\nIn the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.\n\n==Check-digit calculation==\nA check-digit validation is used for all road vehicles sold in the United States and Canada.\n\nWhen trying to validate a VIN with a [[check digit]], first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see [[#Weights used in calculation|below]]) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0\u20139, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs <tt>5GZCZ43D13S812715</tt> (correct with leading five) and <tt>SGZCZ43D13S812715</tt> (incorrect with leading character \"S\"). The VINs in the Porsche image, <tt>WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124</tt>, and the GM-T body image, <tt>KLATF08Y1VB363636</tt>, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.\n\n===Transliterating the numbers===\nTransliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's [[EBCDIC]]) are in the following chart. ''I'', ''O'', and ''Q'' are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with ''N/A'' (''not applicable''). Numerical digits use their own values.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Transliteration key:&nbsp;values for VIN decoding\n|'''A''': 1 ||'''B''': 2 ||'''C''': 3 ||'''D''': 4 ||'''E''': 5 ||'''F''': 6 ||'''G''': 7 ||'''H''': 8 ||'''I''': {{n/a}}\n|-\n|'''J''': 1 ||'''K''': 2 ||'''L''': 3 ||'''M''': 4 ||'''N''': 5 ||'''O''': {{n/a}} ||'''P''': 7 ||'''Q''': {{n/a}} ||'''R''': 9\n|-\n|{{n/a}} ||'''S''': 2 ||'''T''': 3 ||'''U''': 4 ||'''V''': 5 || '''W''': 6||'''X''': 7 ||'''Y''': 8 || '''Z''': 9\n|}\n\n''S'' is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.\n\n===Weights used in calculation===\nThe following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit.

In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as ''X''.\n\nWith a check digit of ''X'', the VIN <tt>1M8GDM9A_KP042788</tt> is written <tt>1M8GDM9A''X''KP042788</tt>.\n\nA VIN with ''straight-ones'' (seventeen consecutive ''1''s) has the nice feature that its check digit ''1'' matches the calculated value ''1''. This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder {{frac|1|11}}; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.\n\n\n==VIN scanning==\nVIN is printed on locations like bottom corner of the windshield on the driver\u2019s side, under the bonnet next to latch, the front end of the vehicle frame and inside the door pillar on the driver\u2019s side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.gapless.app/en/blog/what-is-a-vin-why-its-important-to-know-your-cars-vehicle-identification-number/|title=What is a VIN?

He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Position of the US government ==\nIn the wake of the apartment bombings president [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], secretary of defense [[William Cohen|Cohen]] and secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright|Albright]] have condemned the bombings as acts of terrorism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-106shrg61866/html/CHRG-106shrg61866.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 17, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Radio Remarks on Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1999-book2/html/PPP-1999-book2-doc-pg1555.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 18, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffman |first1=David |authorlink1=David E.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Position of the US government ==\nIn the wake of the apartment bombings president [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], secretary of defense [[William Cohen|Cohen]] and secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright|Albright]] have condemned the bombings as acts of terrorism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-106shrg61866/html/CHRG-106shrg61866.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 17, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Radio Remarks on Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1999-book2/html/PPP-1999-book2-doc-pg1555.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 18, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffman |first1=David |authorlink1=David E.

Billington]] referred to Prokhanov's novel as a continuation of a downward spiral in the Russian literature of the time. The plot of ''Mr. Hexogen'' has been likened to a nested doll of conspiracies within conspiracies. According to the plot, the apartment bombings have been staged by KGB agents, probably at the behest of the Jewish oligarchs, whose ultimate goal was to take power and move Russians to the Arctic while selling the organs of the healthy to Israel. Billington described the book as a \"merciless, anti-Semitic, surrealistic gloss on Moscow politics in the 1990s\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Billington |first1=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself | authorlink = James H.
