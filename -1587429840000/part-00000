The title character was played on the radio show by [[George Seaton]], [[Earle Graser]], and [[Brace Beemer]].<ref name=LATimes/> [[Clayton Moore]] portrayed the Lone Ranger on television, although during a contract dispute, Moore was replaced temporarily by [[John Hart (actor)|John Hart]], who wore a different style of mask. On the radio, Tonto was played by, among others, [[John Todd (actor)|John Todd]] and Roland Parker; and in the television series, by [[Jay Silverheels]], who was a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] from the Six Nations Indian Reserve in [[Ontario]], Canada.\n\n==Origin==\nThe Lone Ranger is the sole survivor of a group of six ambushed [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lachno |first=James |title=The Lone Ranger: 10 things you never knew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/8552851/The-Lone-Ranger-10-things-you-never-knew.html |date=June 2, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> While details differ, the basic story of the Lone Ranger's origin is consistent in most versions of the franchise.<ref name=LATimes/> A posse of six members of the [[Texas Ranger Division]], led by Captain Dan Reid, pursued a band of outlaws led by Bartholomew \"Butch\" Cavendish, but are betrayed by a civilian guide named Collins, who was secretly working with Cavendish, and led the unsuspecting rangers into an ambush at the canyon known as Bryant's Gap.<ref name=\"Enter the Lone Ranger\"/> Later, a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] named Tonto stumbles onto the grisly scene. He discovers one of the rangers, Captain Reid's younger brother, John, barely alive, and he nurses the man to health. In some versions, Tonto recognizes the lone survivor as the man who had saved his life when they both were children. According to the television series, Tonto gave John a ring and the name [[Ke-mo sah-bee|Kemo Sabe]], which he said means \"trusty scout\".<ref>''The Lone Ranger'', \"Pilot Episode\"</ref> John Reid then tells Tonto that he intends to hunt down Cavendish and his men and to bring them to justice. To conceal his identity and honor his fallen brother, John fashions a black [[domino mask]] using cloth from his late brother's vest. To aid in the deception, Tonto digs a sixth grave and places at its head a cross bearing John Reid's name so that Cavendish and his gang will believe that all the Rangers had been killed.\n\nIn many versions, Reid continues fighting for justice as the Lone Ranger even after the Cavendish gang is captured.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Lone Ranger===\nAs generally depicted, the Lone Ranger conducts himself by a strict moral code based on that put in place by Striker at the inception of the character.  It read:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nI believe that to have a friend,\na man must be one.\n\nThat all men are created equal\nand that everyone has within himself\nthe power to make this a better world.\n\nThat God put the firewood there\nbut that every man\nmust gather and light it himself.\n\nIn being prepared\nphysically, mentally, and morally\nto fight when necessary\nfor what is right.\n\nThat a man should make the most\nof what equipment he has.\n\nThat 'this government, \nof the people, by the people\nand for the people'\nshall live always.\n\nThat men should live by\nthe rule of what is best\nfor the greatest number.\n\nThat sooner or later...\nsomewhere...somehow...\nwe must settle with the world\nand make payment for what we have taken.\n\nThat all things change but truth,\nand that truth alone, lives on forever.\n\nIn my Creator, my country, my fellow man.<ref name=\"npr.org\">{{cite web |title= The Lone Ranger: Justice from Outside the Law |publisher=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18073741 |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn addition, Fran Striker and George W. Trendle drew up the following guidelines that embody who and what the Lone Ranger is:<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lone Ranger: F.A.Q. |url=http://weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com/loneranger/faq.html |website=Weird Science-Fantasy Web Links |accessdate=July 1, 2015}}</ref>\n* The Lone Ranger was never seen without his mask or some sort of disguise.\n* He was never captured or held for any length of time by lawmen, avoiding his being unmasked.\n* He always used perfect grammar and precise speech devoid of slang and colloquialisms.\n* Whenever he was forced to use guns, he never shot to kill, but instead tried to disarm his opponent as painlessly as possible.\n* He was never put in a hopeless situation; e.g., he was never seen escaping from a barrage of gunfire merely by fleeing toward the horizon.\n* He rarely referred to himself as the Lone Ranger. If someone's suspicion were aroused, either the Lone Ranger would present one of his silver bullets to confirm his identity or someone else would attest on his behalf; the latter happened at the end of most episodes when someone would ask \"Who ''was'' that masked man?\" as the Lone Ranger departed. His decision to adopt the moniker of Lone Ranger was inspired by Tonto: following the ambush at Bryant's Gap, Tonto observed him to be the only ranger left\u2014in other words, he was the \"lone\" ranger.\n* Even though the Lone Ranger offered his aid to individuals or small groups facing powerful adversaries, the ultimate objective of his story always implied that their benefit was only a by-product of the development of the West or the country.\n* Adversaries were rarely other than American, to avoid criticism from minority groups. There were some exceptions to this rule. He sometimes battled foreign agents, though their nation of origin was generally not named. An exception was his having helped the Mexican [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] against French troops of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]], as occurred in the radio episodes \"Supplies for Juarez\" (18 September 1939), \"Hunted by Legionnaires\" (20 September 1939) and \"Lafitte's Reinforcements\" (22 September 1939).\n* The names of unsympathetic characters were carefully chosen so that they never consisted of two names if it could be avoided. More often than not, a single nickname or surname was selected.\n* The Lone Ranger never drank or smoked; and saloon scenes were usually shown as cafes, with waiters and food instead of bartenders and liquor.\n* Criminals were never shown in enviable positions of wealth or power, and they were never successful or glamorous.\n\n==== The Lone Ranger's first name ====\nAlthough the Lone Ranger's last name in the radio shows was given as Reid, his first name was never specified in any of the radio or television shows. Various radio reference books, beginning with ''Radio's Golden Age'' (Eastern Valley Press, 1966), give the Lone Ranger's first name as John.<ref>Frank Buxton and Bill Owen, ''Radio's Golden Age: The Programs and the Personalities'' ([New York]: Easton Valley Press, 1966): 209.</ref> Some cite the 20th anniversary radio program in 1953 as the source of the name, but the Lone Ranger's first name is never mentioned in that episode.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=20th Anniversary Show |url=http://www.lonerangerfanclub.com/media/20th_Anniversary_Show.mp3 |website=Lonerangerfanclub.com |type=MP3 |access-date=July 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the final chapter of the 1938 Republic ''[[The Lone Ranger (serial)|The Lone Ranger]]'' movie serial, he is revealed to be Texas Ranger Allen King. In the second serial, ''[[The Lone Ranger Rides Again]]'', he identifies himself as \"Bill Andrews\".\n\nThe Lone Ranger's first name is also thought to have not been mentioned in contemporary Lone Ranger newspaper comics, comic books, and tie-in [[radio premium|premiums]], though some have stated that the name John Reid was used in an illustration of the grave marker made by Tonto which appeared in either a comic book version of the character's origin story or in a children's record set.\n\nThe name John Reid is used in the 1981 film ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]''. The Lone Ranger is also John Reid in [[Dynamite Entertainment]]'s licensed Lone Ranger [[comic book]] series that began in 2006 and in the 2013 Disney film ''The Lone Ranger''.\n\nThe name \"Luke Hartman\" was used in the 2003 TV-movie/unsold series pilot.\n\n===Tonto===\n{{Main|Tonto}}\n\nThe character made his initial appearance in the 11th episode of the radio show. Fran Striker told his son that Tonto was added so the Lone Ranger would have someone to talk to.<ref name=\"npr.org\"/> He was named by [[James Jewell]], who also came up with the term \"Kemosabe\" based on the name of a summer camp owned by his father-in-law in upstate Michigan. In the local Native American language, \"Tonto\" meant \"wild one\".<ref name=vanhise16-18>Van Hise, James, ''Who was that Masked Man? The Story of the Lone Ranger\" (Pioneer Books, Las Vegas, 1990), pp. 16\u201318.</ref>\n\nThe character spoke in broken English that emphasized Tonto had learned it as a second language.\n\nBecause {{wiktspa|tonto}} means \"stupid\" or \"ignorant\" in Spanish, the character is renamed \"{{wiktspa|toro|Toro}}\" (Spanish for \"bull\") or \"{{wiktspa|ponto|Ponto}}\" in Spanish-speaking countries.<ref name=vanhise16-18 />\n\n===Dan Reid Jr.===\nThe name of Captain Reid's son, the Lone Ranger's nephew, a character introduced in the radio series in 1942, who became a juvenile sidekick to the Masked Man, is Dan Reid. When Trendle and Striker later created ''[[The Green Hornet]]'' in 1936, they made this Dan Reid the father of Britt Reid, alias the Green Hornet, thereby making the Lone Ranger the Green Hornet's great-uncle.<ref>Jim Harmon, ''The Great Radio Heroes'', Doubleday,1967</ref> Throughout ''The Lone Ranger'' radio series, Dan was played by Ernest Winstanley, Bob Martin, Clarence Weitzel, [[James Lipton]] and [[Dick Beals]].\n\nThe Lone Ranger's nephew made his first appearance in \"Heading North\" (December 14, 1942) under the name \"Dan Frisby\", the grandson of Grandma Frisby. The two lived in an area described as \"the high border country of the northwest\" near the town of Martinsville close to the Canada\u2013US border. This and the following four episodes (\"Design for Murder\", December 16, 1942; \"Rope's End\", December 18, 1942; \"Law of the Apex\", December 21, 1942; and \"Dan's Strange Behavior\", December 23, 1942) centred on a plot to steal the valuable Martin Copper Mine and Dan's being fooled by a Lone Ranger impostor into helping him steal it. The Lone Ranger and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mounties]] foil the plot and capture the impostor and his gang.\n\nIn the final episode of the arc, \"A Nephew Is Found\" (December 25, 1942), the dying Grandma Frisby reveals to The Lone Ranger Dan's true identity and how he came to be with her. Fifteen years previously, Grandma Frisby had been part of a wagon train travelling to [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]]. Also on that wagon train had been Linda Reid, wife of Texas Ranger Captain Dan Reid, and her six-month-old son Dan Jr., who were travelling from their home in Virginia to join her husband. Before the wagon train could reach Fort Laramie, Indians attacked it and Linda Reid was among those killed. Grandma Frisby took charge and care of Dan Jr., but upon reaching Fort Laramie found two messages waiting: one that Captain Reid (voiced in this story by [[Al Hodge]]) had been killed in an ambush at Bryant's Gap and the other that her own husband had been killed in an explosion. Taking Dan and certain items concerning his identity (including a small gold locket containing a picture of Dan's parents and a picture of Captain Reid's brother), Grandma Frisby travelled to Martinsville and raised Dan as her grandson.\n\nOn hearing this story, The Lone Ranger reveals his true identity and his own story to Grandma Frisby and promises that he will care for Dan like his own son. Before Grandma Frisby dies, The Lone Ranger removes his mask and lets her see his face. Her last words are \"Ride on, Lone Ranger ... ride on forever ... with Danny at your side.\" The Lone Ranger takes the grieving Dan outside the cabin, gives him the locket and reveals their true relationship. Dan Reid Jr. would go on to be a recurring character throughout the remainder of the series, riding with The Lone Ranger and Tonto on his own horse Victor.\n\nEventually, Dan Reid Jr. would be sent East to gain an education, making infrequent appearances on the series whenever [[Fran Striker]] wanted to remind the audience of the family connection, and would later become part of ''[[The Green Hornet (radio series)|The Green Hornet]]'' radio series, first appearing on October 22, 1936, establishing the connection between The Lone Ranger and The Green Hornet in the episode \"Too Hot to Handle\" (November 11, 1947) and being played throughout the series by John Todd, who played \"Tonto\" on ''The Lone Ranger'' radio series.\n\n===Their horses===\nAccording to the episode \"The Legend of Silver\" (September 30, 1938), before acquiring Silver, the Lone Ranger rode a chestnut mare called Dusty. The Lone Ranger saves Silver's life from an enraged buffalo and, in gratitude, Silver chooses to give up his wild life to carry him.\n\nThe origin of Tonto's horse, Scout, is less clear. For a long time, Tonto rides a white horse called White Feller. In \"Four Day Ride\" (August 5, 1938), Tonto is given a [[American Paint Horse|paint horse]] by his friend Chief Thundercloud, who then takes White Feller. Tonto rides this horse and refers to him simply as \"Paint Horse\" for several episodes. The horse is finally named Scout in \"Border Dope Smuggling\" (September 2, 1938). In another episode, however, the Lone Ranger, in a surge of conscience, releases Silver back to the wild. The episode ends with Silver returning, bringing along a companion who becomes Tonto's horse Scout.\n\nIn an echo of the Lone Ranger's line, Tonto frequently says, \"Git-um up, Scout!\" (The phrase became so well embedded in the Lone Ranger mythos that [[International Harvester]] used it as an advertising line to promote their [[International Harvester Scout|Scout]] [[utility vehicle]] in the 1970s.) In the [[The Lone Ranger (1966 TV series)|Format Films animated cartoon which ran from 1966 to 1968]], Tonto also had an eagle he called Taka, and installments that focused exclusively on him or had him team up with the Lone Ranger ended with his saying, '''''\"Fly,''''' Taka! ''On,'' Scout!\" (Those where he teamed with the Lone Ranger had the Ranger following this up with the customary \"Hi-yo, '''''Silver!''''' Away!\")\n\n==Original radio series==\nThe first of 2,956 radio episodes of ''The Lone Ranger'' premiered on [[WXYT (AM)|WXYZ]], a radio station serving [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], on January 30, 1933<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-lone-ranger-debuts-on-detroit-radio |title=Jan 30, 1933: The Lone Ranger debuts on Detroit radio |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History.com]] |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> or January 31, 1933.<ref name=dunning407 /> As Dunning writes in ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio:''\n\n{{quote|There may have been a few late-night on-air shakedown shows prior to the official January 31, 1933 premiere date.

Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, when from out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!</blockquote>\n\nBy the time it was on ABC at 7:30 pm Eastern Time, the introduction, voiced by [[Fred Foy]], had become \"Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear\", followed by, \"From out of the west with the speed of light and a hearty 'Hi-yo, Silver!{{' \"}} The intro was later changed to:\n\n<blockquote>\nA fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! ... With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early western United States! Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice! Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear! From out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!</blockquote>\n\nThis was followed by Brace Beemer's voice, declaring, \"Come on, Silver! Let's go, big fellow! Hi-yo, Silver! Away!\"\n\n=== Cast ===\nThe Lone Ranger was played by several actors:\n* John L. Barrett, on test broadcasts on [[WDCZ|WEBR]] in January 1933;\n* [[George Seaton]] (under the name George Stenius) (January 31 \u2013 May 9, 1933);\n* Series director [[James Jewell]], for one episode;\n* An actor known only by the pseudonym \"Jack Deeds\", for one episode;\n* [[Earle Graser]] (May 16, 1933 \u2013 April 7, 1941). On April 8, Graser died in a car accident; and, for five episodes, the Lone Ranger was unable to speak beyond a whisper, with Tonto carrying the action. In addition, six episodes broadcast in August 1938 did not include the Lone Ranger's voice other than an occasional \"Hi-Yo Silver!\" in the background.<ref>from \"Conspiracy for Revenge\" (aired 1938-08-08) to \"Crooked Sheriff\" (aired 1938-08-19)</ref>  In those episodes, Tonto carried the dialog;\n* [[Brace Beemer]] (April 18, 1941 to the end), who had been the show's deep-voiced announcer for several years;\n* [[Fred Foy]] (March 29, 1954), also an announcer on the show, took over the role for one broadcast when Beemer had [[laryngitis]].\n\nTonto was played throughout the run by actor [[John Todd (actor)|John Todd]] (although there were a few isolated occasions when he was replaced by Roland Parker, better known as Kato for much of the run of sister series ''The Green Hornet''). Other supporting players were selected from Detroit area actors and studio staff. These included Jay Michael (who also played the lead on ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'', a.k.a. ''Sgt.

The part of nephew Dan Reid was played by various child actors, including Bob Martin, [[James Lipton]] and [[Dick Beals]].\n\n=== Music ===\nThe theme music was primarily taken from the \"March of the Swiss Soldiers\" finale of [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture|''William Tell'' Overture]], which thus came to be inseparably associated with the series. The theme was conducted by Daniel P\u00e9rez Casta\u00f1eda,<ref name=\"music\">Music of The Lone Ranger CD liner notes by Graham Newton, 1992.</ref> with the softer parts excerpted from ''[[Die Moldau]]'', composed by [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]].\n\nMany other classical selections were used as incidental music, including [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Flying Dutchman (opera)|Flying Dutchman Overture]]'',  [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|Symphony in C]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s [[The Hebrides (overture)|''Fingal's Cave'' Overture]], [[Emil von \u0158ezn\u00ed\u010dek]]'s ''[[Donna Diana]]'' Overture, [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s ''[[Les pr\u00e9ludes]]'', [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture|''1812'' Overture]] and music by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]].<ref>Jim Harmon, ''The Great Radio Heroes'' (McFarland, 2001), p. 162.</ref> Classical music was originally used because it was in the [[public domain]], thus allowing production costs to be kept low while providing a wide range of music as needed without the cost of a composer. The incidental music from Liszt's ''Les Preludes'' was being used in the 1940s by Germany's Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, as a theme in German weekly news announcements, particularly to dramatize German victories in WWII.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Trendle acquired the rights to use incidental music from [[Republic Pictures]] motion picture serials as part of a deal for Republic to produce a serial based (loosely) on the Lone Ranger. This music was then modified by NBC radio arranger Ben Bonnell and recorded in Mexico to avoid American union rules. This music was used in both the radio and later television shows.<ref name=\"music\" />\n\n=== Possible inspirations ===\nThe character was originally believed to be inspired by Texas Ranger Captain [[John Hughes (lawman)|John R. Hughes]], to whom the book ''[[The Lone Star Ranger]]'' by [[Zane Grey]] was dedicated in 1915.<ref>\"Lone Ranger Research Connects the Dots to Cambridge\", Mike Clark, CommunityCasts.com</ref> Another possible historical inspiration was [[Bass Reeves]], the first [[African-American|black]] [[United States Marshals Service|deputy U.S. marshal]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/06/sport/lone-ranger-african-american-reeves/|title=Was this African American cop the inspiration for the Lone Ranger? |author=Sheena McKenzie|website=Edition.cnn.com|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref> Speculation may have originated from a 2006 Reeves biography by historian Art T. Burton, ''Black Gun, Silver Star.'' Burton wrote, \"Bass Reeves is the closest real person to resemble the Lone Ranger.\" Burton also documents that Reeves' career as a lawman was widely known and celebrated in his time.

It was produced by [[Herbert Klynn]] and [[Jules Engel]] of [[Format Films]], Hollywood, and designed and animated at the [[Halas and Batchelor|Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Film]] studios in London, England. The show lasted thirty episodes; however, these were invariably split into three separate shorts, with the middle segment being a solo adventure for Tonto, so that there were actually 90 installments in all. The last episode aired on March 9, 1968.\n\nThese Lone Ranger adventures were similar in tone and nature to CBS's [[science fiction Western]], ''[[The Wild Wild West]],'' in that the plots were bizarre and had elements of science-fiction and [[steampunk]] technology thrown in. Even the Lone Ranger's greatest enemy in the animated series was a dwarf, similar to James T. West's greatest enemy, [[Dr. Loveless|Dr. Miguelito Loveless]]. He was called Tiny Tom, and was voiced by [[Dick Beals]]. This animated cartoon was credited as being a Jack Wrather production, and it provided the first exposure many 1960s children had to the characters.\n\nThe Lone Ranger's voice was provided by [[Michael Rye]], who had portrayed ''[[Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy]]'' on radio. [[Shepard Menken]] played Tonto. The narrator in the opening title was [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]]. Other \"guest voices\" were provided by [[Paul Winchell]], [[Agnes Moorehead]] and [[Hans Conried]].\n\n====''The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour'', early 1980s====\n{{Main|The Lone Ranger (1980 TV series)}}\n{{Further|The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour}}\nThe Lone Ranger was featured, along with [[Zorro]] and [[Tarzan]], in ''[[The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour|Adventure Hour]]'' cartoon shorts in the early 1980s, produced by [[Filmation]]. These episodes featured [[William Conrad]] as the voice of the Masked Man, although he was listed in the credits as \"J. Darnoc\" (Conrad spelled backwards). This series took a more realistic tone with a heavily historical context to include an educational element to the stories, even though there were several episodes that did feature elements of science fiction (much like the earlier cartoons from the 1960s). There were 14 episodes, combining two adventures in each episode, for a total of 28 stories. Though Conrad was the main voice featured, other noted voice actors in the Filmation series include an uncredited [[Lou Scheimer]], [[Frank Welker]], and [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]].\n\n====''The Lone Ranger: The Lost Episodes'', 2001====\nIn 2001, [[GoodTimes Entertainment|GoodTimes Home Video]] released a videotape called ''The Lone Ranger: The Lost Episodes''. Along with clips from the first 1930s film serial, trailers for the two post-TV series features, commercials with Moore, and sometimes Silverheels, in character, and two complete television episodes, there was a cartoon short, said to date from the late 1930s.<ref name=Riddle2000>{{cite web |last1=Riddle |first1=Ray |title=Lone Ranger: Lost Episodes |url=https://www.amazon.com/Lone-Ranger-Episodes-Jay-Silverheels/dp/B00005B1XT |year=2000\u20132013 |at=Customer Reviews |website=Amazon.com |accessdate=July 22, 2014|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=Charles2013>{{cite web |last1=Charles |first1=Jim |title=The Lone Ranger: Lost Episodes and Rare Footage |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Lone-Ranger-Episodes-Footage/dp/B00BC0JJDQ |year=2013 |at=Customer Reviews |website=Amazon.com |accessdate=July 22, 2014|display-authors=etal}}</ref> This cartoon was produced by ''Pathegrams'' on 16mm film and sold to the home market and libraries, which often showed cartoons as a prelude to the feature films they would play for children, much as they do videos now. It was a silent film, like most films produced for the home market in those days, and had dialog written on title cards, just as films of the silent era. The DVD also has the approximately eight-minute-long documentary, \"The Lone Ranger and the Peace Patrol\". Presented and narrated by Clayton Moore, it revolves around purchasing U.S. Savings Stamps, a child's version of Savings Bonds. The main focus is to get children to invest in the stamps. The narrated segment culminates with the inaugural ceremonies on the grounds of the Washington Memorial before a crowd of thousands of children and their parents.\n\n===Video game===\n{{Further|The Lone Ranger (video game)}}\n\nA [[video game]] version of ''The Lone Ranger'' was released by [[Konami]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America in [[1991 in video gaming|1991]]. It is an [[action adventure game]] featuring three different perspectives: side-scrolling, overhead, and first-person exploration. The game loosely follows the plot of the 1981 film ''The Legend of the Lone Ranger,'' with the ultimate goal being the rescue of the President of the United States, whom the Lone Ranger's nemesis, \"Butch\" Cavendish, has kidnapped.\n\n===Premiums===\n''The Lone Ranger'' program offered many [[radio premium]]s, including the Lone Ranger Six-Shooter Ring and the Lone Ranger Deputy Badge. Some used a silver bullet motif. One ring had a miniature of one of his six-guns atop it, with a flint and striking wheel, as used in cigarette lighters, so that \"fanning\" the miniature pistol would produce a shower of sparks. During [[World War II]], the premiums adapted to the times. In 1942, the program offered the [[Kix (cereal)|Kix]] Blackout Kit.\n\nSome premiums were rather [[anachronism|anachronistic]] for a 19th-century hero. In 1947, the program offered the Kix Atomic Bomb Ring, also known to collectors as the Lone Ranger Atom Bomb Ring.<ref>Reif, Rita. [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/11/arts/arts-artifacts-trivia-long-ago-serious-treasures-now.html ARTS/ARTIFACTS; Trivia Long Ago, Serious Treasures Now.] ''[[The New York Times]].'' June 11, 1995.</ref> This ring was a miniature [[spinthariscope]] that actually had a small amount of [[polonium-210]] in it, which emitted [[alpha particles]] to produce scintillations on the [[zinc sulfide]] outer part of the ring. With its tailfin piece removed, though, the \"bomb\" body looked like a silver bullet.\n\nThe sponsor was [[General Mills]], with its [[Breakfast cereal|breakfast-cereal]] products: [[Cheerios]], [[Wheaties]], and Kix. In 1947, Cheerios produced a line of Frontier Town cereal boxes with the Lone Ranger likeness on the front of the box. Different versions of the boxes would have Frontier Town buildings on their backs to cut out. One could also send in ten cents and a box-top to get each of the four map sections of the town. These, as well as nine different boxes, were needed to complete the cardboard Frontier Town.\n\n===Toys and games===\nBesides the premiums offered in connection with the radio series, there have been many Lone Ranger commercial toys released over the years. One of the most successful was a line of 10-inch action figures and accessories released by [[Gabriel Toys]] in 1973. Board games were released by Parker Brothers: The Lone Ranger Game, in 1938,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lone Ranger Game (1938) |url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14225/lone-ranger-game |website=[[BoardGameGeek]] |access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref> and The New Lone Ranger Game, in 1956.<ref>{{cite web |title=The New Lone Ranger Game (1956) |url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15831/new-lone-ranger-game |website=[[BoardGameGeek]] |access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Parodies and spoofs===\n\nIn the 1939 [[Looney Tune]] ''The Lone Stranger and Porky'', supervised by [[Bob Clampett]], the masked man comes to the rescue of stagecoach driver in distress, [[Porky Pig]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Films of Bob Clampett |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/bobclampett.html |date=1996 |website=Library, University of California, Berkeley |access-date=September 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[Hugh Harman]] made a Lone Ranger parody for [[MGM Cartoons]] titled ''The Lonesome Stranger''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOyHANu2A0U|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nJay Silverheels appeared as Tonto on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' starring [[Johnny Carson]] in a comedy sketch in which Carson is interviewing Tonto for employment. The audio portion of this sketch was included in the LP ''[[Here's Johnny: Magic Moments from the Tonight Show]]'', released by [[Casablanca Records]] in 1974.\n\nBoth Clayton Moore and Silverheels appeared as the Lone Ranger and Tonto in a commercial for [[Totino's|Jeno's Pizza Rolls]] produced by ad man/satirist [[Stan Freberg]]. The commercial was a spoof of a then-current commercial for [[Lark (cigarette)|Lark cigarettes]] which also used the ''William Tell'' overture theme music.\n\nA recorded routine by comic [[Lenny Bruce]] formed the basis for the 1971 animated cartoon, ''[[Thank You Mask Man]]'', produced by John Magnuson Associates. This was an adult humor routine, comically implying a gay relationship between the Ranger and Tonto.\n\nParody versions of The Lone Ranger (called Lonely Rider) and Tonto appear as main characters in 1971 Finnish western comedy ''[[The Unhanged]]'' (''Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t''). They were played by [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]] and [[Simo Salminen]].\n\n''The Top Ranger'' is a movie parody produced by Disney starring [[Mickey Mouse]] (Top Ranger) and [[Goofy]] (Tonto-lone), with the script and drawing by Marco Gervasio and published in an Italian comic book, ''[[Topolino]]'' #3005 (July 2, 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/issue.php?c=it/TL+3005|title=Italy: Topolino (libretto) # 3005|website=Coa.inducks.org|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n\"The Provolone Ranger\", an episode of the ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!|Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]'', featured [[Mario]] donning a mask to fight outlaws alongside of a speedy companion named Pronto. In a spoof of the Lone Ranger's habit of leaving before those whom he has helped can thank him, the episode ends with Mario returning to collect a reward of pasta.\n\nIn \"Wild West Rangers\"\", a two-part episode of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'', [[Pink Ranger]] [[Kimberly Hart]] ([[Amy Jo Johnson]]) falls backwards through time to the Old West, where she meets look-alike ancestors of her fellow Power Rangers and other characters in the show. A hero called the White Stranger, a mask-less duplicate of Kimberly's boyfriend [[Tommy Oliver]], the [[White Ranger]] (played by [[Jason David Frank]]) rides to the rescue on more than one occasion when danger threatens.\n\nIn \"Who Was That Masked Man\", a 1987 episode from the fifth season of [[Night Court]], an old actor who had played a Lone Ranger-esque character named the Red Ranger was being sued to prevent his appearing in public in costume by a movie company seeking to release a new movie based on the Red Ranger.\n\n==Ownership==\nFrom its inception, George W. Trendle had legal ownership of the Lone Ranger and characters associated with the Lone Ranger through his company, The Lone Ranger, Inc.  Trendle sold The Lone Ranger, Inc. to oil man and film producer [[Jack Wrather]] in 1954 for $3 million.  After Wrather died in 1984, his widow, [[Bonita Granville]], sold the Wrather Productions properties to Southbrook International Television Co. in 1985 for $10 million.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kb3eCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=trendle+%2B+wrather&source=bl&ots=51HLQMpS7o&sig=vB8QyXf0nWh-3XCcgKvwvUrJL7s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMI7Zu0wfCjxwIVR3ySCh0S5wM1#v=onepage&q=trendle%20%2B%20wrather&f=false|title=An Illustrated History of Trigger: The Lives and Legend of Roy Rogers' Palomino|author=Pando, Leo|page=203}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8f76dbp/entire_text/|title=Jack and Bonita Granville Wrather Papers|website=Oac.cdlib.org|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/173020826/|title=The Los Angeles Times from Los Angeles, California on April 25, 1985 \u00b7 73|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>  [[Broadway Video]] acquired the rights in 1994.

He discovers one of the rangers, Captain Reid's younger brother, John, barely alive, and he nurses the man to health. In some versions, Tonto recognizes the lone survivor as the man who had saved his life when they both were children. According to the television series, Tonto gave John a ring and the name [[Ke-mo sah-bee|Kemo Sabe]], which he said means \"trusty scout\".<ref>''The Lone Ranger'', \"Pilot Episode\"</ref> John Reid then tells Tonto that he intends to hunt down Cavendish and his men and to bring them to justice. To conceal his identity and honor his fallen brother, John fashions a black [[domino mask]] using cloth from his late brother's vest. To aid in the deception, Tonto digs a sixth grave and places at its head a cross bearing John Reid's name so that Cavendish and his gang will believe that all the Rangers had been killed.\n\nIn many versions, Reid continues fighting for justice as the Lone Ranger even after the Cavendish gang is captured.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Lone Ranger===\nAs generally depicted, the Lone Ranger conducts himself by a strict moral code based on that put in place by Striker at the inception of the character.  It read:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nI believe that to have a friend,\na man must be one.\n\nThat all men are created equal\nand that everyone has within himself\nthe power to make this a better world.\n\nThat God put the firewood there\nbut that every man\nmust gather and light it himself.\n\nIn being prepared\nphysically, mentally, and morally\nto fight when necessary\nfor what is right.\n\nThat a man should make the most\nof what equipment he has.\n\nThat 'this government, \nof the people, by the people\nand for the people'\nshall live always.\n\nThat men should live by\nthe rule of what is best\nfor the greatest number.\n\nThat sooner or later...\nsomewhere...somehow...\nwe must settle with the world\nand make payment for what we have taken.\n\nThat all things change but truth,\nand that truth alone, lives on forever.\n\nIn my Creator, my country, my fellow man.<ref name=\"npr.org\">{{cite web |title= The Lone Ranger: Justice from Outside the Law |publisher=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18073741 |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn addition, Fran Striker and George W. Trendle drew up the following guidelines that embody who and what the Lone Ranger is:<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lone Ranger: F.A.Q. |url=http://weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com/loneranger/faq.html |website=Weird Science-Fantasy Web Links |accessdate=July 1, 2015}}</ref>\n* The Lone Ranger was never seen without his mask or some sort of disguise.\n* He was never captured or held for any length of time by lawmen, avoiding his being unmasked.\n* He always used perfect grammar and precise speech devoid of slang and colloquialisms.\n* Whenever he was forced to use guns, he never shot to kill, but instead tried to disarm his opponent as painlessly as possible.\n* He was never put in a hopeless situation; e.g., he was never seen escaping from a barrage of gunfire merely by fleeing toward the horizon.\n* He rarely referred to himself as the Lone Ranger. If someone's suspicion were aroused, either the Lone Ranger would present one of his silver bullets to confirm his identity or someone else would attest on his behalf; the latter happened at the end of most episodes when someone would ask \"Who ''was'' that masked man?\" as the Lone Ranger departed. His decision to adopt the moniker of Lone Ranger was inspired by Tonto: following the ambush at Bryant's Gap, Tonto observed him to be the only ranger left\u2014in other words, he was the \"lone\" ranger.\n* Even though the Lone Ranger offered his aid to individuals or small groups facing powerful adversaries, the ultimate objective of his story always implied that their benefit was only a by-product of the development of the West or the country.\n* Adversaries were rarely other than American, to avoid criticism from minority groups. There were some exceptions to this rule. He sometimes battled foreign agents, though their nation of origin was generally not named. An exception was his having helped the Mexican [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] against French troops of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]], as occurred in the radio episodes \"Supplies for Juarez\" (18 September 1939), \"Hunted by Legionnaires\" (20 September 1939) and \"Lafitte's Reinforcements\" (22 September 1939).\n* The names of unsympathetic characters were carefully chosen so that they never consisted of two names if it could be avoided. More often than not, a single nickname or surname was selected.\n* The Lone Ranger never drank or smoked; and saloon scenes were usually shown as cafes, with waiters and food instead of bartenders and liquor.\n* Criminals were never shown in enviable positions of wealth or power, and they were never successful or glamorous.\n\n==== The Lone Ranger's first name ====\nAlthough the Lone Ranger's last name in the radio shows was given as Reid, his first name was never specified in any of the radio or television shows. Various radio reference books, beginning with ''Radio's Golden Age'' (Eastern Valley Press, 1966), give the Lone Ranger's first name as John.<ref>Frank Buxton and Bill Owen, ''Radio's Golden Age: The Programs and the Personalities'' ([New York]: Easton Valley Press, 1966): 209.</ref> Some cite the 20th anniversary radio program in 1953 as the source of the name, but the Lone Ranger's first name is never mentioned in that episode.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=20th Anniversary Show |url=http://www.lonerangerfanclub.com/media/20th_Anniversary_Show.mp3 |website=Lonerangerfanclub.com |type=MP3 |access-date=July 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the final chapter of the 1938 Republic ''[[The Lone Ranger (serial)|The Lone Ranger]]'' movie serial, he is revealed to be Texas Ranger Allen King. In the second serial, ''[[The Lone Ranger Rides Again]]'', he identifies himself as \"Bill Andrews\".\n\nThe Lone Ranger's first name is also thought to have not been mentioned in contemporary Lone Ranger newspaper comics, comic books, and tie-in [[radio premium|premiums]], though some have stated that the name John Reid was used in an illustration of the grave marker made by Tonto which appeared in either a comic book version of the character's origin story or in a children's record set.\n\nThe name John Reid is used in the 1981 film ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]''. The Lone Ranger is also John Reid in [[Dynamite Entertainment]]'s licensed Lone Ranger [[comic book]] series that began in 2006 and in the 2013 Disney film ''The Lone Ranger''.\n\nThe name \"Luke Hartman\" was used in the 2003 TV-movie/unsold series pilot.\n\n===Tonto===\n{{Main|Tonto}}\n\nThe character made his initial appearance in the 11th episode of the radio show. Fran Striker told his son that Tonto was added so the Lone Ranger would have someone to talk to.<ref name=\"npr.org\"/> He was named by [[James Jewell]], who also came up with the term \"Kemosabe\" based on the name of a summer camp owned by his father-in-law in upstate Michigan. In the local Native American language, \"Tonto\" meant \"wild one\".<ref name=vanhise16-18>Van Hise, James, ''Who was that Masked Man? The Story of the Lone Ranger\" (Pioneer Books, Las Vegas, 1990), pp. 16\u201318.</ref>\n\nThe character spoke in broken English that emphasized Tonto had learned it as a second language.\n\nBecause {{wiktspa|tonto}} means \"stupid\" or \"ignorant\" in Spanish, the character is renamed \"{{wiktspa|toro|Toro}}\" (Spanish for \"bull\") or \"{{wiktspa|ponto|Ponto}}\" in Spanish-speaking countries.<ref name=vanhise16-18 />\n\n===Dan Reid Jr.===\nThe name of Captain Reid's son, the Lone Ranger's nephew, a character introduced in the radio series in 1942, who became a juvenile sidekick to the Masked Man, is Dan Reid. When Trendle and Striker later created ''[[The Green Hornet]]'' in 1936, they made this Dan Reid the father of Britt Reid, alias the Green Hornet, thereby making the Lone Ranger the Green Hornet's great-uncle.<ref>Jim Harmon, ''The Great Radio Heroes'', Doubleday,1967</ref> Throughout ''The Lone Ranger'' radio series, Dan was played by Ernest Winstanley, Bob Martin, Clarence Weitzel, [[James Lipton]] and [[Dick Beals]].\n\nThe Lone Ranger's nephew made his first appearance in \"Heading North\" (December 14, 1942) under the name \"Dan Frisby\", the grandson of Grandma Frisby. The two lived in an area described as \"the high border country of the northwest\" near the town of Martinsville close to the Canada\u2013US border. This and the following four episodes (\"Design for Murder\", December 16, 1942; \"Rope's End\", December 18, 1942; \"Law of the Apex\", December 21, 1942; and \"Dan's Strange Behavior\", December 23, 1942) centred on a plot to steal the valuable Martin Copper Mine and Dan's being fooled by a Lone Ranger impostor into helping him steal it. The Lone Ranger and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mounties]] foil the plot and capture the impostor and his gang.\n\nIn the final episode of the arc, \"A Nephew Is Found\" (December 25, 1942), the dying Grandma Frisby reveals to The Lone Ranger Dan's true identity and how he came to be with her. Fifteen years previously, Grandma Frisby had been part of a wagon train travelling to [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]]. Also on that wagon train had been Linda Reid, wife of Texas Ranger Captain Dan Reid, and her six-month-old son Dan Jr., who were travelling from their home in Virginia to join her husband. Before the wagon train could reach Fort Laramie, Indians attacked it and Linda Reid was among those killed. Grandma Frisby took charge and care of Dan Jr., but upon reaching Fort Laramie found two messages waiting: one that Captain Reid (voiced in this story by [[Al Hodge]]) had been killed in an ambush at Bryant's Gap and the other that her own husband had been killed in an explosion. Taking Dan and certain items concerning his identity (including a small gold locket containing a picture of Dan's parents and a picture of Captain Reid's brother), Grandma Frisby travelled to Martinsville and raised Dan as her grandson.\n\nOn hearing this story, The Lone Ranger reveals his true identity and his own story to Grandma Frisby and promises that he will care for Dan like his own son. Before Grandma Frisby dies, The Lone Ranger removes his mask and lets her see his face. Her last words are \"Ride on, Lone Ranger ... ride on forever ... with Danny at your side.\" The Lone Ranger takes the grieving Dan outside the cabin, gives him the locket and reveals their true relationship. Dan Reid Jr. would go on to be a recurring character throughout the remainder of the series, riding with The Lone Ranger and Tonto on his own horse Victor.\n\nEventually, Dan Reid Jr. would be sent East to gain an education, making infrequent appearances on the series whenever [[Fran Striker]] wanted to remind the audience of the family connection, and would later become part of ''[[The Green Hornet (radio series)|The Green Hornet]]'' radio series, first appearing on October 22, 1936, establishing the connection between The Lone Ranger and The Green Hornet in the episode \"Too Hot to Handle\" (November 11, 1947) and being played throughout the series by John Todd, who played \"Tonto\" on ''The Lone Ranger'' radio series.\n\n===Their horses===\nAccording to the episode \"The Legend of Silver\" (September 30, 1938), before acquiring Silver, the Lone Ranger rode a chestnut mare called Dusty. The Lone Ranger saves Silver's life from an enraged buffalo and, in gratitude, Silver chooses to give up his wild life to carry him.\n\nThe origin of Tonto's horse, Scout, is less clear. For a long time, Tonto rides a white horse called White Feller. In \"Four Day Ride\" (August 5, 1938), Tonto is given a [[American Paint Horse|paint horse]] by his friend Chief Thundercloud, who then takes White Feller. Tonto rides this horse and refers to him simply as \"Paint Horse\" for several episodes. The horse is finally named Scout in \"Border Dope Smuggling\" (September 2, 1938). In another episode, however, the Lone Ranger, in a surge of conscience, releases Silver back to the wild. The episode ends with Silver returning, bringing along a companion who becomes Tonto's horse Scout.\n\nIn an echo of the Lone Ranger's line, Tonto frequently says, \"Git-um up, Scout!\" (The phrase became so well embedded in the Lone Ranger mythos that [[International Harvester]] used it as an advertising line to promote their [[International Harvester Scout|Scout]] [[utility vehicle]] in the 1970s.) In the [[The Lone Ranger (1966 TV series)|Format Films animated cartoon which ran from 1966 to 1968]], Tonto also had an eagle he called Taka, and installments that focused exclusively on him or had him team up with the Lone Ranger ended with his saying, '''''\"Fly,''''' Taka! ''On,'' Scout!\" (Those where he teamed with the Lone Ranger had the Ranger following this up with the customary \"Hi-yo, '''''Silver!''''' Away!\")\n\n==Original radio series==\nThe first of 2,956 radio episodes of ''The Lone Ranger'' premiered on [[WXYT (AM)|WXYZ]], a radio station serving [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], on January 30, 1933<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-lone-ranger-debuts-on-detroit-radio |title=Jan 30, 1933: The Lone Ranger debuts on Detroit radio |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History.com]] |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> or January 31, 1933.<ref name=dunning407 /> As Dunning writes in ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio:''\n\n{{quote|There may have been a few late-night on-air shakedown shows prior to the official January 31, 1933 premiere date.

Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, when from out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!</blockquote>\n\nBy the time it was on ABC at 7:30 pm Eastern Time, the introduction, voiced by [[Fred Foy]], had become \"Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear\", followed by, \"From out of the west with the speed of light and a hearty 'Hi-yo, Silver!{{' \"}} The intro was later changed to:\n\n<blockquote>\nA fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! ... With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early western United States! Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice! Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear! From out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!</blockquote>\n\nThis was followed by Brace Beemer's voice, declaring, \"Come on, Silver! Let's go, big fellow! Hi-yo, Silver! Away!\"\n\n=== Cast ===\nThe Lone Ranger was played by several actors:\n* John L. Barrett, on test broadcasts on [[WDCZ|WEBR]] in January 1933;\n* [[George Seaton]] (under the name George Stenius) (January 31 \u2013 May 9, 1933);\n* Series director [[James Jewell]], for one episode;\n* An actor known only by the pseudonym \"Jack Deeds\", for one episode;\n* [[Earle Graser]] (May 16, 1933 \u2013 April 7, 1941). On April 8, Graser died in a car accident; and, for five episodes, the Lone Ranger was unable to speak beyond a whisper, with Tonto carrying the action. In addition, six episodes broadcast in August 1938 did not include the Lone Ranger's voice other than an occasional \"Hi-Yo Silver!\" in the background.<ref>from \"Conspiracy for Revenge\" (aired 1938-08-08) to \"Crooked Sheriff\" (aired 1938-08-19)</ref>  In those episodes, Tonto carried the dialog;\n* [[Brace Beemer]] (April 18, 1941 to the end), who had been the show's deep-voiced announcer for several years;\n* [[Fred Foy]] (March 29, 1954), also an announcer on the show, took over the role for one broadcast when Beemer had [[laryngitis]].\n\nTonto was played throughout the run by actor [[John Todd (actor)|John Todd]] (although there were a few isolated occasions when he was replaced by Roland Parker, better known as Kato for much of the run of sister series ''The Green Hornet''). Other supporting players were selected from Detroit area actors and studio staff. These included Jay Michael (who also played the lead on ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'', a.k.a. ''Sgt. Preston of the Yukon''), Bill Saunders (as various villains, including Butch Cavendish), Paul Hughes (as the Ranger's friend Thunder Martin and as various army colonels and badmen), future movie star [[John Hodiak]], Janka Fasciszewska (under the name Jane Fae), and Rube and Liz Weiss (a married couple, both actors in several radio and television programs in Detroit, Rube usually taking on villain roles on the \"Ranger\", and Liz playing damsels in distress). The part of nephew Dan Reid was played by various child actors, including Bob Martin, [[James Lipton]] and [[Dick Beals]].\n\n=== Music ===\nThe theme music was primarily taken from the \"March of the Swiss Soldiers\" finale of [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture|''William Tell'' Overture]], which thus came to be inseparably associated with the series. The theme was conducted by Daniel P\u00e9rez Casta\u00f1eda,<ref name=\"music\">Music of The Lone Ranger CD liner notes by Graham Newton, 1992.</ref> with the softer parts excerpted from ''[[Die Moldau]]'', composed by [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]].\n\nMany other classical selections were used as incidental music, including [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Flying Dutchman (opera)|Flying Dutchman Overture]]'',  [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|Symphony in C]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s [[The Hebrides (overture)|''Fingal's Cave'' Overture]], [[Emil von \u0158ezn\u00ed\u010dek]]'s ''[[Donna Diana]]'' Overture, [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s ''[[Les pr\u00e9ludes]]'', [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture|''1812'' Overture]] and music by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]].<ref>Jim Harmon, ''The Great Radio Heroes'' (McFarland, 2001), p. 162.</ref> Classical music was originally used because it was in the [[public domain]], thus allowing production costs to be kept low while providing a wide range of music as needed without the cost of a composer. The incidental music from Liszt's ''Les Preludes'' was being used in the 1940s by Germany's Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, as a theme in German weekly news announcements, particularly to dramatize German victories in WWII.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Trendle acquired the rights to use incidental music from [[Republic Pictures]] motion picture serials as part of a deal for Republic to produce a serial based (loosely) on the Lone Ranger. This music was then modified by NBC radio arranger Ben Bonnell and recorded in Mexico to avoid American union rules. This music was used in both the radio and later television shows.<ref name=\"music\" />\n\n=== Possible inspirations ===\nThe character was originally believed to be inspired by Texas Ranger Captain [[John Hughes (lawman)|John R. Hughes]], to whom the book ''[[The Lone Star Ranger]]'' by [[Zane Grey]] was dedicated in 1915.<ref>\"Lone Ranger Research Connects the Dots to Cambridge\", Mike Clark, CommunityCasts.com</ref> Another possible historical inspiration was [[Bass Reeves]], the first [[African-American|black]] [[United States Marshals Service|deputy U.S. marshal]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/06/sport/lone-ranger-african-american-reeves/|title=Was this African American cop the inspiration for the Lone Ranger? |author=Sheena McKenzie|website=Edition.cnn.com|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref> Speculation may have originated from a 2006 Reeves biography by historian Art T. Burton, ''Black Gun, Silver Star.'' Burton wrote, \"Bass Reeves is the closest real person to resemble the Lone Ranger.\" Burton also documents that Reeves' career as a lawman was widely known and celebrated in his time. Burton cites many similarities between Reeves and the Lone Ranger (wearing disguises, having a Native American partner, riding a white and grey horse, giving out silver keepsakes, possessing legendary marksmanship and horsemanship etc.)  <ref>{{cite web |title=Was an African American Cop the Real Lone Ranger? |publisher=CNN|date=6 August 2013 |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/06/sport/lone-ranger-african-american-reeves/index.html |accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref> Other suggested inspirations were [[Zorro]] and [[Robin Hood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bp/secret-history-lone-ranger-185818908.html|title=The Secret History of the Lone Ranger|website=Yahoo.com|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Green Hornet'' ===\n{{Main|Green Hornet}}\nThe radio series inspired a spinoff called ''The Green Hornet,'' which depicts the son of the Lone Ranger's nephew Dan,<ref>\"Too Hot Too Handle,\" ''[[The Green Hornet#Radio series|The Green Hornet]]'' (radio series) (November 11, 1947), ABC radio network.</ref> [[Britt Reid]], originally played by [[Al Hodge]], who in contemporary times, fights crime with a similar secret identity and a [[sidekick]], [[Kato (The Green Hornet)|Kato]].

Contrary to most visual media depictions, and acknowledged by developer/original script writer [[Ron Fortier]] to be the result of legal complications,<ref>[[Will Murray (writer)|Murray, Will]], \"Where Hornets Swarm\", ''[[Comics Scene (magazine)|Comics Scene]]'', # 9, (October) 1989, [[Starlog|Starlog Communications, Inc.]], p. 41.</ref> his mask covers all of his face, as it did in the two serials from [[Republic Pictures]] (see below). However, rights to The Lone Ranger and The Green Hornet have been acquired by separate owners and the familial link has been ignored in the Western character's various incarnations. The Lone Ranger&nbsp;\u2013 Green Hornet connection is part of [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton Universe]], which connects disparate fictional characters.\n\n==Film serials==\n{{Main|The Lone Ranger (serial)|The Lone Ranger Rides Again}}\n\n[[Republic Pictures]] released two [[serial (film)|serials]] starring the Lone Ranger. The first, released in 1938, utilized several actors playing different men portraying the masked hero, with the true Lone Ranger unknown to the audience until the conclusion; the character played by [[Lee Powell (actor)|Lee Powell]] is ultimately revealed to be the Lone Ranger. The second serial, ''The Lone Ranger Rides Again'', was released in 1939 and starred [[Robert Livingston (actor)|Robert Livingston]]. Tonto was played in both by Victor Daniels, billed as [[Chief Thundercloud]].\n\n==Television series==\n{{Main|The Lone Ranger (TV series)}}\n\n''The Lone Ranger'' was a TV show that aired for eight seasons, from 1949 to 1957, and starred [[Clayton Moore]] as the Lone Ranger and [[Jay Silverheels]] as Tonto.

This series originally consisted of reprints from the newspaper strips (as had all previous comic book appearances of the character in various titles from [[David McKay Publications]] and from Dell). However, new stories by writer [[Paul S. Newman]] and artist [[Tom Gill (comics)|Tom Gill]] began with issue #38 (August 1951). Some original content was presented as early as #7 (January 1949), but these were non-Lone Ranger fillers. Newman and Gill produced the series until its final issue, #145 (July 1962).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/538/ ''The Lone Ranger'' (Dell, 1948 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref>\n\nTonto got his own spin-off title in 1951, which lasted 31 issues. Such was the Ranger's popularity at the time that even his horse Silver had a comic book, ''The Lone Ranger's Famous Horse Hi-Yo Silver'', starting in 1952 and running 34 issues; writer [[Gaylord DuBois]] wrote and developed Silver as a hero in his own right. In addition, Dell also published three big ''Lone Ranger'' annuals, as well as an adaptation of the 1956 theatrical film.\n\nThe Dell series came to an end in 1962. Later that same year, Western Publishing ended its publishing partnership with Dell Comics and started its own comic book imprint, [[Gold Key Comics]]. The new imprint launched its own ''Lone Ranger'' title in 1964. Initially reprinting material from the Dell run, original content did not begin until issue #22 in 1975, and the magazine itself folded with #28 in 1977.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1650/ ''The Lone Ranger'' (Gold Key, 1964 series)] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> Additionally the same year, [[Aktiebolag|AB]] published a three-part Swedish Lone Ranger story in ''[[Hemmets Journal]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1994, [[Topps Comics]] produced a four-issue [[miniseries]], ''The Lone Ranger and Tonto'', written by [[Joe R.

It was produced by [[Herbert Klynn]] and [[Jules Engel]] of [[Format Films]], Hollywood, and designed and animated at the [[Halas and Batchelor|Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Film]] studios in London, England. The show lasted thirty episodes; however, these were invariably split into three separate shorts, with the middle segment being a solo adventure for Tonto, so that there were actually 90 installments in all. The last episode aired on March 9, 1968.\n\nThese Lone Ranger adventures were similar in tone and nature to CBS's [[science fiction Western]], ''[[The Wild Wild West]],'' in that the plots were bizarre and had elements of science-fiction and [[steampunk]] technology thrown in. Even the Lone Ranger's greatest enemy in the animated series was a dwarf, similar to James T. West's greatest enemy, [[Dr. Loveless|Dr. Miguelito Loveless]]. He was called Tiny Tom, and was voiced by [[Dick Beals]]. This animated cartoon was credited as being a Jack Wrather production, and it provided the first exposure many 1960s children had to the characters.\n\nThe Lone Ranger's voice was provided by [[Michael Rye]], who had portrayed ''[[Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy]]'' on radio. [[Shepard Menken]] played Tonto. The narrator in the opening title was [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]]. Other \"guest voices\" were provided by [[Paul Winchell]], [[Agnes Moorehead]] and [[Hans Conried]].\n\n====''The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour'', early 1980s====\n{{Main|The Lone Ranger (1980 TV series)}}\n{{Further|The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour}}\nThe Lone Ranger was featured, along with [[Zorro]] and [[Tarzan]], in ''[[The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour|Adventure Hour]]'' cartoon shorts in the early 1980s, produced by [[Filmation]]. These episodes featured [[William Conrad]] as the voice of the Masked Man, although he was listed in the credits as \"J. Darnoc\" (Conrad spelled backwards). This series took a more realistic tone with a heavily historical context to include an educational element to the stories, even though there were several episodes that did feature elements of science fiction (much like the earlier cartoons from the 1960s). There were 14 episodes, combining two adventures in each episode, for a total of 28 stories. Though Conrad was the main voice featured, other noted voice actors in the Filmation series include an uncredited [[Lou Scheimer]], [[Frank Welker]], and [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]].\n\n====''The Lone Ranger: The Lost Episodes'', 2001====\nIn 2001, [[GoodTimes Entertainment|GoodTimes Home Video]] released a videotape called ''The Lone Ranger: The Lost Episodes''. Along with clips from the first 1930s film serial, trailers for the two post-TV series features, commercials with Moore, and sometimes Silverheels, in character, and two complete television episodes, there was a cartoon short, said to date from the late 1930s.<ref name=Riddle2000>{{cite web |last1=Riddle |first1=Ray |title=Lone Ranger: Lost Episodes |url=https://www.amazon.com/Lone-Ranger-Episodes-Jay-Silverheels/dp/B00005B1XT |year=2000\u20132013 |at=Customer Reviews |website=Amazon.com |accessdate=July 22, 2014|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=Charles2013>{{cite web |last1=Charles |first1=Jim |title=The Lone Ranger: Lost Episodes and Rare Footage |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Lone-Ranger-Episodes-Footage/dp/B00BC0JJDQ |year=2013 |at=Customer Reviews |website=Amazon.com |accessdate=July 22, 2014|display-authors=etal}}</ref> This cartoon was produced by ''Pathegrams'' on 16mm film and sold to the home market and libraries, which often showed cartoons as a prelude to the feature films they would play for children, much as they do videos now. It was a silent film, like most films produced for the home market in those days, and had dialog written on title cards, just as films of the silent era. The DVD also has the approximately eight-minute-long documentary, \"The Lone Ranger and the Peace Patrol\". Presented and narrated by Clayton Moore, it revolves around purchasing U.S. Savings Stamps, a child's version of Savings Bonds. The main focus is to get children to invest in the stamps. The narrated segment culminates with the inaugural ceremonies on the grounds of the Washington Memorial before a crowd of thousands of children and their parents.\n\n===Video game===\n{{Further|The Lone Ranger (video game)}}\n\nA [[video game]] version of ''The Lone Ranger'' was released by [[Konami]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America in [[1991 in video gaming|1991]]. It is an [[action adventure game]] featuring three different perspectives: side-scrolling, overhead, and first-person exploration. The game loosely follows the plot of the 1981 film ''The Legend of the Lone Ranger,'' with the ultimate goal being the rescue of the President of the United States, whom the Lone Ranger's nemesis, \"Butch\" Cavendish, has kidnapped.\n\n===Premiums===\n''The Lone Ranger'' program offered many [[radio premium]]s, including the Lone Ranger Six-Shooter Ring and the Lone Ranger Deputy Badge. Some used a silver bullet motif. One ring had a miniature of one of his six-guns atop it, with a flint and striking wheel, as used in cigarette lighters, so that \"fanning\" the miniature pistol would produce a shower of sparks. During [[World War II]], the premiums adapted to the times. In 1942, the program offered the [[Kix (cereal)|Kix]] Blackout Kit.\n\nSome premiums were rather [[anachronism|anachronistic]] for a 19th-century hero. In 1947, the program offered the Kix Atomic Bomb Ring, also known to collectors as the Lone Ranger Atom Bomb Ring.<ref>Reif, Rita. [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/11/arts/arts-artifacts-trivia-long-ago-serious-treasures-now.html ARTS/ARTIFACTS; Trivia Long Ago, Serious Treasures Now.] ''[[The New York Times]].'' June 11, 1995.</ref> This ring was a miniature [[spinthariscope]] that actually had a small amount of [[polonium-210]] in it, which emitted [[alpha particles]] to produce scintillations on the [[zinc sulfide]] outer part of the ring. With its tailfin piece removed, though, the \"bomb\" body looked like a silver bullet.\n\nThe sponsor was [[General Mills]], with its [[Breakfast cereal|breakfast-cereal]] products: [[Cheerios]], [[Wheaties]], and Kix. In 1947, Cheerios produced a line of Frontier Town cereal boxes with the Lone Ranger likeness on the front of the box. Different versions of the boxes would have Frontier Town buildings on their backs to cut out. One could also send in ten cents and a box-top to get each of the four map sections of the town. These, as well as nine different boxes, were needed to complete the cardboard Frontier Town.\n\n===Toys and games===\nBesides the premiums offered in connection with the radio series, there have been many Lone Ranger commercial toys released over the years. One of the most successful was a line of 10-inch action figures and accessories released by [[Gabriel Toys]] in 1973. Board games were released by Parker Brothers: The Lone Ranger Game, in 1938,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lone Ranger Game (1938) |url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14225/lone-ranger-game |website=[[BoardGameGeek]] |access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref> and The New Lone Ranger Game, in 1956.<ref>{{cite web |title=The New Lone Ranger Game (1956) |url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15831/new-lone-ranger-game |website=[[BoardGameGeek]] |access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Parodies and spoofs===\n\nIn the 1939 [[Looney Tune]] ''The Lone Stranger and Porky'', supervised by [[Bob Clampett]], the masked man comes to the rescue of stagecoach driver in distress, [[Porky Pig]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Films of Bob Clampett |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/bobclampett.html |date=1996 |website=Library, University of California, Berkeley |access-date=September 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[Hugh Harman]] made a Lone Ranger parody for [[MGM Cartoons]] titled ''The Lonesome Stranger''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOyHANu2A0U|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nJay Silverheels appeared as Tonto on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' starring [[Johnny Carson]] in a comedy sketch in which Carson is interviewing Tonto for employment. The audio portion of this sketch was included in the LP ''[[Here's Johnny: Magic Moments from the Tonight Show]]'', released by [[Casablanca Records]] in 1974.\n\nBoth Clayton Moore and Silverheels appeared as the Lone Ranger and Tonto in a commercial for [[Totino's|Jeno's Pizza Rolls]] produced by ad man/satirist [[Stan Freberg]]. The commercial was a spoof of a then-current commercial for [[Lark (cigarette)|Lark cigarettes]] which also used the ''William Tell'' overture theme music.\n\nA recorded routine by comic [[Lenny Bruce]] formed the basis for the 1971 animated cartoon, ''[[Thank You Mask Man]]'', produced by John Magnuson Associates. This was an adult humor routine, comically implying a gay relationship between the Ranger and Tonto.\n\nParody versions of The Lone Ranger (called Lonely Rider) and Tonto appear as main characters in 1971 Finnish western comedy ''[[The Unhanged]]'' (''Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t'').

For example, he enjoys a symphony concert not so much for the music, but for the atmosphere: \"the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendor.\" Later on in the story, he steals money from where he works to support a short escapade in [[New York City]].

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of tension, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful. He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad' s job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater.

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of tension, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful. He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad' s job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him.
