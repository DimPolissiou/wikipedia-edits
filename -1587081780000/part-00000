The world map called \"Freedonia\" has never been reset unlike most other survival Minecraft servers, making it the oldest running map in the game. The server is famous for extravagant builds built by hand in survival, many players join the server to see these structures. <ref>[https://www.oldest.org/entertainment/minecraft-servers] 7 Oldest Minecraft Servers</ref>\n\n== Rules ==\nUnlike most other Minecraft servers, MinecraftOnline does not have block protection outside of the spawn region. Because of this, very strict rules are needed to protect the creations of other players and make the survival experience enjoyable. Moderators and administrators are both tasked with making sure these rules are not broken.\n\n=== Rules ===\n\n# Do not grief.\n# Do not cheat.\n# Do not spam.\n\n=== Grief ===\n'''Grief''' on MinecraftOnline is an act of damaging or changing the builds of other players without given permission. Breaking a single block placed by another player can get the griefer banned.\n\n=== '''Cheating''' ===\n'''Cheating''' on MinecraftOnline means using [[Minecraft mods|client-side modifications]] or abusing glitches or exploits in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players.\n\n=== Spam ===\n'''Spam''' (including '''Flooding''') on MinecraftOnline means sending repeated or nonsensical messages in chat. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Rules|title=Category:Rules - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Freedom of speech ===\nMinecraftOnline has complete [[Freedom of speech]] and absolutely no [[censorship]]. \n\n== Hardware ==\nThe server runs on Debian Linux 7, 8x Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM, 8x i7-2600 3.4GHz. The server is located in [[Germany]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Hardware|title=Hardware - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n== Moderation ==\nIn order to protect the server, staff bans people for breaking the rules. Every block players break or place is logged. Staffs are moderators and admins. Moderators can ban and warn players, teleport to them to make sure the player is not breaking the rules. Admins have the ability to do anything in order to fix the grief. Admins can also check the logs of broken or placed blocks.

The world map called \"Freedonia\" has never been reset unlike most other survival Minecraft servers, making it the oldest running map in the game. The server is famous for extravagant builds built by hand in survival, many players join the server to see these structures. <ref>[https://www.oldest.org/entertainment/minecraft-servers] 7 Oldest Minecraft Servers</ref>\n\n== Rules ==\nUnlike most other Minecraft servers, MinecraftOnline does not have block protection outside of the spawn region. Because of this, very strict rules are needed to protect the creations of other players and make the survival experience enjoyable. Moderators and administrators are both tasked with making sure these rules are not broken.\n\n=== Rules ===\n\n# Do not grief.\n# Do not cheat.\n# Do not spam.\n\n=== Grief ===\n'''Grief''' on MinecraftOnline is an act of damaging or changing the builds of other players without given permission. Breaking a single block placed by another player can get the griefer banned.\n\n=== '''Cheating''' ===\n'''Cheating''' on MinecraftOnline means using [[Minecraft mods|client-side modifications]] or abusing glitches or exploits in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players.\n\n=== Spam ===\n'''Spam''' (including '''Flooding''') on MinecraftOnline means sending repeated or nonsensical messages in chat. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Rules|title=Category:Rules - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Freedom of speech ===\nMinecraftOnline has complete [[Freedom of speech]] and absolutely no [[censorship]]. \n\n== Hardware ==\nThe server runs on Debian Linux 7, 8x Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM, 8x i7-2600 3.4GHz. The server is located in [[Germany]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Hardware|title=Hardware - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n== Moderation ==\nIn order to protect the server, staff bans people for breaking the rules. Every block players break or place is logged. Staffs are moderators and admins. Moderators can ban and warn players, teleport to them to make sure the player is not breaking the rules. Admins have the ability to do anything in order to fix the grief. Admins can also check the logs of broken or placed blocks. Usually, moderators are banning players online, and admins clearing what moderators missed by checking logs. \n\nEvery time the player breaks or places a block, the online staff gets a message in chat. Moderators or admins then teleport to the place player broke or placed a block at, asking player a few questions if needed. \n\nStaff also gets an alert every time a player is caught cheating.\n\nPlayers usually get a warning for the first time they break a rule, repeating the action can get the player banned.

The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Despite being impacted by earthquakes in both 1906 and 1989, the campus was rebuilt each time. In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by [[Herbert Hoover]] to preserve artifacts related to [[World War I]]. The Stanford Medical Center, completed in 1959, is a teaching hospital with over 800 beds. The [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] (originally named the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University|title=Stanford University \u2013 Location, Enrollment, & Notable Alumni|publisher=britannica.com|date=December 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great eastern universities, most specifically [[Cornell University]]. Stanford opened being called the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to faculty being former Cornell affiliates (either professors, alumni, or both) including its first president, [[David Starr Jordan]]. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to have higher education be accessible, nonsectarian, and open to women as well as to men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt this radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Margo Baumgartner |last2=Nilan |first2=Roxanne |title=The Stanford Album: A Photographic History, 1885\u20131945 |date=1989 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1639-0 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe0qpzomMwkC&pg=PA14 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Land ==\n[[File:View Stanford.jpg|thumb|An [[aerial photography|aerial photograph]] of the center of the Stanford University campus in 2008.]]\n\nMost of Stanford University is on an {{convert|8180|acre|sqmi km2|1|adj=on}}<ref name=\"stanford_facts_glance\" /> campus, one of the largest in the [[United States]].{{#tag:ref|It is often stated that Stanford has the largest contiguous campus in the world (or the United States)<ref name=\"virtualtour\">{{cite web\n|url=http://web.stanford.edu/dept/visitorinfo/tours/virtual/index.html | title=Virtual Tours | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Keck|first=Gayle |title=Stanford: A Haven in Silicon Valley|url=http://www.gaylekeck.com/wp-content/uploads/Silicon-Valley-Story.pdf|publisher=Executive Travel Magazine}}</ref> but that depends on definitions.

The [[Stanford MIPS]] would go on to be commercialized as the successful [[MIPS architecture]], while [[Berkeley RISC]] gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the [[SPARC]]. Another success from this era were [[IBM]]'s efforts that eventually led to the [[IBM POWER instruction set architecture]], [[PowerPC]], and [[Power ISA]]. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the [[Unix workstation]] market as well as [[embedded processor]]s in [[laser printer]]s, [[router (computing)|routers]] and similar products.<ref name=\"coinrisk\">{{cite book|title=Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology|url=https://archive.org/details/milestonesincomp0000reil|url-access=registration|last=Reilly|first=Edwin D.|year=2003|isbn=1-57356-521-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/milestonesincomp0000reil/page/50 50]}}</ref>\n* [[SUN workstation]] \u2013 [[Andy Bechtolsheim]] designed the SUN workstation for the [[Stanford University Network]] communications project as a personal [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] workstation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i.stanford.edu/TR/CSL-TR-82-229.html|title=The SUN Workstation Architecture|author1=Andreas Bechtolsheim|author2=Forest Baskett|date=March 1982|work=Stanford University Computer systems Laboratory Technical Report No. 229|accessdate=July 5, 2018|author3=Vaughan Pratt}}</ref> which led to [[Sun Microsystems]].\n\n=== Businesses and entrepreneurship ===\n{{Main|List of companies founded by Stanford University alumni}}\nStanford is one of the most successful universities in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies; it is often held up as a model for [[technology transfer]].<ref name=Page>Nigel Page.

The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Despite being impacted by earthquakes in both 1906 and 1989, the campus was rebuilt each time. In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by [[Herbert Hoover]] to preserve artifacts related to [[World War I]]. The Stanford Medical Center, completed in 1959, is a teaching hospital with over 800 beds. The [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] (originally named the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University|title=Stanford University \u2013 Location, Enrollment, & Notable Alumni|publisher=britannica.com|date=December 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great eastern universities, most specifically [[Cornell University]]. Stanford opened being called the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to faculty being former Cornell affiliates (either professors, alumni, or both) including its first president, [[David Starr Jordan]]. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to have higher education be accessible, nonsectarian, and open to women as well as to men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt this radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Margo Baumgartner |last2=Nilan |first2=Roxanne |title=The Stanford Album: A Photographic History, 1885\u20131945 |date=1989 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1639-0 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe0qpzomMwkC&pg=PA14 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Land ==\n[[File:View Stanford.jpg|thumb|An [[aerial photography|aerial photograph]] of the center of the Stanford University campus in 2008.]]\n\nMost of Stanford University is on an {{convert|8180|acre|sqmi km2|1|adj=on}}<ref name=\"stanford_facts_glance\" /> campus, one of the largest in the [[United States]].{{#tag:ref|It is often stated that Stanford has the largest contiguous campus in the world (or the United States)<ref name=\"virtualtour\">{{cite web\n|url=http://web.stanford.edu/dept/visitorinfo/tours/virtual/index.html | title=Virtual Tours | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Keck|first=Gayle |title=Stanford: A Haven in Silicon Valley|url=http://www.gaylekeck.com/wp-content/uploads/Silicon-Valley-Story.pdf|publisher=Executive Travel Magazine}}</ref> but that depends on definitions.

The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s the board decided that 15 members was not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be just trustees and that the university president would be a trustee ex officio.<ref name=\"FoundingGrant\" /> The last original trustee, [[Timothy Hopkins]], died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D.
