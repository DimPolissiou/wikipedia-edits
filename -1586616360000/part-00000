In 1958, he came out of retirement when appointed [[Prime Minister of France|President of the Council of Ministers]] by President [[Ren\u00e9 Coty]]. He was asked to rewrite the [[Constitution of France]] and founded the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] after approval by [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum]]. He was [[List of indirect presidential elections in France|elected]] as [[President of France]] later that year, a position he was [[1965 French presidential election|reelected]] to in 1965 and held until his resignation in 1969. He was the dominant figure of France during the early part of the [[Cold War]] era; his memory continues to influence French politics.\n\nBorn in [[Lille]], he graduated from [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] in 1912. He was a decorated officer of the [[World War I|First World War]], wounded several times and later taken prisoner at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. During the [[interwar period]], he advocated mobile armoured divisions. During the German invasion of May 1940, he led an armoured division which counterattacked the invaders; he was then appointed Undersecretary for War. Refusing to accept his government's [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|armistice with Germany]], Charles de Gaulle escaped to England and exhorted the French to resist occupation and to continue the fight in his [[Appeal of 18 June]]. He led the [[Free French Forces]] and later headed the [[French Committee of National Liberation|French National Liberation Committee]] against the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. Despite frosty relations with the [[United States]], he generally had [[Winston Churchill]]'s support and emerged as the undisputed leader of the [[French Resistance]]. He became head of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] in June 1944, the interim government of France following [[Liberation of France|its Liberation]]. As early as 1944, Charles de Gaulle introduced a [[Dirigisme|dirigiste]] economic policy, which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy which was followed by 30 years of unprecedented growth, known as the [[Trente Glorieuses]].\n\nFrustrated by the return of petty partisanship in the new [[Fourth French Republic|Fourth Republic]], he resigned in early 1946 but continued to be politically active as founder of the [[Rally of the French People|Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais]] (RPF; \"Rally of the French People\"). He retired in the early 1950s and wrote his ''War Memoirs'', which quickly became a staple of modern French literature. When the [[Algerian War]] was ripping apart the unstable [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] brought him back to power during the [[May 1958 crisis (France)|May 1958 crisis]]. He founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency, and he was [[1958 French presidential election|elected]] to continue in that role. He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war, much to the anger of the [[Pied-Noir|''Pieds-Noirs'']] (ethnic French born in Algeria) and the military; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule. He granted independence to [[Algeria]] and acted progressively towards other French colonies. In the context of the Cold War, Charles de Gaulle initiated his \"politics of grandeur\" asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries, such as the United States, for its national security and prosperity. To this end, he pursued a policy of \"national independence\" which led him to withdraw from [[NATO]]'s military integrated command and to launch an independent [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development program]] that made France the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]]. He restored cordial [[Franco-German relations]] to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence through the signing of the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty]] on 22 January 1963. However, he opposed any development of a [[Supranational union|supranational Europe]], favouring Europe as a continent of [[sovereign nation]]s. Charles de Gaulle openly criticised the [[Vietnam War|United States intervention in Vietnam]] and the \"[[exorbitant privilege]]\" of the United States dollar. In his later years, his support for the slogan \"''[[Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre]]''\" and his two vetoes of Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] generated considerable controversy in both North America and Europe.\n \nAlthough reelected President of the Republic in [[1965 French presidential election|1965]], he faced widespread protests by students and workers in [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]], but had the Army's support and won an [[1968 French legislative election|election]] with an increased majority in the National Assembly. Charles de Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a [[1969 French constitutional referendum|referendum]] in which he proposed more decentralisation. He died a year later at his residence in [[Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises]], leaving his presidential memoirs unfinished. Many French political parties and figures claim a [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] legacy; many streets and monuments in France were dedicated to his memory after his death.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood and origins===\n[[File:Maison natale de Charles de Gaulle, Lille.jpg|thumb|right|Charles de Gaulle's birth house in [[Lille]], now a national museum]]\nCharles de Gaulle was born in the industrial region of [[Lille]] in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord department]], the third of five children.

Struck by his mother's tale of how she cried as a child when she heard of the French capitulation to the Germans at [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Sedan in 1870]], he developed a keen interest in military strategy. He was also influenced by his uncle, also named [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]], who was a historian and passionate [[Celticist]] who wrote books and pamphlets advocating the union of the Welsh, Scots, Irish, and [[Bretons]] into one people. His grandfather Julien-Philippe was also a historian, and his grandmother Josephine-Marie wrote poems which impassioned his Christian faith.<ref name=\"Schoenbrun\">David Schoenbrun, ''The Three Lives of Charles de Gaulle'' (1966)</ref><ref name=\"Fenby-2010\"/>{{RP|42\u201347}}\n\n===Education and intellectual influences===\nBy the time he was ten he was reading medieval history.

Equally unwelcome were the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' with Britain, the [[First Moroccan Crisis]], and above all the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. Henri de Gaulle came to be a supporter of Dreyfus, but was less concerned with his innocence ''per se'' than with the disgrace which the army had brought onto itself. The same period also saw a resurgence in evangelical Catholicism, the dedication of the [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris]] and the rise of the cult of [[Joan of Arc]].<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|50\u201351}}<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p13\"/>\n\nCharles de Gaulle was not an outstanding pupil until his mid-teens, but from July 1906 he worked harder at school as he focused on winning a place to train as an army officer at the military academy, [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]].<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp9-10\">Lacouture 1991, pp9-10</ref> Lacouture suggests that Charles de Gaulle joined the army, despite being by inclination more suited to a career as a writer and historian, partly to please his father and partly because it was one of the few unifying forces which represented the whole of French society.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp14-15\">Lacouture 1991, pp14-15</ref> He later wrote that \"when I entered the Army, it was one of the greatest things in the world\",<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|51}} a claim which Lacouture points out needs to be treated with caution: the army's reputation was at a low ebb in the early 1900s after the Dreyfus Affair. It was used extensively for strike-breaking and there were fewer than 700 applicants for St Cyr in 1908, down from 2,000 at the turn of the century.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp14-15\"/>\n\n==Early career==\n===Officer cadet and lieutenant===\nCharles de Gaulle won a place at St Cyr in 1909. His class ranking was mediocre (119th out of 221 entrants), but he was relatively young and this was his first attempt at the exam.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp9-10\"/> Under a law of 21 March 1905, aspiring army officers were required to serve a year in the ranks, including time both as a private and as an [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]], before attending the academy. Accordingly, in October 1909, Charles de Gaulle enlisted (for four years, as required, rather than the normal two-year term for [[Conscription in France|conscripts]]) in the {{ill|33rd Infantry Regiment (France)|fr|33e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie|lt=33rd Infantry Regiment}} of the [[French Army]], based at Arras.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p16-17\">Lacouture 1991, p16-17</ref> This was a historic regiment with [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] amongst its battle honours.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p16</ref> In April 1910 he was promoted to corporal.

In 1912, he graduated 13th in his class<ref>{{cite web | url=http://spartacus-educational.com/2WWdegaulle.htm | title=Charles de Gaulle}}</ref> and his passing-out report noted that he was a gifted cadet who would undoubtedly make an excellent officer.

The regiment was now commanded by Colonel (and future Marshal) [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], whom Charles de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years. He later wrote in his memoirs: \"My first colonel, P\u00e9tain, taught me the art of command\".{{r|time19590105}}<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p21\"/>\n\nIt has been claimed that in the build-up to [[World War I]], Charles de Gaulle agreed with P\u00e9tain about the obsolescence of cavalry and of traditional tactics in the age of machine guns and barbed wire, and often debated great battles and the likely outcome of any coming war with his superior.<ref name=Schoenbrun/> Lacouture is sceptical, pointing out that although P\u00e9tain wrote glowing appraisals of Charles de Gaulle in the first two-quarters of 1913, it is unlikely that he stood out among the 19 captains and 32 lieutenants under his command. Charles de Gaulle would have been present at the 1913 Arras manoeuvres, at which P\u00e9tain criticised General {{ill|Marie Alexandre \u00c9mile Hippolyte Gallet|fr|lt=Gallet}} to his face, but there is no evidence in his notebooks that he accepted P\u00e9tain's unfashionable ideas about the importance of firepower against the dominant doctrine emphasizing \"[[Attaque \u00e0 outrance|offensive spirit]]\". Charles de  Gaulle stressed how [[Maurice de Saxe]] had banned volley fire, how French armies of the [[Napoleonic period]] had relied on infantry column attack, and how French military power had declined in the nineteenth century because of \u2013 supposedly \u2013 excessive concentration on firepower (e.g. the [[Chassepot rifle]]) rather than ''[[:wikt:\u00e9lan|\u00e9lan]]''.

Here he clashed with his instructor Colonel Moyrand by arguing for tactics based on circumstances rather than doctrine, and after an exercise in which he had played the role of commander, he refused to answer a question about supplies, replying ''\"de minimis non curat praetor\"'' (\"a leader does not concern himself with trivia\") before ordering the responsible officer to answer Moyrand. He obtained respectable, but not outstanding grades \u2013 15 or so out of 20 \u2013 on many of his assessments. Moyrand wrote in his final report that he was \"an intelligent, cultured and serious-minded officer; has brilliance and talent\" but criticised him for not deriving as much benefit from the course as he should have done, and for his arrogance: his \"excessive self-confidence\", his harsh dismissal of the views of others \"and his attitude of a King in exile\". Having entered 33rd out of 129, he graduated in 52nd place, with a grade of ''assez bien'' (\"good enough\").

He had written mainly historical material, but P\u00e9tain wanted to add a final chapter of his own thoughts.

He imprisoned a soldier for appealing to his deputy ([[member of parliament]]) for a transfer to a cushier unit, and when investigated initially tried to invoke his status as a member of the ''Maison P\u00e9tain'', eventually appealing to P\u00e9tain to protect himself from a reprimand for interfering with the soldier's political rights. An observer wrote of Charles de Gaulle at this time that although he encouraged young officers, \"his ego...glowed from far off\". In the winter of 1928\u20131929, thirty soldiers (\"not counting [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annamese]]\") died from so-called \"German flu\", seven of them from Charles de Gaulle's battalion. After an investigation, he was singled out for praise in the ensuing parliamentary debate as an exceptionally capable commanding officer, and mention of how he had worn a mourning band for a private soldier who was an orphan earned an exclamation of praise from the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]].<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp90-2</ref>\n\nThe breach between Charles de Gaulle and Philippe P\u00e9tain over the ghost-writing of ''Le Soldat'' had deepened in 1928. P\u00e9tain brought in a new ghostwriter, Colonel Audet, who was unwilling to take on the job and wrote to Charles de Gaulle in some embarrassment to take over the project. P\u00e9tain was quite friendly about the matter but did not publish the book.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp84-7, 213\u20135</ref> In 1929 P\u00e9tain did not use Charles de Gaulle's draft text for his eulogy for the late [[Ferdinand Foch]], whose seat at the ''[[Academie Francaise]]'' he was assuming.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p84-7\"/>\n\nThe Allied occupation of the Rhineland was coming to an end, and Charles de Gaulle's battalion was due to be disbanded, although the decision was later rescinded after he had moved to his next posting. Charles de Gaulle wanted a teaching post at the ''\u00c9cole de Guerre'' in 1929.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p92-3</ref> There was apparently a threat of mass resignation of the faculty were he appointed to a position there.

Philippe P\u00e9tain tried to obtain an appointment for him as Professor of History there, but once again the faculty would not have him. Instead Charles de Gaulle, drawing on plans he had drawn up in 1928 for reform of that institution, asked P\u00e9tain to create a special post for him which would enable him to lecture on \"the Conduct of War\" both to the ''\u00c9cole de Guerre'' and to the ''Centre des Hautes \u00c9tudes Militaires'' (CHEM \u2013 a senior staff college for generals, known as the \"school for marshals\"), and also to civilians at the ''[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]'', and to civil servants.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p99, p118\">Lacouture 1991, p99, p118</ref>\n\nP\u00e9tain instead advised him to apply for a posting to the ''Secr\u00e9tariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de la D\u00e9fense Nationale'' (SGDN \u2013 General Secretariat of the Supreme War Council, reporting to the Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister, although later moved to the Ministry of War in 1936) in Paris. P\u00e9tain promised to lobby for the appointment, which he thought would be good experience for him.

Mayer thought that although wars were still bound to happen, it was \"obsolete\" for civilised countries to threaten or wage war on one another as they had in previous centuries. He had a low opinion of the quality of French generals, and was a critic of the [[Maginot Line]] and a proponent of mechanised warfare. Lacouture suggests that Mayer focused de Gaulle's thoughts away from his obsession with the mystique of the strong leader (''Le Fil d'Ep\u00e9e'': 1932) and back to loyalty to Republican institutions and military reform.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp. 114\u20137, 131, 154.</ref>\n\nIn 1934 de Gaulle wrote ''Vers l'Arm\u00e9e de M\u00e9tier'' (''Towards a Professional Army''). He proposed mechanization of the infantry, with stress on an \u00e9lite force of 100,000 men and 3,000 tanks. The book imagined tanks driving around the country like cavalry. De Gaulle's mentor Emile Mayer was somewhat more prophetic than he was about the future importance of air power on the battlefield. Such an army would both compensate for France's population shortage, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which forbade Germany from rearming. He also thought it would be a precursor to a deeper national reorganisation, and wrote that \"a master has to make his appearance [...] whose orders cannot be challenged \u2013 a man upheld by public opinion\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp. 133\u20135.</ref>\n\nOnly 700 copies were sold in France; the claim that thousands of copies were sold in Germany<ref name=\"time19590105\">''See, e.g.,'' {{cite news|title=Charles de Gaulle|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1958.html|newspaper=Time|date=5 January 1959}}</ref> is thought to be an exaggeration. De Gaulle used the book to widen his contacts among journalists, notably with Andr\u00e9 Pironneau, editor of ''[[L'\u00c9cho de Paris]]''. The book attracted praise across the political spectrum, apart from the hard left who were committed to the Republican ideal of a citizen army.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 136.</ref> De Gaulle's views attracted the attention of the maverick politician [[Paul Reynaud]], to whom he wrote frequently, sometimes in obsequious terms. Reynaud first invited him to meet him on 5 December 1934.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 139-46.</ref>\n\nThe de Gaulle family were very private.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 104.</ref> De Gaulle was deeply focused on his career at this time. There is no evidence that he was tempted by fascism, and there is little evidence of his views either on domestic upheavals in [[6 February 1934 crisis|1934]] and [[1936 French legislative election|1936]] or the many foreign policy crises of the decade.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp. 127\u20138, 143\u20134.</ref> He approved of the rearmament drive which the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government began in 1936, although French military doctrine remained that tanks should be used in penny packets for infantry support (ironically, in 1940 it would be German panzer units that would be used in a manner similar to what de Gaulle had advocated).<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 144.</ref> A rare insight into de Gaulle's political views is a letter to his mother warning her that war with Germany was sooner or later inevitable and reassuring her that [[Pierre Laval]]'s [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|pact with the USSR in 1935]] was for the best, likening it to [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]'s [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|alliance with the Turks]] against the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]].<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 127.</ref>\n\n====Late-1930s: tank regiment====\nFrom April 1936, whilst still in his staff position at SGDN, de Gaulle was also a lecturer to generals at CHEM.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p125\"/> De Gaulle's superiors disapproved of his views about tanks, and he was passed over for promotion to full colonel in 1936, supposedly because his service record was not good enough. He interceded with his political patron Reynaud, who showed his record to the Minister of War [[\u00c9douard Daladier]]. Daladier, who was an enthusiast for rearmament with modern weapons, ensured that his name was entered onto the promotion list for the following year.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|109}}<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp147-8</ref>\n\nIn 1937 General Bineau, who had taught him at St Cyr, wrote on his report on his lectureship at CHEM that he was highly able and suitable for high command in the future, but that he hid his attributes under \"a cold and lofty attitude\".<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p125\"/> He was put in command of the 507th Tank Regiment (consisting of a battalion of medium [[Char D2]]s and a battalion of [[Renault R35|R35 light tanks]]) at [[Metz]] on 13 July 1937, and his promotion to full colonel took effect on 24 December that year. De Gaulle attracted public attention by leading a parade of 80 tanks into the Place d'Armes at Metz, in his command tank \"[[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp149-50, 169</ref>\n\nBy now de Gaulle was beginning to be a well-known figure, known as \"Colonel Motor(s)\".<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|117}} At the invitation of the publisher [[Plon (publisher)|Plon]], he produced another book, ''La France et son Arm\u00e9e (France and Her Army)'' in 1938. De Gaulle incorporated much of the text he had written for P\u00e9tain a decade earlier for the uncompleted book ''Le Soldat'', to P\u00e9tain's displeasure. In the end, de Gaulle agreed to include a dedication to P\u00e9tain (although he wrote his own rather than using the draft P\u00e9tain sent him), which was later dropped from postwar editions. Until 1938 P\u00e9tain had treated de Gaulle, as Lacouture puts it, \"with unbounded good will\", but by October 1938 he privately thought his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \"an ambitious man, and very ill-bred\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp157-65, 213\u20135</ref>\n\n==Second World War: the Fall of France==\n===Early war===\nAt the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle was put in command of the French [[Fifth Army (France)|Fifth Army]]'s tanks (five scattered battalions, largely equipped with [[Renault R35|R35 light tanks]]) in Alsace.

Outnumbered and without air support, he lost 23 of his 90 vehicles to mines, anti-tank weapons, or [[Stuka]]s. On 18 May he was reinforced by two fresh regiments of armoured cavalry, bringing his strength up to 150 vehicles. He attacked again on 19 May and his forces were once again devastated by German Stukas and artillery. He ignored orders from General Georges to withdraw, and in the early afternoon demanded two more divisions from Touchon, who refused his request.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p180-3 on pp213-5, in a list of acts of insubordination committed by de Gaulle prior to 18 June 1940, Lacouture mentions a demand on 25 May 1940 that he be given command of an extra two or three divisions to mount a stronger attack. This does not appear in the more detailed narrative and it is not clear whether it is a confusion of the events on 19 May.</ref> Although de Gaulle's tanks forced the German infantry to retreat to [[Caumont-sur-Durance|Caumont]], the action brought only temporary relief and did little to slow the spearhead of the German advance. Nevertheless, it was one of the few successes the French enjoyed while suffering defeats elsewhere across the country.<ref name=\"Ledwidge p. 50-52\">Ledwidge pp. 50\u201352</ref><ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p180-3\">Lacouture 1991, p180-3</ref>\n\nHe delayed his retreat until 20 May. On 21 May, at the request of propaganda officers, he gave a talk on French radio about his recent attack.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p183</ref> In recognition for his efforts de Gaulle was promoted to the rank of temporary ([[Acting (rank)|acting]], in Anglophone parlance) [[Brigade general#France|brigadier-general]] on 23 May 1940. Despite being compulsorily retired as a colonel on 22 June (see below) he would wear the uniform of a brigadier-general for the rest of his life.<ref>Lacouture writes that after the war he was \"mythically a general to all eternity, but legally a retired colonel\". Early in 1946, just after his departure from office, War Minister [[Edmond Michelet]] wrote to him that Prime Minister [[F\u00e9lix Gouin]] wanted his rank to be as high as possible (which Lacouture takes to mean Marshal of France). De Gaulle wrote back that it was \"impossible to regulate a situation absolutely without precedent,\" that the situation had continued for 5 years 7 months and 3 days and that it would be \"strange, even ridiculous\" to rectify his rank for administrative reasons now. As the royalties for his War Memoirs were paid to the Anne-de-Gaulle foundation, he and his wife had to live off his pension as a retired colonel in the 1950s. His wife was reduced to selling family silverware to help make ends meet.[Lacouture Vol 2, p128, pp156-7]</ref><ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p180-3\"/>\n\nOn 28\u201329 May, de Gaulle attacked the German bridgehead south of the Somme at [[Battle of Abbeville|Abbeville]], taking around 400 German prisoners in the last attempt to cut an escape route for the Allied forces falling back on Dunkirk.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p184</ref><ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|127}}\n\nThe future General Paul Huard, who served under de Gaulle at this time, recorded how he would often stand on a piece of high ground, keeping other officers literally at six yards' distance, subjecting his subordinates to harsh criticism and making all decisions autocratically himself, behaviour consistent with his later conduct as a political leader. Lacouture points out that for all his undoubted energy and physical courage there is no evidence in his brief period of command that he possessed the \"hunter's eye\" of the great battlefield commander, and that not a single one of his officers joined him in London, although some joined the Resistance in France.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p186</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle's rank of brigadier-general became effective on 1 June 1940.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|127}} That day he was in Paris. After a visit to his tailor to be fitted for his general's uniform, he visited Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time, then the commander-in-chief [[Maxime Weygand]], who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p187\">Lacouture 1991, p187</ref> On 2 June he sent a memo to Weygand vainly urging that the French armoured divisions be consolidated from four weak divisions into three stronger ones and concentrated into an armoured [[corps]] under his command. He made the same suggestion to Reynaud.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p187\"/>\n\n===Battle of France: government minister===\nOn 5 June, the day the Germans began the second phase of their offensive ''([[Fall Rot]])'', Prime Minister Paul Reynaud appointed de Gaulle a government minister, as Under-Secretary of State for [[Minister of Defence (France)|National Defence and War]], with particular responsibility for coordination with the British.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cabinet Paul Reynaud|publisher=Assembl\u00e9e Nationale Fran\u00e7aise|year=2008|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/gvt3rep.asp#paulreynaud}}</ref> Weygand objected to the appointment, thinking him \"a mere child\".<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p190\">Lacouture 1991, p190</ref> P\u00e9tain (Deputy Prime Minister) was also displeased at his appointment and told Reynaud the story of the ghost-writing of ''Le Soldat''.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p190\"/> His appointment received a good deal of press attention, both in France and in the UK. He asked for an English-speaking aide and [[Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel]] was given the job.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p191</ref>\n\nOn 8 June de Gaulle visited Weygand, who believed it was \"the end\" and that after France was defeated Britain would also soon sue for peace. He hoped that after an armistice the Germans would allow him to retain enough of a French Army to \"maintain order\" in France. He gave a \"despairing laugh\" when de Gaulle suggested fighting on.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p193. Weygand later disputed the accuracy of de Gaulle's account of this conversation, and remarked on its similarity to a dialogue by [[Pierre Corneille]]. Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle's account is consistent with other evidence of Weygand's beliefs at the time and is therefore, allowing perhaps for a little literary embellishment, broadly plausible.</ref>\n\nOn 9 June de Gaulle flew to London and met British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] for the first time. It was thought that half a million men could be evacuated to [[French North Africa]], provided the British and French navies and air forces coordinated their efforts. Either at this meeting or on 16 June he urged Churchill in vain to throw more [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft into the Battle of France, but conceded there and then that Churchill was right to refuse.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p194</ref>\n\nIn his memoirs de Gaulle mentioned his support for the proposal to continue the war from French North Africa, but at the time he was more in favour of the plan to form a \"[[National redoubt|redoubt]]\" in Brittany than he later admitted.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p189</ref>\n\nItaly entered the war on 10 June. That day de Gaulle was present at two meetings with Weygand (he only mentions one in his memoirs), one at the defence committee and a second where Weygand barged into Reynaud's office and demanded an armistice. When Weygand asked de Gaulle, who wanted to carry on fighting, if he had \"anything to suggest\", de Gaulle replied that it was the government's job to give orders, not to make suggestions. De Gaulle wanted Paris to be stubbornly defended by [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|de Lattre]], but instead it was declared an [[open city]]. At around 23:00 Reynaud and de Gaulle left Paris for Tours; the rest of the government left Paris on 11 June.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp195-6\">Lacouture 1991, pp195-6</ref>\n\n===Battle of France: Briare and Tours===\nOn 11 June de Gaulle drove to Arcis-sur-Aube and offered General [[Charles Huntziger|Hunziger]] (Commander of the Central Army Group) Weygand's job as Commander-in-Chief. Hunziger accepted in principle (although according to Henri Massis he was merely amused at the prospect of forming a Breton redoubt \u2013 Hunziger would sign the armistice on behalf of P\u00e9tain a few weeks later) but de Gaulle was unable to persuade Reynaud to sack Weygand.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp195-6\"/>\n\nLater on 11 June de Gaulle attended the meeting of the [[Anglo-French Supreme War Council]] at the Chateau du Muguet at [[Briare]]. The British were represented by Churchill, [[Anthony Eden]], [[John Dill]], [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]] and [[Edward Spears]], and the French by Reynaud, P\u00e9tain, Weygand, and Georges. Churchill demanded that the French take to guerrilla warfare, and reminded P\u00e9tain of how he had come to the aid of the British with forty divisions in [[Spring Offensive|March 1918]], receiving a dusty answer in each case. De Gaulle's fighting spirit made a strong impression on the British. At the meeting de Gaulle met P\u00e9tain for the first time in two years. P\u00e9tain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that P\u00e9tain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914, he replied that there was \"no comparison\" with the present situation. De Gaulle later conceded that P\u00e9tain was right about that much at least.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p197</ref> De Gaulle missed the second day of the conference as he was in [[Rennes]] for a meeting (not mentioned in his memoirs) to discuss the plans for the Breton redoubt with General [[Ren\u00e9 Altmayer]]. He then returned to attend a cabinet meeting, at which it was clear that there was a growing movement for an armistice, and which decided that the government should move to [[Bordeaux]] rather than de Gaulle's preference for [[Quimper]] in Brittany.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p198</ref>\n\nOn 13 June de Gaulle attended another Anglo-French conference at Tours with Churchill, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], Spears, Ismay, and [[Alexander Cadogan]]. This time few other major French figures were present apart from Reynaud and Baudoin. He was an hour late, and his account is not reliable. Reynaud demanded that France be released from the agreement which he had made with Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] in March 1940, so that France could seek an armistice. De Gaulle wrote that Churchill was sympathetic to France seeking an armistice, provided that an agreement was reached about what was to happen to the French fleet. This claim was later made by apologists for the Vichy Regime, e.g., General Georges, who claimed that Churchill had supported the armistice as a means of keeping the Germans out of French North Africa. However, is not supported by other eyewitnesses (Churchill himself, [[Roland de Margerie]], Spears) who agree that Churchill said that he \"understood\" the French action but that he did ''not'' agree with it. He murmured at de Gaulle that he was ''\"l\u2019homme du destin (the man of destiny)\"'', although it is unclear whether de Gaulle actually heard him.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp198-200, 238</ref> At the cabinet meeting that evening P\u00e9tain strongly supported Weygand's demand for an armistice, and said that he himself would remain in France to share the suffering of the French people and to begin the national rebirth. De Gaulle was dissuaded from resigning by the Interior Minister [[Georges Mandel]], who argued that the war was only just beginning, and that de Gaulle needed to keep his reputation unsullied.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p201\">Lacouture 1991, p201</ref>\n\n===Battle of France: Franco-British Union===\nDe Gaulle arrived at Bordeaux on 14 June, and was given a new mission to go to London to discuss the potential evacuation to North Africa. He had a brief meeting with [[Francois Darlan|Admiral Darlan]] about the potential role of the French Navy. That evening, by coincidence, he dined in the same restaurant as P\u00e9tain: he went over to shake his hand in silence, the last time they ever met. Next morning no aircraft could be found so he had to drive to Brittany, where he visited his wife and daughters, and his aged mother (whom he never saw again, as she died in July), before taking a boat to Plymouth (he asked the skipper if he would be willing to carry on the war under British flag), where he arrived on 16 June. He ordered the boat ''Pasteur'', with a cargo of munitions, to be diverted to a British port, which caused some members of the French Government to call for him to be put on trial.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p201\"/>\n\nOn the afternoon of Sunday 16 June de Gaulle was at [[10 Downing Street]] for talks about [[Jean Monnet]]'s mooted [[Franco-British Union#World War II (1940)|Anglo-French political union]]. He telephoned Reynaud \u2013 they were cut off during the conversation and had to resume later \u2013 with the news that the British had agreed.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp203-4</ref> He took off from London on a British aircraft at 18:30 on 16 June (it is unclear whether, as was later claimed, he and Churchill agreed that he would be returning soon), landing at Bordeaux at around 22:00 to be told that he was no longer a minister, as Reynaud had resigned as prime minister after the Franco-British Union had been rejected by his cabinet. P\u00e9tain had become prime minister with a remit of seeking an [[armistice]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. De Gaulle was now in imminent danger of arrest.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp202-7</ref>\n\n===Flight with Edward Spears===\nDe Gaulle visited Reynaud, who still hoped to escape to French North Africa and declined to come to London. Reynaud still had control of secret government funds until the handover of power the next day. It has been suggested that he ordered de Gaulle to go to London, but no written evidence has ever been found to confirm this. Georges Mandel also refused to come.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p209-11</ref>\n\nAt around 09:00 on the morning of 17 June he flew to London on a British aircraft with [[Edward Spears]]. The escape was hair-raising. Spears claimed that de Gaulle had been reluctant to come, and that he had pulled him into the aircraft at the last minute, although de Gaulle's biographer does not accept this. Jean Laurent brought 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by Reynaud. De Gaulle later told [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] of the mental anguish which his flight to London \u2013 a break with the French Army and with the recognised government, which would inevitably be seen as treason by many \u2013 had caused him.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p211-6</ref>\n\n==Second World War: leader of the Free French in exile==\n{{See also|Free France}}\n\n===Appeal from London===\n[[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|General de Gaulle speaking on [[BBC Radio]] during the war]]\n[[File:De Gaulle - \u00e0 tous les Fran\u00e7ais.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|\"To all Frenchmen\": de Gaulle exhorting the French to resist the German occupation]]\n[[File:De Gaulle speech plaque in Arc de Triomphe.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|De Gaulle speech plaque in Arc de Triomphe]]\n\nDe Gaulle landed at [[Heston Airport]] soon after 12:30 on 17 June 1940. He saw Churchill at around 15:00 and Churchill offered him broadcast time on BBC. They both knew about P\u00e9tain's broadcast earlier that day that stated that \"the fighting must end\" and that he had approached the Germans for terms. That evening de Gaulle dined with Jean Monnet and denounced P\u00e9tain's \"treason\".<ref>Jackson, 2019, p 125-28.</ref> The next day the British Cabinet (Churchill was not present, as it was the day of his [[This was their finest hour|\"Finest Hour\" speech]]) were reluctant to agree to de Gaulle giving a radio address, as Britain was still in communication with the P\u00e9tain government about the fate of the French fleet. [[Duff Cooper]] (Minister of Information) had an advance copy of the text of the address, to which there were no objections. The cabinet eventually agreed after individual lobbying, as indicated by a handwritten amendment to the cabinet minutes.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp221-3</ref><ref name=\"CDG\"/>\n\nDe Gaulle's ''[[Appeal of 18 June]]'' exhorted the French people not to be demoralized and to continue to resist the occupation of France. He also \u2013 apparently on his own initiative \u2013 declared that he would broadcast again the next day.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p208\">Lacouture 1991, p208</ref> No recording survives of the 18 June speech. Few listened to it, although it was published in some newspapers in metropolitan (mainland) France. The speech was largely aimed at French soldiers who were then in Britain after being evacuated from [[Norwegian campaign|Norway]] and [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]; most showed no interest in fighting for de Gaulle's [[Free French Forces]] and were repatriated back to France to become German prisoners of war.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p226</ref>\n\nIn his next broadcast on 19 June de Gaulle denied the legitimacy of the government at Bordeaux.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p208\"/> He called on the North African troops to live up to the tradition of [[Bertrand Clausel]], [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]], and [[Hubert Lyautey]] by defying orders from Bordeaux. The British Foreign Office protested to Churchill.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p228</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle also tried, largely in vain, to attract the support of French forces in the French Empire. He telegraphed to General [[Charles Nogu\u00e8s]] (Resident-General in Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa), offering to serve under him or to cooperate in any way. Nogu\u00e8s, who was dismayed by the armistice but agreed to go along with it, refused to cooperate and forbade the press in French North Africa to publish de Gaulle's appeal. Nogu\u00e8s told the British liaison officer that de Gaulle's attitude was \"unseemly\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp229-30</ref> De Gaulle also sent a telegram to Weygand offering to serve under his orders, receiving a dismissive reply.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p230</ref>\n\nAfter the armistice was signed on 21 June 1940, de Gaulle spoke at 20:00 on 22 June to denounce it.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p236\">Lacouture 1991, p236</ref> The Bordeaux government declared him compulsorily retired from the French Army (with the rank of colonel) on 23 June 1940.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1:243-4\">Lacouture 1:243-4</ref> On 23 June the British Government denounced the armistice as a breach of the Anglo-French treaty signed in March, and stated that they no longer regarded the Bordeaux Government as a fully independent state. They also \"took note\" of the plan to establish a French National Committee ''(FNC)'' in exile, but did not mention de Gaulle by name. Jean Monnet broke with de Gaulle on 23 June, as he thought his appeal was \"too personal\" and went too far, and that French opinion would not rally to a man who was seen to be operating from British soil. He said he had warned the Foreign Office officials Alexander Cadogan and [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], as well as Edward Spears, of his concerns about de Gaulle. Monnet soon resigned as head of the Inter-Allied Commission and departed for the US. De Gaulle broadcast again on 24 June.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp236-7</ref>\n\n===Leader of the Free French===\nThe armistice took effect from 00:35 on 25 June.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p236\"/> Alexander Cadogan of the foreign office sent [[Gladwyn Jebb]], then a fairly junior official, to ask de Gaulle to tone down his next broadcast on 26 June; de Gaulle backed down under protest when Jebb told him that he would otherwise be banned from broadcasting. He claimed erroneously that the French fleet was to be handed over to the Germans.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p248-51</ref> On 26 June de Gaulle wrote to Churchill demanding recognition of his French Committee.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p208\"/> On 28 June, after Churchill's envoys had failed to establish contact with the French leaders in North Africa, the British Government recognised de Gaulle as leader of the Free French, despite the reservations of Halifax and Cadogan at the foreign office.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p243</ref> Cadogan later wrote that de Gaulle was \"that c*** of a fellow\", but other foreign office figures [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]] and [[Oliver Harvey, 1st Baron Harvey of Tasburgh|Oliver Harvey]] were quite sympathetic, as was ''The Times'' which gave de Gaulle plenty of coverage.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p249-50</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle had little success in attracting the support of major figures. Ambassador [[Charles Corbin]], who had strongly supported the mooted Anglo-French Union on 16 June, resigned from the French Foreign Office but retired to South America. [[Alexis Leger]], Secretary-General at the [[Quai d'Orsay]] (who hated Reynaud for sacking him) came to London but went on to the US. Roland de Margerie stayed in France despite his opposition to the armistice. De Gaulle received support from Captain Tissier and [[Andr\u00e9 Dewavrin]] (both of whom had been fighting in Norway prior to joining the Free French), [[Gaston Palewski]], [[Maurice Schumann]], and the jurist [[Ren\u00e9 Cassin]].<ref>Lacouture 1991, p239</ref>\n\nP\u00e9tain's government was recognised by the US, the USSR, and the Papacy, and controlled the French fleet and the forces in almost all her colonies. At this time de Gaulle's followers consisted of a secretary of limited competence, three colonels, a dozen captains, a famous law professor (Cassin), and three battalions of [[French Foreign Legion|legionnaires]] who had agreed to stay in Britain and fight for him. For a time the [[New Hebrides]] were the only French colony to back de Gaulle.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p244</ref> On 30 June 1940 [[\u00c9mile Muselier|Admiral Muselier]] joined the Free French.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p263\">Lacouture 1991, p263</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle initially reacted angrily to news of the Royal Navy's [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|attack on the French fleet]] (3 July); P\u00e9tain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him \"astonishingly objective\" and acknowledging that it was the right thing from the British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown \"a splendid dignity\". In his broadcast of 8 July he spoke of the \"pain and anger\" caused by the attack and that it was a \"hateful tragedy not a glorious battle\", but that one day the enemy would have used the ships against England or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean \"bondage forever\" for France. \"Our two ancient nations...remain bound to one another. They will either go down both together or both together they will win\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, p248-9</ref>\n[[File:General De Gaulle inspecting sailors on the Free French ship LEOPARD at Greenock, 24 June 1942.

His family had left Brittany (the other ship which left at the same time was sunk) and lived for a time at [[Petts Wood]]. As his daughter Anne was terrified by the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] they moved to [[Ellesmere, Shropshire|Ellesmere]] in Shropshire, a four-hour journey from London and where de Gaulle was only able to visit them once a month. His wife and daughter also lived for a time in the country at Rodinghead House, [[Little Gaddesden]], in Hertfordshire, 45 kilometres (28 miles) from central London. De Gaulle lived at the [[Connaught Hotel]] in London, then from 1942 to 1944 he lived in [[Hampstead]], North London.<ref>Lacouture 1:257\u201358</ref>\n\nThe Vichy regime had already sentenced de Gaulle to four years' imprisonment; on 2 August 1940 he was condemned to death by court martial ''in absentia'', although P\u00e9tain commented that he would ensure that the sentence was never carried out.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1:243-4\"/> De Gaulle said of the sentence, \"I consider the act of the Vichy men as void; I shall have an explanation with them after the victory\".<ref name=\"sptimes19400803\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dk8wAAAAIBAJ&pg=3148%2C219080 | title=French Take Part in Air Raids | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=1940-08-03 | accessdate=2018-08-09 | page=1}}</ref> He and Churchill reached agreement on 7 August 1940, that Britain would fund the Free French, with the bill to be settled after the war (the financial agreement was finalised in March 1941).

The British historian Christopher Flood noted that there were major differences between the speeches of de Gaulle and P\u00e9tain, which reflected their views on themselves and of France. P\u00e9tain always used the personal pronoun ''je'', portrayed himself as both a Christ-like figure sacrificing himself for France while also assuming a God-like tone of a semi-omniscient narrator who knew truths about the world that the rest of the French did not.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\">{{cite book|last1=Flood|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Holman|editor1-first=Valerie|editor2-last=Kelly|editor2-first=Debra|title=France at War in the Twentieth Century; Propaganda, Myth, and Metaphor|date=2000|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=9781571817013|pages=88\u2013110|chapter-url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HolmanFrance|accessdate=19 November 2017|chapter=P\u00e9tain and de Gaulle}}</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle began by making frequent use of \"I\" and \"me\" in his war-time speeches, but over time, their use declined. Unlike P\u00e9tain, de Gaulle never invoked quasi-religious imagery to enhance his prestige.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" />\n\nDe Gaulle always mentioned P\u00e9tain by name whereas P\u00e9tain never mentioned de Gaulle directly, referring to him as the \"''faux ami''\" (\"false friend\").<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" />\n\nP\u00e9tain exonerated the French military of responsibility for the defeat of 1940 which he blamed on the moral decline of French society (thus making his ''R\u00e9volution nationale'' necessary) while de Gaulle blamed the military chiefs while exonerating French society for the defeat (thus suggesting that French society was nowhere near as rotten as P\u00e9tain claimed, making the ''R\u00e9volution nationale'' unnecessary).<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> P\u00e9tain claimed that France had \"stupidly\" declared war on Germany in 1939 at British prompting while de Gaulle spoke of the entire era since 1914 as \"''la guerre de trente ans''\" (\"the thirty years' war\"), arguing the two world wars were really one with a long truce in between.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> The only historical figure P\u00e9tain invoked was [[Joan of Arc]] as a model of self-sacrificing French patriotism in the \"eternal struggle\" against England whereas de Gaulle invoked virtually every major French historical figure from the ancient Gauls to World War I.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> De Gaulle's willingness to invoke historical figures from before and after 1789 was meant to suggest that his France was an inclusive France where there was room for both left and right, in contrast to P\u00e9tain's demand for national unity under his leadership.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> Most significantly, P\u00e9tain's speeches always stressed the need for France to withdraw from a hostile and threatening world to find unity.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> By contrast, de Gaulle's speeches, while praising the greatness of France, lacked P\u00e9tain's implicit xenophobia; the fight for a free, democratic and inclusive France was always portrayed as part of a wider worldwide struggle for world freedom, where France would be an anchor for a new democratic order.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" />\n\nDe Gaulle spoke more of \"the Republic\" than of \"democracy\"; before his death Ren\u00e9 Cassin claimed that he had \"succeeded in turning de Gaulle towards democracy\". However, claims that de Gaulle was surrounded by [[Cagoulards]], Royalists and other right-wing extremists are untrue. Some of Andr\u00e9 Dewavrin's closest colleagues were Cagoulards, although Dewavrin always denied that he himself was. Many leading figures of the Free French and the Resistance, e.g., [[Jean Moulin]] and [[Pierre Brossolette]], were on the political left.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p254-5</ref> By the end of 1940 de Gaulle was beginning to be recognised as the leader of the Resistance, a position cemented after Jean Moulin's visit to London in autumn 1941.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p256\"/> In the summer of 1941 the BBC set aside five minutes per day (later increased to ten) for the Free French, with Maurice Schumann as the main spokesman, and eventually there was a programme \"Les Francais parlent aux Francais\". A newspaper ''France'' was also soon set up.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p250-1\"/>\n\nDe Gaulle organised the Free French Forces and the Allies gave increasing support and recognition to de Gaulle's efforts. In London in September 1941 de Gaulle formed the Free French National Council, with himself as president. It was an all-encompassing coalition of resistance forces, ranging from conservative Catholics like himself to communists. By early 1942, the \"Fighting French\" movement, as it was now called, gained rapidly in power and influence; it overcame Vichy in Syria and Lebanon, adding to its base. Dealing with the French communists was a delicate issue, for they were under Moscow's control and the USSR was friendly with Germany in 1940\u201341 as a result of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. They came into the Free French movement only when [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded Russia]] in June 1941. De Gaulle's policy then became one of friendship directly with Moscow, but [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] showed little interest.<ref>Lacouture 1:373, 462</ref> In 1942, de Gaulle created the [[Normandie-Niemen]] squadron, a [[Free French Air Force]] regiment, in order to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

As an adult he spoke German much better than he spoke English; he had thought little of the British Army's contribution to the First World War, and even less of that of 1939\u201340, and in the 1930s he had been a reader of the journal ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]'' which blamed Britain for German foreign policy gains at France's expense.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p220</ref> De Gaulle explained his position:{{quote|Never did the Anglo-Saxons really treat us as real allies. They never consulted us, government to government, on any of their provisions.

Winston Churchill was often frustrated at what he perceived as de Gaulle's patriotic arrogance, but also wrote of his \"immense admiration\" for him during the early days of his British exile. Although their relationship later became strained, Churchill tried to explain the reasons for de Gaulle's behaviour in the second volume of [[The Second World War (book series)|his history of World War II]]:{{quote|He felt it was essential to his position before the French people that he should maintain a proud and haughty demeanour towards \"[[perfidious Albion]]\", although in exile, dependent upon our protection and dwelling in our midst.

He certainly carried out this policy with perseverance.}}\n\nDe Gaulle described his adversarial relationship with Churchill in these words: \"When I am right, I get angry.

But the War Cabinet warned Churchill that a precipitate break with de Gaulle would have a disastrous effect on the whole resistance movement. By autumn 1943, Churchill had to acknowledge that de Gaulle had won the struggle for leadership of Free France.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/06/world/churchill-and-roosevelt-wanted-de-gaulle-out-britain-discloses.html \"Churchill and Roosevelt Wanted de Gaulle Out, Britain Discloses\"], ''New York Times'', 6 January 2000.</ref>\n\n[[File:Franklin D.

Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, referred to de Gaulle as \"an apprentice dictator\", a view backed by a number of leading Frenchmen in Washington, including [[Jean Monnet]], who later became an instrumental figure in the setting up of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] that led to the modern [[European Union]]. Roosevelt directed Churchill to not provide de Gaulle with strategic details of the imminent invasion because he did not trust him to keep the information to himself. French codes were considered weak, posing a risk since the Free French refused to use British or American codes.<ref name=Beevor/> De Gaulle refused to share coded information with the British, who were then obliged secretly to break the codes to read French messages.<ref>Singh, Simon (2000).

De Gaulle refused because of Roosevelt's intention to install a provisional Allied military government in the former occupied territories pending elections, but he eventually relented and flew to Britain the next day.\n\n[[File:Winston Churchill with General de Gaulle during an inspection of French troops at Marrakesh in Morocco, January 1944.

De Gaulle was very concerned that an American takeover of the French administration would just provoke a communist uprising.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nChurchill then lost his temper, saying that Britain would always be an ally to the United States, and that under the circumstances, if they had to choose between France and the US, Britain would always choose the latter. De Gaulle replied that he realised this would always be the case. The next day, de Gaulle refused to address the French nation as the script again made no mention of his being the legitimate interim ruler of France. It instructed the French people to obey Allied military authorities until elections could be held, and so the row continued, with de Gaulle calling Churchill a \"gangster\". Churchill accused de Gaulle of treason in the height of battle, and demanded that he be flown back to Algiers \"in chains if necessary\".<ref name=Beevor/>\n\nDe Gaulle and Churchill had a complex relationship during the wartime period.

Initially landing as part of [[Operation Dragoon]], in the south of France, the [[French First Army]] helped to liberate almost one third of the country and participated in the invasion and occupation of Germany. As the invasion slowly progressed and the Germans were pushed back, de Gaulle made preparations to return to France.\n\n[[File:HD-SN-99-02715.JPEG|thumb|left|General de Gaulle delivering a speech in liberated [[Cherbourg]] from the h\u00f4tel de ville (town hall)]]\n\nOn 14 June 1944, he left Britain for France for what was supposed to be a one-day trip. Despite an agreement that he would take only two staff, he was accompanied by a large entourage with extensive luggage, and although many rural Normans remained mistrustful of him, he was warmly greeted by the inhabitants of the towns he visited, such as the badly damaged [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]]. Finally he arrived at the city of [[Bayeux]], which he now proclaimed as the capital of Free France. Appointing his Aide-de-Camp Francois Coulet as head of the civil administration, de Gaulle returned to the UK that same night on a French destroyer, and although the official position of the supreme military command remained unchanged, local Allied officers found it more practical to deal with the fledgling administration in Bayeux in everyday matters.<ref name=Beevor/> De Gaulle flew to Algiers on 16 June and then went on to Rome to meet the Pope and the new Italian government. At the beginning of July he at last visited Roosevelt in Washington, where he received the 17-gun salute of a senior military leader rather than the 21 guns of a visiting head of state. The visit was 'devoid of trust on both sides' according to the French representative,<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" /> however, Roosevelt did make some concessions towards recognising the legitimacy of the Bayeux administration.\n\nMeanwhile, with the Germans retreating in the face of the Allied onslaught, harried all the way by the resistance, there were widespread instances of revenge attacks on those accused of collaboration. A number of prominent officials and members of the feared [[Milice]] were murdered, often by exceptionally brutal means, provoking the Germans into appalling reprisals, such as in the destruction of the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] and the killing of its 642 inhabitants.<ref name=Macksey>Macksey, Kenneth (1966) ''[[Purnell's History of the Second World War]]'': No. 123. \"The Liberation of Paris\"</ref>\n\nLiberation of the French capital was not high on the Allies' list of priorities as it had comparatively little strategic value, but both de Gaulle and the commander of the French 2nd Armored Division, General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Philippe Leclerc]] were still extremely concerned about a communist takeover. De Gaulle successfully lobbied for Paris to be made a priority for liberation on humanitarian grounds and obtained from Allied Supreme Commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] an agreement that French troops would be allowed to enter the capital first. A few days later, General Leclerc's division entered the outskirts of the city, and after [[Liberation of Paris|six days of fighting]] in which the resistance played a major part, the German garrison of 5000 men surrendered on 25 August, although some sporadic outbreaks of fighting continued for several days. General [[Dietrich von Choltitz]], the commander of the garrison, was instructed by Hitler to raze the city to the ground, however, he simply ignored the order and surrendered his forces.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:General Charles de Gaulle and his entourage set off from the Arc de Triumphe down the Champs Elysees.jpg|thumb|General de Gaulle and his entourage stroll down the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] following the liberation of Paris in August 1944]]\n[[File:Crowds of French patriots line the Champs Elysees-edit2.jpg|thumb|The [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd Armored Division]] passes through the [[Arc de Triomphe]].

De Gaulle made contact with Leclerc and demanded the presence of the 2nd Armoured Division to accompany him on a massed parade down the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], \"as much for prestige as for security\".<ref name=\"Second World War 1966\"/> This was in spite of the fact that Leclerc's unit was fighting as part of the American 1st Army and were under strict orders to continue their next objective without obeying orders from anyone else. In the event, the American General [[Omar Bradley]] decided that Leclerc's division would be indispensable for the maintenance of order and the liquidation of the last pockets of resistance in the French capital. Earlier, on 21 August, de Gaulle had appointed his military advisor General [[Marie-Pierre Koenig]] as Governor of Paris.\n\nAs his procession came along the Place de la Concorde on Saturday 26 August, it came under machine gun fire by Vichy militia and [[fifth column]]ists who were unable to give themselves up. Later, on entering the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] to be received as head of the provisional government by the Committee of Liberation, loud shots broke out again, and Leclerc and Koenig tried to hustle him through the door, but de Gaulle shook off their hands and never faltered. While the battle began outside, he walked slowly down the aisle. Before he had gone far a machine pistol fired down from above, at least two more joined in, and from below the [[Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Int\u00e9rieur|FFI]] and police fired back. A BBC correspondent who was present reported;\n\n{{quote|... the General is being presented to the people. He is being received...they have opened fire! ... firing started all over the place ... that was one of the most dramatic scenes I have ever seen. ... General de Gaulle walked straight ahead into what appeared to me to be a hail of fire ... but he went straight ahead without hesitation, his shoulders flung back, and walked right down the centre aisle, even while the bullets were pouring about him. It was the most extraordinary example of courage I have ever seen ... there were bangs, flashes all about him, yet he seemed to have an absolutely charmed life.<ref>''TIME'', 4 September 1944.</ref>}}\n\nLater, in the great hall of the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]], de Gaulle was greeted by a jubilant crowd and, proclaiming the continuity of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], delivered a famous proclamation;\n\n{{quote|Paris! Paris outraged, Paris broken, Paris martyred, but Paris liberated! Liberated by itself, liberated by its people with the assistance of the armies of France, with the support and assistance of the whole of France! ... The enemy is faltering but he is not yet beaten. He is still on our soil. It will not suffice that we, with the assistance of our dear and admirable allies, will have chased him from our home in order to be satisfied after what has happened. We want to enter his territory, as is fitting, as conquerors. ... It is for this revenge, this vengeance and this justice, that we will continue to fight until the last day, until the day of the total and complete victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/pendant-la-guerre-1940-1946/discours-de-l-hotel-de-ville-de-paris-25-aout-1944.php|title=Discours de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville de Paris, 25 ao\u00fbt 1944|publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127174456/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/pendant-la-guerre-1940-1946/discours-de-l-hotel-de-ville-de-paris-25-aout-1944.php|archivedate=27 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThat evening, the Wehrmacht launched a massive aerial and artillery barrage of Paris in revenge, leaving several thousand dead or injured.<ref name=\"Second World War 1966\"/> The situation in Paris remained tense, and a few days later de Gaulle, still unsure of the trend of events asked General Eisenhower to send some American troops into Paris as a show of strength.

Eisenhower, unlike Roosevelt, wanted to cooperate with de Gaulle, and he secured a last-minute promise from the President on the eve of D-Day that the Allied officers would not act as military governors and would instead cooperate with the local authorities as the Allied forces liberated French Territory. De Gaulle would later claim in his memoirs that he blocked AMGOT.<ref>Kim Munholland, ''Rock of Contention, Free French and Americans at War in New Caledonia 1940\u20131945'', Berghahn Books, New York, Oxford, 2005, p. 190.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\n[[File:The Campaign in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU158.jpg|thumb|left|General de Gaulle with General Leclerc and other French officers at Montparnasse railway station in Paris, 25 August 1944]]\n\nWith the prewar parties and most of their leaders discredited, there was little opposition to de Gaulle and his associates forming an interim administration. In order not to be seen as presuming on his position in such austere times, de Gaulle did not use one of the grand official residences such as [[Hotel de Matignon]] or the presidential palace on the Elysee, but resided briefly in his old office at the War Ministry. When he was joined by his wife and daughters a short while later, they moved into a small state-owned villa on edge of [[Bois de Boulogne]] which had once been set aside for [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]].<ref name=\"Werth\">De Gaulle. Alexander Werth (1965)</ref>\n\nLiving conditions immediately after the liberation were even worse than under German rule. About 25% of the city was in ruins and public services and fuel were almost nonexistent. Large-scale public demonstrations erupted all over France, protesting the apparent lack of action at improving the supply of food, while in Normandy, bakeries were pillaged. The problem was not French agriculture, which had largely continued operating without problems, but the near-total breakdown of the country's infrastructure. Large areas of track had been destroyed by bombing, most modern equipment, rolling stock, lorries and farm animals had been taken to Germany and all the bridges over the [[Seine]], the [[Loire]] and the [[Rhone]] between Paris and the sea had been destroyed. The black market pushed real prices to four times the level of 1939, causing the government to print money to try to improve the money supply, which only added to inflation.<ref name=Werth/>\n\nOn 10 November 1944, Churchill flew to Paris to a reception by de Gaulle and the two together were greeted by thousands of cheering Parisians on the next day.<ref name=\"winstonchurchill.org\"/> [[Harold Nicolson]] stated that [[Anthony Eden]] told him that \"not for one moment did Winston stop crying, and that he could have filled buckets by the time he received the Freedom of Paris.\"<ref name=\"winstonchurchill.org\"/> He said \"they yelled for Churchill in a way that he has never heard any crowd yell before.\" At an official luncheon, de Gaulle said, \"It is true that we would not have seen [the liberation] if our old and gallant ally England, and all the British dominions under precisely the impulsion and inspiration of those we are honouring today, had not deployed the extraordinary determination to win, and that magnificent courage which saved the freedom of the world. There is no French man or woman who is not touched to the depths of their hearts and souls by this.\"<ref name=\"winstonchurchill.org\"/>\n\n===Curbing the Communist Resistance===\nAfter the celebrations had died down, de Gaulle began conferring with leading Resistance figures who, with the Germans gone, intended to continue as a political and military force, and asked to be given a government building to serve as their headquarters. The Resistance, in which the Communists were competing with other trends for leadership, had developed its own manifesto for social and political change known as the [[National Council of the Resistance]] (CNR) Charter, and wanted special status to enter the army under their own flags, ranks and honours. Despite their decisive support in backing him against Giraud, de Gaulle disappointed some of the Resistance leaders by telling them that although their efforts and sacrifices had been recognised, they had no further role to play and, that unless they joined the regular army, they should lay down their arms and return to civilian life.<ref name=Werth />\n\nBelieving them to be a dangerous revolutionary force, de Gaulle moved to break up the liberation committees and other militias. The communists were not only extremely active, but they received a level of popular support that disturbed de Gaulle. As early as May 1943, the US Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] had written to Roosevelt urging him to take action to attempt to curb the rise of communism in France.<ref name=Schoenbrun/>\n\n===Provisional Government of the French Republic===\nOn 10 September 1944 the Provisional Government of the French Republic, or Government of National Unanimity formed. It included many of de Gaulle's Free French associates such as [[Gaston Palewski]], Claude Guy, [[Claude Mauriac]] and [[Jacques Soustelle]], together with members of the main parties, which included the [[French Section of the Workers' International|Socialists]] and a new Christian Democratic Party, the MRP under the leadership of Georges Bidault, who served as Foreign Minister. The president of the prewar Senate [[Jules Jeanneney]] was brought back as second-ranking member, but because of their links with Russia, de Gaulle allowed the Communists only two minor positions in his government. While they were now a major political force with over a million members, of the full cabinet of 22 men, only Augustin Laurent and [[Charles Tillon]]\u2014who as head of [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]] had been one of the most active members of the resistance\u2014were given ministries. However, de Gaulle did pardon the Communists' leader [[Maurice Thorez]], who had been sentenced to death ''in absentia'' by the French government for desertion. On his return home from Russia, Thorez delivered a speech supporting de Gaulle in which he said that for the present, the war against Germany was the only task that mattered.\n\nThere were also a number of new faces in the government, including a literary academic, [[Georges Pompidou]], who had written to one of de Gaulle's recruiting agents offering his services, and Jean Monnet, who in spite of his past opposition to the General now recognized the need for unity and served as Commissioner for Economic Planning. Of equal rank to ministers and answerable only to the prime minister, a number of Commissioners of the Republic (Commissaires de la R\u00e9publique) were appointed to re-establish the democratic institutions of France and to extend the legitimacy of the provisional government. A number of former Free French associates served as commissioners, including [[Henri Fr\u00e9ville]], [[Raymond Aubrac]] and [[Michel Debr\u00e9]], who was charged with reforming the civil service. Controversially, de Gaulle also appointed [[Maurice Papon]] as Commissioner for Aquitaine in spite of his involvement in the deportation of Jews while serving as a senior police official in the Vichy regime during the occupation. (Over the years, Papon remained in high official positions but continued to be implicated in controversial events such as the [[Paris massacre of 1961]],<ref>''Daily Mail'', 22 October 2011.</ref> eventually being convicted of crimes against humanity in 1998.)\n\nIn social policy, legislation was introduced{{by whom|date=January 2016}} in February 1945 that provided for the establishment of works committees in all private industrial establishments employing more than 50 (originally more than 100) people.<ref>Chambers Encyclopaedia new edition, Volume V: Edward-Franks, George Newnes Ltd. 1959, supplementary information 1961, printed and bound in England by Hazel Watson and Viney Ltd., Aylesbury and Slough.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\n===Tour of major cities===\nDe Gaulle's policy was to postpone elections as long as 2.6&nbsp;million French were in Germany as prisoners of war and forced laborers. In mid-September, he embarked upon a tour of major provincial cities to increase his public profile and to help cement his position. Although he received a largely positive reception from the crowds who came out to see him, he reflected that only a few months previously the very same people had come out to cheer Marshal P\u00e9tain when he was serving the Vichy regime. Raymond Aubrac said that the General showed himself to be ill-at-ease at social functions; in [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]] he became irate when he had to sit next to former Resistance leaders and also voiced his distaste for the rowdy, libidinous behavior of French youths during the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquisard]] parades which preceded his speech.<ref name=Werth /> When he reached [[Toulouse]], de Gaulle also had to confront the leaders of a group which had proclaimed themselves to be the provincial government of the city.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nDuring the tour, de Gaulle showed his customary lack of concern for his own safety by mixing with the crowds and thus making himself an easy target for an assassin. Although he was naturally shy, the good use of amplification and patriotic music enabled him to deliver his message that though all of France was fragmented and suffering, together they would rise again. During every speech he would stop halfway through to invite the crowd to join him in singing ''La Marseillaise'', before continuing and finishing by raising his hands in the air and crying \"Vive la France!\"<ref name=Werth/>\n\n===Legal purges (\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale)===\nAs the war entered the final stages, the nation was forced to confront the reality of how many of its people had behaved under German rule. In France, collaborators were more severely punished than in most other occupied countries.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Perry, K. (1976) ''Modern European History'', W.H. Allen; {{ISBN|0750604824}}</ref> Immediately after the liberation, countless women accused of aiding, abetting, and taking German soldiers as lovers were subjected to public humiliations such as being shaved bald and paraded through the streets in their underwear. Women who got this treatment were lucky as many others were simply attacked by lynch mobs. With so many of their former members having been hunted down and killed by the Nazis and paramilitary Milice, the Partisans had already summarily executed an estimated 4,500 people,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and the Communists in particular continued to press for severe action against collaborators. In Paris alone, over 150,000 people were at some time detained on suspicion of collaboration, although most were later released. Famous figures accused included the industrialist [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]], the actress [[Arletty]], who had lived openly with a German officer in [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris|the Ritz]], the opera star [[Tino Rossi]], the chanteuse [[\u00c9dith Piaf]], the stage actor [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Coco Chanel]], who was briefly detained but fled to Switzerland.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nKeenly aware of the need to seize the initiative and to get the process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister [[Fran\u00e7ois de Menthon]] to lead the Legal Purge ([[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale]]) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'\u2014such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy in order to keep the country running as normally as possible\u2014he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" /> Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down.<ref name=Werth /> It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government\u2014such as Maurice Papon and [[Ren\u00e9 Bousquet]]\u2014escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.<ref name=Werth />\n\nLater, there was the question of what to do with the former Vichy leaders when they were finally returned to France. Marshal P\u00e9tain and [[Maxime Weygand]] were war heroes from World War I and were now extremely old; convicted of treason, P\u00e9tain received a death sentence which his old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 de Gaulle commuted to life imprisonment, while Weygand was eventually acquitted. Three Vichy leaders were executed. [[Joseph Darnand]], who became an SS officer and led the Milice paramilitaries who hunted down members of the Resistance, was executed in October 1945. [[Fernand de Brinon]], the third-ranking Vichy official, was found guilty of war crimes and executed in April 1947. The two trials of the most infamous collaborator of all, [[Pierre Laval]], who was heavily implicated in the murder of Jews, were widely criticised as being unfair for depriving him of the opportunity to properly defend himself, although Laval antagonized the court throughout with his bizarre behavior. He was found guilty of treason in May 1945 and de Gaulle was adamant that there would be no commuting the death sentence, saying that Laval's execution was \"an indispensable symbolic gesture required for reasons of state\". There was a widespread belief, particularly in the years that followed, that de Gaulle was trying to appease both the Third Republic politicians and the former Vichy leaders who had made Laval their scapegoat.<ref name=Werth/>\n\n===Winter of 1944===\nThe winter of 1944{{ndash}}45 was especially difficult for most of the population. Inflation showed no sign of slowing down and food shortages were severe. The prime minister and the other Gaullists were forced to try to balance the desires of ordinary people and public servants for a return to normal life with pressure from Bidault's MRP and the Communists for the large scale nationalisation programme and other social changes that formed the main tenets of the CNR Charter. At the end of 1944 the coal industry and other energy companies were nationalised, followed shortly afterwards by major banks and finance houses, the merchant navy, the main aircraft manufacturers, airlines and a number of major private enterprises such as the [[Renault]] car company at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], whose owner had been implicated as a collaborator and accused of having made huge profits working for the Nazis.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" /> In some cases, unions, feeling that things were not progressing quickly enough, took matters into their own hands, occupying premises and setting up workers' committees to run the companies.<ref name=Werth /> Women were also allowed the vote for the first time, a new social security system was introduced to cover most medical costs, unions were expanded and price controls introduced to try to curb inflation. At de Gaulle's request, the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' was founded in December 1944 to provide France with a quality daily journal similar to those in other countries. ''Le Monde'' took over the premises and facilities of the older ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', whose independence and reputation had been badly compromised during the Vichy years.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nDuring this period there were a number of minor disagreements between the French and the other Allies. The British ambassador to France [[Duff Cooper, 1st Viscount Norwich|Duff Cooper]] said that de Gaulle seemed to seek out real or imagined insults to take offence at whatever possible.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" /> De Gaulle believed Britain and the US were intending to keep their armies in France after the war and were secretly working to take over its overseas possessions and to prevent it from regaining its political and economic strength. In late October he complained that the Allies were failing to adequately arm and equip the new French army and instructed Bidault to use the French veto at the European Council.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nOn Armistice Day in 1945, Winston Churchill made his first visit to France since the liberation and received a good reception in Paris where he laid a wreath to [[Georges Clemenceau]]. The occasion also marked the first official appearance of de Gaulle's wife Yvonne, but the visit was less friendly than it appeared. De Gaulle had instructed that there be no excessive displays of public affection towards Churchill and no official awards without his prior agreement. When crowds cheered Churchill during a parade down the Elysee, de Gaulle was heard to remark, \"Fools and cretins! Look at the rabble cheering the old bandit\".<ref name=Werth />\n\n===Visit to the Soviet Union===\nWith the Russian forces making more rapid advances into German-held territory than the Allies, there was a sudden public realisation that the Soviet Union was about to dominate large parts of eastern Europe. In fact, at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo]] and [[Tehran Conference]]s in 1943 Britain and America had already agreed to allow Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary to fall under the Soviet sphere of influence after the war, with shared influence in Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Robottom\">Robottom, John (1972) ''Modern Russia'', McGraw-Hill</ref> The UK was to retain hegemony over Greece, although there had been no agreement over Poland, whose eastern territories were already in Soviet hands under the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, and which retained a government in exile in London.<ref name=Robottom/> De Gaulle had not been invited to any of the '[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]' Conferences, although the decisions made by Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt in dividing up Europe were of huge importance to France.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nDe Gaulle and his Foreign Minister Bidault stated that they were not in favour of a 'Western Bloc' that would be separate from the rest of Europe, and hoped that a resurgent France might be able to act as a 'third force' in Europe to temper the ambitions of the two emerging superpowers, America and Soviet Union.<ref name=Schoenbrun/> He began seeking an audience with Stalin to press his 'facing both ways' policy, and finally received an invitation in late 1944. In his memoirs, de Gaulle devoted 24 pages to his visit to the Soviet Union, but a number of writers make the point that his version of events differs significantly from that of the Soviets, of foreign news correspondents, and with their own eyewitness accounts.<ref name=Schoenbrun/><ref name=Werth/>\n\nDe Gaulle wanted access to German coal in the [[Ruhr]] as reparations after the war, the left bank of the Rhine to be incorporated into French territory, and for the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in Poland to become Germany's official eastern border. De Gaulle began by requesting that France enter into a treaty with the Soviet Union on this basis, but Stalin, who remained in constant contact with Churchill throughout the visit, said that it would be impossible to make such an agreement without the consent of Britain and America. He suggested that it might be possible to add France's name to the existing [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] if they agreed to recognise the Soviet-backed provisional Polish government known as the [[Lublin Committee]] as rightful rulers of Poland, but de Gaulle refused on the grounds that this would be 'un-French', as it would mean it being a junior partner in an alliance.<ref name=Schoenbrun /> During the visit, de Gaulle accompanied the deputy Soviet leader [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] on a tour of the former battleground at [[Stalingrad]], where he was deeply moved at the scene of carnage he witnessed and surprised Molotov by referring to \"our joint sacrifice\".<ref name=Schoenbrun />\n\nThough the treaty which was eventually signed by Bidault and Molotov carried symbolic importance in that it enabled de Gaulle to demonstrate that he was recognised as the official head of state and show that France's voice was being heard abroad, it was of little relevance to Stalin due to France's lack of real political and military power; it did not affect the outcome of the post-war settlement. Stalin later commented that like Churchill and Roosevelt, he found de Gaulle to be awkward and stubborn and believed that he was 'not a complicated person' (by which he meant that he was an old-style nationalist).<ref name=Schoenbrun /> Stalin also felt that he lacked realism in claiming the same rights as the major powers and did not object to Roosevelt's refusal to allow de Gaulle to attend the 'Big Three' conferences that were to come at Yalta and Potsdam.\n\n===Strasbourg===\nAt the end of 1944 French forces continued to advance as part of the American armies, but during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] there was a dispute over Eisenhower's order to French troops to evacuate [[Strasbourg]], which had just been liberated so as to straighten the defensive line against the German counterattack.<ref name=Schoenbrun /> Strasbourg was an important political and psychological symbol of French sovereignty in [[Alsace and Lorraine]], and de Gaulle, saying that its loss would bring down the government, refused to allow a retreat, predicting that \"Strasbourg will be our Stalingrad\".<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nBy early 1945 it was clear that the price controls which had been introduced to control inflation had only served to boost the black market and prices continued to move ever upwards. By this time the army had swelled to over 1.2&nbsp;million men and almost half of state expenditure was going to military spending.<ref name=Werth/> De Gaulle was faced with his first major ministerial dispute when the very able but tough-minded economics minister [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France]] demanded a programme of severe monetary reform which was opposed by the Finance Ministry headed by [[Aim\u00e9 Lepercq|Aime Lepercq]], who favoured a programme of heavy borrowing to stimulate the economy.<ref name=Werth /> When de Gaulle, knowing there would be little appetite for further austerity measures sided with Lepercq, Mend\u00e8s France tendered his resignation, which was rejected because de Gaulle knew he needed him. Lepercq was killed in a road accident a short time afterwards and was succeeded by Pleven, but when in March, Mend\u00e8s France asked unsuccessfully for taxes on capital earnings and for the blocking of certain bank accounts, he again offered his resignation and it was accepted.<ref name=Werth />\n\n===Yalta Conference===\n\nDe Gaulle was never invited to the summit conferences of Allied leaders such as [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]]. He never forgave the Big Three leaders (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin) for their neglect and continued to rage against it as having been a negative factor in European politics for the rest of his life.<ref name=Schoenbrun />\n\nAfter the [[Operation Plunder|Rhine crossings]], the French First Army captured a large section of territory in southern Germany, but although this later allowed France to play a part in the signing of the German surrender, Roosevelt in particular refused to allow any discussion about de Gaulle participating in the Big Three conferences that would shape Europe in the post-war world. Churchill pressed hard for France to be included 'at the inter-allied table', but on 6 December 1944 the American president wired both Stalin and Churchill to say that de Gaulle's presence would \"merely introduce a complicating and undesirable factor\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Winston S. Churchill|title=Triumph and Tragedy: The Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VArC_rYqimoC&pg=PA259|year=1950|page=259|isbn=9780795311475}}</ref>\n\nAt the Yalta Conference in February 1945, despite Stalin's opposition, Churchill and Roosevelt insisted that France be allowed a post-war occupation zone in Germany, and also made sure that it was included among the five nations that invited others to the conference to establish the United Nations.<ref name=Robottom /> This was important because it guaranteed France a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]], a prestigious position that, despite pressure from emerging nations, it still holds today.\n\n===President Truman===\nOn his way back from Yalta, Roosevelt asked de Gaulle to meet him in Algiers for talks. The General refused, believing that there was nothing more to be said, and for this he received a rebuke from [[Georges Bidault]] and from the French press, and a severely angered Roosevelt criticised de Gaulle to Congress. Soon after, on 12 April 1945, Roosevelt died, and despite their uneasy relationship de Gaulle declared a week of mourning in France and forwarded an emotional and conciliatory letter to the new American president, [[Harry S. Truman]], in which he said of Roosevelt, \"all of France loved him\".<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nDe Gaulle's relationship with Truman was to prove just as difficult as it had been with Roosevelt. With Allied forces advancing deep into Germany, another serious situation developed between American and French forces in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]], when French soldiers were ordered to transfer the occupation zones to US troops. Wishing to retain as much German territory in French hands as possible, de Gaulle ordered his troops, who were using American weapons and ammunition, to resist, and an armed confrontation seemed imminent.<ref name=Werth /> Truman threatened to cut off supplies to the French army and to take the zones by force, leaving de Gaulle with little choice but to back down. De Gaulle never forgave Truman and hinted he would work closely with Stalin, leading Truman to tell his staff, \"I don't like the son of a bitch.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Offner|first=Arnold A.|title=Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945\u20131953|url=https://archive.org/details/anothersuchvicto00offn|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anothersuchvicto00offn/page/50 50]\u201351|isbn=9780804747745}}</ref>\n\nThe first visit by de Gaulle to Truman in the U.S. was not a success. Truman told his visitor that it was time that the French got rid of the Communist influence from its government, to which de Gaulle replied that this was France's own business.<ref name=Schoenbrun /> But Truman, who admitted that his feelings towards the French were becoming 'less and less friendly', went on to say that under the circumstances, the French could not expect much economic aid and refused to accept de Gaulle's request for control of the west bank of the Rhine. During the argument which followed, de Gaulle reminded Truman that the US was using the French port of [[Noum\u00e9a]] in [[New Caledonia]] as a base against the Japanese.<ref name=Schoenbrun />\n\n===Victory in Europe===\n\nIn May 1945 the German armies surrendered to the Americans and British at Rheims, and a separate armistice was signed with France in Berlin.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> De Gaulle refused to allow any British participation in the victory parade in Paris. However, among the vehicles that took part was an ambulance from the [[Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit]], staffed by French doctors and British nurses. One of the nurses was Mary Spears, who had set up the unit and had worked almost continuously since the [[Battle of France]] with Free French forces in the Middle East, North Africa and Italy. Mary's husband was General [[Edward Spears]], the British liaison to the Free French who had personally spirited de Gaulle to safety in Britain in 1940. When de Gaulle saw the [[Union Flag]]s and [[Flag of France|Tricolours]] side by side on the ambulance, and heard French soldiers cheering, \"Voil\u00e0 Spears! Vive Spears!\", he ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British staff sent home. A number of French troops returned their medals in protest and Mary wrote, \"it is a pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small.\"<ref>''The Day the War Ended''. London. Martin Gilbert (1995)</ref>\n\nAnother confrontation with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of [[Val d'Aoste]]. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France. Truman sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France.<ref name=Schoenbrun/>\n\nHowever, de Gaulle was generally well received in the United States immediately after World War II and supported the United States in public comments. He visited New York City on 27 August 1945 to great welcome by thousands of people of the city and its mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]].<ref name=\"wnyc.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/charles-de-gaulle-city-hall-reception/|title=Charles de Gaulle City Hall Reception|publisher=WNYC|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"gettyimages.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/french-general-charles-de-gaulle-flanked-by-new-york-mayor-news-photo/102263730 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140814192955/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/french-general-charles-de-gaulle-flanked-by-new-york-mayor-news-photo/102263730 |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On that day, de Gaulle wished \"Long live the United States of America\".

A dispute with Britain over control of Syria and Lebanon quickly developed into an unpleasant diplomatic incident that demonstrated France's weaknesses. In May, de Gaulle sent General Beynet to establish an air base in Syria and a naval base in Lebanon, provoking an outbreak of nationalism in which some French nationals were attacked and killed. On 20 May, French artillery and warplanes fired on demonstrators in [[Damascus]]. After several days, upwards of 800 Syrians lay dead.<ref>{{cite book|author=Meir Zamir|title=The Secret Anglo-French War in the Middle East: Intelligence and Decolonization, 1940\u20131948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE6cBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA126|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=126\u201334|isbn=9781317657408}}</ref>\n\nChurchill's relationship with de Gaulle was now at rock bottom. In January he told a colleague that he believed that de Gaulle was \"a great danger to peace and for Great Britain. After five years of experience, I am convinced that he is the worst enemy of France in her troubles ... he is one of the greatest dangers to European peace.... I am sure that in the long run no understanding will be reached with General de Gaulle\".<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|287}}\n\nOn 31 May, Churchill told de Gaulle \"immediately to order French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks\". British forces moved in and forced the French to withdraw from the city; they were then escorted and confined to barracks.<ref name=\"Wall\">Wall p. 33</ref> With this political pressure added, the French ordered a ceasefire; De Gaulle raged but France was isolated and suffering a diplomatic humiliation. The secretary of the [[Arab League]] [[Edward Atiyah]] said, \"France put all her cards and two rusty pistols on the table\".<ref>''TIME'' 25 June 1945</ref> De Gaulle saw it as a heinous [[Anglo-Saxon]] conspiracy: he told the British ambassador [[Duff Cooper]], \"I recognise that we are not in a position to wage war against you, but you have betrayed France and betrayed the West.

However, the resistance leaders in Indo-China proclaimed the freedom and independence of Vietnam, and [[First Indochina War|a civil war]] broke out that lasted until France was defeated in 1954.<ref>Stein T\u00f8nnesson, ''The Vietnamese revolution of 1945: Roosevelt, Ho Chi Minh, and De Gaulle in a world at war'' (Sage, 1991).</ref>\n\n===New elections and resignation===\nSince the liberation, the only parliament in France had been an enlarged version of the Algiers Consultative Assembly, and at last, in October 1945, elections were held for a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. De Gaulle favoured a strong executive for the nation,{{r|time19590105}} but all three of the main parties wished to severely restrict the powers of the president. The Communists wanted an assembly with full constitutional powers and no time limit, whereas de Gaulle, the Socialists and the [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) advocated one with a term limited to only seven months, after which the draft constitution would be submitted for another referendum.<ref>Hilary Footitt and John Simmonds. ''France, 1943\u20131945'' (1988) pp 228\u201359.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1945 French legislative election|election]], the second option was approved by 13 million of the 21&nbsp;million voters. The big three parties won 75% of the vote, with the Communists winning 158 seats, the MRP 152 seats, the Socialists 142 seats and the remaining seats going to the various far right parties.\n\nOn 13 November 1945, the new assembly unanimously elected Charles de Gaulle head of the government, but problems immediately arose when it came to selecting the cabinet, due to his unwillingness once more to allow the Communists any important ministries. The Communists, now the largest party and with their charismatic leader Maurice Thorez back at the helm, were not prepared to accept this for a second time, and a furious row ensued, during which de Gaulle sent a letter of resignation to the speaker of the Assembly and declared that he was unwilling to trust a party that he considered to be an agent of a foreign power (Russia) with authority over the police and armed forces of France.<ref name=Schoenbrun/>\n\nEventually, the new cabinet was finalised on 21 November, with the Communists receiving five out of the twenty-two ministries, and although they still did not get any of the key portfolios. De Gaulle believed that the draft constitution placed too much power in the hands of parliament with its shifting party alliances. One of his ministers said he was \"a man equally incapable of monopolizing power as of sharing it\".<ref>Ronald Matthews, ''The death of the Fourth Republic'' (1954)p 121.</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle outlined a programme of further nationalisations and a new economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when the Communists demanded a 20 percent reduction in the military budget. Refusing to \"rule by compromise\", de Gaulle once more threatened to resign. There was a general feeling that he was trying to blackmail the assembly into complete subservience by threatening to withdraw his personal prestige which he insisted was what alone kept the ruling coalition together.<ref name=Werth/> Although the MRP managed to broker a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments, it was little more than a stop-gap measure.<ref name=Schoenbrun/>\n\nBarely two months after forming the new government, de Gaulle abruptly resigned on 20 January 1946. The move was called \"a bold and ultimately foolish political ploy\", with de Gaulle hoping that as a war hero, he would be soon brought back as a more powerful executive by the French people.<ref name=\"Hitchcock 2004 112\">{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Europe: The Turbulent History of a Divided Continent 1945 to the Present|first=William I.|last=Hitchcock|publisher=Random House|year=2004|isbn=978-0-385-49799-2|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fFfhnC4mYccC&pg=PT112}}</ref> However, that did not turn out to be the case. With the war finally over, the initial period of crisis had passed. Although there were still shortages, particularly of bread, France was now on the road to recovery, and de Gaulle suddenly did not seem so indispensable.

Despite the new party's taking 40 percent of the vote in local elections and 121 seats in 1951, lacking its own press and access to television, its support ebbed away. In May 1953, he withdrew again from active politics,{{r|time19590105}} though the ''RPF'' lingered until September 1955.<ref name=\"Grolier\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_degaulle.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223083920/http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_degaulle.html|archivedate=23 February 2005|title=Charles de Gaulle|work=Grolier Online}}</ref>\n\nAs with all colonial powers France began to lose its overseas possessions amid the surge of nationalism.  [[French Indochina]] (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century, had been lost to the Japanese after the defeat of 1940. De Gaulle had intended to hold on to France's Indochina colony, ordering the parachuting of French agents and arms into Indochina in late 1944 and early 1945 with orders to attack the Japanese as American troops hit the beaches.<ref>Karnow pp. 143\u20134</ref> Although de Gaulle had moved quickly to consolidate French control of the territory during his brief first tenure as president in the 1940s, the communist [[Vietminh]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]] began a determined campaign for independence from 1946 onwards. The French fought a bitter seven-year war (the [[First Indochina War]]) to hold on to Indochina. It was largely funded by the United States and grew increasingly unpopular, especially after the stunning defeat at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]]. France pulled out that summer under Prime Minister [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France]].\n\nThe independence of Morocco and Tunisia was arranged by Mend\u00e8s France and proclaimed in March 1956. Meanwhile, in Algeria some 350,000 French troops were fighting 150,000 combatants of the Algerian Liberation Movement (FLN). Within a few years, the Algerian war of independence reached a summit in terms of savagery and bloodshed and threatened to spill into metropolitan France itself.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1958 the Fourth Republic had 24 separate ministries. Frustrated by the endless divisiveness, de Gaulle famously asked \"How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?\"<ref>''Time'', 16 March 1962</ref>\n\n===1958: Collapse of the Fourth Republic===\n{{Further|May 1958 crisis}}\n\nThe [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] was wracked by political instability, failures in [[French Indochina|Indochina]], and inability to resolve the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian question]].<ref>Charles Sowerwine, France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic (2009) ch 20\u201321</ref><ref>Martin S.

As a journalist expressed the concerns of some who feared that he would violate civil liberties, de Gaulle retorted vehemently: \"Have I ever done that?

He is sometimes described as the author of the [[Constitution of France|new constitution]], as he commissioned it and was responsible for its overall framework. The actual drafter of the text was [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] who wrote up de Gaulle's political ideas and guided the text through the enactment process.

It became, for the next ten years, a favourite political rallying cry of de Gaulle's. His vision stood in contrast to the [[Atlanticism]] of the United States and Britain, preferring instead a Europe that would act as a third [[polarity (power)|pole]] between the United States and the Soviet Union. By including in his ideal of Europe all the territory up to the Urals, de Gaulle was implicitly offering [[d\u00e9tente]] to the Soviets.\nAs the last chief of government of the Fourth Republic, de Gaulle made sure that the [[Treaty of Rome]] creating the [[European Economic Community]] was fully implemented, and that the British project of Free Trade Area was rejected, to the extent that he was sometimes considered as a \"Father of Europe\"<ref>Warlouzet, 'De Gaulle as a Father of Europe' in ''Contemporary European History'', 2011 [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/contemporary-european-history/article/de-gaulle-as-a-father-of-europe-the-unpredictability-of-the-ftas-failure-and-the-eecs-success-195658/A2D1FB241EA0C9675E326029F1C8BFC0]</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n{{further|Algerian War}}\n[[File:French Community 1959.svg|thumb|250px|The [[French Community]] in 1959]]\nUpon becoming president, de Gaulle was faced with the urgent task of finding a way to bring to an end the bloody and divisive war in Algeria.<ref>Charles Sowerwine, ''France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic'' (2009) pp 296\u2013316</ref> His intentions were obscure. He had immediately visited Algeria and declared, ''Je vous ai compris''\u2014'I have understood you', and each competing interest had wished to believe it was them that he had understood. The settlers assumed he supported them, and would be stunned when he did not. In Paris, the left wanted independence for Algeria. Although the military's near-coup had contributed to his return to power, de Gaulle soon ordered all officers to quit the rebellious Committees of Public Safety. Such actions greatly angered the pieds-noirs and their military supporters.<ref>Alexander Harrison, ''Challenging De Gaulle: The OAS and the Counterrevolution in Algeria, 1954\u20131962'' (Praeger, 1989).</ref>\n\nHe faced uprisings in Algeria by the pied-noirs and the French armed forces. On assuming the prime minister role in June 1958 he immediately went to Algeria, and neutralised the army there, with its 600,000 soldiers. The Algiers Committee of Public Safety was loud in its demands on behalf of the settlers, but de Gaulle made more visits and sidestepped them. For the long term he devised a plan to modernize Algeria's traditional economy, deescalated the war, and offered Algeria self-determination in 1959. A [[Algerian War#The week of barricades|pied-noir revolt in 1960]] failed, while another [[Algiers putsch of 1961|attempted coup]] failed in April 1961. French voters approved his course in [[French referendum on Algerian self-determination, 1961|a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination]]. De Gaulle arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 [[Evian Accords]], legitimated by another [[1962 French \u00c9vian Accords referendum|referendum]] a month later. It gave victory to the FLN, which came to power and declared independence.

France recognised Algerian independence on 3 July 1962, while a blanket amnesty law was belatedly voted in 1968, covering all crimes committed by the French army during the war. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'' left the country.

Germany was in an even worse position, but after 1948 things began to improve dramatically with the introduction of [[Marshall Aid]]\u2014large scale American financial assistance given to help rebuild European economies and infrastructure. This laid the foundations of a meticulously planned program of investments in energy, transport and heavy industry, overseen by the government of Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]].\n\nIn the context of a population boom unseen in France since the 18th century, the government intervened heavily in the economy, using ''[[dirigisme]]''\u2014a unique combination of free-market and state-directed economy\u2014with indicative five-year plans as its main tool. This was followed by a rapid transformation and expansion of the French economy.\n\nHigh-profile projects, mostly but not always financially successful, were launched: the extension of [[Marseille]]'s harbour (soon ranking third in Europe and first in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]); the promotion of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] passenger jetliner (a predecessor of [[Airbus]]); the decision to start building the supersonic Franco-British [[Concorde]] airliner in [[Toulouse]]; the expansion of the French auto industry with state-owned [[Renault]] at its centre; and the building of the first motorways between Paris and the provinces.\n\nAided by these projects, the French economy recorded growth rates unrivalled since the 19th century. In 1964, for the first time in nearly 100 years<ref>France's GDP was slightly higher than the UK's at the beginning of the 19th century, with the UK surpassing France around 1870.

Kennedy]] and de Gaulle at the conclusion of their talks at Elysee Palace, 1961]]\nDuring his first tenure as president, de Gaulle became enthusiastic about the possibilities of nuclear power. France had carried out important work in the early development of atomic energy and in October 1945 he established the French Atomic Energy Commission [[Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique]], (CEA) responsible for all scientific, commercial, and military uses of nuclear energy. However, partly due to communist influences in government opposed to proliferation, research stalled and France was excluded from American, British and Canadian nuclear efforts.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBy October 1952, the United Kingdom had become the third country\u2014after the United States and the Soviet Union\u2014to independently test and develop nuclear weapons. This gave Britain the capability to launch a nuclear strike via its [[Vulcan bomber]] force and they began developing a ballistic missile program known as [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/uk/blue-streak.htm|title=Blue Streak \u2013 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile|publisher=Global Security.org|access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs early as April 1954 while out of power, de Gaulle argued that France must have its own nuclear arsenal; at the time nuclear weapons were seen as a national status symbol and a way of maintaining international prestige with a place at the 'top table' of the United Nations. Full-scale research began again in late 1954 when Prime Minister [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France]] authorized a plan to develop the atomic bomb; large deposits of [[uranium]] had been discovered near [[Limoges]] in central France, providing the researchers with an unrestricted supply of nuclear fuel. France's independent [[Force de Frappe]] (strike force) came into being soon after de Gaulle's election with his authorization for the first nuclear test.\n\nWith the cancellation of Blue Streak, the US agreed to supply Britain with its [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] and later [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] weapons systems, and in 1958 the two nations signed the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement|Mutual Defence Agreement]] forging close links which have seen the US and UK cooperate on nuclear security matters ever since. Although at the time it was still a full member of NATO, France proceeded to develop its own independent nuclear technologies\u2014this would enable it to become a partner in any reprisals and would give it a voice in matters of atomic control.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marshal Juin Defended \u2013 General de Gaulle on Moral Issue|newspaper=The Times|date=8 April 1954}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FS Redoutable.jpg|thumb|The ''[[FS Redoutable|Redoutable]]'', the first French nuclear missile submarine.]]\n\nAfter six years of effort, on 13 February 1960 France became the [[France and nuclear weapons|world's fourth nuclear power]] when a high-powered [[Gerboise Bleue|nuclear device]] was exploded in the [[Sahara]] some 700 miles south-south-west of Algiers.<ref name=\"Weekend of Rejoicing in France\">{{cite news|title=Weekend of Rejoicing in France|newspaper=The Times|date=15 February 1960}}</ref> In August 1963 France decided against signing the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] designed to slow the arms race because it would have prohibited it from testing nuclear weapons above ground. France continued to carry out tests at the Algerian site until 1966, under an agreement with the newly independent Algeria. France's testing program then moved to the [[Mururoa]] and [[Fangataufa]] Atolls in the South Pacific.\n\nIn November 1967, an article by the French Chief of the General Staff (but inspired by de Gaulle) in the ''Revue de la D\u00e9fense Nationale'' caused international consternation. It was stated that the French nuclear force should be capable of firing \"in all directions\"\u2014thus including even America as a potential target. This surprising statement was intended as a declaration of French national independence, and was in retaliation to a warning issued long ago by [[Dean Rusk]] that US missiles would be aimed at France if it attempted to employ atomic weapons outside an agreed plan. However, criticism of de Gaulle was growing over his tendency to act alone with little regard for the views of others.<ref>Ledwidge p. 341</ref> In August, concern over de Gaulle's policies had been voiced by [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] when he queried 'the solitary exercise of power'.<ref>{{cite news|title=Independents Fear for France's Future \u2013 Gaullist Policy Queried|newspaper=The Times|date=18 August 1967}}</ref>\n\n===NATO===\n[[File:Lyndon B.

Johnson]] in Washington, D.C., 1963]]\nWith the onset of the Cold War and the perceived threat of invasion from the [[Soviet Union]] and the countries of the [[eastern bloc]], the United States, Canada and a number of western European countries set up the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) to co-ordinate a military response to any possible attack. France played a key role during the early days of the organisation, providing a large military contingent and agreeing\u2014after much soul-searching\u2014to the participation of West German forces. But after his election in 1958 Charles de Gaulle took the view that the organisation was too dominated by the US and UK, and that America would not fulfill its promise to defend Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion.\n\nDe Gaulle demanded political parity with Britain and America in NATO, and for its geographic coverage to be extended to include French territories abroad, including Algeria, then experiencing civil war. This was not forthcoming, and so in March 1959 France, citing the need for it to maintain its own independent military strategy, withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet (ALESCMED) from NATO, and a few months later de Gaulle demanded the removal of all US nuclear weapons from French territory.\n\n[[File:Charles de Gaulle-1963.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle during his presidency]]\n\nDe Gaulle hosted a superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms limitation talks and d\u00e9tente efforts in the wake of the [[1960 U-2 incident]] between United States President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and United Kingdom Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].<ref name=bbc1/> De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: \"Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan.\" When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, \"De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. He took me also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support\". General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's \"unconditional support\" of the United States during that \"crucial time\".<ref name=j1>{{cite journal|author=Walter, Vernon A.|year=2007|origyear=1974|title=General De Gaulle in Action: 1960 Summit Conference|journal=Studies in Intelligence|volume=38|issue=5|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/95unclass/Walters.html}}</ref> De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved in the wake of the U-2 incident.<ref name=bbc1>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/17/newsid_2512000/2512335.stm 1960: East-West summit in tatters after spy plane row].

De Gaulle always viewed Communism as a passing phenomenon, and never used the term 'Soviet Union', always calling it Russia. In his view, Russian national interests rather than Communist ideology determined the decision-making in the Kremlin. Later, he proclaimed a new alliance between the nations, but although Soviet premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] later visited Paris, the Soviets clearly did not consider France a superpower and knew that they would remain dependent on the NATO alliance in the event of a war. In 1965, de Gaulle pulled France out of [[SEATO]], the southeast Asian equivalent of NATO, and refused to participate in any future NATO maneuvers.\n\nIn February 1966, France withdrew from the [[NATO Military Command Structure]], but remained within the organisation. De Gaulle, haunted by the memories of 1940, wanted France to remain the master of the decisions affecting it, unlike in the 1930s when it had to follow in step with its British ally. He also ordered all foreign military personnel to leave France within a year.<ref name=\"Crawley-1969\" />{{RP|431}} This latter action was particularly badly received in the US, prompting [[Dean Rusk]], the US Secretary of State, to ask de Gaulle whether the removal of American military personnel was to include exhumation of the 50,000 American war dead buried in French cemeteries.<ref name=\"FontanaHistory\">Holland, Robert (1991) ''Fontana History of England \u2013 Britain & the World Role''</ref>\n\n===European Economic Community (EEC)===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}\n\nFrance, experiencing the disintegration of its [[French colonial Empire|colonial empire]] and severe problems in Algeria, turned towards Europe after [[Suez Crisis]], and to West Germany in particular.<ref name=\"FontanaHistory\" /> In the years after, the economies of both nations integrated and they led the drive towards European unity.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nOne of the conditions of Marshall Aid was that the nations' leaders must co-ordinate economic efforts and pool the supply of raw materials. By far the most critical commodities in driving growth were coal and steel.

The franc became a solid, stable currency for the first time in half a century, and the economy mostly boomed. Adenauer however, all too aware of the importance of American support in Europe, gently distanced himself from the general's more extreme ideas, wanting no suggestion that any new European community would in any sense challenge or set itself at odds with the US. In Adenauer's eyes, the support of the US was more important than any question of European prestige.<ref name=\"TIME-8 August 1960\">''Time'', 8 August 1960</ref> Adenauer was also anxious to reassure Britain that nothing was being done behind its back and was quick to inform British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] of any new developments.\n\nGreat Britain initially declined to join the Common Market, preferring to remain with another organisation known as the [[European Free Trade Area]], mostly consisting of the northern European countries and Portugal. By the late 1950s German and French living standards began to exceed those in Britain, and the government of Harold Macmillan, realising that the EEC was a stronger trade bloc than EFTA, began negotiations to join.\n\nDe Gaulle vetoed the British application to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1963, famously uttering the single word 'non' into the television cameras at the critical moment, a statement used to sum up French opposition towards Britain for many years afterwards.<ref name=\"R+Q\">Richards, Denis & Quick, Antony (1974) ''Twentieth Century Britain''</ref> Macmillan said afterwards that he always believed that de Gaulle would prevent Britain joining, but thought he would do it quietly, behind the scenes.

He sent the French Navy across the Atlantic to pick up the French reserve of gold, which had been moved there during World War II, and was followed by several countries. As it resulted in considerably reducing US gold stock and US economic influence, it led US President [[Richard Nixon]] to unilaterally end the convertibility of the dollar to gold on 15 August 1971 (the \"[[Nixon Shock]]\"). This was meant to be a temporary measure but the dollar became permanently a floating [[fiat money]] and in October 1976, the US government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes.<ref>Eug\u00e8ne White, Dominique Simard, Michael Bordo, ''La France et le syst\u00e8me mon\u00e9taire de Bretton Woods '' [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ecofi_0987-3368_1993_num_26_3_2015]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret Garritsen De Vries|title=The International Monetary Fund, 1966\u20131971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5oUS9M1kzOEC&pg=PA61|year=1976|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=978-0-939934-09-6|page=61}}</ref>\n\n==Second term==\nIn December 1965, de Gaulle [[1965 French presidential election|returned as president for a second seven-year term]].

He said that provided Israel withdrew its forces, it appeared that it might be possible to reach a solution through the UN framework which could include assurances of a dignified and fair future for refugees and minorities in the Middle East, recognition from Israel's neighbours, and freedom of navigation through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/10/archives/text-of-de-gaulles-answer-to-letter-from-bengurion.html?sq=de+Gaulle+dignified+minorities&scp=1&st=p|title=Text of de Gaulle's Answer to Letter From Ben-Gurion|work=The New York Times|date=10 January 1968}}</ref>\n\n===Nigerian Civil War===\nThe Eastern Region of Nigeria declared itself independent under the name of the Independent Republic of [[Biafra]] on 30 May 1967.

This monopoly meant that the government was in a position to directly influence broadcast news. In many respects, Gaullist France was conservative, Catholic, and there were few women in high-level political posts (in May 1968, the government's ministers were 100% male).<ref>{{cite web|title=Les femmes et le pouvoir|url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&rub=dossier&item=7|quote=of the first eleven governments of the Fifth Republic, four contained no women whatsoever.|date=2007-05-29}}</ref> Many factors contributed to a general weariness of sections of the public, particularly the student youth, which led to the events of May 1968.\n\nThe mass demonstrations and strikes in France in May 1968 severely challenged De Gaulle's legitimacy. He and other government leaders feared that the country was on the brink of revolution or civil war. On 29 May, De Gaulle disappeared without notifying Prime Minister Pompidou or anyone else in the government, stunning the country. He fled to [[Baden-Baden]] in Germany to meet with General Massu, then head of the French military there, to discuss possible army intervention against the protesters.

The term is now common parlance in French political commentary, used both critically and ironically referring back to de Gaulle.<ref>Crawley (p. 454) also writes that de Gaulle was undoubtedly using the term in his barrack-room style to mean 'shit in the bed'. De Gaulle had said it first in Bucharest while on an official visit from which he returned on 19 May 1968. Pompidou told the press that de Gaulle used the phrase after the cabinet meeting on 19 May.</ref>\n\nBut de Gaulle offered to accept some of the reforms the demonstrators sought. He again considered a referendum to support his moves, but on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded him to dissolve parliament (in which the government had all but lost its majority in the March 1967 elections) and hold new elections instead.

The only notable absentee was Canadian PM [[Pierre Trudeau]], possibly because he was still angry over de Gaulle's cry of \"''Vive le Quebec libre''\" during his 1967 visit.<ref name=\"TIME-23 November 1970\"/>\n\nThe funeral on 12 November 1970 was the biggest such event in French history, with hundreds of thousands of French people\u2014many carrying blankets and picnic baskets\u2014and thousands of cars parked in the roads and fields along the routes to the two venues. Thousands of guests attended the event, included de Gaulle's successor [[Georges Pompidou]], American President [[Richard Nixon]], British Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], [[UN]] General Secretary [[U Thant]], Soviet President [[Nikolai Podgorny]], Italian President [[Giuseppe Saragat]], West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands]]. Special trains were laid on to bring extra mourners to the region and the crowd was packed so tightly that those who fainted had to be passed overhead toward first-aid stations at the rear.<ref name=\"TIME-23 November 1970\"/> The General was conveyed to the church on an armoured reconnaissance vehicle and carried to his grave, next to his daughter Anne, by eight young men of Colombey. As he was lowered into the ground, the bells of all the churches in France tolled, starting from Notre Dame and spreading out from there.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/DeGaulle-and-Nasser-Die/12303235577467-8 |title=1970 \u2013 Year in Review.

The first Algerian president, [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], said that de Gaulle was the \"military leader who brought us the hardest blows\" prior to Algerian independence, but \"saw further\" than other politicians, and had a \"universal dimension that is too often lacking in current leaders.\"<ref>Ahmed Ben Bella, ''De Gaulle voyait plus loin'', in ''L'Express'', 26 October 1995.</ref> Likewise, [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]], the first president of Senegal, said that few Western leaders could boast of having risked their lives to grant a colony independence.\n\nIn 1990 President Mitterrand, de Gaulle's old political rival, presided over the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. Mitterrand, who once wrote a vitriolic critique of him called the \"Permanent Coup d'\u00c9tat\", quoted a then recent opinion poll, saying, \"As General de Gaulle, he has entered the pantheon of great national heroes, where he ranks ahead of [[Napoleon]] and behind only [[Charlemagne]].\"<ref name=\"DeGaulle\">Mahoney, Daniel (2000) ''De Gaulle: Statesmanship, Grandeur and Modern Democracy'', Transaction Publishers, {{ISBN|1412821274}}</ref> Under the influence of [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]], the leader of CERES, the left-wing and [[Souverainism|souverainist]] faction of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], Mitterrand had, except on certain economic and social policies, rallied to much of Gaullism. Between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s there developed a left-right consensus, dubbed \"Gaullo-Mitterrandism\", behind the \"French status\" in NATO: i.e. outside the integrated military command.\n\n===Relationships with other political leaders===\nAlthough he initially enjoyed good relations with US President [[John F. Kennedy]], who admired his stance against the Soviet Union\u2014particularly when the [[Berlin Wall]] was being built\u2014and who called him \"a great captain of the Western world\", their relationship later cooled.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\"/> He was Kennedy's most loyal ally during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and supported the right that the US claimed to defend its interests in the western hemisphere, in contrast to then German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] who doubted Kennedy's commitment to Europe and thought the crisis could have been avoided.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=D.|year=2000|title=One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945|location=New York|publisher=W W Norton and Company|page=182|isbn=0393321088}}</ref> De Gaulle accepted that it might be necessary for the United States to take preemptive military action against Cuba, unlike many other European leaders of his time.<ref name=j1/> De Gaulle was a prominent figure at the state funerals of two American presidents: [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]] (Eisenhower funeral was his only visit to the U.S. since the funeral of JFK).<ref>{{cite news|title=Nixon will Meet with De Gaulle Today|first=Peter|last=Grose|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 March 1969|page=1|quote=President de Gaulle arrived by plane from Paris, on his first visit to the United States since the funeral of President Kennedy in 1963.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=World's Leaders Join in Services for Eisenhower |first=Felix |last=Belair Jr. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 April 1969 |page=1}}</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle was admired by the later President Nixon. After a meeting at the [[Palace of Versailles]] just before the general left office, Nixon declared that \"He did not try to put on airs but an aura of majesty seemed to envelop him ... his performance\u2014and I do not use that word disparagingly\u2014was breathtaking.\"<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\"/> On arriving for his funeral several months later, Nixon said of him, \"greatness knows no national boundaries\".<ref>''Time'', 23 November 1970</ref>\n\nLt. General [[Vernon A. Walters]], a military attach\u00e9 of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and later military attach\u00e9 in France from 1967 to 1973, noted the strong relationship between de Gaulle and Eisenhower, de Gaulle's unconditional support of Eisenhower during the U-2 incident, and de Gaulle's strong support of [[John F. Kennedy]] during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Thus Walters was intensely curious as to the great contrast between de Gaulle's close relations with two United States presidents during notable [[Cold War]] crises and de Gaulle's later decision to withdraw France from NATO's military command, and Walters spoke with many close military and political aides of de Gaulle.<ref name=j1/>\n\nWalters' conclusion, based upon de Gaulle's comments to many of his aides (and to Eisenhower during a meeting at Ramboullet Castle in 1959), is that de Gaulle feared that later United States presidents after Eisenhower would not have Eisenhower's special ties to Europe and would not risk nuclear war over Europe.<ref name=j1/> Also, de Gaulle interpreted the peaceful resolution of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] without fighting to take back Cuba from communism a mere 90 miles from the United States as an indication that the United States might not fight for Europe's defense 3,500 miles away following Soviet aggression in Europe, but would only go to war following a nuclear strike against the United States itself.<ref name=j1/> De Gaulle told Eisenhower that France did not seek to compete with the Strategic Air Command or army of the United States, but believed that France needed a way to strike the Soviet Union.<ref name=j1/>\n\nA number of commentators have been critical of de Gaulle for his failure to prevent the massacres after Algerian independence<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> while others take the view that the struggle had been so long and savage that it was perhaps inevitable.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\"/> The Australian historian [[Brian Crozier]] wrote, \"that he was able to part with Algeria without civil war was a great though negative achievement which in all probability would have been beyond the capacity of any other leader France possessed.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''De Gaulle: The Statesman''. Brian Crozier (Methuen). 1974</ref> In April 1961, when four rebel generals seized power in Algeria, he \"did not flinch in the face of this daunting challenge\", but appeared on television in his general's uniform to forbid Frenchmen to obey the rebels' orders in an \"inflexible display of personal authority\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nDe Gaulle was an excellent manipulator of the media, as seen in his shrewd use of television to persuade around 80% of [[Metropolitan France]] to approve the new constitution for the Fifth Republic. In so doing, he refused to yield to the reasoning of his opponents who said that, if he succeeded in Algeria, he would no longer be necessary. He afterwards enjoyed massive approval ratings, and once said that \"every Frenchman is, has been or will be Gaullist\".<ref name=\"Debray\"/>\n\nThat de Gaulle did not necessarily reflect mainstream French public opinion with his veto was suggested by the decisive majority of French people who voted in favour of British membership when the much more conciliatory Pompidou called a referendum on the matter in 1972. His early influence in setting the parameters of the EEC can still be seen today, most notably with the controversial Common Agricultural Policy.\n\nSome writers take the view that Pompidou was a more progressive and influential leader than de Gaulle because, though also a Gaullist, he was less autocratic and more interested in social reforms.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref>Richards, Denis and Quick, Anthony (1974) ''20th Century Britain''</ref> Although he followed the main tenets of de Gaulle's foreign policy, he was keen to work towards warmer relations with the United States. A banker by profession, Pompidou is also widely credited, as de Gaulle's prime minister from 1962 to 1968, with putting in place the reforms which provided the impetus for the economic growth which followed.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1968, shortly before leaving office, de Gaulle refused to devalue the Franc on grounds of national prestige, but upon taking over Pompidou reversed the decision almost straight away. It was ironic, that during the financial crisis of 1968, France had to rely on American (and West German) financial aid to help shore up the economy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nPerry has written that the \"events of 1968 illustrated the brittleness of de Gaulle's rule. That he was taken by surprise is an indictment of his rule; he was too remote from real life and had no interest in the conditions under which ordinary French people lived. Problems like inadequate housing and social services had been ignored. The French greeted the news of his departure with some relief as the feeling had grown that he had outlived his usefulness. Perhaps he clung onto power too long, perhaps he should have retired in 1965 when he was still popular.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n[[Brian Crozier]] said \"the fame of de Gaulle outstrips his achievements, he chose to make repeated gestures of petulance and defiance that weakened the west without compensating advantages to France\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[R\u00e9gis Debray]] called de Gaulle \"super-lucide\"<ref name=\"Debray\"/> and pointed out that virtually all of his predictions, such as the fall of communism, the reunification of Germany and the resurrection of 'old' Russia, came true after his death.<ref>In fact, several of de Gaulle's predictions, such as his often-repeated belief during the early cold war period that a Third World War, with its \"nuclear bombardments, famine, deportations\" was not only ineluctable, but imminent, have not yet materialized. Jean Lacouture, ''De Gaulle'', Seuil, vol. II, p. 357.</ref> Debray compared him with [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] ('the great political myth of the 19th century'), calling de Gaulle his 20th century equivalent. \"The sublime, it seems, appears in France only once a century ... Napoleon left two generations dead on battlefield. De Gaulle was more sparing with other people's blood; even so, he left us, as it were, stranded, alive but dazed... A delusion, perhaps, but one that turns the world upside down: causes events and movements; divides people into supporters and adversaries; leaves traces in the form of civil and penal codes and railways, factories and institutions (the Fifth Republic has already lasted three times as long as the Empire). A statesman who gets something going, who has followers, escapes the reality of the reports and statistics and become part of imagination. Napoleon and de Gaulle modified the state of things because they modified souls\".<ref name=\"Debray\"/>\n\nHowever, Debray pointed out that there is a difference between Napoleon and de Gaulle: \"How can the exterminator be compared with the liberator? ... The former ran the whole enterprise into the ground, while the latter managed to save it. So that to measure the rebel against the despot, the challenger against the leader, is just glaringly idiotic. You simply do not put an adventurer who worked for himself or his family on the same level as a commander-in-chief serving his country. ... Regrettably, Gaullism and Bonapartism have a number of features in common, but Napoleon and de Gaulle do not have the same moral value. ... the first wanted a Holy French Empire without the faith, a Europe under French occupation. The second wanted to rescue the nation from the emperors and establish a free France in a free Europe\".<ref name=\"Debray\"/>\n\nWhile de Gaulle had many admirers, he was at the same time one of the most hated and reviled men in modern French history.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3679392|title = General de Gaulle and His Enemies: Anti-Gaullism in France Since 1940|journal = Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|volume = 9|pages = 43\u201365|last1 = Jackson|first1 = Julian|year = 1999|doi = 10.2307/3679392}}</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n===French===\n* [[File:Legion Honneur GC ribbon.svg|80px]] Grand-Croix of the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] \u2013 1945 (Officer \u2013 1934; Knight \u2013 1919)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH280/PG/FRDAFAN83_OC18V002.htm|title=Minist\u00e8re de la culture \u2013 Base L\u00e9onore|work=culture.gouv.fr|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref>\n* [[File:Ruban de l'Ordre de la Lib\u00e9ration (2).PNG|80px]] Grand Master of the [[Ordre de la Lib\u00e9ration]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeyjBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA200|title=Parisis Code \u2013 tome 2 \u2013 Le Code secret des rues de Paris|work=google.be|accessdate=14 January 2016|isbn=9791091289030|last1=Leur|first1=Thierry Van de}}</ref>\n* [[File:Ordre national du Merite GC ribbon.svg|80px]] Grand-Croix of the [[Ordre national du M\u00e9rite]] \u2013 1963<ref>[http://www.legiondhonneur.fr/sites/default/files/presse_dl/50_ans_ordre_national_du_mcrite.pdf]</ref>\n* [[File:Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 ribbon.svg|80px]] [[Croix de guerre 1914-1918 (France)|Croix de guerre 1915]]<ref name=\"charles-de-gaulle.org\"/>\n* [[File:Croix de Guerre 1939-1945 ribbon.svg|80px]] [[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)|Croix de guerre (1939\u20131945)]]{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Foreign===\n* [[File:Virtuti Militari Ribbon.png|80px]] Silver Cross of [[Virtuti Militari]] of Poland (1920)<ref name=RPPL>{{cite web|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/216865.html|title=Virtuti Militari de Gaulle'a|work=Rzeczpospolita|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref>\n* [[File:US Legion of Merit Chief Commander ribbon.png|80px]] Chief Commander of the US [[Legion of Merit]] (24 August 1945)\n* [[File:Ord of the Dragon of Annam kngt ribbon bar.png|80px]] Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Dragon of Annam]] (last awarded 1945)\n* [[File:Cordone di gran Croce di Gran Cordone OMRI BAR.svg|80px]] Knight Grand Cross decorated with Grand Cordon of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]] (16 June 1959)\n* [[File:Order of the Royal House of Chakri (Thailand) ribbon.svg|80px]] Knight of the [[Order of the Royal House of Chakri]] of Thailand (11 October 1960)\n* [[File:Order of the Seraphim -

the [[French Resistance]] against [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]] and chaired the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] from 1944 to 1946 in order to reestablish democracy in [[France]]. In 1958, he came out of retirement when appointed [[Prime Minister of France|President of the Council of Ministers]] by President [[Ren\u00e9 Coty]]. He was asked to rewrite the [[Constitution of France]] and founded the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] after approval by [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum]]. He was [[List of indirect presidential elections in France|elected]] as [[President of France]] later that year, a position he was [[1965 French presidential election|reelected]] to in 1965 and held until his resignation in 1969. He was the dominant figure of France during the early part of the [[Cold War]] era; his memory continues to influence French politics.\n\nBorn in [[Lille]], he graduated from [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] in 1912. He was a decorated officer of the [[World War I|First World War]], wounded several times and later taken prisoner at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. During the [[interwar period]], he advocated mobile armoured divisions. During the German invasion of May 1940, he led an armoured division which counterattacked the invaders; he was then appointed Undersecretary for War. Refusing to accept his government's [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|armistice with Germany]], de Gaulle escaped to England and exhorted the French to resist occupation and to continue the fight in his [[Appeal of 18 June]]. He led the [[Free French Forces]] and later headed the [[French Committee of National Liberation|French National Liberation Committee]] against the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. Despite frosty relations with the [[United States]], he generally had [[Winston Churchill]]'s support and emerged as the undisputed leader of the [[French Resistance]]. He became head of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] in June 1944, the interim government of France following [[Liberation of France|its Liberation]]. As early as 1944, de Gaulle introduced a [[Dirigisme|dirigiste]] economic policy, which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy which was followed by 30 years of unprecedented growth, known as the [[Trente Glorieuses]].\n\nFrustrated by the return of petty partisanship in the new [[Fourth French Republic|Fourth Republic]], he resigned in early 1946 but continued to be politically active as founder of the [[Rally of the French People|Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais]] (RPF; \"Rally of the French People\"). He retired in the early 1950s and wrote his ''War Memoirs'', which quickly became a staple of modern French literature. When the [[Algerian War]] was ripping apart the unstable [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] brought him back to power during the [[May 1958 crisis (France)|May 1958 crisis]]. He founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency, and he was [[1958 French presidential election|elected]] to continue in that role. He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war, much to the anger of the [[Pied-Noir|''Pieds-Noirs'']] (ethnic French born in Algeria) and the military; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule. He granted independence to [[Algeria]] and acted progressively towards other French colonies. In the context of the Cold War, de Gaulle initiated his \"politics of grandeur\" asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries, such as the United States, for its national security and prosperity. To this end, he pursued a policy of \"national independence\" which led him to withdraw from [[NATO]]'s military integrated command and to launch an independent [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development program]] that made France the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]]. He restored cordial [[Franco-German relations]] to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence through the signing of the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty]] on 22 January 1963. However, he opposed any development of a [[Supranational union|supranational Europe]], favouring Europe as a continent of [[sovereign nation]]s. De Gaulle openly criticised the [[Vietnam War|United States intervention in Vietnam]] and the \"[[exorbitant privilege]]\" of the United States dollar. In his later years, his support for the slogan \"''[[Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre]]''\" and his two vetoes of Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] generated considerable controversy in both North America and Europe.\n \nAlthough reelected President of the Republic in [[1965 French presidential election|1965]], he faced widespread protests by students and workers in [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]], but had the Army's support and won an [[1968 French legislative election|election]] with an increased majority in the National Assembly. De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a [[1969 French constitutional referendum|referendum]] in which he proposed more decentralisation. He died a year later at his residence in [[Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises]], leaving his presidential memoirs unfinished. Many French political parties and figures claim a [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] legacy; many streets and monuments in France were dedicated to his memory after his death.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood and origins===\n[[File:Maison natale de Charles de Gaulle, Lille.jpg|thumb|right|De Gaulle's birth house in [[Lille]], now a national museum]]\nDe Gaulle was born in the industrial region of [[Lille]] in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord department]], the third of five children.

Struck by his mother's tale of how she cried as a child when she heard of the French capitulation to the Germans at [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Sedan in 1870]], he developed a keen interest in military strategy. He was also influenced by his uncle, also named [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]], who was a historian and passionate [[Celticist]] who wrote books and pamphlets advocating the union of the Welsh, Scots, Irish, and [[Bretons]] into one people. His grandfather Julien-Philippe was also a historian, and his grandmother Josephine-Marie wrote poems which impassioned his Christian faith.<ref name=\"Schoenbrun\">David Schoenbrun, ''The Three Lives of Charles de Gaulle'' (1966)</ref><ref name=\"Fenby-2010\"/>{{RP|42\u201347}}\n\n===Education and intellectual influences===\nBy the time he was ten he was reading medieval history.

In addition to the German philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], he read the works of the ancient Greeks (especially [[Plato]]) and the prose of the romanticist poet [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]].<ref name=\"Pedley\">Alan Pedley (1996) ''As Mighty as the Sword: A Study of the Writings of Charles de Gaulle''. pp. 170\u201372.

Equally unwelcome were the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' with Britain, the [[First Moroccan Crisis]], and above all the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. Henri de Gaulle came to be a supporter of Dreyfus, but was less concerned with his innocence ''per se'' than with the disgrace which the army had brought onto itself. The same period also saw a resurgence in evangelical Catholicism, the dedication of the [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris]] and the rise of the cult of [[Joan of Arc]].<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|50\u201351}}<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p13\"/>\n\nDe Gaulle was not an outstanding pupil until his mid-teens, but from July 1906 he worked harder at school as he focused on winning a place to train as an army officer at the military academy, [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]].<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp9-10\">Lacouture 1991, pp9-10</ref> Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle joined the army, despite being by inclination more suited to a career as a writer and historian, partly to please his father and partly because it was one of the few unifying forces which represented the whole of French society.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp14-15\">Lacouture 1991, pp14-15</ref> He later wrote that \"when I entered the Army, it was one of the greatest things in the world\",<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|51}} a claim which Lacouture points out needs to be treated with caution: the army's reputation was at a low ebb in the early 1900s after the Dreyfus Affair. It was used extensively for strike-breaking and there were fewer than 700 applicants for St Cyr in 1908, down from 2,000 at the turn of the century.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp14-15\"/>\n\n==Early career==\n===Officer cadet and lieutenant===\nDe Gaulle won a place at St Cyr in 1909. His class ranking was mediocre (119th out of 221 entrants), but he was relatively young and this was his first attempt at the exam.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp9-10\"/> Under a law of 21 March 1905, aspiring army officers were required to serve a year in the ranks, including time both as a private and as an [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]], before attending the academy. Accordingly, in October 1909, de Gaulle enlisted (for four years, as required, rather than the normal two-year term for [[Conscription in France|conscripts]]) in the {{ill|33rd Infantry Regiment (France)|fr|33e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie|lt=33rd Infantry Regiment}} of the [[French Army]], based at Arras.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p16-17\">Lacouture 1991, p16-17</ref> This was a historic regiment with [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] amongst its battle honours.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p16</ref> In April 1910 he was promoted to corporal. His company commander declined to promote him to sergeant, the usual rank for a potential officer, commenting that the young man clearly felt that nothing less than [[Constable of France]] would be good enough for him.<ref>Fenby writes that he did promote him to sergeant at this point, which does not tally with Lacouture and other more detailed accounts</ref><ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p16-17\"/> He was eventually promoted to sergeant in September 1910.<ref name=\"charles-de-gaulle.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/la-grande-guerre/reperes/chronologie-1909-1918.php|title=Chronologie 1909\u20131918|publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307082919/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/la-grande-guerre/reperes/chronologie-1909-1918.php|archivedate=7 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle took up his place at St Cyr in October 1910. By the end of his first year he had risen to 45th place.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p19</ref> At St Cyr, de Gaulle acquired the nickname of \"the great asparagus\" because of his height (196&nbsp;cm, 6'5\"), high forehead, and nose.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|301}} He did well at the academy and received praise for his conduct, manners, intelligence, character, military spirit, and resistance to fatigue. In 1912, he graduated 13th in his class<ref>{{cite web | url=http://spartacus-educational.com/2WWdegaulle.htm | title=Charles de Gaulle}}</ref> and his passing-out report noted that he was a gifted cadet who would undoubtedly make an excellent officer. The future Marshal [[Alphonse Juin]] passed out first in the class, although the two do not appear to have been close friends at the time.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p21\">Lacouture 1991, p21</ref>\n\nPreferring to serve in France rather than the distant overseas colonies, in October 1912 he rejoined the 33rd Infantry Regiment as a ''[[Ranks in the French Army#Sous-lieutenant|sous-lieutenant]]'' (second lieutenant). The regiment was now commanded by Colonel (and future Marshal) [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years. He later wrote in his memoirs: \"My first colonel, P\u00e9tain, taught me the art of command\".{{r|time19590105}}<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p21\"/>\n\nIt has been claimed that in the build-up to [[World War I]], de Gaulle agreed with P\u00e9tain about the obsolescence of cavalry and of traditional tactics in the age of machine guns and barbed wire, and often debated great battles and the likely outcome of any coming war with his superior.<ref name=Schoenbrun/> Lacouture is sceptical, pointing out that although P\u00e9tain wrote glowing appraisals of de Gaulle in the first two-quarters of 1913, it is unlikely that he stood out among the 19 captains and 32 lieutenants under his command. De Gaulle would have been present at the 1913 Arras manoeuvres, at which P\u00e9tain criticised General {{ill|Marie Alexandre \u00c9mile Hippolyte Gallet|fr|lt=Gallet}} to his face, but there is no evidence in his notebooks that he accepted P\u00e9tain's unfashionable ideas about the importance of firepower against the dominant doctrine emphasizing \"[[Attaque \u00e0 outrance|offensive spirit]]\". De Gaulle stressed how [[Maurice de Saxe]] had banned volley fire, how French armies of the [[Napoleonic period]] had relied on infantry column attack, and how French military power had declined in the nineteenth century because of \u2013 supposedly \u2013 excessive concentration on firepower (e.g. the [[Chassepot rifle]]) rather than ''[[:wikt:\u00e9lan|\u00e9lan]]''. He also appears to have accepted the then fashionable lesson drawn from the recent [[Russo-Japanese War]], of how bayonet charges by Japanese infantry with high morale had succeeded in the face of enemy firepower.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p21-5</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1913.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p24-5</ref>\n\n===First World War===\n====Combat====\n[[File:CDG Pont Dinant.JPG|thumb|right|A plaque in [[Dinant]] commemorating the place where Charles de Gaulle, then an infantry lieutenant, was wounded in 1914]]\n\nWhen war finally broke out in France in early August 1914, the 33rd Regiment, considered one of the best fighting units in France, was immediately thrown into checking the German advance at [[Dinant]]. However, the [[French Fifth Army]] commander, General [[Charles Lanrezac]], remained wed to 19th-century battle tactics, throwing his units into pointless bayonet charges with bugles and full colours flying against the German artillery, incurring heavy losses.<ref name=Schoenbrun />\n\nAs a platoon commander, de Gaulle was involved in fierce fighting from the outset. He received his baptism of fire on 15 August and was among the first to be wounded, receiving a bullet in the knee at the [[Battle of Dinant (1914)|Battle of Dinant]].<ref name=\"charles-de-gaulle.org\"/><ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|58}} It is sometimes claimed that in hospital, he grew bitter at the tactics used, and spoke with other injured officers against the outdated methods of the French army. However, there is no contemporary evidence that he understood the importance of artillery in modern warfare. Instead, in his writing at the time, he criticised the \"overrapid\" offensive, the inadequacy of French generals, and the \"slowness of the English troops\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, p31</ref>\n\nHe rejoined his regiment in October, as commander of the 7th [[Company (military unit)|company]]. Many of his former comrades were already dead. In December he became regimental [[adjutant]].<ref name=\"charles-de-gaulle.org\"/>\n\nDe Gaulle's unit gained recognition for repeatedly crawling out into [[no man's land]] to listen to the conversations of the enemy in their trenches, and the information brought back was so valuable that on 18 January 1915 he received the [[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]]. On 10 February he was promoted to captain, initially on probation.<ref name=\"charles-de-gaulle.org\"/> On 10 March 1915, de Gaulle received a bullet in the left hand, which initially seemed trivial but became infected.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p34</ref> The wound incapacitated him for four months and later forced him to wear his wedding ring on the right hand.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|61}}<ref name=\"charles-de-gaulle.org\"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wIi-48RIaQC&pg=PT71|title=Yvonne de Gaulle|isbn=978-2-213-66087-5|page=71|last1=Neau-Dufour|first1=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique|date=2010}}</ref> In August he commanded the 10th company before returning to duty as regimental adjutant.

His patriotic fervour and confidence in victory earned him yet another nickname, ''Le Conn\u00e9table'' (\"[[Constable of France|The Constable]]\"), the title of the medieval commander-in-chief of the French army.<ref name=\"Ledwidge\">Ledwidge p. 24</ref> During his time as a POW, de Gaulle got to know well [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], the future commander of the [[Red Army]], whose [[deep operations|theories]] about a fast-moving, mechanized army closely resembled his. While a prisoner of war, de Gaulle wrote his first book, ''Discorde chez l'ennemi (The Enemy's House Divided)'', analysing the issues and divisions within the German forces. The book was published in 1924.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|83}}\n\nDe Gaulle made five unsuccessful escape attempts,<ref name=\"charles-de-gaulle.org\"/> and was moved to a higher-security facility and punished on his return with long periods of solitary confinement and with the withdrawal of privileges such as newspapers and tobacco. He attempted escape by hiding in a laundry basket, digging a tunnel, digging a hole through a wall, and even posing as a nurse to fool his guards.<ref>The General: Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved (Pg. 62\u201367)</ref>{{r|time19590105}} In his letters to his parents, he constantly spoke of his frustration that the war was continuing without him, calling the situation \"a shameful misfortune\" and compared it to being [[cuckold]]ed. As the war neared its end, he grew depressed that he was playing no part in the victory, but despite his efforts, he remained in captivity until the [[Armistice with Germany|armistice]]. On 1 December 1918, three weeks later, he returned to his father's house in the [[Dordogne]] to be reunited with his three brothers, who had all served in the army and survived the war.\n\n===Between the wars===\n====Early 1920s: Poland and staff college====\nAfter the armistice, de Gaulle served with the staff of the [[French Military Mission to Poland]] as an instructor of Poland's infantry during its [[Polish-Soviet War|war with communist Russia]] (1919\u20131921). He distinguished himself in operations near the [[Zbrucz|River Zbrucz]], with the rank of major in the Polish army, and won Poland's highest military decoration, the [[Virtuti Militari]].<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|71\u201374}}\n\nDe Gaulle returned to France, where he became a lecturer in military history at St Cyr. He was already a powerful speaker, after practice as a prisoner of war.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p64</ref> He then studied at the ''[[\u00c9cole de Guerre]]'' (staff college) from November 1922 to October 1924. Here he clashed with his instructor Colonel Moyrand by arguing for tactics based on circumstances rather than doctrine, and after an exercise in which he had played the role of commander, he refused to answer a question about supplies, replying ''\"de minimis non curat praetor\"'' (\"a leader does not concern himself with trivia\") before ordering the responsible officer to answer Moyrand. He obtained respectable, but not outstanding grades \u2013 15 or so out of 20 \u2013 on many of his assessments. Moyrand wrote in his final report that he was \"an intelligent, cultured and serious-minded officer; has brilliance and talent\" but criticised him for not deriving as much benefit from the course as he should have done, and for his arrogance: his \"excessive self-confidence\", his harsh dismissal of the views of others \"and his attitude of a King in exile\". Having entered 33rd out of 129, he graduated in 52nd place, with a grade of ''assez bien'' (\"good enough\"). He was posted to [[Mainz]] to help supervise supplies of food and equipment for the [[Occupation of the Rhineland|French Army of Occupation]].<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp66-71, 213\u20135</ref><ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|82}}\n\nDe Gaulle's book ''La Discorde chez l'ennemi'' had appeared in March 1924.

He died in 1925, but he did not know it\") and of what he saw as the lust for public adulation of P\u00e9tain and his wife. In 1925 de Gaulle began to cultivate [[Joseph Paul-Boncour]], his first political patron.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p80</ref> On 1 December 1925 he published an essay on the \"Historical Role of French Fortresses\". This was a popular topic because of the [[Maginot Line]] which was then being planned, but his argument was quite nuanced: he argued that the aim of fortresses should be to weaken the enemy, not to economise on defence.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p77-86\"/>\n\nFriction arose between de Gaulle and P\u00e9tain over ''Le Soldat'', a history of the French soldier which he had ghost-written and for which he wanted greater writing credit. He had written mainly historical material, but P\u00e9tain wanted to add a final chapter of his own thoughts. There was at least one stormy meeting late in 1926 after which de Gaulle was seen to emerge, white with anger, from P\u00e9tain's office.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p84-7\">Lacouture 1991, p84-7</ref> In October 1926 he returned to his duties with the Headquarters of the Army of the Rhine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/un-officier-non-conformiste/reperes/chronologie-1921-1939.php|title=Chronologie 1921\u20131939|publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234832/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/un-officier-non-conformiste/reperes/chronologie-1921-1939.php|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle had sworn that he would never return to the ''\u00c9cole de Guerre'' except as commandant, but at P\u00e9tain's invitation, and introduced to the stage by his patron, he delivered three lectures there in April 1927: \"Leadership in Wartime\", \"Character\", and \"Prestige\". These later formed the basis for his book ''The Edge of the Sword'' (1932). Many of the officers in the audience were his seniors, who had taught and examined him only a few years earlier.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p88\">Lacouture 1991, p88</ref>\n\n====Late-1920s: Trier and Beirut====\nAfter spending twelve years as a captain, a normal period, de Gaulle was promoted to ''[[Ranks in the French Army#Commandant|commandant]]'' (major) on 25 September 1927.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p88\"/> In November 1927 he began a two-year posting as commanding officer of the 19th ''[[Chasseur#Chasseurs \u00e0 pied|chasseurs \u00e0 pied]]'' (a [[battalion]] of \u00e9lite light infantry) with the occupation forces at [[Trier]] (Treves).<ref>Lacouture 1991, p84</ref><ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|94}}\n\nDe Gaulle trained his men hard (a river crossing exercise of the freezing [[Moselle River]] at night was vetoed by his commanding general). He imprisoned a soldier for appealing to his deputy ([[member of parliament]]) for a transfer to a cushier unit, and when investigated initially tried to invoke his status as a member of the ''Maison P\u00e9tain'', eventually appealing to P\u00e9tain to protect himself from a reprimand for interfering with the soldier's political rights. An observer wrote of de Gaulle at this time that although he encouraged young officers, \"his ego...glowed from far off\". In the winter of 1928\u20131929, thirty soldiers (\"not counting [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annamese]]\") died from so-called \"German flu\", seven of them from de Gaulle's battalion. After an investigation, he was singled out for praise in the ensuing parliamentary debate as an exceptionally capable commanding officer, and mention of how he had worn a mourning band for a private soldier who was an orphan earned an exclamation of praise from the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]].<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp90-2</ref>\n\nThe breach between de Gaulle and P\u00e9tain over the ghost-writing of ''Le Soldat'' had deepened in 1928. P\u00e9tain brought in a new ghostwriter, Colonel Audet, who was unwilling to take on the job and wrote to de Gaulle in some embarrassment to take over the project. P\u00e9tain was quite friendly about the matter but did not publish the book.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp84-7, 213\u20135</ref> In 1929 P\u00e9tain did not use de Gaulle's draft text for his eulogy for the late [[Ferdinand Foch]], whose seat at the ''[[Academie Francaise]]'' he was assuming.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p84-7\"/>\n\nThe Allied occupation of the Rhineland was coming to an end, and de Gaulle's battalion was due to be disbanded, although the decision was later rescinded after he had moved to his next posting. De Gaulle wanted a teaching post at the ''\u00c9cole de Guerre'' in 1929.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p92-3</ref> There was apparently a threat of mass resignation of the faculty were he appointed to a position there. There was talk of a posting to Corsica or North Africa, but on P\u00e9tain's advice he accepted a two-year posting to [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Lebanon and Syria]].<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|93\u201394}} In Beirut he was chief of the 3rd Bureau (military operations) of General Louis-Paul-Gaston de Bigault du Granrut, who wrote him a glowing reference recommending him for high command in the future.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp99-100\">Lacouture 1991, pp99-100</ref>\n\n====1930s: staff officer====\nIn the spring of 1931, as his posting in Beirut drew to a close, de Gaulle once again asked P\u00e9tain for a posting to the ''\u00c9cole de Guerre''. P\u00e9tain tried to obtain an appointment for him as Professor of History there, but once again the faculty would not have him. Instead de Gaulle, drawing on plans he had drawn up in 1928 for reform of that institution, asked P\u00e9tain to create a special post for him which would enable him to lecture on \"the Conduct of War\" both to the ''\u00c9cole de Guerre'' and to the ''Centre des Hautes \u00c9tudes Militaires'' (CHEM \u2013 a senior staff college for generals, known as the \"school for marshals\"), and also to civilians at the ''[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]'', and to civil servants.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p99, p118\">Lacouture 1991, p99, p118</ref>\n\nP\u00e9tain instead advised him to apply for a posting to the ''Secr\u00e9tariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de la D\u00e9fense Nationale'' (SGDN \u2013 General Secretariat of the Supreme War Council, reporting to the Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister, although later moved to the Ministry of War in 1936) in Paris. P\u00e9tain promised to lobby for the appointment, which he thought would be good experience for him. De Gaulle was posted to SGDN in November 1931, initially as a \"drafting officer\".<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p99, p118\"/><ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|94}}\n\nHe was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in December 1932 and appointed Head of the Third Section (operations). His service at SGDN gave him six years' experience of the interface between army planning and government, enabling him to take on ministerial responsibilities in 1940.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|97}}<ref>Lacouture 1991, p105, p119 \u2013 Lacouture gives the date of this promotion both as December 1932 (the date favoured by most accounts) and December 1933</ref>\n\nAfter studying arrangements in the US, Italy, and Belgium, de Gaulle drafted a bill for the organisation of the country in time of war. He made a presentation about his bill to the CHEM. The bill passed the Chamber of Deputies but failed in the Senate.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p125\">Lacouture 1991, p125</ref>\n\n====Early 1930s: proponent of armoured warfare====\nUnlike P\u00e9tain, de Gaulle believed in the use of tanks and rapid maneuvers rather than trench warfare.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|108}} De Gaulle became a disciple of \u00c9mile Mayer (1851\u20131938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the [[Dreyfus Affair]]) and military thinker. Mayer thought that although wars were still bound to happen, it was \"obsolete\" for civilised countries to threaten or wage war on one another as they had in previous centuries. He had a low opinion of the quality of French generals, and was a critic of the [[Maginot Line]] and a proponent of mechanised warfare. Lacouture suggests that Mayer focused de Gaulle's thoughts away from his obsession with the mystique of the strong leader (''Le Fil d'Ep\u00e9e'': 1932) and back to loyalty to Republican institutions and military reform.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp. 114\u20137, 131, 154.</ref>\n\nIn 1934 de Gaulle wrote ''Vers l'Arm\u00e9e de M\u00e9tier'' (''Towards a Professional Army''). He proposed mechanization of the infantry, with stress on an \u00e9lite force of 100,000 men and 3,000 tanks. The book imagined tanks driving around the country like cavalry. De Gaulle's mentor Emile Mayer was somewhat more prophetic than he was about the future importance of air power on the battlefield. Such an army would both compensate for France's population shortage, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which forbade Germany from rearming. He also thought it would be a precursor to a deeper national reorganisation, and wrote that \"a master has to make his appearance [...] whose orders cannot be challenged \u2013 a man upheld by public opinion\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp. 133\u20135.</ref>\n\nOnly 700 copies were sold in France; the claim that thousands of copies were sold in Germany<ref name=\"time19590105\">''See, e.g.,'' {{cite news|title=Charles de Gaulle|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1958.html|newspaper=Time|date=5 January 1959}}</ref> is thought to be an exaggeration. De Gaulle used the book to widen his contacts among journalists, notably with Andr\u00e9 Pironneau, editor of ''[[L'\u00c9cho de Paris]]''. The book attracted praise across the political spectrum, apart from the hard left who were committed to the Republican ideal of a citizen army.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 136.</ref> De Gaulle's views attracted the attention of the maverick politician [[Paul Reynaud]], to whom he wrote frequently, sometimes in obsequious terms. Reynaud first invited him to meet him on 5 December 1934.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 139-46.</ref>\n\nThe de Gaulle family were very private.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 104.</ref> De Gaulle was deeply focused on his career at this time. There is no evidence that he was tempted by fascism, and there is little evidence of his views either on domestic upheavals in [[6 February 1934 crisis|1934]] and [[1936 French legislative election|1936]] or the many foreign policy crises of the decade.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp. 127\u20138, 143\u20134.</ref> He approved of the rearmament drive which the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government began in 1936, although French military doctrine remained that tanks should be used in penny packets for infantry support (ironically, in 1940 it would be German panzer units that would be used in a manner similar to what de Gaulle had advocated).<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 144.</ref> A rare insight into de Gaulle's political views is a letter to his mother warning her that war with Germany was sooner or later inevitable and reassuring her that [[Pierre Laval]]'s [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|pact with the USSR in 1935]] was for the best, likening it to [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]'s [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|alliance with the Turks]] against the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]].<ref>Lacouture 1991, p. 127.</ref>\n\n====Late-1930s: tank regiment====\nFrom April 1936, whilst still in his staff position at SGDN, de Gaulle was also a lecturer to generals at CHEM.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p125\"/> De Gaulle's superiors disapproved of his views about tanks, and he was passed over for promotion to full colonel in 1936, supposedly because his service record was not good enough. He interceded with his political patron Reynaud, who showed his record to the Minister of War [[\u00c9douard Daladier]]. Daladier, who was an enthusiast for rearmament with modern weapons, ensured that his name was entered onto the promotion list for the following year.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|109}}<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp147-8</ref>\n\nIn 1937 General Bineau, who had taught him at St Cyr, wrote on his report on his lectureship at CHEM that he was highly able and suitable for high command in the future, but that he hid his attributes under \"a cold and lofty attitude\".<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p125\"/> He was put in command of the 507th Tank Regiment (consisting of a battalion of medium [[Char D2]]s and a battalion of [[Renault R35|R35 light tanks]]) at [[Metz]] on 13 July 1937, and his promotion to full colonel took effect on 24 December that year. De Gaulle attracted public attention by leading a parade of 80 tanks into the Place d'Armes at Metz, in his command tank \"[[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp149-50, 169</ref>\n\nBy now de Gaulle was beginning to be a well-known figure, known as \"Colonel Motor(s)\".<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|117}} At the invitation of the publisher [[Plon (publisher)|Plon]], he produced another book, ''La France et son Arm\u00e9e (France and Her Army)'' in 1938. De Gaulle incorporated much of the text he had written for P\u00e9tain a decade earlier for the uncompleted book ''Le Soldat'', to P\u00e9tain's displeasure. In the end, de Gaulle agreed to include a dedication to P\u00e9tain (although he wrote his own rather than using the draft P\u00e9tain sent him), which was later dropped from postwar editions. Until 1938 P\u00e9tain had treated de Gaulle, as Lacouture puts it, \"with unbounded good will\", but by October 1938 he privately thought his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \"an ambitious man, and very ill-bred\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp157-65, 213\u20135</ref>\n\n==Second World War: the Fall of France==\n===Early war===\nAt the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle was put in command of the French [[Fifth Army (France)|Fifth Army]]'s tanks (five scattered battalions, largely equipped with [[Renault R35|R35 light tanks]]) in Alsace.

De Gaulle's tanks were inspected by [[Albert Lebrun|President Lebrun]], who was impressed, but regretted that it was too late to implement his ideas.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p170</ref> He wrote a paper ''L'Av\u00e8nement de la force m\u00e9canique (The coming of the Armoured Force)'' which he sent to [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|General Georges]] (commander-in-chief on the northeast front \u2013 who was not especially impressed) and the politician [[Leon Blum]]. Daladier, Prime Minister at the time, was too busy to read it.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p171</ref>\n\nIn late-February 1940, Reynaud told de Gaulle that he had been earmarked for command of an armoured division as soon as one became available.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp174-5</ref> Early in 1940 (the exact date is uncertain) de Gaulle proposed to Reynaud that he be appointed Secretary-General of the War Council, which would in effect have made him the government's military adviser. When Reynaud became prime minister in March he was reliant on Daladier's backing, so the job went instead to the politician [[Paul Baudouin]].<ref>Lacouture 1991, p175</ref>\n\nIn late-March de Gaulle was told by Reynaud that he would be given command of the [[4e Division cuirass\u00e9e|4th Armoured Division]], due to form by 15 May.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p177</ref> The government appeared likely to be restructured, as Daladier and [[Maurice Gamelin]] (commander-in-chief) were under attack in the aftermath of the [[Norwegian Campaign|Allied defeat in Norway]], and had this happened de Gaulle, who on 3 May was still lobbying Reynaud for a restructuring of the control of the war, might well have joined the government.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p178\">Lacouture 1991, p178</ref> By 7 May he was assembling the staff of his new division.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp180-1\">Lacouture 1991, pp180-1</ref>\n\n===Battle of France: division commander===\n{{Main|Battle of France}}\n\nThe Germans [[Manstein Plan|attacked the West on 10 May]].<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p178\"/> De Gaulle activated his new division on 12 May.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp180-1\"/> The Germans broke through at [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Sedan]] on 15 May 1940.<ref name=\"CDG\">{{cite web|author=Brad DeLong|title=Charles de Gaulle|url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/charlesdegaulle.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107012026/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/charlesdegaulle.html|archivedate=7 January 2006|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|date=29 May 2000}}</ref> That day, with three tank battalions assembled, less than a third of his paper strength, he was summoned to headquarters and told to attack to gain time for General Robert Touchon's [[Sixth Army (France)|Sixth Army]] to redeploy from the Maginot Line to the Aisne.

The attack at [[Battle of Montcornet|Montcornet]], a key road junction near Laon, began around 04:30 on 17 May. Outnumbered and without air support, he lost 23 of his 90 vehicles to mines, anti-tank weapons, or [[Stuka]]s. On 18 May he was reinforced by two fresh regiments of armoured cavalry, bringing his strength up to 150 vehicles. He attacked again on 19 May and his forces were once again devastated by German Stukas and artillery. He ignored orders from General Georges to withdraw, and in the early afternoon demanded two more divisions from Touchon, who refused his request.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p180-3 on pp213-5, in a list of acts of insubordination committed by de Gaulle prior to 18 June 1940, Lacouture mentions a demand on 25 May 1940 that he be given command of an extra two or three divisions to mount a stronger attack. This does not appear in the more detailed narrative and it is not clear whether it is a confusion of the events on 19 May.</ref> Although de Gaulle's tanks forced the German infantry to retreat to [[Caumont-sur-Durance|Caumont]], the action brought only temporary relief and did little to slow the spearhead of the German advance. Nevertheless, it was one of the few successes the French enjoyed while suffering defeats elsewhere across the country.<ref name=\"Ledwidge p. 50-52\">Ledwidge pp. 50\u201352</ref><ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p180-3\">Lacouture 1991, p180-3</ref>\n\nHe delayed his retreat until 20 May. On 21 May, at the request of propaganda officers, he gave a talk on French radio about his recent attack.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p183</ref> In recognition for his efforts de Gaulle was promoted to the rank of temporary ([[Acting (rank)|acting]], in Anglophone parlance) [[Brigade general#France|brigadier-general]] on 23 May 1940. Despite being compulsorily retired as a colonel on 22 June (see below) he would wear the uniform of a brigadier-general for the rest of his life.<ref>Lacouture writes that after the war he was \"mythically a general to all eternity, but legally a retired colonel\". Early in 1946, just after his departure from office, War Minister [[Edmond Michelet]] wrote to him that Prime Minister [[F\u00e9lix Gouin]] wanted his rank to be as high as possible (which Lacouture takes to mean Marshal of France). De Gaulle wrote back that it was \"impossible to regulate a situation absolutely without precedent,\" that the situation had continued for 5 years 7 months and 3 days and that it would be \"strange, even ridiculous\" to rectify his rank for administrative reasons now. As the royalties for his War Memoirs were paid to the Anne-de-Gaulle foundation, he and his wife had to live off his pension as a retired colonel in the 1950s. His wife was reduced to selling family silverware to help make ends meet.[Lacouture Vol 2, p128, pp156-7]</ref><ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p180-3\"/>\n\nOn 28\u201329 May, de Gaulle attacked the German bridgehead south of the Somme at [[Battle of Abbeville|Abbeville]], taking around 400 German prisoners in the last attempt to cut an escape route for the Allied forces falling back on Dunkirk.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p184</ref><ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|127}}\n\nThe future General Paul Huard, who served under de Gaulle at this time, recorded how he would often stand on a piece of high ground, keeping other officers literally at six yards' distance, subjecting his subordinates to harsh criticism and making all decisions autocratically himself, behaviour consistent with his later conduct as a political leader. Lacouture points out that for all his undoubted energy and physical courage there is no evidence in his brief period of command that he possessed the \"hunter's eye\" of the great battlefield commander, and that not a single one of his officers joined him in London, although some joined the Resistance in France.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p186</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle's rank of brigadier-general became effective on 1 June 1940.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|127}} That day he was in Paris. After a visit to his tailor to be fitted for his general's uniform, he visited Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time, then the commander-in-chief [[Maxime Weygand]], who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p187\">Lacouture 1991, p187</ref> On 2 June he sent a memo to Weygand vainly urging that the French armoured divisions be consolidated from four weak divisions into three stronger ones and concentrated into an armoured [[corps]] under his command.

He asked for an English-speaking aide and [[Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel]] was given the job.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p191</ref>\n\nOn 8 June de Gaulle visited Weygand, who believed it was \"the end\" and that after France was defeated Britain would also soon sue for peace. He hoped that after an armistice the Germans would allow him to retain enough of a French Army to \"maintain order\" in France. He gave a \"despairing laugh\" when de Gaulle suggested fighting on.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p193. Weygand later disputed the accuracy of de Gaulle's account of this conversation, and remarked on its similarity to a dialogue by [[Pierre Corneille]]. Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle's account is consistent with other evidence of Weygand's beliefs at the time and is therefore, allowing perhaps for a little literary embellishment, broadly plausible.</ref>\n\nOn 9 June de Gaulle flew to London and met British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] for the first time. It was thought that half a million men could be evacuated to [[French North Africa]], provided the British and French navies and air forces coordinated their efforts. Either at this meeting or on 16 June he urged Churchill in vain to throw more [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft into the Battle of France, but conceded there and then that Churchill was right to refuse.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p194</ref>\n\nIn his memoirs de Gaulle mentioned his support for the proposal to continue the war from French North Africa, but at the time he was more in favour of the plan to form a \"[[National redoubt|redoubt]]\" in Brittany than he later admitted.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p189</ref>\n\nItaly entered the war on 10 June. That day de Gaulle was present at two meetings with Weygand (he only mentions one in his memoirs), one at the defence committee and a second where Weygand barged into Reynaud's office and demanded an armistice. When Weygand asked de Gaulle, who wanted to carry on fighting, if he had \"anything to suggest\", de Gaulle replied that it was the government's job to give orders, not to make suggestions. De Gaulle wanted Paris to be stubbornly defended by [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|de Lattre]], but instead it was declared an [[open city]]. At around 23:00 Reynaud and de Gaulle left Paris for Tours; the rest of the government left Paris on 11 June.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp195-6\">Lacouture 1991, pp195-6</ref>\n\n===Battle of France: Briare and Tours===\nOn 11 June de Gaulle drove to Arcis-sur-Aube and offered General [[Charles Huntziger|Hunziger]] (Commander of the Central Army Group) Weygand's job as Commander-in-Chief. Hunziger accepted in principle (although according to Henri Massis he was merely amused at the prospect of forming a Breton redoubt \u2013 Hunziger would sign the armistice on behalf of P\u00e9tain a few weeks later) but de Gaulle was unable to persuade Reynaud to sack Weygand.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, pp195-6\"/>\n\nLater on 11 June de Gaulle attended the meeting of the [[Anglo-French Supreme War Council]] at the Chateau du Muguet at [[Briare]]. The British were represented by Churchill, [[Anthony Eden]], [[John Dill]], [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]] and [[Edward Spears]], and the French by Reynaud, P\u00e9tain, Weygand, and Georges. Churchill demanded that the French take to guerrilla warfare, and reminded P\u00e9tain of how he had come to the aid of the British with forty divisions in [[Spring Offensive|March 1918]], receiving a dusty answer in each case. De Gaulle's fighting spirit made a strong impression on the British. At the meeting de Gaulle met P\u00e9tain for the first time in two years. P\u00e9tain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that P\u00e9tain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914, he replied that there was \"no comparison\" with the present situation. De Gaulle later conceded that P\u00e9tain was right about that much at least.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p197</ref> De Gaulle missed the second day of the conference as he was in [[Rennes]] for a meeting (not mentioned in his memoirs) to discuss the plans for the Breton redoubt with General [[Ren\u00e9 Altmayer]]. He then returned to attend a cabinet meeting, at which it was clear that there was a growing movement for an armistice, and which decided that the government should move to [[Bordeaux]] rather than de Gaulle's preference for [[Quimper]] in Brittany.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p198</ref>\n\nOn 13 June de Gaulle attended another Anglo-French conference at Tours with Churchill, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], Spears, Ismay, and [[Alexander Cadogan]]. This time few other major French figures were present apart from Reynaud and Baudoin. He was an hour late, and his account is not reliable. Reynaud demanded that France be released from the agreement which he had made with Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] in March 1940, so that France could seek an armistice. De Gaulle wrote that Churchill was sympathetic to France seeking an armistice, provided that an agreement was reached about what was to happen to the French fleet. This claim was later made by apologists for the Vichy Regime, e.g., General Georges, who claimed that Churchill had supported the armistice as a means of keeping the Germans out of French North Africa. However, is not supported by other eyewitnesses (Churchill himself, [[Roland de Margerie]], Spears) who agree that Churchill said that he \"understood\" the French action but that he did ''not'' agree with it. He murmured at de Gaulle that he was ''\"l\u2019homme du destin (the man of destiny)\"'', although it is unclear whether de Gaulle actually heard him.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp198-200, 238</ref> At the cabinet meeting that evening P\u00e9tain strongly supported Weygand's demand for an armistice, and said that he himself would remain in France to share the suffering of the French people and to begin the national rebirth. De Gaulle was dissuaded from resigning by the Interior Minister [[Georges Mandel]], who argued that the war was only just beginning, and that de Gaulle needed to keep his reputation unsullied.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p201\">Lacouture 1991, p201</ref>\n\n===Battle of France: Franco-British Union===\nDe Gaulle arrived at Bordeaux on 14 June, and was given a new mission to go to London to discuss the potential evacuation to North Africa. He had a brief meeting with [[Francois Darlan|Admiral Darlan]] about the potential role of the French Navy. That evening, by coincidence, he dined in the same restaurant as P\u00e9tain: he went over to shake his hand in silence, the last time they ever met. Next morning no aircraft could be found so he had to drive to Brittany, where he visited his wife and daughters, and his aged mother (whom he never saw again, as she died in July), before taking a boat to Plymouth (he asked the skipper if he would be willing to carry on the war under British flag), where he arrived on 16 June. He ordered the boat ''Pasteur'', with a cargo of munitions, to be diverted to a British port, which caused some members of the French Government to call for him to be put on trial.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p201\"/>\n\nOn the afternoon of Sunday 16 June de Gaulle was at [[10 Downing Street]] for talks about [[Jean Monnet]]'s mooted [[Franco-British Union#World War II (1940)|Anglo-French political union]]. He telephoned Reynaud \u2013 they were cut off during the conversation and had to resume later \u2013 with the news that the British had agreed.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp203-4</ref> He took off from London on a British aircraft at 18:30 on 16 June (it is unclear whether, as was later claimed, he and Churchill agreed that he would be returning soon), landing at Bordeaux at around 22:00 to be told that he was no longer a minister, as Reynaud had resigned as prime minister after the Franco-British Union had been rejected by his cabinet. P\u00e9tain had become prime minister with a remit of seeking an [[armistice]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. De Gaulle was now in imminent danger of arrest.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp202-7</ref>\n\n===Flight with Edward Spears===\nDe Gaulle visited Reynaud, who still hoped to escape to French North Africa and declined to come to London. Reynaud still had control of secret government funds until the handover of power the next day. It has been suggested that he ordered de Gaulle to go to London, but no written evidence has ever been found to confirm this. Georges Mandel also refused to come.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p209-11</ref>\n\nAt around 09:00 on the morning of 17 June he flew to London on a British aircraft with [[Edward Spears]]. The escape was hair-raising. Spears claimed that de Gaulle had been reluctant to come, and that he had pulled him into the aircraft at the last minute, although de Gaulle's biographer does not accept this. Jean Laurent brought 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by Reynaud. De Gaulle later told [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] of the mental anguish which his flight to London \u2013 a break with the French Army and with the recognised government, which would inevitably be seen as treason by many \u2013 had caused him.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p211-6</ref>\n\n==Second World War: leader of the Free French in exile==\n{{See also|Free France}}\n\n===Appeal from London===\n[[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|General de Gaulle speaking on [[BBC Radio]] during the war]]\n[[File:De Gaulle - \u00e0 tous les Fran\u00e7ais.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|\"To all Frenchmen\": de Gaulle exhorting the French to resist the German occupation]]\n[[File:De Gaulle speech plaque in Arc de Triomphe.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|De Gaulle speech plaque in Arc de Triomphe]]\n\nDe Gaulle landed at [[Heston Airport]] soon after 12:30 on 17 June 1940. He saw Churchill at around 15:00 and Churchill offered him broadcast time on BBC. They both knew about P\u00e9tain's broadcast earlier that day that stated that \"the fighting must end\" and that he had approached the Germans for terms. That evening de Gaulle dined with Jean Monnet and denounced P\u00e9tain's \"treason\".<ref>Jackson, 2019, p 125-28.</ref> The next day the British Cabinet (Churchill was not present, as it was the day of his [[This was their finest hour|\"Finest Hour\" speech]]) were reluctant to agree to de Gaulle giving a radio address, as Britain was still in communication with the P\u00e9tain government about the fate of the French fleet. [[Duff Cooper]] (Minister of Information) had an advance copy of the text of the address, to which there were no objections. The cabinet eventually agreed after individual lobbying, as indicated by a handwritten amendment to the cabinet minutes.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp221-3</ref><ref name=\"CDG\"/>\n\nDe Gaulle's ''[[Appeal of 18 June]]'' exhorted the French people not to be demoralized and to continue to resist the occupation of France. He also \u2013 apparently on his own initiative \u2013 declared that he would broadcast again the next day.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p208\">Lacouture 1991, p208</ref> No recording survives of the 18 June speech. Few listened to it, although it was published in some newspapers in metropolitan (mainland) France. The speech was largely aimed at French soldiers who were then in Britain after being evacuated from [[Norwegian campaign|Norway]] and [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]; most showed no interest in fighting for de Gaulle's [[Free French Forces]] and were repatriated back to France to become German prisoners of war.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p226</ref>\n\nIn his next broadcast on 19 June de Gaulle denied the legitimacy of the government at Bordeaux.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p208\"/> He called on the North African troops to live up to the tradition of [[Bertrand Clausel]], [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]], and [[Hubert Lyautey]] by defying orders from Bordeaux. The British Foreign Office protested to Churchill.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p228</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle also tried, largely in vain, to attract the support of French forces in the French Empire. He telegraphed to General [[Charles Nogu\u00e8s]] (Resident-General in Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa), offering to serve under him or to cooperate in any way. Nogu\u00e8s, who was dismayed by the armistice but agreed to go along with it, refused to cooperate and forbade the press in French North Africa to publish de Gaulle's appeal. Nogu\u00e8s told the British liaison officer that de Gaulle's attitude was \"unseemly\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp229-30</ref> De Gaulle also sent a telegram to Weygand offering to serve under his orders, receiving a dismissive reply.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p230</ref>\n\nAfter the armistice was signed on 21 June 1940, de Gaulle spoke at 20:00 on 22 June to denounce it.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p236\">Lacouture 1991, p236</ref> The Bordeaux government declared him compulsorily retired from the French Army (with the rank of colonel) on 23 June 1940.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1:243-4\">Lacouture 1:243-4</ref> On 23 June the British Government denounced the armistice as a breach of the Anglo-French treaty signed in March, and stated that they no longer regarded the Bordeaux Government as a fully independent state. They also \"took note\" of the plan to establish a French National Committee ''(FNC)'' in exile, but did not mention de Gaulle by name. Jean Monnet broke with de Gaulle on 23 June, as he thought his appeal was \"too personal\" and went too far, and that French opinion would not rally to a man who was seen to be operating from British soil. He said he had warned the Foreign Office officials Alexander Cadogan and [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], as well as Edward Spears, of his concerns about de Gaulle. Monnet soon resigned as head of the Inter-Allied Commission and departed for the US. De Gaulle broadcast again on 24 June.<ref>Lacouture 1991, pp236-7</ref>\n\n===Leader of the Free French===\nThe armistice took effect from 00:35 on 25 June.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p236\"/> Alexander Cadogan of the foreign office sent [[Gladwyn Jebb]], then a fairly junior official, to ask de Gaulle to tone down his next broadcast on 26 June; de Gaulle backed down under protest when Jebb told him that he would otherwise be banned from broadcasting. He claimed erroneously that the French fleet was to be handed over to the Germans.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p248-51</ref> On 26 June de Gaulle wrote to Churchill demanding recognition of his French Committee.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p208\"/> On 28 June, after Churchill's envoys had failed to establish contact with the French leaders in North Africa, the British Government recognised de Gaulle as leader of the Free French, despite the reservations of Halifax and Cadogan at the foreign office.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p243</ref> Cadogan later wrote that de Gaulle was \"that c*** of a fellow\", but other foreign office figures [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]] and [[Oliver Harvey, 1st Baron Harvey of Tasburgh|Oliver Harvey]] were quite sympathetic, as was ''The Times'' which gave de Gaulle plenty of coverage.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p249-50</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle had little success in attracting the support of major figures. Ambassador [[Charles Corbin]], who had strongly supported the mooted Anglo-French Union on 16 June, resigned from the French Foreign Office but retired to South America. [[Alexis Leger]], Secretary-General at the [[Quai d'Orsay]] (who hated Reynaud for sacking him) came to London but went on to the US. Roland de Margerie stayed in France despite his opposition to the armistice. De Gaulle received support from Captain Tissier and [[Andr\u00e9 Dewavrin]] (both of whom had been fighting in Norway prior to joining the Free French), [[Gaston Palewski]], [[Maurice Schumann]], and the jurist [[Ren\u00e9 Cassin]].<ref>Lacouture 1991, p239</ref>\n\nP\u00e9tain's government was recognised by the US, the USSR, and the Papacy, and controlled the French fleet and the forces in almost all her colonies. At this time de Gaulle's followers consisted of a secretary of limited competence, three colonels, a dozen captains, a famous law professor (Cassin), and three battalions of [[French Foreign Legion|legionnaires]] who had agreed to stay in Britain and fight for him. For a time the [[New Hebrides]] were the only French colony to back de Gaulle.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p244</ref> On 30 June 1940 [[\u00c9mile Muselier|Admiral Muselier]] joined the Free French.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p263\">Lacouture 1991, p263</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle initially reacted angrily to news of the Royal Navy's [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|attack on the French fleet]] (3 July); P\u00e9tain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him \"astonishingly objective\" and acknowledging that it was the right thing from the British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown \"a splendid dignity\". In his broadcast of 8 July he spoke of the \"pain and anger\" caused by the attack and that it was a \"hateful tragedy not a glorious battle\", but that one day the enemy would have used the ships against England or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean \"bondage forever\" for France. \"Our two ancient nations...remain bound to one another. They will either go down both together or both together they will win\".<ref>Lacouture 1991, p248-9</ref>\n[[File:General De Gaulle inspecting sailors on the Free French ship LEOPARD at Greenock, 24 June 1942.

His family had left Brittany (the other ship which left at the same time was sunk) and lived for a time at [[Petts Wood]]. As his daughter Anne was terrified by the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] they moved to [[Ellesmere, Shropshire|Ellesmere]] in Shropshire, a four-hour journey from London and where de Gaulle was only able to visit them once a month. His wife and daughter also lived for a time in the country at Rodinghead House, [[Little Gaddesden]], in Hertfordshire, 45 kilometres (28 miles) from central London. De Gaulle lived at the [[Connaught Hotel]] in London, then from 1942 to 1944 he lived in [[Hampstead]], North London.<ref>Lacouture 1:257\u201358</ref>\n\nThe Vichy regime had already sentenced de Gaulle to four years' imprisonment; on 2 August 1940 he was condemned to death by court martial ''in absentia'', although P\u00e9tain commented that he would ensure that the sentence was never carried out.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1:243-4\"/> De Gaulle said of the sentence, \"I consider the act of the Vichy men as void; I shall have an explanation with them after the victory\".<ref name=\"sptimes19400803\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dk8wAAAAIBAJ&pg=3148%2C219080 | title=French Take Part in Air Raids | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=1940-08-03 | accessdate=2018-08-09 | page=1}}</ref> He and Churchill reached agreement on 7 August 1940, that Britain would fund the Free French, with the bill to be settled after the war (the financial agreement was finalised in March 1941).

He was sacked by Vichy and arrived in London on 31 August; de Gaulle had gone to Dakar, but they met in [[Chad]] four weeks later. He was the most senior military figure to defect to the Free French.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p263\"/>\n\nIn October 1940, after talks between the foreign office and [[Louis Rougier]], de Gaulle was asked to tone down his attacks on P\u00e9tain. On average he spoke on BBC radio three times a month.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p250-1\">Lacouture 1991, p250-1</ref>\n\n===De Gaulle and P\u00e9tain: rival visions of France===\nPrime Minister P\u00e9tain moved the government to Vichy (2 July) and had the National Assembly (10 July) vote to dissolve itself and give him dictatorial powers, making the beginning of his ''R\u00e9volution nationale'' (National Revolution) intended to \"reorient\" French society. This was the dawn of the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].<ref name=\"Lacouture 1:243-4\"/>\n\nDe Gaulle's subsequent speeches reached many parts of the territories under the Vichy regime, helping to rally the French resistance movement and earning him much popularity amongst the French people and soldiers. The British historian Christopher Flood noted that there were major differences between the speeches of de Gaulle and P\u00e9tain, which reflected their views on themselves and of France. P\u00e9tain always used the personal pronoun ''je'', portrayed himself as both a Christ-like figure sacrificing himself for France while also assuming a God-like tone of a semi-omniscient narrator who knew truths about the world that the rest of the French did not.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\">{{cite book|last1=Flood|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Holman|editor1-first=Valerie|editor2-last=Kelly|editor2-first=Debra|title=France at War in the Twentieth Century; Propaganda, Myth, and Metaphor|date=2000|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=9781571817013|pages=88\u2013110|chapter-url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HolmanFrance|accessdate=19 November 2017|chapter=P\u00e9tain and de Gaulle}}</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle began by making frequent use of \"I\" and \"me\" in his war-time speeches, but over time, their use declined. Unlike P\u00e9tain, de Gaulle never invoked quasi-religious imagery to enhance his prestige.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" />\n\nDe Gaulle always mentioned P\u00e9tain by name whereas P\u00e9tain never mentioned de Gaulle directly, referring to him as the \"''faux ami''\" (\"false friend\").<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" />\n\nP\u00e9tain exonerated the French military of responsibility for the defeat of 1940 which he blamed on the moral decline of French society (thus making his ''R\u00e9volution nationale'' necessary) while de Gaulle blamed the military chiefs while exonerating French society for the defeat (thus suggesting that French society was nowhere near as rotten as P\u00e9tain claimed, making the ''R\u00e9volution nationale'' unnecessary).<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> P\u00e9tain claimed that France had \"stupidly\" declared war on Germany in 1939 at British prompting while de Gaulle spoke of the entire era since 1914 as \"''la guerre de trente ans''\" (\"the thirty years' war\"), arguing the two world wars were really one with a long truce in between.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> The only historical figure P\u00e9tain invoked was [[Joan of Arc]] as a model of self-sacrificing French patriotism in the \"eternal struggle\" against England whereas de Gaulle invoked virtually every major French historical figure from the ancient Gauls to World War I.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> De Gaulle's willingness to invoke historical figures from before and after 1789 was meant to suggest that his France was an inclusive France where there was room for both left and right, in contrast to P\u00e9tain's demand for national unity under his leadership.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> Most significantly, P\u00e9tain's speeches always stressed the need for France to withdraw from a hostile and threatening world to find unity.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" /> By contrast, de Gaulle's speeches, while praising the greatness of France, lacked P\u00e9tain's implicit xenophobia; the fight for a free, democratic and inclusive France was always portrayed as part of a wider worldwide struggle for world freedom, where France would be an anchor for a new democratic order.<ref name=\"HolmanKelly-2000\" />\n\nDe Gaulle spoke more of \"the Republic\" than of \"democracy\"; before his death Ren\u00e9 Cassin claimed that he had \"succeeded in turning de Gaulle towards democracy\". However, claims that de Gaulle was surrounded by [[Cagoulards]], Royalists and other right-wing extremists are untrue. Some of Andr\u00e9 Dewavrin's closest colleagues were Cagoulards, although Dewavrin always denied that he himself was. Many leading figures of the Free French and the Resistance, e.g., [[Jean Moulin]] and [[Pierre Brossolette]], were on the political left.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p254-5</ref> By the end of 1940 de Gaulle was beginning to be recognised as the leader of the Resistance, a position cemented after Jean Moulin's visit to London in autumn 1941.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p256\"/> In the summer of 1941 the BBC set aside five minutes per day (later increased to ten) for the Free French, with Maurice Schumann as the main spokesman, and eventually there was a programme \"Les Francais parlent aux Francais\". A newspaper ''France'' was also soon set up.<ref name=\"Lacouture 1991, p250-1\"/>\n\nDe Gaulle organised the Free French Forces and the Allies gave increasing support and recognition to de Gaulle's efforts. In London in September 1941 de Gaulle formed the Free French National Council, with himself as president. It was an all-encompassing coalition of resistance forces, ranging from conservative Catholics like himself to communists. By early 1942, the \"Fighting French\" movement, as it was now called, gained rapidly in power and influence; it overcame Vichy in Syria and Lebanon, adding to its base. Dealing with the French communists was a delicate issue, for they were under Moscow's control and the USSR was friendly with Germany in 1940\u201341 as a result of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. They came into the Free French movement only when [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded Russia]] in June 1941. De Gaulle's policy then became one of friendship directly with Moscow, but [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] showed little interest.<ref>Lacouture 1:373, 462</ref> In 1942, de Gaulle created the [[Normandie-Niemen]] squadron, a [[Free French Air Force]] regiment, in order to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. It is the only Western allied formation to have fought until the end of the war in the East.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bg8drRyDGhEC&pg=PA361|title = 500 Days: The War in Eastern Europe, 1944\u20131945|isbn=978-1-4349-6159-4|page=361|last1 = McAteer|first1 = Sean M.|year = 2009}}</ref>\n\n===De Gaulle's relations with the ''Anglo-Saxons''===\n[[File:Sikorski McNaughton Churchill de Gaulle C064027.jpg|thumb|right|Charles de Gaulle (far right) with [[Andrew McNaughton]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], and [[Winston Churchill]]]]\nIn his dealings with the British and Americans (both referred to as the \"Anglo-Saxons\", in de Gaulle's parlance), he always insisted on retaining full freedom of action on behalf of France and was constantly on the verge of losing the Allies' support.

As an adult he spoke German much better than he spoke English; he had thought little of the British Army's contribution to the First World War, and even less of that of 1939\u201340, and in the 1930s he had been a reader of the journal ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]'' which blamed Britain for German foreign policy gains at France's expense.<ref>Lacouture 1991, p220</ref> De Gaulle explained his position:{{quote|Never did the Anglo-Saxons really treat us as real allies. They never consulted us, government to government, on any of their provisions. For political purpose or by convenience, they sought to use the French forces for their own goals, as if these forces belonged to them, alleging that they had provided weapons to them [...] I considered that I had to play the French game, since the others were playing theirs ...

Winston Churchill was often frustrated at what he perceived as de Gaulle's patriotic arrogance, but also wrote of his \"immense admiration\" for him during the early days of his British exile. Although their relationship later became strained, Churchill tried to explain the reasons for de Gaulle's behaviour in the second volume of [[The Second World War (book series)|his history of World War II]]:{{quote|He felt it was essential to his position before the French people that he should maintain a proud and haughty demeanour towards \"[[perfidious Albion]]\", although in exile, dependent upon our protection and dwelling in our midst.

He certainly carried out this policy with perseverance.}}\n\nDe Gaulle described his adversarial relationship with Churchill in these words: \"When I am right, I get angry.

But the War Cabinet warned Churchill that a precipitate break with de Gaulle would have a disastrous effect on the whole resistance movement. By autumn 1943, Churchill had to acknowledge that de Gaulle had won the struggle for leadership of Free France.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/06/world/churchill-and-roosevelt-wanted-de-gaulle-out-britain-discloses.html \"Churchill and Roosevelt Wanted de Gaulle Out, Britain Discloses\"], ''New York Times'', 6 January 2000.</ref>\n\n[[File:Franklin D.

Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, referred to de Gaulle as \"an apprentice dictator\", a view backed by a number of leading Frenchmen in Washington, including [[Jean Monnet]], who later became an instrumental figure in the setting up of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] that led to the modern [[European Union]]. Roosevelt directed Churchill to not provide de Gaulle with strategic details of the imminent invasion because he did not trust him to keep the information to himself. French codes were considered weak, posing a risk since the Free French refused to use British or American codes.<ref name=Beevor/> De Gaulle refused to share coded information with the British, who were then obliged secretly to break the codes to read French messages.<ref>Singh, Simon (2000).

De Gaulle refused because of Roosevelt's intention to install a provisional Allied military government in the former occupied territories pending elections, but he eventually relented and flew to Britain the next day.\n\n[[File:Winston Churchill with General de Gaulle during an inspection of French troops at Marrakesh in Morocco, January 1944.

De Gaulle was very concerned that an American takeover of the French administration would just provoke a communist uprising.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nChurchill then lost his temper, saying that Britain would always be an ally to the United States, and that under the circumstances, if they had to choose between France and the US, Britain would always choose the latter. De Gaulle replied that he realised this would always be the case. The next day, de Gaulle refused to address the French nation as the script again made no mention of his being the legitimate interim ruler of France. It instructed the French people to obey Allied military authorities until elections could be held, and so the row continued, with de Gaulle calling Churchill a \"gangster\". Churchill accused de Gaulle of treason in the height of battle, and demanded that he be flown back to Algiers \"in chains if necessary\".<ref name=Beevor/>\n\nDe Gaulle and Churchill had a complex relationship during the wartime period.

Initially landing as part of [[Operation Dragoon]], in the south of France, the [[French First Army]] helped to liberate almost one third of the country and participated in the invasion and occupation of Germany. As the invasion slowly progressed and the Germans were pushed back, de Gaulle made preparations to return to France.\n\n[[File:HD-SN-99-02715.JPEG|thumb|left|General de Gaulle delivering a speech in liberated [[Cherbourg]] from the h\u00f4tel de ville (town hall)]]\n\nOn 14 June 1944, he left Britain for France for what was supposed to be a one-day trip. Despite an agreement that he would take only two staff, he was accompanied by a large entourage with extensive luggage, and although many rural Normans remained mistrustful of him, he was warmly greeted by the inhabitants of the towns he visited, such as the badly damaged [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]]. Finally he arrived at the city of [[Bayeux]], which he now proclaimed as the capital of Free France. Appointing his Aide-de-Camp Francois Coulet as head of the civil administration, de Gaulle returned to the UK that same night on a French destroyer, and although the official position of the supreme military command remained unchanged, local Allied officers found it more practical to deal with the fledgling administration in Bayeux in everyday matters.<ref name=Beevor/> De Gaulle flew to Algiers on 16 June and then went on to Rome to meet the Pope and the new Italian government. At the beginning of July he at last visited Roosevelt in Washington, where he received the 17-gun salute of a senior military leader rather than the 21 guns of a visiting head of state. The visit was 'devoid of trust on both sides' according to the French representative,<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" /> however, Roosevelt did make some concessions towards recognising the legitimacy of the Bayeux administration.\n\nMeanwhile, with the Germans retreating in the face of the Allied onslaught, harried all the way by the resistance, there were widespread instances of revenge attacks on those accused of collaboration. A number of prominent officials and members of the feared [[Milice]] were murdered, often by exceptionally brutal means, provoking the Germans into appalling reprisals, such as in the destruction of the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] and the killing of its 642 inhabitants.<ref name=Macksey>Macksey, Kenneth (1966) ''[[Purnell's History of the Second World War]]'': No. 123. \"The Liberation of Paris\"</ref>\n\nLiberation of the French capital was not high on the Allies' list of priorities as it had comparatively little strategic value, but both de Gaulle and the commander of the French 2nd Armored Division, General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Philippe Leclerc]] were still extremely concerned about a communist takeover. De Gaulle successfully lobbied for Paris to be made a priority for liberation on humanitarian grounds and obtained from Allied Supreme Commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] an agreement that French troops would be allowed to enter the capital first. A few days later, General Leclerc's division entered the outskirts of the city, and after [[Liberation of Paris|six days of fighting]] in which the resistance played a major part, the German garrison of 5000 men surrendered on 25 August, although some sporadic outbreaks of fighting continued for several days. General [[Dietrich von Choltitz]], the commander of the garrison, was instructed by Hitler to raze the city to the ground, however, he simply ignored the order and surrendered his forces.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:General Charles de Gaulle and his entourage set off from the Arc de Triumphe down the Champs Elysees.jpg|thumb|General de Gaulle and his entourage stroll down the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] following the liberation of Paris in August 1944]]\n[[File:Crowds of French patriots line the Champs Elysees-edit2.jpg|thumb|The [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd Armored Division]] passes through the [[Arc de Triomphe]]. Signs read \"Long live de Gaulle\" and \"De Gaulle to power\".]]\n\nIt was fortunate for de Gaulle that the Germans had forcibly removed members of the Vichy government and taken them to Germany a few days earlier on 20 August; it allowed him to enter Paris as a liberator in the midst of the general euphoria,<ref name=\"Second World War 1966\">Mondal, Jacques (1966) ''[[Purnell's History of the Second World War]]'': No. 72 1966.</ref> but there were serious concerns that communist elements of the resistance, which had done so much to clear the way for the military, would try to seize the opportunity to proclaim their own 'Peoples' Government' in the capital. De Gaulle made contact with Leclerc and demanded the presence of the 2nd Armoured Division to accompany him on a massed parade down the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], \"as much for prestige as for security\".<ref name=\"Second World War 1966\"/> This was in spite of the fact that Leclerc's unit was fighting as part of the American 1st Army and were under strict orders to continue their next objective without obeying orders from anyone else. In the event, the American General [[Omar Bradley]] decided that Leclerc's division would be indispensable for the maintenance of order and the liquidation of the last pockets of resistance in the French capital. Earlier, on 21 August, de Gaulle had appointed his military advisor General [[Marie-Pierre Koenig]] as Governor of Paris.\n\nAs his procession came along the Place de la Concorde on Saturday 26 August, it came under machine gun fire by Vichy militia and [[fifth column]]ists who were unable to give themselves up. Later, on entering the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] to be received as head of the provisional government by the Committee of Liberation, loud shots broke out again, and Leclerc and Koenig tried to hustle him through the door, but de Gaulle shook off their hands and never faltered. While the battle began outside, he walked slowly down the aisle. Before he had gone far a machine pistol fired down from above, at least two more joined in, and from below the [[Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Int\u00e9rieur|FFI]] and police fired back. A BBC correspondent who was present reported;\n\n{{quote|... the General is being presented to the people. He is being received...they have opened fire! ... firing started all over the place ... that was one of the most dramatic scenes I have ever seen. ... General de Gaulle walked straight ahead into what appeared to me to be a hail of fire ... but he went straight ahead without hesitation, his shoulders flung back, and walked right down the centre aisle, even while the bullets were pouring about him. It was the most extraordinary example of courage I have ever seen ... there were bangs, flashes all about him, yet he seemed to have an absolutely charmed life.<ref>''TIME'', 4 September 1944.</ref>}}\n\nLater, in the great hall of the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]], de Gaulle was greeted by a jubilant crowd and, proclaiming the continuity of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], delivered a famous proclamation;\n\n{{quote|Paris! Paris outraged, Paris broken, Paris martyred, but Paris liberated! Liberated by itself, liberated by its people with the assistance of the armies of France, with the support and assistance of the whole of France! ... The enemy is faltering but he is not yet beaten. He is still on our soil. It will not suffice that we, with the assistance of our dear and admirable allies, will have chased him from our home in order to be satisfied after what has happened. We want to enter his territory, as is fitting, as conquerors. ... It is for this revenge, this vengeance and this justice, that we will continue to fight until the last day, until the day of the total and complete victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/pendant-la-guerre-1940-1946/discours-de-l-hotel-de-ville-de-paris-25-aout-1944.php|title=Discours de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville de Paris, 25 ao\u00fbt 1944|publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127174456/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/pendant-la-guerre-1940-1946/discours-de-l-hotel-de-ville-de-paris-25-aout-1944.php|archivedate=27 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThat evening, the Wehrmacht launched a massive aerial and artillery barrage of Paris in revenge, leaving several thousand dead or injured.<ref name=\"Second World War 1966\"/> The situation in Paris remained tense, and a few days later de Gaulle, still unsure of the trend of events asked General Eisenhower to send some American troops into Paris as a show of strength.

Eisenhower, unlike Roosevelt, wanted to cooperate with de Gaulle, and he secured a last-minute promise from the President on the eve of D-Day that the Allied officers would not act as military governors and would instead cooperate with the local authorities as the Allied forces liberated French Territory. De Gaulle would later claim in his memoirs that he blocked AMGOT.<ref>Kim Munholland, ''Rock of Contention, Free French and Americans at War in New Caledonia 1940\u20131945'', Berghahn Books, New York, Oxford, 2005, p. 190.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\n[[File:The Campaign in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU158.jpg|thumb|left|General de Gaulle with General Leclerc and other French officers at Montparnasse railway station in Paris, 25 August 1944]]\n\nWith the prewar parties and most of their leaders discredited, there was little opposition to de Gaulle and his associates forming an interim administration. In order not to be seen as presuming on his position in such austere times, de Gaulle did not use one of the grand official residences such as [[Hotel de Matignon]] or the presidential palace on the Elysee, but resided briefly in his old office at the War Ministry. When he was joined by his wife and daughters a short while later, they moved into a small state-owned villa on edge of [[Bois de Boulogne]] which had once been set aside for [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]].<ref name=\"Werth\">De Gaulle. Alexander Werth (1965)</ref>\n\nLiving conditions immediately after the liberation were even worse than under German rule. About 25% of the city was in ruins and public services and fuel were almost nonexistent. Large-scale public demonstrations erupted all over France, protesting the apparent lack of action at improving the supply of food, while in Normandy, bakeries were pillaged. The problem was not French agriculture, which had largely continued operating without problems, but the near-total breakdown of the country's infrastructure. Large areas of track had been destroyed by bombing, most modern equipment, rolling stock, lorries and farm animals had been taken to Germany and all the bridges over the [[Seine]], the [[Loire]] and the [[Rhone]] between Paris and the sea had been destroyed. The black market pushed real prices to four times the level of 1939, causing the government to print money to try to improve the money supply, which only added to inflation.<ref name=Werth/>\n\nOn 10 November 1944, Churchill flew to Paris to a reception by de Gaulle and the two together were greeted by thousands of cheering Parisians on the next day.<ref name=\"winstonchurchill.org\"/> [[Harold Nicolson]] stated that [[Anthony Eden]] told him that \"not for one moment did Winston stop crying, and that he could have filled buckets by the time he received the Freedom of Paris.\"<ref name=\"winstonchurchill.org\"/> He said \"they yelled for Churchill in a way that he has never heard any crowd yell before.\" At an official luncheon, de Gaulle said, \"It is true that we would not have seen [the liberation] if our old and gallant ally England, and all the British dominions under precisely the impulsion and inspiration of those we are honouring today, had not deployed the extraordinary determination to win, and that magnificent courage which saved the freedom of the world. There is no French man or woman who is not touched to the depths of their hearts and souls by this.\"<ref name=\"winstonchurchill.org\"/>\n\n===Curbing the Communist Resistance===\nAfter the celebrations had died down, de Gaulle began conferring with leading Resistance figures who, with the Germans gone, intended to continue as a political and military force, and asked to be given a government building to serve as their headquarters. The Resistance, in which the Communists were competing with other trends for leadership, had developed its own manifesto for social and political change known as the [[National Council of the Resistance]] (CNR) Charter, and wanted special status to enter the army under their own flags, ranks and honours. Despite their decisive support in backing him against Giraud, de Gaulle disappointed some of the Resistance leaders by telling them that although their efforts and sacrifices had been recognised, they had no further role to play and, that unless they joined the regular army, they should lay down their arms and return to civilian life.<ref name=Werth />\n\nBelieving them to be a dangerous revolutionary force, de Gaulle moved to break up the liberation committees and other militias. The communists were not only extremely active, but they received a level of popular support that disturbed de Gaulle. As early as May 1943, the US Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] had written to Roosevelt urging him to take action to attempt to curb the rise of communism in France.<ref name=Schoenbrun/>\n\n===Provisional Government of the French Republic===\nOn 10 September 1944 the Provisional Government of the French Republic, or Government of National Unanimity formed. It included many of de Gaulle's Free French associates such as [[Gaston Palewski]], Claude Guy, [[Claude Mauriac]] and [[Jacques Soustelle]], together with members of the main parties, which included the [[French Section of the Workers' International|Socialists]] and a new Christian Democratic Party, the MRP under the leadership of Georges Bidault, who served as Foreign Minister. The president of the prewar Senate [[Jules Jeanneney]] was brought back as second-ranking member, but because of their links with Russia, de Gaulle allowed the Communists only two minor positions in his government. While they were now a major political force with over a million members, of the full cabinet of 22 men, only Augustin Laurent and [[Charles Tillon]]\u2014who as head of [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]] had been one of the most active members of the resistance\u2014were given ministries. However, de Gaulle did pardon the Communists' leader [[Maurice Thorez]], who had been sentenced to death ''in absentia'' by the French government for desertion. On his return home from Russia, Thorez delivered a speech supporting de Gaulle in which he said that for the present, the war against Germany was the only task that mattered.\n\nThere were also a number of new faces in the government, including a literary academic, [[Georges Pompidou]], who had written to one of de Gaulle's recruiting agents offering his services, and Jean Monnet, who in spite of his past opposition to the General now recognized the need for unity and served as Commissioner for Economic Planning. Of equal rank to ministers and answerable only to the prime minister, a number of Commissioners of the Republic (Commissaires de la R\u00e9publique) were appointed to re-establish the democratic institutions of France and to extend the legitimacy of the provisional government. A number of former Free French associates served as commissioners, including [[Henri Fr\u00e9ville]], [[Raymond Aubrac]] and [[Michel Debr\u00e9]], who was charged with reforming the civil service. Controversially, de Gaulle also appointed [[Maurice Papon]] as Commissioner for Aquitaine in spite of his involvement in the deportation of Jews while serving as a senior police official in the Vichy regime during the occupation. (Over the years, Papon remained in high official positions but continued to be implicated in controversial events such as the [[Paris massacre of 1961]],<ref>''Daily Mail'', 22 October 2011.</ref> eventually being convicted of crimes against humanity in 1998.)\n\nIn social policy, legislation was introduced{{by whom|date=January 2016}} in February 1945 that provided for the establishment of works committees in all private industrial establishments employing more than 50 (originally more than 100) people.<ref>Chambers Encyclopaedia new edition, Volume V: Edward-Franks, George Newnes Ltd. 1959, supplementary information 1961, printed and bound in England by Hazel Watson and Viney Ltd., Aylesbury and Slough.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\n===Tour of major cities===\nDe Gaulle's policy was to postpone elections as long as 2.6&nbsp;million French were in Germany as prisoners of war and forced laborers. In mid-September, he embarked upon a tour of major provincial cities to increase his public profile and to help cement his position. Although he received a largely positive reception from the crowds who came out to see him, he reflected that only a few months previously the very same people had come out to cheer Marshal P\u00e9tain when he was serving the Vichy regime. Raymond Aubrac said that the General showed himself to be ill-at-ease at social functions; in [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]] he became irate when he had to sit next to former Resistance leaders and also voiced his distaste for the rowdy, libidinous behavior of French youths during the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquisard]] parades which preceded his speech.<ref name=Werth /> When he reached [[Toulouse]], de Gaulle also had to confront the leaders of a group which had proclaimed themselves to be the provincial government of the city.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nDuring the tour, de Gaulle showed his customary lack of concern for his own safety by mixing with the crowds and thus making himself an easy target for an assassin. Although he was naturally shy, the good use of amplification and patriotic music enabled him to deliver his message that though all of France was fragmented and suffering, together they would rise again. During every speech he would stop halfway through to invite the crowd to join him in singing ''La Marseillaise'', before continuing and finishing by raising his hands in the air and crying \"Vive la France!\"<ref name=Werth/>\n\n===Legal purges (\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale)===\nAs the war entered the final stages, the nation was forced to confront the reality of how many of its people had behaved under German rule. In France, collaborators were more severely punished than in most other occupied countries.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Perry, K. (1976) ''Modern European History'', W.H. Allen; {{ISBN|0750604824}}</ref> Immediately after the liberation, countless women accused of aiding, abetting, and taking German soldiers as lovers were subjected to public humiliations such as being shaved bald and paraded through the streets in their underwear. Women who got this treatment were lucky as many others were simply attacked by lynch mobs. With so many of their former members having been hunted down and killed by the Nazis and paramilitary Milice, the Partisans had already summarily executed an estimated 4,500 people,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and the Communists in particular continued to press for severe action against collaborators. In Paris alone, over 150,000 people were at some time detained on suspicion of collaboration, although most were later released. Famous figures accused included the industrialist [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]], the actress [[Arletty]], who had lived openly with a German officer in [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris|the Ritz]], the opera star [[Tino Rossi]], the chanteuse [[\u00c9dith Piaf]], the stage actor [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Coco Chanel]], who was briefly detained but fled to Switzerland.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nKeenly aware of the need to seize the initiative and to get the process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister [[Fran\u00e7ois de Menthon]] to lead the Legal Purge ([[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale]]) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'\u2014such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy in order to keep the country running as normally as possible\u2014he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" /> Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down.<ref name=Werth /> It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government\u2014such as Maurice Papon and [[Ren\u00e9 Bousquet]]\u2014escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.<ref name=Werth />\n\nLater, there was the question of what to do with the former Vichy leaders when they were finally returned to France. Marshal P\u00e9tain and [[Maxime Weygand]] were war heroes from World War I and were now extremely old; convicted of treason, P\u00e9tain received a death sentence which his old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 de Gaulle commuted to life imprisonment, while Weygand was eventually acquitted. Three Vichy leaders were executed. [[Joseph Darnand]], who became an SS officer and led the Milice paramilitaries who hunted down members of the Resistance, was executed in October 1945. [[Fernand de Brinon]], the third-ranking Vichy official, was found guilty of war crimes and executed in April 1947. The two trials of the most infamous collaborator of all, [[Pierre Laval]], who was heavily implicated in the murder of Jews, were widely criticised as being unfair for depriving him of the opportunity to properly defend himself, although Laval antagonized the court throughout with his bizarre behavior. He was found guilty of treason in May 1945 and de Gaulle was adamant that there would be no commuting the death sentence, saying that Laval's execution was \"an indispensable symbolic gesture required for reasons of state\". There was a widespread belief, particularly in the years that followed, that de Gaulle was trying to appease both the Third Republic politicians and the former Vichy leaders who had made Laval their scapegoat.<ref name=Werth/>\n\n===Winter of 1944===\nThe winter of 1944{{ndash}}45 was especially difficult for most of the population. Inflation showed no sign of slowing down and food shortages were severe. The prime minister and the other Gaullists were forced to try to balance the desires of ordinary people and public servants for a return to normal life with pressure from Bidault's MRP and the Communists for the large scale nationalisation programme and other social changes that formed the main tenets of the CNR Charter. At the end of 1944 the coal industry and other energy companies were nationalised, followed shortly afterwards by major banks and finance houses, the merchant navy, the main aircraft manufacturers, airlines and a number of major private enterprises such as the [[Renault]] car company at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], whose owner had been implicated as a collaborator and accused of having made huge profits working for the Nazis.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" /> In some cases, unions, feeling that things were not progressing quickly enough, took matters into their own hands, occupying premises and setting up workers' committees to run the companies.<ref name=Werth /> Women were also allowed the vote for the first time, a new social security system was introduced to cover most medical costs, unions were expanded and price controls introduced to try to curb inflation. At de Gaulle's request, the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' was founded in December 1944 to provide France with a quality daily journal similar to those in other countries. ''Le Monde'' took over the premises and facilities of the older ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', whose independence and reputation had been badly compromised during the Vichy years.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nDuring this period there were a number of minor disagreements between the French and the other Allies. The British ambassador to France [[Duff Cooper, 1st Viscount Norwich|Duff Cooper]] said that de Gaulle seemed to seek out real or imagined insults to take offence at whatever possible.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" /> De Gaulle believed Britain and the US were intending to keep their armies in France after the war and were secretly working to take over its overseas possessions and to prevent it from regaining its political and economic strength. In late October he complained that the Allies were failing to adequately arm and equip the new French army and instructed Bidault to use the French veto at the European Council.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nOn Armistice Day in 1945, Winston Churchill made his first visit to France since the liberation and received a good reception in Paris where he laid a wreath to [[Georges Clemenceau]]. The occasion also marked the first official appearance of de Gaulle's wife Yvonne, but the visit was less friendly than it appeared. De Gaulle had instructed that there be no excessive displays of public affection towards Churchill and no official awards without his prior agreement. When crowds cheered Churchill during a parade down the Elysee, de Gaulle was heard to remark, \"Fools and cretins! Look at the rabble cheering the old bandit\".<ref name=Werth />\n\n===Visit to the Soviet Union===\nWith the Russian forces making more rapid advances into German-held territory than the Allies, there was a sudden public realisation that the Soviet Union was about to dominate large parts of eastern Europe. In fact, at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo]] and [[Tehran Conference]]s in 1943 Britain and America had already agreed to allow Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary to fall under the Soviet sphere of influence after the war, with shared influence in Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Robottom\">Robottom, John (1972) ''Modern Russia'', McGraw-Hill</ref> The UK was to retain hegemony over Greece, although there had been no agreement over Poland, whose eastern territories were already in Soviet hands under the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, and which retained a government in exile in London.<ref name=Robottom/> De Gaulle had not been invited to any of the '[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]' Conferences, although the decisions made by Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt in dividing up Europe were of huge importance to France.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nDe Gaulle and his Foreign Minister Bidault stated that they were not in favour of a 'Western Bloc' that would be separate from the rest of Europe, and hoped that a resurgent France might be able to act as a 'third force' in Europe to temper the ambitions of the two emerging superpowers, America and Soviet Union.<ref name=Schoenbrun/> He began seeking an audience with Stalin to press his 'facing both ways' policy, and finally received an invitation in late 1944. In his memoirs, de Gaulle devoted 24 pages to his visit to the Soviet Union, but a number of writers make the point that his version of events differs significantly from that of the Soviets, of foreign news correspondents, and with their own eyewitness accounts.<ref name=Schoenbrun/><ref name=Werth/>\n\nDe Gaulle wanted access to German coal in the [[Ruhr]] as reparations after the war, the left bank of the Rhine to be incorporated into French territory, and for the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in Poland to become Germany's official eastern border. De Gaulle began by requesting that France enter into a treaty with the Soviet Union on this basis, but Stalin, who remained in constant contact with Churchill throughout the visit, said that it would be impossible to make such an agreement without the consent of Britain and America. He suggested that it might be possible to add France's name to the existing [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] if they agreed to recognise the Soviet-backed provisional Polish government known as the [[Lublin Committee]] as rightful rulers of Poland, but de Gaulle refused on the grounds that this would be 'un-French', as it would mean it being a junior partner in an alliance.<ref name=Schoenbrun /> During the visit, de Gaulle accompanied the deputy Soviet leader [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] on a tour of the former battleground at [[Stalingrad]], where he was deeply moved at the scene of carnage he witnessed and surprised Molotov by referring to \"our joint sacrifice\".<ref name=Schoenbrun />\n\nThough the treaty which was eventually signed by Bidault and Molotov carried symbolic importance in that it enabled de Gaulle to demonstrate that he was recognised as the official head of state and show that France's voice was being heard abroad, it was of little relevance to Stalin due to France's lack of real political and military power; it did not affect the outcome of the post-war settlement. Stalin later commented that like Churchill and Roosevelt, he found de Gaulle to be awkward and stubborn and believed that he was 'not a complicated person' (by which he meant that he was an old-style nationalist).<ref name=Schoenbrun /> Stalin also felt that he lacked realism in claiming the same rights as the major powers and did not object to Roosevelt's refusal to allow de Gaulle to attend the 'Big Three' conferences that were to come at Yalta and Potsdam.\n\n===Strasbourg===\nAt the end of 1944 French forces continued to advance as part of the American armies, but during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] there was a dispute over Eisenhower's order to French troops to evacuate [[Strasbourg]], which had just been liberated so as to straighten the defensive line against the German counterattack.<ref name=Schoenbrun /> Strasbourg was an important political and psychological symbol of French sovereignty in [[Alsace and Lorraine]], and de Gaulle, saying that its loss would bring down the government, refused to allow a retreat, predicting that \"Strasbourg will be our Stalingrad\".<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nBy early 1945 it was clear that the price controls which had been introduced to control inflation had only served to boost the black market and prices continued to move ever upwards. By this time the army had swelled to over 1.2&nbsp;million men and almost half of state expenditure was going to military spending.<ref name=Werth/> De Gaulle was faced with his first major ministerial dispute when the very able but tough-minded economics minister [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France]] demanded a programme of severe monetary reform which was opposed by the Finance Ministry headed by [[Aim\u00e9 Lepercq|Aime Lepercq]], who favoured a programme of heavy borrowing to stimulate the economy.<ref name=Werth /> When de Gaulle, knowing there would be little appetite for further austerity measures sided with Lepercq, Mend\u00e8s France tendered his resignation, which was rejected because de Gaulle knew he needed him. Lepercq was killed in a road accident a short time afterwards and was succeeded by Pleven, but when in March, Mend\u00e8s France asked unsuccessfully for taxes on capital earnings and for the blocking of certain bank accounts, he again offered his resignation and it was accepted.<ref name=Werth />\n\n===Yalta Conference===\n\nDe Gaulle was never invited to the summit conferences of Allied leaders such as [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]]. He never forgave the Big Three leaders (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin) for their neglect and continued to rage against it as having been a negative factor in European politics for the rest of his life.<ref name=Schoenbrun />\n\nAfter the [[Operation Plunder|Rhine crossings]], the French First Army captured a large section of territory in southern Germany, but although this later allowed France to play a part in the signing of the German surrender, Roosevelt in particular refused to allow any discussion about de Gaulle participating in the Big Three conferences that would shape Europe in the post-war world. Churchill pressed hard for France to be included 'at the inter-allied table', but on 6 December 1944 the American president wired both Stalin and Churchill to say that de Gaulle's presence would \"merely introduce a complicating and undesirable factor\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Winston S. Churchill|title=Triumph and Tragedy: The Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VArC_rYqimoC&pg=PA259|year=1950|page=259|isbn=9780795311475}}</ref>\n\nAt the Yalta Conference in February 1945, despite Stalin's opposition, Churchill and Roosevelt insisted that France be allowed a post-war occupation zone in Germany, and also made sure that it was included among the five nations that invited others to the conference to establish the United Nations.<ref name=Robottom /> This was important because it guaranteed France a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]], a prestigious position that, despite pressure from emerging nations, it still holds today.\n\n===President Truman===\nOn his way back from Yalta, Roosevelt asked de Gaulle to meet him in Algiers for talks. The General refused, believing that there was nothing more to be said, and for this he received a rebuke from [[Georges Bidault]] and from the French press, and a severely angered Roosevelt criticised de Gaulle to Congress. Soon after, on 12 April 1945, Roosevelt died, and despite their uneasy relationship de Gaulle declared a week of mourning in France and forwarded an emotional and conciliatory letter to the new American president, [[Harry S. Truman]], in which he said of Roosevelt, \"all of France loved him\".<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />\n\nDe Gaulle's relationship with Truman was to prove just as difficult as it had been with Roosevelt. With Allied forces advancing deep into Germany, another serious situation developed between American and French forces in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]], when French soldiers were ordered to transfer the occupation zones to US troops. Wishing to retain as much German territory in French hands as possible, de Gaulle ordered his troops, who were using American weapons and ammunition, to resist, and an armed confrontation seemed imminent.<ref name=Werth /> Truman threatened to cut off supplies to the French army and to take the zones by force, leaving de Gaulle with little choice but to back down. De Gaulle never forgave Truman and hinted he would work closely with Stalin, leading Truman to tell his staff, \"I don't like the son of a bitch.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Offner|first=Arnold A.|title=Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945\u20131953|url=https://archive.org/details/anothersuchvicto00offn|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anothersuchvicto00offn/page/50 50]\u201351|isbn=9780804747745}}</ref>\n\nThe first visit by de Gaulle to Truman in the U.S. was not a success. Truman told his visitor that it was time that the French got rid of the Communist influence from its government, to which de Gaulle replied that this was France's own business.<ref name=Schoenbrun /> But Truman, who admitted that his feelings towards the French were becoming 'less and less friendly', went on to say that under the circumstances, the French could not expect much economic aid and refused to accept de Gaulle's request for control of the west bank of the Rhine. During the argument which followed, de Gaulle reminded Truman that the US was using the French port of [[Noum\u00e9a]] in [[New Caledonia]] as a base against the Japanese.<ref name=Schoenbrun />\n\n===Victory in Europe===\n\nIn May 1945 the German armies surrendered to the Americans and British at Rheims, and a separate armistice was signed with France in Berlin.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> De Gaulle refused to allow any British participation in the victory parade in Paris. However, among the vehicles that took part was an ambulance from the [[Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit]], staffed by French doctors and British nurses. One of the nurses was Mary Spears, who had set up the unit and had worked almost continuously since the [[Battle of France]] with Free French forces in the Middle East, North Africa and Italy. Mary's husband was General [[Edward Spears]], the British liaison to the Free French who had personally spirited de Gaulle to safety in Britain in 1940. When de Gaulle saw the [[Union Flag]]s and [[Flag of France|Tricolours]] side by side on the ambulance, and heard French soldiers cheering, \"Voil\u00e0 Spears! Vive Spears!\", he ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British staff sent home. A number of French troops returned their medals in protest and Mary wrote, \"it is a pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small.\"<ref>''The Day the War Ended''. London. Martin Gilbert (1995)</ref>\n\nAnother confrontation with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of [[Val d'Aoste]]. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France. Truman sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France.<ref name=Schoenbrun/>\n\nHowever, de Gaulle was generally well received in the United States immediately after World War II and supported the United States in public comments. He visited New York City on 27 August 1945 to great welcome by thousands of people of the city and its mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]].<ref name=\"wnyc.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/charles-de-gaulle-city-hall-reception/|title=Charles de Gaulle City Hall Reception|publisher=WNYC|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"gettyimages.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/french-general-charles-de-gaulle-flanked-by-new-york-mayor-news-photo/102263730 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140814192955/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/french-general-charles-de-gaulle-flanked-by-new-york-mayor-news-photo/102263730 |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On that day, de Gaulle wished \"Long live the United States of America\". He visited [[New York City Hall]] and Idlewild Airport (now [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]), and presented LaGuardia with the Grand Croix of the [[Legion of Honour]] award.<ref name=\"wnyc.org\"/><ref name=\"gettyimages.com\"/>\n\n===Confrontation in Syria and Lebanon===\n{{further|Levant Crisis}}\nOn [[VE Day]], there were also serious riots in French Tunisia. A dispute with Britain over control of Syria and Lebanon quickly developed into an unpleasant diplomatic incident that demonstrated France's weaknesses. In May, de Gaulle sent General Beynet to establish an air base in Syria and a naval base in Lebanon, provoking an outbreak of nationalism in which some French nationals were attacked and killed. On 20 May, French artillery and warplanes fired on demonstrators in [[Damascus]]. After several days, upwards of 800 Syrians lay dead.<ref>{{cite book|author=Meir Zamir|title=The Secret Anglo-French War in the Middle East: Intelligence and Decolonization, 1940\u20131948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE6cBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA126|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=126\u201334|isbn=9781317657408}}</ref>\n\nChurchill's relationship with de Gaulle was now at rock bottom. In January he told a colleague that he believed that de Gaulle was \"a great danger to peace and for Great Britain. After five years of experience, I am convinced that he is the worst enemy of France in her troubles ... he is one of the greatest dangers to European peace.... I am sure that in the long run no understanding will be reached with General de Gaulle\".<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|287}}\n\nOn 31 May, Churchill told de Gaulle \"immediately to order French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks\". British forces moved in and forced the French to withdraw from the city; they were then escorted and confined to barracks.<ref name=\"Wall\">Wall p. 33</ref> With this political pressure added, the French ordered a ceasefire; De Gaulle raged but France was isolated and suffering a diplomatic humiliation. The secretary of the [[Arab League]] [[Edward Atiyah]] said, \"France put all her cards and two rusty pistols on the table\".<ref>''TIME'' 25 June 1945</ref> De Gaulle saw it as a heinous [[Anglo-Saxon]] conspiracy: he told the British ambassador [[Duff Cooper]], \"I recognise that we are not in a position to wage war against you, but you have betrayed France and betrayed the West. That cannot be forgotten\".<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\" />{{RP|42\u201347}}\n\n===Potsdam Conference===\nAt the [[Potsdam Conference]] in July, to which de Gaulle was not invited, a decision was made to divide Vietnam, which had been a French colony for over a hundred years, into British and Chinese spheres of influence.<ref name=Robottom /> Soon after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, de Gaulle sent the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] to re-establish French sovereignty in [[French Indochina]].  However, the resistance leaders in Indo-China proclaimed the freedom and independence of Vietnam, and [[First Indochina War|a civil war]] broke out that lasted until France was defeated in 1954.<ref>Stein T\u00f8nnesson, ''The Vietnamese revolution of 1945: Roosevelt, Ho Chi Minh, and De Gaulle in a world at war'' (Sage, 1991).</ref>\n\n===New elections and resignation===\nSince the liberation, the only parliament in France had been an enlarged version of the Algiers Consultative Assembly, and at last, in October 1945, elections were held for a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. De Gaulle favoured a strong executive for the nation,{{r|time19590105}} but all three of the main parties wished to severely restrict the powers of the president. The Communists wanted an assembly with full constitutional powers and no time limit, whereas de Gaulle, the Socialists and the [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) advocated one with a term limited to only seven months, after which the draft constitution would be submitted for another referendum.<ref>Hilary Footitt and John Simmonds. ''France, 1943\u20131945'' (1988) pp 228\u201359.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1945 French legislative election|election]], the second option was approved by 13 million of the 21&nbsp;million voters. The big three parties won 75% of the vote, with the Communists winning 158 seats, the MRP 152 seats, the Socialists 142 seats and the remaining seats going to the various far right parties.\n\nOn 13 November 1945, the new assembly unanimously elected Charles de Gaulle head of the government, but problems immediately arose when it came to selecting the cabinet, due to his unwillingness once more to allow the Communists any important ministries. The Communists, now the largest party and with their charismatic leader Maurice Thorez back at the helm, were not prepared to accept this for a second time, and a furious row ensued, during which de Gaulle sent a letter of resignation to the speaker of the Assembly and declared that he was unwilling to trust a party that he considered to be an agent of a foreign power (Russia) with authority over the police and armed forces of France.<ref name=Schoenbrun/>\n\nEventually, the new cabinet was finalised on 21 November, with the Communists receiving five out of the twenty-two ministries, and although they still did not get any of the key portfolios. De Gaulle believed that the draft constitution placed too much power in the hands of parliament with its shifting party alliances. One of his ministers said he was \"a man equally incapable of monopolizing power as of sharing it\".<ref>Ronald Matthews, ''The death of the Fourth Republic'' (1954)p 121.</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle outlined a programme of further nationalisations and a new economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when the Communists demanded a 20 percent reduction in the military budget. Refusing to \"rule by compromise\", de Gaulle once more threatened to resign. There was a general feeling that he was trying to blackmail the assembly into complete subservience by threatening to withdraw his personal prestige which he insisted was what alone kept the ruling coalition together.<ref name=Werth/> Although the MRP managed to broker a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments, it was little more than a stop-gap measure.<ref name=Schoenbrun/>\n\nBarely two months after forming the new government, de Gaulle abruptly resigned on 20 January 1946. The move was called \"a bold and ultimately foolish political ploy\", with de Gaulle hoping that as a war hero, he would be soon brought back as a more powerful executive by the French people.<ref name=\"Hitchcock 2004 112\">{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Europe: The Turbulent History of a Divided Continent 1945 to the Present|first=William I.|last=Hitchcock|publisher=Random House|year=2004|isbn=978-0-385-49799-2|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fFfhnC4mYccC&pg=PT112}}</ref> However, that did not turn out to be the case. With the war finally over, the initial period of crisis had passed. Although there were still shortages, particularly of bread, France was now on the road to recovery, and de Gaulle suddenly did not seem so indispensable. The Communist publication ''Combat'' wrote, \"There was no cataclysm, and the empty plate didn't crack\".<ref name=Werth/>\n\n==1946\u20131958: Out of power==\n[[File:Charles de Gaulle Quotation 2011.jpg|thumb|The statement of Charles de Gaulle in reference to World War II]]\nAfter monopolizing French politics for six years, Charles de Gaulle suddenly dropped out of sight, and returned to his home to write his war memoirs.

During this period of formal retirement, however, de Gaulle maintained regular contact with past political lieutenants from wartime and ''RPF'' days, including sympathizers involved in political developments in French Algeria, becoming \"perhaps the best-informed man in France\".{{r|time19590105}}\n\nIn April 1947, de Gaulle made a renewed attempt to transform the political scene by creating a ''[[Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (Rally of the French People, or ''RPF''), which he hoped would be able to move above the familiar party squabbles of the parliamentary system. Despite the new party's taking 40 percent of the vote in local elections and 121 seats in 1951, lacking its own press and access to television, its support ebbed away. In May 1953, he withdrew again from active politics,{{r|time19590105}} though the ''RPF'' lingered until September 1955.<ref name=\"Grolier\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_degaulle.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223083920/http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_degaulle.html|archivedate=23 February 2005|title=Charles de Gaulle|work=Grolier Online}}</ref>\n\nAs with all colonial powers France began to lose its overseas possessions amid the surge of nationalism.  [[French Indochina]] (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century, had been lost to the Japanese after the defeat of 1940. De Gaulle had intended to hold on to France's Indochina colony, ordering the parachuting of French agents and arms into Indochina in late 1944 and early 1945 with orders to attack the Japanese as American troops hit the beaches.<ref>Karnow pp. 143\u20134</ref> Although de Gaulle had moved quickly to consolidate French control of the territory during his brief first tenure as president in the 1940s, the communist [[Vietminh]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]] began a determined campaign for independence from 1946 onwards. The French fought a bitter seven-year war (the [[First Indochina War]]) to hold on to Indochina. It was largely funded by the United States and grew increasingly unpopular, especially after the stunning defeat at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]]. France pulled out that summer under Prime Minister [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France]].\n\nThe independence of Morocco and Tunisia was arranged by Mend\u00e8s France and proclaimed in March 1956. Meanwhile, in Algeria some 350,000 French troops were fighting 150,000 combatants of the Algerian Liberation Movement (FLN). Within a few years, the Algerian war of independence reached a summit in terms of savagery and bloodshed and threatened to spill into metropolitan France itself.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1958 the Fourth Republic had 24 separate ministries. Frustrated by the endless divisiveness, de Gaulle famously asked \"How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?\"<ref>''Time'', 16 March 1962</ref>\n\n===1958: Collapse of the Fourth Republic===\n{{Further|May 1958 crisis}}\n\nThe [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] was wracked by political instability, failures in [[French Indochina|Indochina]], and inability to resolve the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian question]].<ref>Charles Sowerwine, France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic (2009) ch 20\u201321</ref><ref>Martin S.

It became, for the next ten years, a favourite political rallying cry of de Gaulle's. His vision stood in contrast to the [[Atlanticism]] of the United States and Britain, preferring instead a Europe that would act as a third [[polarity (power)|pole]] between the United States and the Soviet Union. By including in his ideal of Europe all the territory up to the Urals, de Gaulle was implicitly offering [[d\u00e9tente]] to the Soviets.\nAs the last chief of government of the Fourth Republic, de Gaulle made sure that the [[Treaty of Rome]] creating the [[European Economic Community]] was fully implemented, and that the British project of Free Trade Area was rejected, to the extent that he was sometimes considered as a \"Father of Europe\"<ref>Warlouzet, 'De Gaulle as a Father of Europe' in ''Contemporary European History'', 2011 [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/contemporary-european-history/article/de-gaulle-as-a-father-of-europe-the-unpredictability-of-the-ftas-failure-and-the-eecs-success-195658/A2D1FB241EA0C9675E326029F1C8BFC0]</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n{{further|Algerian War}}\n[[File:French Community 1959.svg|thumb|250px|The [[French Community]] in 1959]]\nUpon becoming president, de Gaulle was faced with the urgent task of finding a way to bring to an end the bloody and divisive war in Algeria.<ref>Charles Sowerwine, ''France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic'' (2009) pp 296\u2013316</ref> His intentions were obscure. He had immediately visited Algeria and declared, ''Je vous ai compris''\u2014'I have understood you', and each competing interest had wished to believe it was them that he had understood. The settlers assumed he supported them, and would be stunned when he did not. In Paris, the left wanted independence for Algeria. Although the military's near-coup had contributed to his return to power, de Gaulle soon ordered all officers to quit the rebellious Committees of Public Safety. Such actions greatly angered the pieds-noirs and their military supporters.<ref>Alexander Harrison, ''Challenging De Gaulle: The OAS and the Counterrevolution in Algeria, 1954\u20131962'' (Praeger, 1989).</ref>\n\nHe faced uprisings in Algeria by the pied-noirs and the French armed forces. On assuming the prime minister role in June 1958 he immediately went to Algeria, and neutralised the army there, with its 600,000 soldiers. The Algiers Committee of Public Safety was loud in its demands on behalf of the settlers, but de Gaulle made more visits and sidestepped them. For the long term he devised a plan to modernize Algeria's traditional economy, deescalated the war, and offered Algeria self-determination in 1959. A [[Algerian War#The week of barricades|pied-noir revolt in 1960]] failed, while another [[Algiers putsch of 1961|attempted coup]] failed in April 1961. French voters approved his course in [[French referendum on Algerian self-determination, 1961|a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination]]. De Gaulle arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 [[Evian Accords]], legitimated by another [[1962 French \u00c9vian Accords referendum|referendum]] a month later. It gave victory to the FLN, which came to power and declared independence.

France recognised Algerian independence on 3 July 1962, while a blanket amnesty law was belatedly voted in 1968, covering all crimes committed by the French army during the war. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'' left the country. After 5 July, the exodus accelerated in the wake of the French deaths during the [[Oran massacre of 1962]].\n\n===Assassination attempts===\n[[File:General charles de gaulle visite isles sur suippe 1963.jpg|thumb|Charles de Gaulle's motorcade passes through [[Isles-sur-Suippe]] ([[Marne (department)|Marne]]), the president salutes the crowd from his famous [[Citro\u00ebn DS]]]]\n\nDe Gaulle was targeted for death by the [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS), in retaliation for his Algerian initiatives.

This laid the foundations of a meticulously planned program of investments in energy, transport and heavy industry, overseen by the government of Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]].\n\nIn the context of a population boom unseen in France since the 18th century, the government intervened heavily in the economy, using ''[[dirigisme]]''\u2014a unique combination of free-market and state-directed economy\u2014with indicative five-year plans as its main tool. This was followed by a rapid transformation and expansion of the French economy.\n\nHigh-profile projects, mostly but not always financially successful, were launched: the extension of [[Marseille]]'s harbour (soon ranking third in Europe and first in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]); the promotion of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] passenger jetliner (a predecessor of [[Airbus]]); the decision to start building the supersonic Franco-British [[Concorde]] airliner in [[Toulouse]]; the expansion of the French auto industry with state-owned [[Renault]] at its centre; and the building of the first motorways between Paris and the provinces.\n\nAided by these projects, the French economy recorded growth rates unrivalled since the 19th century.

France had carried out important work in the early development of atomic energy and in October 1945 he established the French Atomic Energy Commission [[Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique]], (CEA) responsible for all scientific, commercial, and military uses of nuclear energy. However, partly due to communist influences in government opposed to proliferation, research stalled and France was excluded from American, British and Canadian nuclear efforts.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBy October 1952, the United Kingdom had become the third country\u2014after the United States and the Soviet Union\u2014to independently test and develop nuclear weapons. This gave Britain the capability to launch a nuclear strike via its [[Vulcan bomber]] force and they began developing a ballistic missile program known as [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/uk/blue-streak.htm|title=Blue Streak \u2013 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile|publisher=Global Security.org|access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs early as April 1954 while out of power, de Gaulle argued that France must have its own nuclear arsenal; at the time nuclear weapons were seen as a national status symbol and a way of maintaining international prestige with a place at the 'top table' of the United Nations. Full-scale research began again in late 1954 when Prime Minister [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France]] authorized a plan to develop the atomic bomb; large deposits of [[uranium]] had been discovered near [[Limoges]] in central France, providing the researchers with an unrestricted supply of nuclear fuel. France's independent [[Force de Frappe]] (strike force) came into being soon after de Gaulle's election with his authorization for the first nuclear test.\n\nWith the cancellation of Blue Streak, the US agreed to supply Britain with its [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] and later [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] weapons systems, and in 1958 the two nations signed the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement|Mutual Defence Agreement]] forging close links which have seen the US and UK cooperate on nuclear security matters ever since. Although at the time it was still a full member of NATO, France proceeded to develop its own independent nuclear technologies\u2014this would enable it to become a partner in any reprisals and would give it a voice in matters of atomic control.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marshal Juin Defended \u2013 General de Gaulle on Moral Issue|newspaper=The Times|date=8 April 1954}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FS Redoutable.jpg|thumb|The ''[[FS Redoutable|Redoutable]]'', the first French nuclear missile submarine.]]\n\nAfter six years of effort, on 13 February 1960 France became the [[France and nuclear weapons|world's fourth nuclear power]] when a high-powered [[Gerboise Bleue|nuclear device]] was exploded in the [[Sahara]] some 700 miles south-south-west of Algiers.<ref name=\"Weekend of Rejoicing in France\">{{cite news|title=Weekend of Rejoicing in France|newspaper=The Times|date=15 February 1960}}</ref> In August 1963 France decided against signing the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] designed to slow the arms race because it would have prohibited it from testing nuclear weapons above ground. France continued to carry out tests at the Algerian site until 1966, under an agreement with the newly independent Algeria. France's testing program then moved to the [[Mururoa]] and [[Fangataufa]] Atolls in the South Pacific.\n\nIn November 1967, an article by the French Chief of the General Staff (but inspired by de Gaulle) in the ''Revue de la D\u00e9fense Nationale'' caused international consternation. It was stated that the French nuclear force should be capable of firing \"in all directions\"\u2014thus including even America as a potential target. This surprising statement was intended as a declaration of French national independence, and was in retaliation to a warning issued long ago by [[Dean Rusk]] that US missiles would be aimed at France if it attempted to employ atomic weapons outside an agreed plan. However, criticism of de Gaulle was growing over his tendency to act alone with little regard for the views of others.<ref>Ledwidge p. 341</ref> In August, concern over de Gaulle's policies had been voiced by [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] when he queried 'the solitary exercise of power'.<ref>{{cite news|title=Independents Fear for France's Future \u2013 Gaullist Policy Queried|newspaper=The Times|date=18 August 1967}}</ref>\n\n===NATO===\n[[File:Lyndon B.

France played a key role during the early days of the organisation, providing a large military contingent and agreeing\u2014after much soul-searching\u2014to the participation of West German forces. But after his election in 1958 Charles de Gaulle took the view that the organisation was too dominated by the US and UK, and that America would not fulfill its promise to defend Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion.\n\nDe Gaulle demanded political parity with Britain and America in NATO, and for its geographic coverage to be extended to include French territories abroad, including Algeria, then experiencing civil war. This was not forthcoming, and so in March 1959 France, citing the need for it to maintain its own independent military strategy, withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet (ALESCMED) from NATO, and a few months later de Gaulle demanded the removal of all US nuclear weapons from French territory.\n\n[[File:Charles de Gaulle-1963.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle during his presidency]]\n\nDe Gaulle hosted a superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms limitation talks and d\u00e9tente efforts in the wake of the [[1960 U-2 incident]] between United States President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and United Kingdom Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].<ref name=bbc1/> De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: \"Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan.\" When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, \"De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm.

De Gaulle always viewed Communism as a passing phenomenon, and never used the term 'Soviet Union', always calling it Russia. In his view, Russian national interests rather than Communist ideology determined the decision-making in the Kremlin. Later, he proclaimed a new alliance between the nations, but although Soviet premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] later visited Paris, the Soviets clearly did not consider France a superpower and knew that they would remain dependent on the NATO alliance in the event of a war. In 1965, de Gaulle pulled France out of [[SEATO]], the southeast Asian equivalent of NATO, and refused to participate in any future NATO maneuvers.\n\nIn February 1966, France withdrew from the [[NATO Military Command Structure]], but remained within the organisation. De Gaulle, haunted by the memories of 1940, wanted France to remain the master of the decisions affecting it, unlike in the 1930s when it had to follow in step with its British ally. He also ordered all foreign military personnel to leave France within a year.<ref name=\"Crawley-1969\" />{{RP|431}} This latter action was particularly badly received in the US, prompting [[Dean Rusk]], the US Secretary of State, to ask de Gaulle whether the removal of American military personnel was to include exhumation of the 50,000 American war dead buried in French cemeteries.<ref name=\"FontanaHistory\">Holland, Robert (1991) ''Fontana History of England \u2013 Britain & the World Role''</ref>\n\n===European Economic Community (EEC)===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}\n\nFrance, experiencing the disintegration of its [[French colonial Empire|colonial empire]] and severe problems in Algeria, turned towards Europe after [[Suez Crisis]], and to West Germany in particular.<ref name=\"FontanaHistory\" /> In the years after, the economies of both nations integrated and they led the drive towards European unity.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nOne of the conditions of Marshall Aid was that the nations' leaders must co-ordinate economic efforts and pool the supply of raw materials.

This monopoly meant that the government was in a position to directly influence broadcast news. In many respects, Gaullist France was conservative, Catholic, and there were few women in high-level political posts (in May 1968, the government's ministers were 100% male).<ref>{{cite web|title=Les femmes et le pouvoir|url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&rub=dossier&item=7|quote=of the first eleven governments of the Fifth Republic, four contained no women whatsoever.|date=2007-05-29}}</ref> Many factors contributed to a general weariness of sections of the public, particularly the student youth, which led to the events of May 1968.\n\nThe mass demonstrations and strikes in France in May 1968 severely challenged De Gaulle's legitimacy. He and other government leaders feared that the country was on the brink of revolution or civil war. On 29 May, De Gaulle disappeared without notifying Prime Minister Pompidou or anyone else in the government, stunning the country. He fled to [[Baden-Baden]] in Germany to meet with General Massu, then head of the French military there, to discuss possible army intervention against the protesters. De Gaulle returned to France after being assured of the military's support, in return for which De Gaulle agreed to amnesty for the 1961 coup plotters and OAS members.<ref name=\"dogan1984\">{{cite journal|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|title=How Civil War Was Avoided in France|journal=International Political Science Review |year=1984|volume=5|issue=3|pages=245\u2013277|jstor=1600894|doi=10.1177/019251218400500304}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Autocrat of the Grand Manner|newspaper=The Times|date=28 April 1969}}</ref>\n\nIn a private meeting discussing the students' and workers' demands for direct participation in business and government he coined the phrase \"La r\u00e9forme oui, la [[chienlit]] non\", which can be politely translated as 'reform yes, masquerade/chaos no.'

The term is now common parlance in French political commentary, used both critically and ironically referring back to de Gaulle.<ref>Crawley (p. 454) also writes that de Gaulle was undoubtedly using the term in his barrack-room style to mean 'shit in the bed'. De Gaulle had said it first in Bucharest while on an official visit from which he returned on 19 May 1968. Pompidou told the press that de Gaulle used the phrase after the cabinet meeting on 19 May.</ref>\n\nBut de Gaulle offered to accept some of the reforms the demonstrators sought. He again considered a referendum to support his moves, but on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded him to dissolve parliament (in which the government had all but lost its majority in the March 1967 elections) and hold new elections instead. The June 1968 elections were a major success for the Gaullists and their allies; when shown the spectre of revolution or civil war, the majority of the country rallied to him.

The first Algerian president, [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], said that de Gaulle was the \"military leader who brought us the hardest blows\" prior to Algerian independence, but \"saw further\" than other politicians, and had a \"universal dimension that is too often lacking in current leaders.\"<ref>Ahmed Ben Bella, ''De Gaulle voyait plus loin'', in ''L'Express'', 26 October 1995.</ref> Likewise, [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]], the first president of Senegal, said that few Western leaders could boast of having risked their lives to grant a colony independence.\n\nIn 1990 President Mitterrand, de Gaulle's old political rival, presided over the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. Mitterrand, who once wrote a vitriolic critique of him called the \"Permanent Coup d'\u00c9tat\", quoted a then recent opinion poll, saying, \"As General de Gaulle, he has entered the pantheon of great national heroes, where he ranks ahead of [[Napoleon]] and behind only [[Charlemagne]].\"<ref name=\"DeGaulle\">Mahoney, Daniel (2000) ''De Gaulle: Statesmanship, Grandeur and Modern Democracy'', Transaction Publishers, {{ISBN|1412821274}}</ref> Under the influence of [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]], the leader of CERES, the left-wing and [[Souverainism|souverainist]] faction of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], Mitterrand had, except on certain economic and social policies, rallied to much of Gaullism. Between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s there developed a left-right consensus, dubbed \"Gaullo-Mitterrandism\", behind the \"French status\" in NATO: i.e. outside the integrated military command.\n\n===Relationships with other political leaders===\nAlthough he initially enjoyed good relations with US President [[John F.

After a meeting at the [[Palace of Versailles]] just before the general left office, Nixon declared that \"He did not try to put on airs but an aura of majesty seemed to envelop him ... his performance\u2014and I do not use that word disparagingly\u2014was breathtaking.\"<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\"/> On arriving for his funeral several months later, Nixon said of him, \"greatness knows no national boundaries\".<ref>''Time'', 23 November 1970</ref>\n\nLt. General [[Vernon A. Walters]], a military attach\u00e9 of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and later military attach\u00e9 in France from 1967 to 1973, noted the strong relationship between de Gaulle and Eisenhower, de Gaulle's unconditional support of Eisenhower during the U-2 incident, and de Gaulle's strong support of [[John F. Kennedy]] during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Thus Walters was intensely curious as to the great contrast between de Gaulle's close relations with two United States presidents during notable [[Cold War]] crises and de Gaulle's later decision to withdraw France from NATO's military command, and Walters spoke with many close military and political aides of de Gaulle.<ref name=j1/>\n\nWalters' conclusion, based upon de Gaulle's comments to many of his aides (and to Eisenhower during a meeting at Ramboullet Castle in 1959), is that de Gaulle feared that later United States presidents after Eisenhower would not have Eisenhower's special ties to Europe and would not risk nuclear war over Europe.<ref name=j1/> Also, de Gaulle interpreted the peaceful resolution of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] without fighting to take back Cuba from communism a mere 90 miles from the United States as an indication that the United States might not fight for Europe's defense 3,500 miles away following Soviet aggression in Europe, but would only go to war following a nuclear strike against the United States itself.<ref name=j1/> De Gaulle told Eisenhower that France did not seek to compete with the Strategic Air Command or army of the United States, but believed that France needed a way to strike the Soviet Union.<ref name=j1/>\n\nA number of commentators have been critical of de Gaulle for his failure to prevent the massacres after Algerian independence<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> while others take the view that the struggle had been so long and savage that it was perhaps inevitable.<ref name=\"Fenby-2010\"/> The Australian historian [[Brian Crozier]] wrote, \"that he was able to part with Algeria without civil war was a great though negative achievement which in all probability would have been beyond the capacity of any other leader France possessed.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''De Gaulle: The Statesman''. Brian Crozier (Methuen). 1974</ref> In April 1961, when four rebel generals seized power in Algeria, he \"did not flinch in the face of this daunting challenge\", but appeared on television in his general's uniform to forbid Frenchmen to obey the rebels' orders in an \"inflexible display of personal authority\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nDe Gaulle was an excellent manipulator of the media, as seen in his shrewd use of television to persuade around 80% of [[Metropolitan France]] to approve the new constitution for the Fifth Republic. In so doing, he refused to yield to the reasoning of his opponents who said that, if he succeeded in Algeria, he would no longer be necessary. He afterwards enjoyed massive approval ratings, and once said that \"every Frenchman is, has been or will be Gaullist\".<ref name=\"Debray\"/>\n\nThat de Gaulle did not necessarily reflect mainstream French public opinion with his veto was suggested by the decisive majority of French people who voted in favour of British membership when the much more conciliatory Pompidou called a referendum on the matter in 1972. His early influence in setting the parameters of the EEC can still be seen today, most notably with the controversial Common Agricultural Policy.\n\nSome writers take the view that Pompidou was a more progressive and influential leader than de Gaulle because, though also a Gaullist, he was less autocratic and more interested in social reforms.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref>Richards, Denis and Quick, Anthony (1974) ''20th Century Britain''</ref> Although he followed the main tenets of de Gaulle's foreign policy, he was keen to work towards warmer relations with the United States. A banker by profession, Pompidou is also widely credited, as de Gaulle's prime minister from 1962 to 1968, with putting in place the reforms which provided the impetus for the economic growth which followed.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1968, shortly before leaving office, de Gaulle refused to devalue the Franc on grounds of national prestige, but upon taking over Pompidou reversed the decision almost straight away. It was ironic, that during the financial crisis of 1968, France had to rely on American (and West German) financial aid to help shore up the economy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nPerry has written that the \"events of 1968 illustrated the brittleness of de Gaulle's rule. That he was taken by surprise is an indictment of his rule; he was too remote from real life and had no interest in the conditions under which ordinary French people lived. Problems like inadequate housing and social services had been ignored. The French greeted the news of his departure with some relief as the feeling had grown that he had outlived his usefulness. Perhaps he clung onto power too long, perhaps he should have retired in 1965 when he was still popular.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n[[Brian Crozier]] said \"the fame of de Gaulle outstrips his achievements, he chose to make repeated gestures of petulance and defiance that weakened the west without compensating advantages to France\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[R\u00e9gis Debray]] called de Gaulle \"super-lucide\"<ref name=\"Debray\"/> and pointed out that virtually all of his predictions, such as the fall of communism, the reunification of Germany and the resurrection of 'old' Russia, came true after his death.<ref>In fact, several of de Gaulle's predictions, such as his often-repeated belief during the early cold war period that a Third World War, with its \"nuclear bombardments, famine, deportations\" was not only ineluctable, but imminent, have not yet materialized. Jean Lacouture, ''De Gaulle'', Seuil, vol. II, p. 357.</ref> Debray compared him with [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] ('the great political myth of the 19th century'), calling de Gaulle his 20th century equivalent. \"The sublime, it seems, appears in France only once a century ... Napoleon left two generations dead on battlefield. De Gaulle was more sparing with other people's blood; even so, he left us, as it were, stranded, alive but dazed... A delusion, perhaps, but one that turns the world upside down: causes events and movements; divides people into supporters and adversaries; leaves traces in the form of civil and penal codes and railways, factories and institutions (the Fifth Republic has already lasted three times as long as the Empire). A statesman who gets something going, who has followers, escapes the reality of the reports and statistics and become part of imagination. Napoleon and de Gaulle modified the state of things because they modified souls\".<ref name=\"Debray\"/>\n\nHowever, Debray pointed out that there is a difference between Napoleon and de Gaulle: \"How can the exterminator be compared with the liberator? ... The former ran the whole enterprise into the ground, while the latter managed to save it. So that to measure the rebel against the despot, the challenger against the leader, is just glaringly idiotic. You simply do not put an adventurer who worked for himself or his family on the same level as a commander-in-chief serving his country. ... Regrettably, Gaullism and Bonapartism have a number of features in common, but Napoleon and de Gaulle do not have the same moral value. ... the first wanted a Holy French Empire without the faith, a Europe under French occupation. The second wanted to rescue the nation from the emperors and establish a free France in a free Europe\".<ref name=\"Debray\"/>\n\nWhile de Gaulle had many admirers, he was at the same time one of the most hated and reviled men in modern French history.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3679392|title = General de Gaulle and His Enemies: Anti-Gaullism in France Since 1940|journal = Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|volume = 9|pages = 43\u201365|last1 = Jackson|first1 = Julian|year = 1999|doi = 10.2307/3679392}}</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n===French===\n* [[File:Legion Honneur GC ribbon.svg|80px]] Grand-Croix of the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] \u2013 1945 (Officer \u2013 1934; Knight \u2013 1919)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH280/PG/FRDAFAN83_OC18V002.htm|title=Minist\u00e8re de la culture \u2013 Base L\u00e9onore|work=culture.gouv.fr|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref>\n* [[File:Ruban de l'Ordre de la Lib\u00e9ration (2).PNG|80px]] Grand Master of the [[Ordre de la Lib\u00e9ration]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeyjBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA200|title=Parisis Code \u2013 tome 2 \u2013 Le Code secret des rues de Paris|work=google.be|accessdate=14 January 2016|isbn=9791091289030|last1=Leur|first1=Thierry Van de}}</ref>\n* [[File:Ordre national du Merite GC ribbon.svg|80px]] Grand-Croix of the [[Ordre national du M\u00e9rite]] \u2013 1963<ref>[http://www.legiondhonneur.fr/sites/default/files/presse_dl/50_ans_ordre_national_du_mcrite.pdf]</ref>\n* [[File:Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 ribbon.svg|80px]] [[Croix de guerre 1914-1918 (France)|Croix de guerre 1915]]<ref name=\"charles-de-gaulle.org\"/>\n* [[File:Croix de Guerre 1939-1945 ribbon.svg|80px]] [[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)|Croix de guerre (1939\u20131945)]]{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Foreign===\n* [[File:Virtuti Militari Ribbon.png|80px]] Silver Cross of [[Virtuti Militari]] of Poland (1920)<ref name=RPPL>{{cite web|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/216865.html|title=Virtuti Militari de Gaulle'a|work=Rzeczpospolita|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref>\n* [[File:US Legion of Merit Chief Commander ribbon.png|80px]] Chief Commander of the US [[Legion of Merit]] (24 August 1945)\n* [[File:Ord of the Dragon of Annam kngt ribbon bar.png|80px]] Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Dragon of Annam]] (last awarded 1945)\n* [[File:Cordone di gran Croce di Gran Cordone OMRI BAR.svg|80px]] Knight Grand Cross decorated with Grand Cordon of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]] (16 June 1959)\n* [[File:Order of the Royal House of Chakri (Thailand) ribbon.svg|80px]] Knight of the [[Order of the Royal House of Chakri]] of Thailand (11 October 1960)\n* [[File:Order of the Seraphim -

The [[Whanganui River]], New Zealand's longest navigable waterway, runs from [[Mount Tongariro]] to the sea. Whanganui is part of the [[Manawat\u016b-Whanganui]] region.\n\nWhanganui is the ancestral home of Te \u0100ti Haunui-a-P\u0101p\u0101rangi and other [[Whanganui M\u0101ori]] tribes. The [[New Zealand Company]] began to settle the area in 1840, establishing its second settlement after [[Wellington]]. In the early years most European settlers came via Wellington. Whanganui greatly expanded in the 1870s, and freezing works, woollen mills, phosphate works and wool stores were established in the town. Today, much of Whanganui's economy relates directly to the fertile and prosperous farming [[hinterland]].\n\nLike several New Zealand urban areas, it was officially designated a [[list of cities in New Zealand|city]] until an administrative reorganisation in 1989, and is now run by a District Council. Although the city was called ''Wanganui'' from 1854, in February 2009, the [[New Zealand Geographic Board]] recommended the spelling be changed to \"Whanganui\". In December 2009, the government decided that while either spelling was acceptable, [[Public sector organisations in New Zealand|Crown agencies]] would use the ''Whanganui'' spelling.<ref name=\"FinalDecision\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10616306 |title=Whanganui or Wanganui \u2013 it's up to you |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 November 2015, [[Land Information New Zealand]] (LINZ) announced that Wanganui District would be renamed to Whanganui District.<ref name=\":0\" /> This changed the official name of the District Council, and, because Whanganui is not a city but a district, the official name of the urban area as well.\n\n== Geography ==\nWhanganui is on the [[South Taranaki Bight]], close to the mouth of the [[Whanganui River]]. It is {{convert|200|km}} north of [[Wellington]] and {{convert|75|km}} northwest of [[Palmerston North]], at the junction of [[New Zealand state highway network|State Highways]] 3 and 4. Most of the city lies on the river's northwestern bank, because of the greater extent of flat land. The river is crossed by four bridges: Cobham Bridge, City Bridge, Dublin Street Bridge and Aramoho Railway Bridge (rail and pedestrians only).\n\nBoth [[Mount Ruapehu]] and [[Mount Taranaki]] can be seen from Durie Hill and other vantage points around the city.\n\n=== Suburbs and localities ===\nThe suburbs within Whanganui include (clockwise from central Watt Fountain):\n\n* Northeast: Wanganui East, Bastia Hill, Aramoho<ref name=\"profile.id 2017\">{{cite web |title=About the profile areas \u2013 Lower Aramoho |website=profile.id |date=11 April 2017 |url=https://profile.idnz.co.nz/whanganui/about?WebID=200 |access-date=1 June 2019}}</ref>\n* East: Durie Hill\n* South: P\u016btiki<ref name=\"TKM 2019\">{{cite web |title=Iwi \u2013 Whanganui Iwi / Te Atihaunui a P\u0101p\u0101rangi \u2013 Te Kahui Mangai |website=TKM |date=14 February 2019 |url=http://www.tkm.govt.nz/iwi/te-atihaunui-a-paparangi/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214174245/http://www.tkm.govt.nz/iwi/te-atihaunui-a-paparangi/ |archive-date=14 February 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=1 June 2019}}</ref>\n* West: Gonville, Castlecliff, Tawhero\n* Northwest: Springvale, St. Johns Hill, [[Otamatea]]\n\n== History ==\nThe area around the mouth of the Whanganui river was a major site of pre-European [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] settlement.

The early years of the new city were problematic. Purchase of land from the local tribes had been haphazard and irregular, and as such many M\u0101ori were angered with the influx of [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] onto land that they still claimed. It was not until the town had been established for eight years that agreements were finally reached between the colonials and local tribes, and some resentment continued (and still filters through to the present day).\n[[File:Watt Fountain, Wanganui city centre.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Watt Fountain in Victoria Avenue. The former Post Office building is in the background.]]\n\nWanganui grew rapidly after this time, with land being cleared for pasture. The town was a major military centre during the [[New Zealand Wars]] of the 1860s, although local M\u0101ori at P\u016btiki led by [[Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui]] remained friendly to settlers. In 1871 a town bridge was built, followed six years later by a railway bridge at Aramoho.<ref name=\"WisesWanganui\" /> Wanganui was linked by rail to both [[New Plymouth]] and [[Wellington]] by 1886. The town was incorporated as a [[Borough]] on 1 February 1872, and declared a city on 1 July 1924.<ref name=\"WisesWanganui\" />\n\nPerhaps Wanganui's biggest scandal happened in 1920, when Mayor [[Charles Mackay (mayor)|Charles Mackay]] shot and wounded a young poet, [[Walter D'Arcy Cresswell]], who had been blackmailing him over his homosexuality. Mackay served seven years in prison and his name was erased from the town's civic monuments, while Cresswell (himself homosexual) was praised as a \"wholesome-minded young man\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gaynz.net.nz/history/Mackay-cress.html |title=Charles Mackay and D'Arcy Cresswell |accessdate=10 October 2007}}</ref> Mackay's name was restored to the foundation stone of the [[Sarjeant Gallery]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/timeline&new_date=15/05 |title=Wanganui mayor shoots poet |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Whanganui River]] catchment is seen as a sacred area to M\u0101ori, and the Whanganui region is still seen as a focal point for any resentment over land ownership. In 1995, [[Moutoa Gardens]] in Wanganui, known to local M\u0101ori as ''Pakaitore'', were occupied for 79 days in a mainly peaceful protest by the Whanganui iwi over land claims.\n\nWanganui was the site of the [[New Zealand Police]] [[National Law Enforcement System|Law Enforcement System]] (LES) from 1976 to 1995. An early [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] [[mainframe computer]]-based intelligence and data management system, it was known colloquially as the \"Wanganui Computer\". The data centre housing it was subject to New Zealand's highest-profile [[suicide bombing]] in 1982 when anarchist [[Neil Roberts (anarchist)|Neil Roberts]] detonated a [[gelignite]] bomb in the entry foyer. Roberts was the only casualty of the bombing.\n\n== Names ==\n''Wh\u0101ng\u0101 nui'' is a [[M\u0101ori language]] phrase meaning \"big bay\" or \"big harbour\". Europeans called it ''Petre'' (pronounced Peter), after Lord Petre, an officer of the [[New Zealand Company]], but that name did not persist.\n\n=== Spelling of Wanganui/Whanganui ===\n\nIn the local dialect, [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] pronounce the phoneme ''wh'' as {{IPA|[\u02c0w]}}, a ''w'' combined with a glottal stop,{{Dubious|date=March 2012}} and the name as something like \"'Wanganui\", hard to reproduce by non-locals. Until recently it was generally written as \"Wanganui\" and pronounced with a ''w'' by non-speakers of [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] and a ''wh'' ({{IPA|[f]}} or {{IPA|[\u0278]}}) by those M\u0101ori speakers from other areas who knew its derivation.\n\nFollowing an article about the river by David Young in the [[New Zealand Geographic]] magazine that used \"Whanganui\" throughout, in accord with the wishes of the local [[iwi]], the spelling of the river's name reverted to Whanganui in 1991.

A large proportion of this is within the [[Whanganui National Park]], established in 1986.\n\nThe region is known for its outstanding natural environment with the Whanganui Awa (River) at its heart. It is the second-largest river in the North Island, the longest navigable waterway in the country, and runs for {{convert|290|km}} from the heights of Mount Tongariro to Wanganui's coast and the Tasman Sea. Every bend and rapid of the river (there are 239 listed rapids) has a guardian, or kaitiaki, who maintains the mauri (life force) of that stretch of the river.\n\nWhanganui hap\u016b (sub-tribes) were renowned for their canoeing skills and maintained extensive networks of weirs and fishing traps along the River. Generations of river iwi have learned to use and protect this great taonga (treasure), and on 13 September 2012 the Whanganui River became the first river in the world to gain recognition as a legal identity.\n\nToday the river and its surrounds are used for a number of recreational activities including kayaking, jet boating, tramping, cycling and camping. A national cycleway has recently opened, which takes cyclists from the 'mountains to the sea'.\n\nIn the local government reorganisation of the 1980s, Wanganui District Council resulted from the amalgamation in 1989 of Wanganui County Council, most of Waitotara County Council, a small part of Stratford County Council, and Wanganui City Council.

The two daily papers joined in the 1970s, and in 1986 the ''Herald'' became a free weekly, later renamed the ''Wanganui Midweek''.<ref name=\"paperspast\" /> The ''River City Press'' is the other free weekly paper.\n\nIn 1996, Whanganui briefly rose to international infamy when a man who claimed to be carrying a bomb held the local radio station hostage and demanded that the station broadcast the Muppet song \"The Rainbow Connection\" for 12 hours.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.apnews.com/f408e5868a217a29c051221486d2be61 |title=Man Takes Hostage, Wants Muppet Song Played For 12 Hours |publisher=Associated Press |date=22 March 1996 |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Sports ==\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"right\"\n|- ----\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" width=\"141px\" style=\"height:120px; font-size:100%; border:2px double grey;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:12px\" align=\"bottom\"| Sport team's colours<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/nz-@.html |title=Sport regions (New Zealand) |publisher=Crwflags.com |accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background:Blue; color:Blue\" width=\"100%\" | Blue\n|-\n| style=\"background:White; color:White\" width=\"100%\" height=\"10px\" |\n|-\n| style=\"background:Black; color:Black\" width=\"100%\" | Black\n|-\n| style=\"background:White; color:White\" width=\"100%\" height=\"10px\"|\n|-\n| style=\"background:Blue; color:Blue\" width=\"100%\" | Blue\n|- height=\"20px\"\n| colspan=2 style=\"background:Black\" | Shorts/Skirt\n|}\n|}\n\n=== Rugby ===\nThe [[Wanganui Rugby Football Union]] is one of the oldest [[rugby football|rugby]] unions in New Zealand. \n\nWanganui has never held the country's top trophy, the [[Ranfurly Shield]]\n\nOn 10 August 1966 a combined Wanganui and King Country team beat the [[British and Irish Lions]] 12 points to 6 at Spriggens Park.\n\nIn 2008 the Wanganui representative rugby team, under the captaincy of David Gower, won the NZRFU's Heartland Championship (Meads Cup) by defeating Mid Canterbury 27\u201312 in the final. They had previously been the defeated finalist in 2006 and 2007. The 2008 side had an undefeated season \u2013 the first since 1947. The rugby squad, including coach and management, was accorded the honour of 'Freedom of the City' by the Whanganui District Council \u2013 the first time the award had been given to any sporting team.\n\nThe 2009 representative team repeated this feat by regaining the Meads Cup \u2013 again defeating Mid Canterbury in the final by 34 points to 13 (after trailing nil-13 at halftime). Unlike 2008, the 2009 did lose games (to Wellington, Wairarapa Bush and Mid Canterbury) but came good at the business end of the season. Ten Whanganui players were selected for the Heartland XV.\n\nThe Wanganui rugby jersey, due to its resemblance, is known as the butcher's apron.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.wanganui.govt.nz/news/commslink/issue324.asp |title=Unifying the image |publisher=Wanganui District Council |journal=Community Link |issue=324 |date=16 August 2007 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Whanganui environs have produced many [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] including:\n\n* [[Moke Belliss]] (1920-23). \n* [[John Blair (rugby union) |John Blair]] (1897).\n* [[George Bullock-Douglas]] (1932-34).\n* [[Andrew Donald]] (1981-84).\n* [[Keith Gudsell]] (1949).

On 27 January 1962, a world record time of 3 minutes 54.4 seconds for running the [[Middle distance track event#Mile|mile]] was set by [[Peter Snell]] on the grass track at the gardens.

Zealand. The [[Whanganui River]], New Zealand's longest navigable waterway, runs from [[Mount Tongariro]] to the sea. Whanganui is part of the [[Manawat\u016b-Whanganui]] region.\n\nWhanganui is the ancestral home of Te \u0100ti Haunui-a-P\u0101p\u0101rangi and other [[Whanganui M\u0101ori]] tribes. The [[New Zealand Company]] began to settle the area in 1840, establishing its second settlement after [[Wellington]]. In the early years most European settlers came via Wellington. Whanganui greatly expanded in the 1870s, and freezing works, woollen mills, phosphate works and wool stores were established in the town. Today, much of Whanganui's economy relates directly to the fertile and prosperous farming [[hinterland]].\n\nLike several New Zealand urban areas, it was officially designated a [[list of cities in New Zealand|city]] until an administrative reorganisation in 1989, and is now run by a District Council. Although the city was called ''Wanganui'' from 1854, in February 2009, the [[New Zealand Geographic Board]] recommended the spelling be changed to \"Whanganui\". In December 2009, the government decided that while either spelling was acceptable, [[Public sector organisations in New Zealand|Crown agencies]] would use the ''Whanganui'' spelling.<ref name=\"FinalDecision\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10616306 |title=Whanganui or Wanganui \u2013 it's up to you |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 November 2015, [[Land Information New Zealand]] (LINZ) announced that Wanganui District would be renamed to Whanganui District.<ref name=\":0\" /> This changed the official name of the District Council, and, because Whanganui is not a city but a district, the official name of the urban area as well.\n\n== Geography ==\nWhanganui is on the [[South Taranaki Bight]], close to the mouth of the [[Whanganui River]]. It is {{convert|200|km}} north of [[Wellington]] and {{convert|75|km}} northwest of [[Palmerston North]], at the junction of [[New Zealand state highway network|State Highways]] 3 and 4. Most of the city lies on the river's northwestern bank, because of the greater extent of flat land. The river is crossed by four bridges: Cobham Bridge, City Bridge, Dublin Street Bridge and Aramoho Railway Bridge (rail and pedestrians only).\n\nBoth [[Mount Ruapehu]] and [[Mount Taranaki]] can be seen from Durie Hill and other vantage points around the city.\n\n=== Suburbs and localities ===\nThe suburbs within Whanganui include (clockwise from central Watt Fountain):\n\n* Northeast: Wanganui East, Bastia Hill, Aramoho<ref name=\"profile.id 2017\">{{cite web |title=About the profile areas \u2013 Lower Aramoho |website=profile.id |date=11 April 2017 |url=https://profile.idnz.co.nz/whanganui/about?WebID=200 |access-date=1 June 2019}}</ref>\n* East: Durie Hill\n* South: P\u016btiki<ref name=\"TKM 2019\">{{cite web |title=Iwi \u2013 Whanganui Iwi / Te Atihaunui a P\u0101p\u0101rangi \u2013 Te Kahui Mangai |website=TKM |date=14 February 2019 |url=http://www.tkm.govt.nz/iwi/te-atihaunui-a-paparangi/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214174245/http://www.tkm.govt.nz/iwi/te-atihaunui-a-paparangi/ |archive-date=14 February 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=1 June 2019}}</ref>\n* West: Gonville, Castlecliff, Tawhero\n* Northwest: Springvale, St. Johns Hill, [[Otamatea]]\n\n== History ==\nThe area around the mouth of the Whanganui river was a major site of pre-European [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] settlement.

The early years of the new city were problematic. Purchase of land from the local tribes had been haphazard and irregular, and as such many M\u0101ori were angered with the influx of [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] onto land that they still claimed. It was not until the town had been established for eight years that agreements were finally reached between the colonials and local tribes, and some resentment continued (and still filters through to the present day).\n[[File:Watt Fountain, Wanganui city centre.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Watt Fountain in Victoria Avenue. The former Post Office building is in the background.]]\n\nWanganui grew rapidly after this time, with land being cleared for pasture. The town was a major military centre during the [[New Zealand Wars]] of the 1860s, although local M\u0101ori at P\u016btiki led by [[Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui]] remained friendly to settlers. In 1871 a town bridge was built, followed six years later by a railway bridge at Aramoho.<ref name=\"WisesWanganui\" /> Wanganui was linked by rail to both [[New Plymouth]] and [[Wellington]] by 1886. The town was incorporated as a [[Borough]] on 1 February 1872, and declared a city on 1 July 1924.<ref name=\"WisesWanganui\" />\n\nPerhaps Wanganui's biggest scandal happened in 1920, when Mayor [[Charles Mackay (mayor)|Charles Mackay]] shot and wounded a young poet, [[Walter D'Arcy Cresswell]], who had been blackmailing him over his homosexuality. Mackay served seven years in prison and his name was erased from the town's civic monuments, while Cresswell (himself homosexual) was praised as a \"wholesome-minded young man\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gaynz.net.nz/history/Mackay-cress.html |title=Charles Mackay and D'Arcy Cresswell |accessdate=10 October 2007}}</ref> Mackay's name was restored to the foundation stone of the [[Sarjeant Gallery]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/timeline&new_date=15/05 |title=Wanganui mayor shoots poet |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Whanganui River]] catchment is seen as a sacred area to M\u0101ori, and the Whanganui region is still seen as a focal point for any resentment over land ownership. In 1995, [[Moutoa Gardens]] in Wanganui, known to local M\u0101ori as ''Pakaitore'', were occupied for 79 days in a mainly peaceful protest by the Whanganui iwi over land claims.\n\nWanganui was the site of the [[New Zealand Police]] [[National Law Enforcement System|Law Enforcement System]] (LES) from 1976 to 1995. An early [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] [[mainframe computer]]-based intelligence and data management system, it was known colloquially as the \"Wanganui Computer\". The data centre housing it was subject to New Zealand's highest-profile [[suicide bombing]] in 1982 when anarchist [[Neil Roberts (anarchist)|Neil Roberts]] detonated a [[gelignite]] bomb in the entry foyer. Roberts was the only casualty of the bombing.\n\n== Names ==\n''Wh\u0101ng\u0101 nui'' is a [[M\u0101ori language]] phrase meaning \"big bay\" or \"big harbour\". Europeans called it ''Petre'' (pronounced Peter), after Lord Petre, an officer of the [[New Zealand Company]], but that name did not persist.\n\n=== Spelling of Wanganui/Whanganui ===\n\nIn the local dialect, [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] pronounce the phoneme ''wh'' as {{IPA|[\u02c0w]}}, a ''w'' combined with a glottal stop,{{Dubious|date=March 2012}} and the name as something like \"'Wanganui\", hard to reproduce by non-locals. Until recently it was generally written as \"Wanganui\" and pronounced with a ''w'' by non-speakers of [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] and a ''wh'' ({{IPA|[f]}} or {{IPA|[\u0278]}}) by those M\u0101ori speakers from other areas who knew its derivation.\n\nFollowing an article about the river by David Young in the [[New Zealand Geographic]] magazine that used \"Whanganui\" throughout, in accord with the wishes of the local [[iwi]], the spelling of the river's name reverted to Whanganui in 1991. The region's name is now also spelt \"Whanganui\", but the city has a mixture of spellings.\n\nA non-binding [[referendum]] was held in Wanganui in 2006, where 82 per cent voted for Wanganui without an 'h'.

A large proportion of this is within the [[Whanganui National Park]], established in 1986.\n\nThe region is known for its outstanding natural environment with the Whanganui Awa (River) at its heart. It is the second-largest river in the North Island, the longest navigable waterway in the country, and runs for {{convert|290|km}} from the heights of Mount Tongariro to Wanganui's coast and the Tasman Sea. Every bend and rapid of the river (there are 239 listed rapids) has a guardian, or kaitiaki, who maintains the mauri (life force) of that stretch of the river.\n\nWhanganui hap\u016b (sub-tribes) were renowned for their canoeing skills and maintained extensive networks of weirs and fishing traps along the River. Generations of river iwi have learned to use and protect this great taonga (treasure), and on 13 September 2012 the Whanganui River became the first river in the world to gain recognition as a legal identity.\n\nToday the river and its surrounds are used for a number of recreational activities including kayaking, jet boating, tramping, cycling and camping. A national cycleway has recently opened, which takes cyclists from the 'mountains to the sea'.\n\nIn the local government reorganisation of the 1980s, Wanganui District Council resulted from the amalgamation in 1989 of Wanganui County Council, most of Waitotara County Council, a small part of Stratford County Council, and Wanganui City Council.

Its rival from the 1860s onward was the ''Evening Herald'' (later the ''Wanganui Herald''), founded by [[John Ballance]].  Initially, the production of the ''Wanganui Chronicle'' was held back by a lack of equipment, meaning the first issue, dated 18 September 1856, was produced on a makeshift press, made by staff and pupils at the local industrial school.<ref name=\"paperspast\" /> Shortly afterwards, the founder, Henry Stokes, imported a press from Sydney. The two daily papers joined in the 1970s, and in 1986 the ''Herald'' became a free weekly, later renamed the ''Wanganui Midweek''.<ref name=\"paperspast\" /> The ''River City Press'' is the other free weekly paper.\n\nIn 1996, Whanganui briefly rose to international infamy when a man who claimed to be carrying a bomb held the local radio station hostage and demanded that the station broadcast the Muppet song \"The Rainbow Connection\" for 12 hours.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.apnews.com/f408e5868a217a29c051221486d2be61 |title=Man Takes Hostage, Wants Muppet Song Played For 12 Hours |publisher=Associated Press |date=22 March 1996 |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Sports ==\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"right\"\n|- ----\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" width=\"141px\" style=\"height:120px; font-size:100%; border:2px double grey;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:12px\" align=\"bottom\"| Sport team's colours<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/nz-@.html |title=Sport regions (New Zealand) |publisher=Crwflags.com |accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background:Blue; color:Blue\" width=\"100%\" | Blue\n|-\n| style=\"background:White; color:White\" width=\"100%\" height=\"10px\" |\n|-\n| style=\"background:Black; color:Black\" width=\"100%\" | Black\n|-\n| style=\"background:White; color:White\" width=\"100%\" height=\"10px\"|\n|-\n| style=\"background:Blue; color:Blue\" width=\"100%\" | Blue\n|- height=\"20px\"\n| colspan=2 style=\"background:Black\" | Shorts/Skirt\n|}\n|}\n\n=== Rugby ===\nThe [[Wanganui Rugby Football Union]] is one of the oldest [[rugby football|rugby]] unions in New Zealand. \n\nWanganui has never held the country's top trophy, the [[Ranfurly Shield]]\n\nOn 10 August 1966 a combined Wanganui and King Country team beat the [[British and Irish Lions]] 12 points to 6 at Spriggens Park.\n\nIn 2008 the Wanganui representative rugby team, under the captaincy of David Gower, won the NZRFU's Heartland Championship (Meads Cup) by defeating Mid Canterbury 27\u201312 in the final. They had previously been the defeated finalist in 2006 and 2007. The 2008 side had an undefeated season \u2013 the first since 1947. The rugby squad, including coach and management, was accorded the honour of 'Freedom of the City' by the Whanganui District Council \u2013 the first time the award had been given to any sporting team.\n\nThe 2009 representative team repeated this feat by regaining the Meads Cup \u2013 again defeating Mid Canterbury in the final by 34 points to 13 (after trailing nil-13 at halftime). Unlike 2008, the 2009 did lose games (to Wellington, Wairarapa Bush and Mid Canterbury) but came good at the business end of the season. Ten Whanganui players were selected for the Heartland XV.\n\nThe Wanganui rugby jersey, due to its resemblance, is known as the butcher's apron.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.wanganui.govt.nz/news/commslink/issue324.asp |title=Unifying the image |publisher=Wanganui District Council |journal=Community Link |issue=324 |date=16 August 2007 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Whanganui environs have produced many [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] including:\n\n* [[Moke Belliss]] (1920-23). \n* [[John Blair (rugby union) |John Blair]] (1897).\n* [[George Bullock-Douglas]] (1932-34).\n* [[Andrew Donald]] (1981-84).\n* [[Keith Gudsell]] (1949).

It took place on 4 November 1805 off [[Cape Ortegal]], in north-west [[Spain]] and saw [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Sir [[Sir Richard Strachan, 6th Baronet|Richard Strachan]] defeat and capture a French squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]]. It is sometimes known as Strachan's Action.\n\nDumanoir had commanded the van of the line at Trafalgar, and had managed to escape the battle having suffered relatively little damage. He initially attempted to continue the fleet's mission and enter the Mediterranean, but fearful of encountering strong British forces, changed his mind and headed north to skirt round Spain and reach the French Atlantic ports. On his journey he encountered two British frigates and drove them off; shortly afterwards he encountered a single British frigate and chased it. The frigate led Dumanoir within range of a British squadron under Strachan, who was patrolling the area in search of a different French squadron. Strachan immediately gave chase, while Dumanoir fled from Strachan's superior force. Strachan's squadron took time to form up, but he was able to use the frigates attached to it to harass and slow the French, until his larger ships of the line could catch up.\n\nThere then followed several hours of fierce fighting, before Strachan was able to outmanoeuvre his opponent and double his line with frigates and ships of the line. The French ships were then overwhelmed and forced to surrender. All four ships were taken back to Britain as prizes and commissioned into the Navy. Strachan and his men were handsomely rewarded by a public who viewed the successful outcome as completing Nelson's victory at Trafalgar.\n\n==Background==\n===Dumanoir escapes===\nFour French ships of the line stationed towards the head of the combined fleet's line escaped the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]], and sailed southwards. Pelley's initial intention was to carry out Villeneuve's original orders, and make for [[Toulon]].<ref name=\"Adkin530\">{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=530}}</ref> The day after the battle he changed his mind, remembering that a substantial British squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Thomas Louis]] was patrolling the [[straits of Gibraltar|straits]]. With a storm gathering in strength off the Spanish coast, Pelley sailed westwards to clear [[Cape St Vincent]], prior to heading north-west, and then swinging eastwards across the [[Bay of Biscay]], aiming to reach the French port at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]].<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/> His squadron represented a still-considerable force, having suffered only slight damage at Trafalgar.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} In escaping from Trafalgar Dumanoir's flagship, ''Formidable'' had jettisoned twelve 12-pounder guns from her [[quarterdeck]] in order to lighten her load and effect her escape.<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/> Dumanoir doubled Cape St Vincent on 29 October and made for [[\u00cele-d'Aix]], entering the Bay of Biscay on 2 November.<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/>\n\n===Baker sights the French===\nThere were a number of British ships and squadrons already in the bay, and on the lookout for French ships. Zacharie Allemand, commander of the Rochefort squadron, had sailed from the port in July 1805, and was currently [[Allemand's expedition of 1805|cruising in the Atlantic]], raiding British shipping.<ref name=\"James2\">{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=2}}</ref> One of the British ships sent out on patrol was the 36-gun [[HMS Phoenix (1783)|HMS ''Phoenix'']], under the command of Captain [[Thomas Baker (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Baker]]. Baker had orders to patrol west of the [[Scilly Isles]], but in late October he received news from several neutral merchants that Allemand's squadron had been sighted in the Bay of Biscay.<ref name=\"James2\"/> Baker immediately left his station and sailed southwards, reaching the [[latitude]] of [[Cape Finisterre]] on 2 November, just as Dumanoir was entering the bay.<ref name=\"James2\"/> Baker sighted four ships steering north-north-west at 11 o'clock, and immediately gave chase. The ships, which Baker presumed to be part of the Rochefort squadron, but were actually Dumanoir's ships, bore up at noon and began to chase ''Phoenix'', which fled south.<ref name=\"James2\"/> In doing so Baker hoped to lure the French onto a British squadron under Captain [[Sir Richard Strachan, 6th Baronet|Sir Richard Strachan]] that he knew to be in the area.<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/><ref name=\"James2\"/>{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}\n\nBaker kept ahead of the pursuing French, and at 3 o'clock that afternoon he sighted four sails heading south.<ref name=\"James3\">{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=3}}</ref> Dumanoir's forces also saw them, and stood to the east, while Baker, no longer pursued, kept the French sails under observation.<ref name=\"James3\"/> Having ascertained the strength and disposition of the French ships, Baker resumed sailing to the south-east, firing guns and signalling to the four ships he had seen and supposed to be British. Dumanoir's forces had already had a run-in with the British, having been chased by two frigates, the 38-gun {{HMS|Boadicea|1797|6}} under Captain [[John Maitland (Royal Navy officer)|John Maitland]], and the 36-gun {{HMS|Dryad|1795|6}} under Captain [[Adam Drummond (Royal Navy officer)|Adam Drummond]].<ref name=\"James3\"/> ''Boadicea'' and ''Dryad'' sighted ''Phoenix'' and the four sails to the south at 8.45 that evening, and made signals to them. Baker was suspicious of the new sails, standing between him and the French ships, and so did not stand towards them, instead continuing on to the sails in the south.<ref name=\"James3\"/> By now it was clear on ''Boadicea'' and ''Dryad'' that a substantial force was gathering, as ''Phoenix'' closed with four ships of the line, and three other sails were also sighted in the vicinity.<ref name=\"James3\"/> They eventually drew to within two miles of the weather-most ship, the 80-gun [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']], but received no reply to their signals, and drew away at 10.30pm, where after they lost sight of both the French and British ships, and took no further part in the battle.<ref name=\"James3\"/>\n\n===Strachan gives chase===\n[[File:Battle of Cape Ortegal 0h 55m pm EN.svg|thumbnail|right|0h 55m pm]]\nBy 11pm Baker had finally reached the ships, and passing under the stern of ''Caesar'' received confirmation that the ships were Strachan's squadron, as he had initially surmised.<ref name=\"James3\"/> Baker informed Strachan that he had sighted a part of the Rochefort squadron to leeward, and Strachan immediately determined to seek an engagement.<ref name=\"James4\">{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=4}}</ref> Strachan's squadron was however badly scattered by this stage, and after setting sail to intercept the French, sent Baker to round up the remaining ships and order them on to support him.<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/><ref name=\"James4\"/> Strachan's squadron consisted at this time of the 80-gun [[HMS Caesar (1793)|''Caesar'']], the 74-gun [[HMS Hero (1803)|''Hero'']], [[HMS Courageux (1800)|''Courageux'']], [[HMS Namur (1756)|''Namur'']] and {{HMS|Bellona|1760|2}}, and the frigates the 36-gun [[HMS Santa Margarita (1779)|''Santa Margarita'']] and 32-gun [[HMS Aeolus (1801)|''Aeolus'']].<ref name=\"James3\"/> Strachan began the chase with only ''Caesar'', ''Hero'', ''Courageux'' and ''Aeolus'', and chased the French, who were by now pressing on sail for the north west, until losing them in hazy weather at 1.30 in the morning.<ref name=\"James4\"/> They then shortened sail to await the rest of the squadron, and were joined at daylight on 3 November by ''Santa Margarita''.<ref name=\"James4\"/> The chase began again in earnest, and at 7.30 am [[Cape Ortegal]] was sighted, 36 miles to the southeast.<ref name=\"James4\"/> The French ships were again sighted at 9am, and at 11am the lead British ships sighted ''Namur'' and ''Phoenix'' astern, and hurrying to catch up. With them was another frigate, the 38-gun [[HMS R\u00e9volutionnaire (1794)|HMS ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'']], under Captain [[Henry Hotham|Hon. Henry Hotham]], who had stumbled across the chase.<ref name=\"James4\"/> The chase continued throughout the day and into the night, by which time the faster ''Santa Margarita'' and ''Phoenix'' were well ahead of the main British force. The ''Bellona'' had been unable to rejoin the squadron, and took no part in the battle.<ref name=\"James4\"/>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Sir R. Strachan's Action Nov 4 1805.jpg|thumb|''Strachan's Action'' on 4 November 1805]]\nThe battle began at 5.45 on the morning of 4 November, when ''Santa Margarita'' closed on the stern of the rear-most French ship, [[French ship Scipion (1798)|''Scipion'']], and opened fire, being joined by ''Phoenix'' at 9.30.<ref name=\"Adkin531\">{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=531}}</ref><ref name=\"James5\">{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=5}}</ref> At this stage the French were sailing roughly in line abreast, with ''Phoenix'' and ''Santa Margarita'' snapping at ''Scipion''{{'}}s heels.<ref name=\"Adkin531\"/> Strachan was about six miles behind the French with ''Caesar'', ''Hero'' and ''Courageux'', accompanied by ''Aeolus'', while ''Namur'' and ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' were some way astern of them.<ref name=\"Adkin531\"/> The British continued to overhaul the French, while ''Scipion'' exchanged fire with the harassing frigates from her stern-chasers. At 11.45 with an action now unavoidable Dumanoir ordered his ships to form line ahead on the starboard tack, as Strachan likewise lined his ships up and approached from windward on the French ships' starboard side.<ref name=\"Adkin531\"/>\n[[File:Battle of Cape Ortegal 3h 35m pm EN.svg|thumbnail|left|3h 35m pm]]\n\nBy noon all four British frigates were in action, harassing ''Scipion'' on the port side, while ''Namur'' had nearly joined the ships of the line, who were firing on the rear-most French ships' starboard side.<ref name=\"Adkin531\"/> Dumanoir had ordered his ships to tack in succession in 11.30, and so bring his leading ship, ''Duguay-Trouin'' into the action to support his centre.

It took place on 4 November 1805 off [[Cape Ortegal]], in north-west [[Spain]] and saw [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Sir [[Sir Richard Strachan, 6th Baronet|Richard Strachan]] defeat and capture a French squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]]. It is sometimes known as Strachan's Action.\n\nDumanoir had commanded the van of the line at Trafalgar, and had managed to escape the battle having suffered relatively little damage. He initially attempted to continue the fleet's mission and enter the Mediterranean, but fearful of encountering strong British forces, changed his mind and headed north to skirt round Spain and reach the French Atlantic ports. On his journey he encountered two British frigates and drove them off; shortly afterwards he encountered a single British frigate and chased it. The frigate led Dumanoir within range of a British squadron under Strachan, who was patrolling the area in search of a different French squadron. Strachan immediately gave chase, while Dumanoir fled from Strachan's superior force. Strachan's squadron took time to form up, but he was able to use the frigates attached to it to harass and slow the French, until his larger ships of the line could catch up.\n\nThere then followed several hours of fierce fighting, before Strachan was able to outmanoeuvre his opponent and double his line with frigates and ships of the line. The French ships were then overwhelmed and forced to surrender. All four ships were taken back to Britain as prizes and commissioned into the Navy. Strachan and his men were handsomely rewarded by a public who viewed the successful outcome as completing Nelson's victory at Trafalgar.\n\n==Background==\n===Dumanoir escapes===\nFour French ships of the line stationed towards the head of the combined fleet's line escaped the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]], and sailed southwards. Pelley's initial intention was to carry out Villeneuve's original orders, and make for [[Toulon]].<ref name=\"Adkin530\">{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=530}}</ref> The day after the battle he changed his mind, remembering that a substantial British squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Thomas Louis]] was patrolling the [[straits of Gibraltar|straits]]. With a storm gathering in strength off the Spanish coast, Pelley sailed westwards to clear [[Cape St Vincent]], prior to heading north-west, and then swinging eastwards across the [[Bay of Biscay]], aiming to reach the French port at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]].<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/> His squadron represented a still-considerable force, having suffered only slight damage at Trafalgar.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} In escaping from Trafalgar Dumanoir's flagship, ''Formidable'' had jettisoned twelve 12-pounder guns from her [[quarterdeck]] in order to lighten her load and effect her escape.<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/> Dumanoir doubled Cape St Vincent on 29 October and made for [[\u00cele-d'Aix]], entering the Bay of Biscay on 2 November.<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/>\n\n===Baker sights the French===\nThere were a number of British ships and squadrons already in the bay, and on the lookout for French ships. Zacharie Allemand, commander of the Rochefort squadron, had sailed from the port in July 1805, and was currently [[Allemand's expedition of 1805|cruising in the Atlantic]], raiding British shipping.<ref name=\"James2\">{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=2}}</ref> One of the British ships sent out on patrol was the 36-gun [[HMS Phoenix (1783)|HMS ''Phoenix'']], under the command of Captain [[Thomas Baker (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Baker]]. Baker had orders to patrol west of the [[Scilly Isles]], but in late October he received news from several neutral merchants that Allemand's squadron had been sighted in the Bay of Biscay.<ref name=\"James2\"/> Baker immediately left his station and sailed southwards, reaching the [[latitude]] of [[Cape Finisterre]] on 2 November, just as Dumanoir was entering the bay.<ref name=\"James2\"/> Baker sighted four ships steering north-north-west at 11 o'clock, and immediately gave chase. The ships, which Baker presumed to be part of the Rochefort squadron, but were actually Dumanoir's ships, bore up at noon and began to chase ''Phoenix'', which fled south.<ref name=\"James2\"/> In doing so Baker hoped to lure the French onto a British squadron under Captain [[Sir Richard Strachan, 6th Baronet|Sir Richard Strachan]] that he knew to be in the area.<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/><ref name=\"James2\"/>{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}\n\nBaker kept ahead of the pursuing French, and at 3 o'clock that afternoon he sighted four sails heading south.<ref name=\"James3\">{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=3}}</ref> Dumanoir's forces also saw them, and stood to the east, while Baker, no longer pursued, kept the French sails under observation.<ref name=\"James3\"/> Having ascertained the strength and disposition of the French ships, Baker resumed sailing to the south-east, firing guns and signalling to the four ships he had seen and supposed to be British. Dumanoir's forces had already had a run-in with the British, having been chased by two frigates, the 38-gun {{HMS|Boadicea|1797|6}} under Captain [[John Maitland (Royal Navy officer)|John Maitland]], and the 36-gun {{HMS|Dryad|1795|6}} under Captain [[Adam Drummond (Royal Navy officer)|Adam Drummond]].<ref name=\"James3\"/> ''Boadicea'' and ''Dryad'' sighted ''Phoenix'' and the four sails to the south at 8.45 that evening, and made signals to them. Baker was suspicious of the new sails, standing between him and the French ships, and so did not stand towards them, instead continuing on to the sails in the south.<ref name=\"James3\"/> By now it was clear on ''Boadicea'' and ''Dryad'' that a substantial force was gathering, as ''Phoenix'' closed with four ships of the line, and three other sails were also sighted in the vicinity.<ref name=\"James3\"/> They eventually drew to within two miles of the weather-most ship, the 80-gun [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']], but received no reply to their signals, and drew away at 10.30pm, where after they lost sight of both the French and British ships, and took no further part in the battle.<ref name=\"James3\"/>\n\n===Strachan gives chase===\n[[File:Battle of Cape Ortegal 0h 55m pm EN.svg|thumbnail|right|0h 55m pm]]\nBy 11pm Baker had finally reached the ships, and passing under the stern of ''Caesar'' received confirmation that the ships were Strachan's squadron, as he had initially surmised.<ref name=\"James3\"/> Baker informed Strachan that he had sighted a part of the Rochefort squadron to leeward, and Strachan immediately determined to seek an engagement.<ref name=\"James4\">{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=4}}</ref> Strachan's squadron was however badly scattered by this stage, and after setting sail to intercept the French, sent Baker to round up the remaining ships and order them on to support him.<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/><ref name=\"James4\"/> Strachan's squadron consisted at this time of the 80-gun [[HMS Caesar (1793)|''Caesar'']], the 74-gun [[HMS Hero (1803)|''Hero'']], [[HMS Courageux (1800)|''Courageux'']], [[HMS Namur (1756)|''Namur'']] and {{HMS|Bellona|1760|2}}, and the frigates the 36-gun [[HMS Santa Margarita (1779)|''Santa Margarita'']] and 32-gun [[HMS Aeolus (1801)|''Aeolus'']].<ref name=\"James3\"/> Strachan began the chase with only ''Caesar'', ''Hero'', ''Courageux'' and ''Aeolus'', and chased the French, who were by now pressing on sail for the north west, until losing them in hazy weather at 1.30 in the morning.<ref name=\"James4\"/> They then shortened sail to await the rest of the squadron, and were joined at daylight on 3 November by ''Santa Margarita''.<ref name=\"James4\"/> The chase began again in earnest, and at 7.30 am [[Cape Ortegal]] was sighted, 36 miles to the southeast.<ref name=\"James4\"/> The French ships were again sighted at 9am, and at 11am the lead British ships sighted ''Namur'' and ''Phoenix'' astern, and hurrying to catch up. With them was another frigate, the 38-gun [[HMS R\u00e9volutionnaire (1794)|HMS ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'']], under Captain [[Henry Hotham|Hon. Henry Hotham]], who had stumbled across the chase.<ref name=\"James4\"/> The chase continued throughout the day and into the night, by which time the faster ''Santa Margarita'' and ''Phoenix'' were well ahead of the main British force. The ''Bellona'' had been unable to rejoin the squadron, and took no part in the battle.<ref name=\"James4\"/>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Sir R. Strachan's Action Nov 4 1805.jpg|thumb|''Strachan's Action'' on 4 November 1805]]\nThe battle began at 5.45 on the morning of 4 November, when ''Santa Margarita'' closed on the stern of the rear-most French ship, [[French ship Scipion (1798)|''Scipion'']], and opened fire, being joined by ''Phoenix'' at 9.30.<ref name=\"Adkin531\">{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=531}}</ref><ref name=\"James5\">{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=5}}</ref> At this stage the French were sailing roughly in line abreast, with ''Phoenix'' and ''Santa Margarita'' snapping at ''Scipion''{{'}}s heels.<ref name=\"Adkin531\"/> Strachan was about six miles behind the French with ''Caesar'', ''Hero'' and ''Courageux'', accompanied by ''Aeolus'', while ''Namur'' and ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' were some way astern of them.<ref name=\"Adkin531\"/> The British continued to overhaul the French, while ''Scipion'' exchanged fire with the harassing frigates from her stern-chasers. At 11.45 with an action now unavoidable Dumanoir ordered his ships to form line ahead on the starboard tack, as Strachan likewise lined his ships up and approached from windward on the French ships' starboard side.<ref name=\"Adkin531\"/>\n[[File:Battle of Cape Ortegal 3h 35m pm EN.svg|thumbnail|left|3h 35m pm]]\n\nBy noon all four British frigates were in action, harassing ''Scipion'' on the port side, while ''Namur'' had nearly joined the ships of the line, who were firing on the rear-most French ships' starboard side.<ref name=\"Adkin531\"/> Dumanoir had ordered his ships to tack in succession in 11.30, and so bring his leading ship, ''Duguay-Trouin'' into the action to support his centre.

{"title_page": "Magic realism", "text_new": "{{distinguish|science fantasy}}\n{{short description|Artistic genre and movement}}\n\n'''Magical realism''', '''magic realism''', or '''marvelous realism''' is a [[Writing style|style]] of [[fiction]] that paints a realistic view of the modern world while also adding magical elements. It is sometimes called '''fabulism''', in reference to the conventions of [[fable]]s, [[myth]]s, and [[allegory]]. \"Magical realism\", perhaps the most common term, often refers to fiction and literature in particular,<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|1\u20135}} with [[magic in fiction|magic]] or the [[supernatural]] presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane [[setting (narrative)|setting]], commonly seen in novels and dramatic performances. It is considered a subgenre of [[fantasy]].\n\nThe terms are broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous. Matthew Strecher defines magic realism as \"what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe\".<ref>Matthew C. Strecher, Magical Realism and the Search for Identity in the Fiction of Murakami Haruki, Journal of Japanese Studies, Volume 25, Number 2 (Summer 1999), pp. 263-298, at 267.</ref> Many writers are categorized as \"magical realists\", which confuses the term and its wide definition. Irene Guenther tackles the German roots of the term, and how art is related to literature.<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" /> Magical realism is often associated with [[Latin American literature]], particularly authors including genre founders [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], [[Miguel Angel Asturias]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Elena Garro]], [[Mireya Robles]], [[Juan Rulfo]], [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]], [[Arturo Uslar Pietri]], and [[Isabel Allende]]. In [[English literature]], its chief exponents include [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Alice Hoffman]], [[Nick Joaquin]], and [[Nicola Barker]]. In [[Bengali literature]], prominent writers of magic realism include [[Nabarun Bhattacharya]], [[Akhteruzzaman Elias]], [[Shahidul Zahir]], [[Jibanananda Das]], [[Syed Waliullah]], [[Nasreen Jahan]] and [[Humayun Ahmed]]. In [[Japanese literature]], one of the most important authors of this genre is [[Haruki Murakami]]. In [[Polish literature]] magic realism is represented by [[Olga Tokarczuk]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] laureate.\n\n==Etymology==\nWhile the term ''magical realism'' first appeared in English in 1955,<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|16}} the term ''Magischer Realismus,'' translated as ''magic realism,'' was first used by German art critic [[Franz Roh]] in 1925<ref>Slemon, Stephen.

It reflects the uncanniness of people and our modern technological environment.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|9\u201310}} Roh believed that magic realism was related to, but distinct from, [[surrealism]], due to magic realism's focus on the material object and the actual existence of things in the world, as opposed to surrealism's more cerebral, psychological and subconscious reality.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\">{{Cite book | last = Bowers | first = Maggie Ann | title = Magic(al) Realism | publisher = Routledge | date = November 4, 2004 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-415-26854-7}}</ref>{{rp|12}} Magic realism was later used to describe the uncanny [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] by American painters such as [[Ivan Albright]], [[Peter Blume]], [[Paul Cadmus]], [[Gray Foy]], [[George Tooker]] and Viennese-born [[Henry Koerner]], along other artists during the 1940s and 1950s. However, in contrast with its use in literature, magic realist art does not often include overtly fantastic or magical content, but rather looks at the mundane through a hyper-realistic and often mysterious lens.<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />\n\nGerman magic realist paintings influenced the Italian writer [[Massimo Bontempelli]], who has been called the first to apply magic realism to writing, aiming to capture the fantastic, mysterious nature of reality. In 1926 he founded the magic realist magazine ''900.Novecento,'' and his writings influenced Belgian magic realist writers [[Johan Daisne]] and [[Hubert Lampo]].<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|13\u201314}}\n\nRoh's magic realism also influenced writers in Hispanic America, where it was translated as ''realismo m\u00e1gico'' in 1927. Venezuelan writer [[Arturo Uslar-Pietri]], who had known Bontempelli, wrote influential magic realist short stories in the 1930s and 40s that focused on the mystery and reality of how we live.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|14\u201315}} Luis Leal attests that Pietri seemed to have been the first to adopt the term ''realismo m\u00e1gico'' in Hispanic America in 1948.<ref>Leal, Luis, \"Magical Realism in Spanish America\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 120.</ref> There is evidence that Mexican writer Elena Garro used the same term to describe the works of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] but dismissed her own work as a part of the genre.<ref>Rosas Lop\u00e1tegui, Patricia. ''El asesinato de Elena Garro'', Porr\u00faa, M\u00e9xico. 2006.</ref> French-Russian Cuban writer [[Alejo Carpentier]], who rejected Roh's magic realism as tiresome pretension, developed his related concept ''lo real maravilloso,'' or ''marvelous realism,'' in 1949.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|14}} Maggie Ann Bowers writes that marvelous realist literature and art expresses \"the seemingly opposed perspectives of a pragmatic, practical and tangible approach to reality and an acceptance of magic and superstition\" within an environment of differing cultures.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|2\u20133}}\n\nThe term ''magical realism,'' as opposed to ''magic realism,'' first emerged in the 1955 essay \"Magical Realism in Spanish American Fiction\" by critic Angel Flores in reference to writing that combines aspects of magic realism and marvelous realism. While Flores named [[Jorge Luis Borges]] as the first magical realist, he failed to acknowledge either Carpentier or Pietri for bringing Roh's magic realism to Latin America. Borges is often seen as a predecessor of magical realists, with only Flores considering him a true magical realist.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|16\u201318}}\n\nAfter Flores's essay, there was a resurgence of interest in marvelous realism, which, after the Cuban revolution of 1959, led to the term ''magical realism'' being applied to a new type of literature known for matter-of-fact portrayal of magical events.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe extent to which the characteristics below apply to a given magic realist text varies. Every text is different and employs a smattering of the qualities listed here. However, they accurately portray what one might expect from a magic realist text.\n\n====Fantastical elements====\nMagical realism portrays fantastical events in an otherwise realistic tone. It brings fables, folk tales, and myths into contemporary social relevance. Fantasy traits given to characters, such as levitation, telepathy, and telekinesis, help to encompass modern political realities that can be phantasmagorical.<ref>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms, 3rd ed., 2008</ref>\n\n====Real-world setting====\nThe existence of fantasy elements in the real world provides the basis for magical realism. Writers do not invent new worlds but reveal the magical in this world, as was done by [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], who wrote the seminal work ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''.<ref name=Leal89>Garc\u00eda, ''Leal'', p. 89.</ref> In the world of magical realism, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world.<ref name=Zlotchew15>Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism.'' New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007. p. 15</ref>\n\n====Authorial reticence====\nAuthorial reticence is the \"deliberate withholding of information and explanations about the disconcerting fictitious world\".<ref>Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice. Magical Realism and the Fantastic: Resolved versus Unresolved Antinomy. New York: Garland Publishing Inc., 1985. pg. 16</ref> The narrator is indifferent, a characteristic enhanced by this absence of explanation of fantastic events; the story proceeds with \"logical precision\" as if nothing extraordinary had taken place.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |last1=Flores |first1=Angel |title=Magical Realism in Spanish American Fiction |journal=Hispania |date=May 1955 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=187\u2013192 |doi=10.2307/335812 |jstor=335812}}</ref><ref>Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice.

''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 25-27. New York: Routledge, 2004. Print.</ref> Explaining the supernatural world or presenting it as extraordinary would immediately reduce its legitimacy relative to the natural world. The reader would consequently disregard the supernatural as false testimony.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Plenitude====\nIn his essay \"The Baroque and the Marvelous Real\", [[Cubans|Cuban]] writer [[Alejo Carpentier]] defined the [[baroque]] by a lack of emptiness, a departure from structure or rules, and an \"extraordinary\" abundance (plenitude) of disorienting detail (citing [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] as its opposite). From this angle, Carpentier views the baroque as a layering of elements, which translates easily into the post-colonial or transcultural Latin American atmosphere that he emphasizes in ''[[The Kingdom of this World]]''.<ref>Carpentier, Alejo, ''El Reino de este Mundo''</ref> \"America, a continent of symbiosis, mutations... [[mestizaje]], engenders the baroque\",<ref>Carpentier, Alejo, \"The baroque and the marvelous real\" from ''MR: Theory History, Community''</ref> made explicit by elaborate Aztec temples and associative Nahuatl poetry. These mixing ethnicities grow together with the American baroque; the space in between is where the \"marvelous real\" is seen. Marvelous: not meaning beautiful and pleasant, but extraordinary, strange, and excellent.

Furthermore, it is the tool paramount in the execution of a related and major magic realist phenomenon: textualization. This term defines two conditions&mdash;first, where a fictitious reader enters the [[story within a story]] while reading it, making them self-conscious of their status as readers&mdash;and secondly, where the textual world enters into the reader's (real) world. Good sense would negate this process but \"magic\" is the flexible convention that allows it.<ref>Thiem, Jon, \"The Textualization of the Reader in Magical Realist Fiction\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref>\n\n====Heightened awareness of mystery====\nSomething that most critics agree on is this major theme. Magic realist literature tends to read at an intensified level. Taking ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', the reader must let go of pre-existing ties to conventional [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], plot advancement, linear time structure, scientific reason, etc., to strive for a state of heightened awareness of life's connectedness or hidden meanings. Luis Leal articulates this feeling as \"to seize the mystery that breathes behind things\",<ref>Leal, Luis, \"Magical Realism in Spanish American Literature,\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> and supports the claim by saying a writer must heighten his senses to the point of \"estado limite\" (translated as \"limit state\" or \"extreme\") in order to realize all levels of reality, most importantly that of mystery.<ref>Carpentier, Alejo, \"On the Marvelous Real in America\", the Introduction to his novel, ''The Kingdom of this World''</ref>\n\n====Political critique====\nMagic realism contains an \"implicit criticism of society, particularly the elite\".<ref>{{cite web\n |publisher   = University of Texas Press\n |url         = http://www-english.tamu.edu/pers/fac/andreadis/474H_ahapw/Definition_Magic.Realism.html\n |title       = Twentieth-Century Spanish American Literature\n |year        = 194\n |accessdate  = June 18, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227034359/http://www-english.tamu.edu/pers/fac/andreadis/474H_ahapw/Definition_Magic.Realism.html\n |archivedate = February 27, 2009\n}}</ref> Especially with regard to Latin America, the style breaks from the inarguable discourse of \"privileged centers of literature\".<ref>D'haen, Theo, \"Magical realism and postmodernism: decentering privileged centers\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> This is a mode primarily about and for \"ex-centrics\": the geographically, socially and economically marginalized. Therefore, magic realism's \"alternative world\" works to correct the reality of established viewpoints (like realism, naturalism, modernism).

Alternatively, the socially dominant may implement magical realism to disassociate themselves from their \"[[power discourse]]\".<ref>D'haen, Theo, \"Magical realism and postmodernism: decentering privileged centers\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 195</ref> Theo D'haen calls this change in perspective \"decentering\".\n\nIn his review of Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez' novel ''[[Chronicle of a Death Foretold]]'', [[Salman Rushdie]] argues that the formal experiment of magic realism allows political ideas to be expressed in ways that might not be possible through more established literary forms:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Juul|first1=Jesper|title=Are Game Experiments Apolitical?

Writers often traveled between their home country and European cultural hubs, such as Paris or Berlin, and were influenced by the art movement of the time.<ref name=\"Faris, Wendy B pp. 3-4\"/><ref>Carpentier, Alejo: \"The Baroque and the Marvelous Real (1975)\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> Cuban writer [[Alejo Carpentier]] and Venezuelan [[Arturo Uslar-Pietri]], for example, were strongly influenced by European artistic movements, such as [[Surrealism]], during their stays in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/> One major event that linked painterly and literary magic realisms was the translation and publication of Franz Roh's book into Spanish by Spain's ''Revista de Occidente'' in 1927, headed by major literary figure [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]]. \"Within a year, Magic Realism was being applied to the prose of European authors in the literary circles of Buenos Aires.\"<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />{{rp|61}} [[Jorge Luis Borges]] inspired and encouraged other Latin American writers in the development of magical realism \u2013 particularly with his first magical realist publication, ''[[Historia universal de la infamia]]'' in 1935.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Between 1940 and 1950, magical realism in Latin America reached its peak, with prominent writers appearing mainly in Argentina.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nThe theoretical implications of visual art's magic realism greatly influenced European and Latin American literature. Italian [[Massimo Bontempelli]], for instance, claimed that [[literature]] could be a means to create a collective consciousness by \"opening new mythical and magical perspectives on reality\", and used his writings to inspire an Italian nation governed by [[Fascism]].<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/> Pietri was closely associated with Roh's form of magic realism and knew Bontempelli in Paris. Rather than follow Carpentier's developing versions of \"the (Latin) American marvelous real\", Uslar-Pietri's writings emphasize \"the mystery of human living amongst the reality of life\". He believed magic realism was \"a continuation of the '''vanguardia''' [or [[avant-garde]]] modernist experimental writings of Latin America\".<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>\n\n===Major topics in criticism===\n\n====Ambiguities in definition====\nMexican critic [[Luis Leal (writer)|Luis Leal]] summed up the difficulty of defining magical realism by writing, \"If you can explain it, then it's not magical realism.\"<ref>Garc\u00eda, ''Leal'', p. 127\u2013128</ref> He offers his own definition by writing, \"Without thinking of the concept of magical realism, each writer gives expression to a reality he observes in the people. To me, magical realism is an attitude on the part of the characters in the novel toward the world,\" or toward nature.\n\nLeal and Guenther both quote [[Arturo Uslar-Pietri]], who described \"man as a mystery surrounded by realistic facts. A poetic prediction or a poetic denial of reality. What for lack of another name could be called a magical realism.\"<ref>Pietri, Arturo Uslar, ''Letras y hombres de Venezuela''. Mexico City, Fondo de Cultura Economica: 1949. pp. 161-61</ref> It is worth noting that Pietri, in presenting his term for this literary tendency, always kept its definition open by means of a language more lyrical and evocative than strictly critical, as in this 1948 statement. When academic critics attempted to define magical realism with scholarly exactitude, they discovered that it was more powerful than precise. Critics, frustrated by their inability to pin down the term's meaning, have urged its complete abandonment. Yet in Pietri's vague, ample usage, magical realism was wildly successful in summarizing for many readers their perception of much Latin American fiction; this fact suggests that the term has its uses, so long as it is not expected to function with the precision expected of technical, scholarly terminology.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Western and native worldviews====\nThe critical perspective towards magical realism as a conflict between reality and abnormality stems from the Western reader's disassociation with [[mythology]], a root of magical realism more easily understood by non-Western cultures.<ref name=\"Faris, Wendy B pp. 3-4\">Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to ''Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 3-4</ref> Western confusion regarding magical realism is due to the \"conception of the real\" created in a magical realist text: rather than explain reality using natural or physical laws, as in typical Western texts, magical realist texts create a reality \"in which the relation between incidents, characters, and setting could not be based upon or justified by their status within the physical world or their normal acceptance by bourgeois mentality\".<ref>Angel Flores, qtd. in {{citation|last= Simpkins |first= Scott |title= Magical Strategies: The Supplement of Realism |journal = Twentieth Century Literature |volume= 34 |number= 2 |year= 1988 |pages= 140\u2013154 |jstor= 441074 |doi=10.2307/441074}}, p. 142</ref>\n\nGuatemalan author [[William Spindler]]'s article, \"Magic realism: a typology\",<ref>Spindler, W. \"Magic realism: a typology\", Forum for Modern Language Studies. (1993) Vol. xxxix No. 1</ref> suggests that there are three kinds of magic realism, which however are by no means incompatible: European \"metaphysical\" magic realism, with its sense of estrangement and the uncanny, exemplified by [[Kafka]]'s fiction; \"ontological\" magical realism, characterized by \"matter-of-factness\" in relating \"inexplicable\" events; and \"anthropological\" magical realism, where a Native worldview is set side by side with the Western rational worldview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/225960/3/French,%20M.,%20Jackson,%20S.%20Jokisuu,%20E.%20(2010)%20'Diverse%20Engagement%20-%20Drawing%20in%20the%20Margins'%20online%20edition-3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119235615/http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/225960/3/French,%20M.,%20Jackson,%20S.%20Jokisuu,%20E.%20(2010)%20'Diverse%20Engagement%20-%20Drawing%20in%20the%20Margins'%20online%20edition-3.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-19 }}</ref> Spindler's typology of magic realism has been criticized as \"an act of categorization which seeks to define Magic Realism as a culturally specific project, by identifying for his readers those (non-modern) societies where myth and magic persist and where Magic Realism might be expected to occur. There are objections to this analysis. Western rationalism models may not actually describe Western modes of thinking and it is possible to conceive of instances where both orders of knowledge are simultaneously possible.\"<ref>Liam Connell , \"Discarding Magic Realism: Modernism, Anthropology, and Critical Practice\", in ARIEL, Vol. 29, No. 2, April, 1998, pp. 95-110.</ref>\n\n====Lo real maravilloso====\n[[Alejo Carpentier]] originated the term ''lo real maravilloso'' (roughly \"the marvelous real\") in the prologue to his novel ''[[The Kingdom of this World]]'' (1949); however, some debate whether he is truly a magical realist writer, or simply a precursor and source of inspiration. Maggie Bowers claims he is widely acknowledged as the originator of Latin American magical realism (as both a novelist and critic);<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/> she describes Carpentier's conception as a kind of heightened reality where elements of the miraculous can appear while seeming natural and unforced. She suggests that by disassociating himself and his writings from Roh's painterly magic realism, Carpentier aimed to show how&mdash;by virtue of Latin America's varied history, geography, demography, politics, myths, and beliefs&mdash;improbable and marvelous things are made possible.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/> Furthermore, Carpentier's meaning is that Latin America is a land filled with marvels, and that \"writing about this land automatically produces a literature of marvelous reality\".<ref>Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism.'' New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alejocarpentier.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Alejo Carpentier]]\n\n\"The marvelous\" may be easily confused with magical realism, as both modes introduce supernatural events without surprising the implied author. In both, these magical events are expected and accepted as everyday occurrences. However, the marvelous world is a unidimensional world. The implied author believes that anything can happen here, as the entire world is filled with supernatural beings and situations to begin with. Fairy tales are a good example of marvelous literature. The important idea in defining the marvelous is that readers understand that this fictional world is different from the world where they live. The \"marvelous\" one-dimensional world differs from the ''bidimensional'' world of magical realism, as in the latter, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world (arriving at the combination of ''two'' layers of reality: bidimensional).<ref name=Zlotchew15 /> While some use the terms magical realism and lo real maravilloso interchangeably, the key difference lies in the focus.<ref>Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism''. New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007. p. 11</ref>\n\nCritic [[Luis Leal (writer)|Luis Leal]] attests that Carpentier was an originating pillar of the magical realist style by implicitly referring to the latter's critical works, writing that \"The existence of the marvelous real is what started magical realist literature, which some critics claim is ''the'' truly American literature\".<ref>Leal, Luis, \"Magical Realism in Spanish America\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 122</ref> It can consequently be drawn that Carpentier's \"lo real maravilloso\" is especially distinct from ''magical realism'' by the fact that the former applies specifically to ''America''.<ref name=\"Daniel, Lee A 1982\"/> On that note, Lee A. Daniel categorizes critics of Carpentier into three groups: those that do not consider him a magical realist whatsoever (\u00c1ngel Flores), those that call him \"a m\u00e1gicorealista writer with no mention of his \"lo real maravilloso\" (G\u00f3mez Gil, Jean Franco, Carlos Fuentes)\", and those that use the two terms interchangeably (Fernando Alegria, Luis Leal, Emir Rodriguez Monegal).<ref name=\"Daniel, Lee A 1982\"/>\n\n====Latin American exclusivity====\nCriticism that Latin America is the birthplace and cornerstone of all things magic realist is quite common. \u00c1ngel Flores does not deny that magical realism is an international commodity but articulates that it has a Hispanic birthplace, writing that \"Magical realism is a continuation of the romantic realist tradition of Spanish language literature and its European counterparts.\"<ref>Flores, Angel, \"Magical Realism in Spanish America\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> Flores is not alone on this front; there is argument between those who see magical realism as a Latin American invention and those who see it as the global product of a [[postmodern]] world.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> Guenther concludes, \"Conjecture aside, it is in Latin America that [magic realism] was primarily seized by literary criticism and was, through translation and literary appropriation, transformed.\"<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />{{rp|61}} Magic realism has taken on an internationalization: dozens of non-Hispanic writers are categorized as such, and many believe that it truly ''is'' an international commodity.<ref>Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to MR: Theory, History, Community, pp. 4 and 8</ref>\n\nThe Hispanic Origin Theory: If considering all citations given in this article, there are issues with Guenther's and other critic's \"Hispanic origin theory\" and conclusion. By admission of this article, the term \"magical realism\" first came into artistic usage in 1927 by German critic Franz Roh after the 1915 publication of Franz Kafka's novella \"[[The Metamorphosis]]\", both visual and literary representations and uses of magic realism, regardless of suffix nitpicking.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Russian author, Nikolai Gogol and his story \"The Nose\" (1835), is also a predecessor to the Hispanic origin theory. All this further called into question by Borges' critical standing as a true magical realist versus a predecessor to magic realism and how the dates of publications between Hispanic and European works compare.  Magic realism has certainly enjoyed a \"golden era\" in the Hispanic communities. It cannot be denied that Hispanic communities, Argentina in particular, have supported great movements and talents in magic realism. One could validly suggest that the height of magic realism has been seen in Latin American countries, though, feminist readers might disagree. Virginia Woolf, Angela Carter, Toni Morrison and Charlotte Perkins Gilman being excellent critical challenges to this notion of Hispanic magic realism as a full and diversely aware aesthetic. Allende being a later contribution to this gender aware discourse. Frida Kahlo, of course, being important to this as well but also at a later date than Woolf and Gilman. This feminist mapping, however, is unnecessary in identifying a basic truth. Kafka and Gogol predate Borges. They may each have their own forms of magic realism, but they are each by the broader definition solidly within this article's given identification: \"a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe....\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThis issue of feminist study in magic realism and its origination is an important discourse, as well. It should not be ignored. Given that magic realism, by nature of its craft, allows underrepresented and minority voices to be heard in more subtle and representational contexts, magic realism may be one of the better forms available to authors and artists who are expressing unpopular scenarios in socio-political contexts. Again, Woolf, Allende, Kahlo, Carter, Morrison and Gilman being excellent examples of diversity in gender and ethnicity in magic realism. To this end, Hispanic origin theory does not hold.\n\nGender diversity aside, magic realism's foundational beginnings are much more diverse and intricate than what the Hispanic origin theory would suggest as defined in this article. Early in the article, we read a broader definition:  \"[magic realism is] what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe...\" This \"too strange to believe\" standard being relative to European aesthetics\u2014i.e. Woolf's, Kafka's and Gogol's work. Later, we read another definition and seeming precedent to the Hispanic origin theory: \"Magical realism is a continuation of the romantic realist tradition of Spanish language literature.\" This \"continuation\" is a subset of a broader magic realism definition and standard. The Hispanic \"continuation\" and \"romantic realist tradition of Spanish language\" subset certainly identifies why magic realism took root and further developed in Hispanic communities, but it does not set a precedent for ground zero origination or ownership purely in Hispanic cultures. Magic realism originated in Germany as much as it did in Latin American countries. Both can claim their more specific aesthetics, but to identify the broader term of magic realism as being Hispanic is merely a theory unsupported by the citations within this article. Perhaps it is time to identify each as its own as part of a broader and less biased umbrella.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMagic realism is a continued craft in the many countries that have contributed to it in its earliest stages. Germany being first and Latin American countries being a close second. There are certainly differences in aesthetics between European and Hispanic magic realists, but they are both equally magic realists. For this reason, the Hispanic magic realists should really have proper designation as such but not the overarching umbrella of the broader term as this article suggests.<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />\n\n====Postmodernism====\nTaking into account that, theoretically, magical realism was born in the 20th century, some have argued that connecting it to postmodernism is a logical next step. To further connect the two concepts, there are descriptive commonalities between the two that Belgian critic Theo D'haen addresses in his essay, \"Magical Realism and Postmodernism\". While authors such as [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], [[Peter Handke]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[John Fowles]], [[Angela Carter]], [[John Banville]], [[Michel Tournier]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Willem Brakman]] and [[Louis Ferron]] might be widely considered postmodernist, they can \"just as easily be categorized ... magic realist\".<ref>D'haen, Theo L., \"Magical realism and postmodernism\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 193</ref> A list has been compiled of characteristics one might typically attribute to postmodernism, but that also could describe literary magic realism: \"self-reflexiveness, metafiction, eclecticism, redundancy, multiplicity, discontinuity, intertextuality, parody, the dissolution of character and narrative instance, the erasure of boundaries, and the destabilization of the reader\".<ref>D'haen, Theo L., \"Magical realism and postmodernism\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 192-3 [D'haen references many texts that attest to these qualities]</ref> To further connect the two, magical realism and postmodernism share the themes of post-colonial discourse, in which jumps in time and focus cannot really be explained with scientific but rather with magical reasoning; textualization (of the reader); and metafiction.\n\nConcerning attitude toward audience, the two have, some argue, a lot in common. Magical realist works do not seek to primarily satisfy a popular audience, but instead, a sophisticated audience that must be attuned to noticing textual \"subtleties\".<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> While the postmodern writer condemns escapist literature (like fantasy, crime, ghost fiction), he/she is inextricably related to it concerning readership. There are two modes in [[postmodern literature]]: one, commercially successful pop fiction, and the other, philosophy, better suited to intellectuals. A singular reading of the first mode will render a distorted or reductive understanding of the text. The fictitious reader&mdash;such as Aureliano from ''100 Years of Solitude''&mdash;is the hostage used to express the writer's anxiety on this issue of who is reading the work and to what ends, and of how the writer is forever reliant upon the needs and desires of readers (the market).<ref>Thiem, Jon, \"The textualization of the reader in magical realist fiction\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> The magic realist writer with difficulty must reach a balance between saleability and intellectual integrity. Wendy Faris, talking about magic realism as a contemporary phenomenon that leaves modernism for postmodernism, says, \"Magic realist fictions do seem more youthful and popular than their modernist predecessors, in that they often (though not always) cater with unidirectional story lines to our basic desire to hear what happens next. Thus they may be more clearly designed for the entertainment of readers.\"<ref>Wendy Faris, \"Scheherezade's Children: Magical Realism and Postmodern Fiction,\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 163</ref>\n\n===Comparison with related genres===\nWhen attempting to define what something ''is'', it is often helpful to define what something is ''not''. Many literary critics attempt to classify novels and literary works in only one genre, such as \"romantic\" or \"naturalist\", not always taking into account that many works fall into multiple categories.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>  Much discussion is cited from Maggie Ann Bowers' book ''Magic(al) Realism'', wherein she attempts to delimit the terms magic realism and magical realism by examining the relationships with other genres such as realism, surrealism, fantastic literature, science fiction and its African version, the animist realism.\n\n====Realism====\n[[Literary realism|Realism]] is an attempt to create a depiction of actual life; a novel does not simply rely on what it presents but ''how'' it presents it.  In this way, a realist narrative acts as framework by which the reader constructs a world using the raw materials of life.  Understanding both realism and magical realism within the realm of a narrative mode is key to understanding both terms.  Magical realism \"relies upon the presentation of real, imagined or magical elements as if they were real.  It relies upon realism, but only so that it can stretch what is acceptable as real to its limits\".<ref>Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 22. New York: Routledge, 2004. Print.</ref> Literary theorist Kornelije Kvas wrote that \"what is created in magic(al) realism works is a fictional world close to reality, marked by a strong presence of the unusual and the fantastic, in order to pint out, among other things, the contradictions and shortcomings of society. The presence of the element of the fantastic does not violate the manifest coherence of a work that is characteristic of traditional realist literature. Fantastic (magical) elements appear as part of everyday reality, function as saviors of the human against the onslaught of conformism, evil and totalitarianism. Moreover, in magical realism works we find objective narration characteristic of traditional, 19th-century realism\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Boundaries of Realism in World Literature|last=Kvas|first=Kornelije|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2019|isbn=978-1-7936-0910-6|location=Lanham, Boulder, New York, London|pages=29}}</ref>\n\nAs a simple point of comparison, Roh's differentiation between expressionism and post-expressionism as described in ''German Art in the 20th Century,'' may be applied to magic realism and realism. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] pertains to the terms \"history\", \"mimetic\", \"familiarization\", \"empiricism/logic\", \"narration\", \"closure-ridden/reductive naturalism\", and \"rationalization/cause and effect\".<ref name=\"Simpkins, Scott 1988\">{{cite journal |last1=Simpkins |first1=Scott |title=Magical Strategies: The Supplement of Realism |journal=Twentieth Century Literature |date=1988 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=140\u2013154 |doi=10.2307/441074 |jstor=441074}}</ref> On the other hand, magic realism encompasses the terms \"myth/legend\", \"fantastic/supplementation\", \"defamiliarization\", \"mysticism/magic\", \"meta-narration\", \"open-ended/expansive romanticism\", and \"imagination/negative capability\".<ref name=\"Simpkins, Scott 1988\"/>\n\n====Surrealism====\n[[Surrealism]] is often confused with magical realism as they both explore illogical or non-realist aspects of humanity and existence. There is a strong historical connection between Franz Roh's concept of magic realism and surrealism, as well as the resulting influence on Carpentier's marvelous reality; however, important differences remain. Surrealism \"is most distanced from magical realism [in that] the aspects that it explores are associated not with material reality but with the imagination and the mind, and in particular it attempts to express the 'inner life' and psychology of humans through art\". It seeks to express the sub-conscious, unconscious, the repressed and inexpressible. Magical realism, on the other hand, rarely presents the extraordinary in the form of a dream or a ''psychological experience''. \"To do so,\" Bowers writes, \"takes the magic of recognizable material reality and places it into the little understood world of the imagination. The ordinariness of magical realism's magic relies on its accepted and unquestioned position in tangible and ''material reality''.\"<ref>Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 22-24. New York: Routledge, 2004. Print.</ref>\n\n====Imaginary realism====\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2015}}\n\"Imaginary realism\" is a term first coined by Dutch painter [[Carel Willink]] as a pendant of magic realism. Where magic realism uses fantastical and unreal elements, imaginary realism strictly uses realistic elements in an imagined scene. As such, the classic painters with their biblical and mythological scenes, can be qualified as 'imaginary realists'. With the increasing availability of photo editing software, also art photographers like [[Karl Hammer]] and others create artistic works in this genre.\n\n====Fabulism====\nFabulism traditionally refers to fables, parables, and myths, and is sometimes used in contemporary contexts for authors whose work falls within or relates to magical realism.\n\nThough often used to refer to works of magical realism, fabulism incorporates fantasy elements into reality, using myths and fables to critique the exterior world and offer direct allegorical interpretations. Austrian-American child psychologist [[Bruno Bettelheim]] suggested that fairy tales have psychological merit. They are used to translate trauma into a context that people can more easily understand and help to process difficult truths. Bettelheim posited that the darkness and morality of traditional fairy tales allowed children to grapple with questions of fear through symbolism. Fabulism helped to work through these complexities and, in the words of Bettelheim, \"make physical what is otherwise ephemeral or ineffable in an attempt...of understanding those things that we struggle the most to talk about: loss, love, transition.\" <ref>{{cite web |last1=Haggard |first1=Kit |title=How a queer fabulism came to dominate contemporary women's writing |url=https://theoutline.com/post/5751/fabulism-fiction-carmen-maria-machado-daisy-johnson-melissa-broder?zd=2&zi=uju7vyr3 |website=theoutline.com |accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Amber Sparks described fabulism as blending fantastical elements into a realistic setting. Crucial to the genre, said Sparks, is that the elements are often borrowed from specific myths, fairy tales, and folktales. Unlike magical realism, it does not just use general magical elements, but directly incorporates details from well known stories. \"Our lives are bizarre, meandering, and fantastic,\" said Hannah Gilham of the ''[[Washington Square Review]]'' regarding fabulism. \"Shouldn't our fiction reflect that?\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gilham |first1=Hannah |title=Discovering the Fabulists: The Value of the Bizarre in Literature |url=http://www.washingtonsquarereview.com/blog/2018/2/7/in-defense-of-the-fantastic-breaking-up-with-realism |website=Washington Square Review |accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile magical realism is traditionally used to refer to works that are Latin American in origin, fabulism is not tied to any specific culture. Rather than focusing on political realities, fabulism tends to focus on the entirety of the human experience through the mechanization of fairy tales and myths.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Capettini |first1=Emily |title=A Second Ribcage: Fiction and an Article on New Wave Fabulism, Trauma, and the Environment |url=https://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/1548306771.html?FMT=AI |website=PQDT Open |publisher=UMI Dissertation Publishing |accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref> This can be seen in the works of [[C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis]], who was once referred to as the greatest fabulist of the 20th century. His 1956 novel ''[[Till We Have Faces]]'' has been referenced as a fabulist retelling. This re-imagining of the story of [[Cupid and Psyche]] uses an age-old myth to impart moralistic knowledge on the reader. A [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] review of a Lewis biography discusses how his work creates \"a fiction\" in order to deliver a lesson. Says the Post of Lewis, \"The fabulist...illuminates the nature of things through a tale both he and his auditors, or readers, know to be an ingenious analogical invention.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kirk |first1=Russell |title=The Faith of a Fabulist |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1990/04/01/the-faith-of-a-fabulist/a855894c-0126-490b-a4a0-ed6b9829978b/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Italo Calvino]] is an example of a writer in the genre who uses the term ''fabulist''. Calvino is best known for his book trilogy, ''Our Ancestors'', a collection of moral tales told through surrealist fantasy. Like many fabulist collections, his work is often classified as allegories for children. Calvino wanted fiction, like folk tales, to act as a teaching device. \"Time and again, Calvino insisted on the 'educational potential' of the fable and its function as a moral exemplum,\" wrote journalist Ian Thomson about the Italian Fabulist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomson |first1=Ian |title=Italo Calvino: a celebration of the fairy king |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/italo-calvino-the-fairy-king/ |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile reviewing the work of Romanian-born American theater director [[Andrei Serban]], ''New York Times'' critic Mel Gussow coined the term \"The New Fabulism.\" Serban is famous for his reinventions in the art of staging and directing, known for directing works like \"The Stag King\" and \"The Serpent Woman,\" both fables adapted into plays by Carl Gozzi. Gussow defined \"The New Fabulism\" as \"taking ancient myths and turn(ing) them into morality tales.\"<ref name=\"Magic World Behind the Curtain\">{{cite book |last1=Menta |first1=Ed |title=Magic World Behind the Curtain |date=1995 |publisher=Peter Lang Publishing |location=New York |pages=89\u2013105}}</ref> In Ed Menta's book, ''The Magic Behind the Curtain'', he explores Serban's work and influence within the context of American theatre. He wrote that the Fabulist style allowed Serban to neatly combine technical form and his own imagination. Through directing fabulist works, Serban can inspire an audience with innate goodness and romanticism through the magic of theatre. \"The New Fabulism has allowed Serban to pursue his own ideals of achieving on sage the naivete of a children's theater,\" wrote Menta. \"It is in this simplicity, this innocence, this magic that Serban finds any hope for contemporary theatre at all.\"<ref name=\"Magic World Behind the Curtain\"/>\n\n====Fantasy====\nProminent English-language fantasy writers have said that \"magic realism\" is only another name for [[fantasy fiction]].

In fantasy, the presence of the supernatural code is perceived as problematic, something that draws special attention&mdash;where in magical realism, the presence of the supernatural is accepted. In fantasy, while authorial reticence creates a disturbing effect on the reader, it works to ''integrate the supernatural'' into the natural framework in magical realism. This integration is made possible in magical realism as the author presents the supernatural as being equally valid to the natural. There is no hierarchy between the two codes.<ref>Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice, ''Magical realism and the fantastic: Resolved versus unresolved antinomy.'' New York: Garland Publishing Inc., 1985. pp. 30-31</ref> The ghost of Melqu\u00edades in M\u00e1rquez's ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' or the baby ghost in Toni Morrison's ''Beloved'' who visit or haunt the inhabitants of their previous residence are both presented by the narrator as ordinary occurrences; the reader, therefore, accepts the marvelous as normal and common.<ref name=Bowers25-27 />\n\nTo Clark Zlotchew, the differentiating factor between the fantastic and magical realism is that in fantastic literature, such as Kafka's ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', there is a hesitation experienced by the protagonist, implied author or reader in deciding whether to attribute natural or supernatural causes to an unsettling event, or between rational or irrational explanations.<ref>Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism.'' New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007. p. 14</ref> Fantastic literature has also been defined as a piece of narrative in which there is a constant faltering between belief and non-belief in the supernatural or extraordinary event.\n\nIn Leal's view, writers of fantasy literature, such as [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]], can create \"new worlds, perhaps new planets. By contrast, writers like Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who use magical realism, don't create new worlds, but suggest the magical in our world.\"<ref name=Leal89 /> In magical realism, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world. This twofold world of magical realism differs from the onefold world that can be found in fairy-tale and fantasy literature.<ref name=Zlotchew15 /> By contrast, in the series \"[[Sorcerous Stabber Orphen]]\" the laws of natural world become a basis for  a naturalistic concept of magic.<ref name=\"Mizuno2019\">{{cite book|last=Mizuno|first=Ryou|title=Sorcerous Stabber Orphen Anthology.

Bower's cites [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' as a novel that exemplifies the science fiction novel's requirement of a \"rational, physical explanation for any unusual occurrences\". Huxley portrays a world where the population is highly controlled with mood enhancing drugs, which are controlled by the government. In this world, there is no link between copulation and reproduction. Humans are produced in giant test tubes, where chemical alterations during gestation determine their fates. Bowers argues that, \"The science fiction narrative's distinct difference from magical realism is that it is set in a world different from any known reality and its realism resides in the fact that we can recognize it as a possibility for our future. Unlike magical realism, it does not have a realistic setting that is recognizable in relation to any past or present reality.\"<ref>Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 29-30.

The novel's protagonist, Tita, is kept from happiness and marriage by her mother. \"Her unrequited love and ostracism from the family lead her to harness her extraordinary powers of imbuing her emotions to the food she makes. In turn, people who eat her food enact her emotions for her. For example, after eating a wedding cake Tita made while suffering from a forbidden love, the guests all suffer from a wave of longing. The Mexican [[Juan Rulfo]] pioneered the exposition through a non-linear structure with his short novel ''[[Pedro P\u00e1ramo]]'' that tells the story of Comala both as a lively town in times of the eponymous Pedro P\u00e1ramo and as a ghost town through the eyes of his son Juan Preciado who returns to Comala to fulfil a promise to his dead mother.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, major authors include British Indian writer [[Salman Rushdie]], African American novelists [[Toni Morrison]] and [[Gloria Naylor]], Latinos, as [[Ana Castillo]], [[Rudolfo Anaya]], [[Daniel Olivas]], and [[Helena Maria Viramontes]], Native American authors [[Louise Erdrich]] and [[Sherman Alexie]]; English author [[Louis de Berni\u00e8res]] and English feminist writer [[Angela Carter]].

Roh explains,\n\n<blockquote>We are offered a new style that is thoroughly of this world that celebrates the mundane. This new world of objects is still alien to the current idea of Realism.

Magical realism, according to Roh, instead faithfully portrays the exterior of an object, and in doing so the spirit, or magic, of the object reveals itself. One could relate this exterior magic all the way back to the 15th century. Flemish painter [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]] (1395\u20131441) highlights the complexity of a natural landscape by creating illusions of continuous and unseen areas that recede into the background, leaving it to the viewer's imagination to fill in those gaps in the image: for instance, in a rolling landscape with river and hills.

It is sometimes called '''fabulism''', in reference to the conventions of [[fable]]s, [[myth]]s, and [[allegory]]. \"Magical realism\", perhaps the most common term, often refers to fiction and literature in particular,<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|1\u20135}} with [[magic in fiction|magic]] or the [[supernatural]] presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane [[setting (narrative)|setting]], commonly seen in novels and dramatic performances.

In [[Bengali literature]], prominent writers of magic realism include [[Nabarun Bhattacharya]], [[Akhteruzzaman Elias]], [[Shahidul Zahir]], [[Jibanananda Das]], [[Syed Waliullah]], [[Nasreen Jahan]] and [[Humayun Ahmed]]. In [[Japanese literature]], one of the most important authors of this genre is [[Haruki Murakami]].

However, in contrast with its use in literature, magic realist art does not often include overtly fantastic or magical content, but rather looks at the mundane through a hyper-realistic and often mysterious lens.<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />\n\nGerman magic realist paintings influenced the Italian writer [[Massimo Bontempelli]], who has been called the first to apply magic realism to writing, aiming to capture the fantastic, mysterious nature of reality. In 1926 he founded the magic realist magazine ''900.Novecento,'' and his writings influenced Belgian magic realist writers [[Johan Daisne]] and [[Hubert Lampo]].<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|13\u201314}}\n\nRoh's magic realism also influenced writers in Hispanic America, where it was translated as ''realismo m\u00e1gico'' in 1927. Venezuelan writer [[Arturo Uslar-Pietri]], who had known Bontempelli, wrote influential magic realist short stories in the 1930s and 40s that focused on the mystery and reality of how we live.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>{{rp|14\u201315}} Luis Leal attests that Pietri seemed to have been the first to adopt the term ''realismo m\u00e1gico'' in Hispanic America in 1948.<ref>Leal, Luis, \"Magical Realism in Spanish America\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 120.</ref> There is evidence that Mexican writer Elena Garro used the same term to describe the works of [[E.

Every text is different and employs a smattering of the qualities listed here. However, they accurately portray what one might expect from a magic realist text.\n\n====Fantastical elements====\nMagical realism portrays fantastical events in an otherwise realistic tone. It brings fables, folk tales, and myths into contemporary social relevance. Fantasy traits given to characters, such as levitation, telepathy, and telekinesis, help to encompass modern political realities that can be phantasmagorical.<ref>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms, 3rd ed., 2008</ref>\n\n====Real-world setting====\nThe existence of fantasy elements in the real world provides the basis for magical realism. Writers do not invent new worlds but reveal the magical in this world, as was done by [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], who wrote the seminal work ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''.<ref name=Leal89>Garc\u00eda, ''Leal'', p. 89.</ref> In the world of magical realism, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world.<ref name=Zlotchew15>Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism.'' New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007. p. 15</ref>\n\n====Authorial reticence====\nAuthorial reticence is the \"deliberate withholding of information and explanations about the disconcerting fictitious world\".<ref>Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice. Magical Realism and the Fantastic: Resolved versus Unresolved Antinomy. New York: Garland Publishing Inc., 1985. pg. 16</ref> The narrator is indifferent, a characteristic enhanced by this absence of explanation of fantastic events; the story proceeds with \"logical precision\" as if nothing extraordinary had taken place.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |last1=Flores |first1=Angel |title=Magical Realism in Spanish American Fiction |journal=Hispania |date=May 1955 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=187\u2013192 |doi=10.2307/335812 |jstor=335812}}</ref><ref>Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice.

The reader would consequently disregard the supernatural as false testimony.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Plenitude====\nIn his essay \"The Baroque and the Marvelous Real\", [[Cubans|Cuban]] writer [[Alejo Carpentier]] defined the [[baroque]] by a lack of emptiness, a departure from structure or rules, and an \"extraordinary\" abundance (plenitude) of disorienting detail (citing [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] as its opposite). From this angle, Carpentier views the baroque as a layering of elements, which translates easily into the post-colonial or transcultural Latin American atmosphere that he emphasizes in ''[[The Kingdom of this World]]''.<ref>Carpentier, Alejo, ''El Reino de este Mundo''</ref> \"America, a continent of symbiosis, mutations... [[mestizaje]], engenders the baroque\",<ref>Carpentier, Alejo, \"The baroque and the marvelous real\" from ''MR: Theory History, Community''</ref> made explicit by elaborate Aztec temples and associative Nahuatl poetry. These mixing ethnicities grow together with the American baroque; the space in between is where the \"marvelous real\" is seen. Marvelous: not meaning beautiful and pleasant, but extraordinary, strange, and excellent. Such a complex system of layering\u2014encompassed in the Latin American \"boom\" novel, such as ''One Hundred Years of Solitude''\u2014aims towards \"translating the scope of America\".<ref>Carpentier, Alejo, \"The baroque and the marvelous real\" from ''Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community'', pp.107</ref>\n\n====Hybridity====\nMagical realism plot lines characteristically employ hybrid multiple planes of reality that take place in \"inharmonious arenas of such opposites as urban and rural, and Western and indigenous\".<ref name=\"Post Colonial Studies at Emory\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/MagicalRealism.html\n |title       = Post Colonial Studies at Emory\n |year        = 1998\n |accessdate  = June 18, 2009\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090620034827/http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/MagicalRealism.html\n |archivedate = June 20, 2009\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Daniel, Lee A 1982\">{{cite journal |last1=Daniel |first1=Lee A. |title=Realismo M\u00e1gico: True Realism with a Pinch of Magic |journal=The South Central Bulletin |date=1982 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=129\u2013130 |doi=10.2307/3188273 |jstor=3188273}}</ref>\n\n====Metafiction====\n{{main|Metafiction}}\n\nThis trait centers on the reader's role in literature. With its multiple realities and specific reference to the reader's world, it explores the impact fiction has on reality, reality on fiction and the reader's role in between; as such, it is well suited for drawing attention to social or political criticism. Furthermore, it is the tool paramount in the execution of a related and major magic realist phenomenon: textualization. This term defines two conditions&mdash;first, where a fictitious reader enters the [[story within a story]] while reading it, making them self-conscious of their status as readers&mdash;and secondly, where the textual world enters into the reader's (real) world. Good sense would negate this process but \"magic\" is the flexible convention that allows it.<ref>Thiem, Jon, \"The Textualization of the Reader in Magical Realist Fiction\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref>\n\n====Heightened awareness of mystery====\nSomething that most critics agree on is this major theme. Magic realist literature tends to read at an intensified level. Taking ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', the reader must let go of pre-existing ties to conventional [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], plot advancement, linear time structure, scientific reason, etc., to strive for a state of heightened awareness of life's connectedness or hidden meanings. Luis Leal articulates this feeling as \"to seize the mystery that breathes behind things\",<ref>Leal, Luis, \"Magical Realism in Spanish American Literature,\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> and supports the claim by saying a writer must heighten his senses to the point of \"estado limite\" (translated as \"limit state\" or \"extreme\") in order to realize all levels of reality, most importantly that of mystery.<ref>Carpentier, Alejo, \"On the Marvelous Real in America\", the Introduction to his novel, ''The Kingdom of this World''</ref>\n\n====Political critique====\nMagic realism contains an \"implicit criticism of society, particularly the elite\".<ref>{{cite web\n |publisher   = University of Texas Press\n |url         = http://www-english.tamu.edu/pers/fac/andreadis/474H_ahapw/Definition_Magic.Realism.html\n |title       = Twentieth-Century Spanish American Literature\n |year        = 194\n |accessdate  = June 18, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227034359/http://www-english.tamu.edu/pers/fac/andreadis/474H_ahapw/Definition_Magic.Realism.html\n |archivedate = February 27, 2009\n}}</ref> Especially with regard to Latin America, the style breaks from the inarguable discourse of \"privileged centers of literature\".<ref>D'haen, Theo, \"Magical realism and postmodernism: decentering privileged centers\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> This is a mode primarily about and for \"ex-centrics\": the geographically, socially and economically marginalized. Therefore, magic realism's \"alternative world\" works to correct the reality of established viewpoints (like realism, naturalism, modernism). Magic realist texts, under this logic, are subversive texts, revolutionary against socially dominant forces. Alternatively, the socially dominant may implement magical realism to disassociate themselves from their \"[[power discourse]]\".<ref>D'haen, Theo, \"Magical realism and postmodernism: decentering privileged centers\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 195</ref> Theo D'haen calls this change in perspective \"decentering\".\n\nIn his review of Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez' novel ''[[Chronicle of a Death Foretold]]'', [[Salman Rushdie]] argues that the formal experiment of magic realism allows political ideas to be expressed in ways that might not be possible through more established literary forms:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Juul|first1=Jesper|title=Are Game Experiments Apolitical?

It deals with what Naipaul has called \"half-made\" societies, in which the impossibly old struggles against the appallingly new, in which public corruptions and private anguishes are somehow more garish and extreme than they ever get in the so-called \"North\", where centuries of wealth and power have formed thick layers over the surface of what's really going on. In the works of M\u00e1rquez, as in the world he describes, impossible things happen constantly, and quite plausibly, out in the open under the midday sun.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rushdie|first1=Salman|title=Imaginary Homelands: Essays and Criticism 1981-1991|date=1991|publisher=Granta Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-670-83952-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Origins===\nLiterary magic realism originated in Latin America. Writers often traveled between their home country and European cultural hubs, such as Paris or Berlin, and were influenced by the art movement of the time.<ref name=\"Faris, Wendy B pp. 3-4\"/><ref>Carpentier, Alejo: \"The Baroque and the Marvelous Real (1975)\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> Cuban writer [[Alejo Carpentier]] and Venezuelan [[Arturo Uslar-Pietri]], for example, were strongly influenced by European artistic movements, such as [[Surrealism]], during their stays in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/> One major event that linked painterly and literary magic realisms was the translation and publication of Franz Roh's book into Spanish by Spain's ''Revista de Occidente'' in 1927, headed by major literary figure [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]]. \"Within a year, Magic Realism was being applied to the prose of European authors in the literary circles of Buenos Aires.\"<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />{{rp|61}} [[Jorge Luis Borges]] inspired and encouraged other Latin American writers in the development of magical realism \u2013 particularly with his first magical realist publication, ''[[Historia universal de la infamia]]'' in 1935.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Between 1940 and 1950, magical realism in Latin America reached its peak, with prominent writers appearing mainly in Argentina.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nThe theoretical implications of visual art's magic realism greatly influenced European and Latin American literature. Italian [[Massimo Bontempelli]], for instance, claimed that [[literature]] could be a means to create a collective consciousness by \"opening new mythical and magical perspectives on reality\", and used his writings to inspire an Italian nation governed by [[Fascism]].<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/> Pietri was closely associated with Roh's form of magic realism and knew Bontempelli in Paris. Rather than follow Carpentier's developing versions of \"the (Latin) American marvelous real\", Uslar-Pietri's writings emphasize \"the mystery of human living amongst the reality of life\". He believed magic realism was \"a continuation of the '''vanguardia''' [or [[avant-garde]]] modernist experimental writings of Latin America\".<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/>\n\n===Major topics in criticism===\n\n====Ambiguities in definition====\nMexican critic [[Luis Leal (writer)|Luis Leal]] summed up the difficulty of defining magical realism by writing, \"If you can explain it, then it's not magical realism.\"<ref>Garc\u00eda, ''Leal'', p. 127\u2013128</ref> He offers his own definition by writing, \"Without thinking of the concept of magical realism, each writer gives expression to a reality he observes in the people. To me, magical realism is an attitude on the part of the characters in the novel toward the world,\" or toward nature.\n\nLeal and Guenther both quote [[Arturo Uslar-Pietri]], who described \"man as a mystery surrounded by realistic facts. A poetic prediction or a poetic denial of reality. What for lack of another name could be called a magical realism.\"<ref>Pietri, Arturo Uslar, ''Letras y hombres de Venezuela''. Mexico City, Fondo de Cultura Economica: 1949. pp. 161-61</ref> It is worth noting that Pietri, in presenting his term for this literary tendency, always kept its definition open by means of a language more lyrical and evocative than strictly critical, as in this 1948 statement. When academic critics attempted to define magical realism with scholarly exactitude, they discovered that it was more powerful than precise. Critics, frustrated by their inability to pin down the term's meaning, have urged its complete abandonment. Yet in Pietri's vague, ample usage, magical realism was wildly successful in summarizing for many readers their perception of much Latin American fiction; this fact suggests that the term has its uses, so long as it is not expected to function with the precision expected of technical, scholarly terminology.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Western and native worldviews====\nThe critical perspective towards magical realism as a conflict between reality and abnormality stems from the Western reader's disassociation with [[mythology]], a root of magical realism more easily understood by non-Western cultures.<ref name=\"Faris, Wendy B pp. 3-4\">Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to ''Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 3-4</ref> Western confusion regarding magical realism is due to the \"conception of the real\" created in a magical realist text: rather than explain reality using natural or physical laws, as in typical Western texts, magical realist texts create a reality \"in which the relation between incidents, characters, and setting could not be based upon or justified by their status within the physical world or their normal acceptance by bourgeois mentality\".<ref>Angel Flores, qtd. in {{citation|last= Simpkins |first= Scott |title= Magical Strategies: The Supplement of Realism |journal = Twentieth Century Literature |volume= 34 |number= 2 |year= 1988 |pages= 140\u2013154 |jstor= 441074 |doi=10.2307/441074}}, p. 142</ref>\n\nGuatemalan author [[William Spindler]]'s article, \"Magic realism: a typology\",<ref>Spindler, W. \"Magic realism: a typology\", Forum for Modern Language Studies. (1993) Vol. xxxix No. 1</ref> suggests that there are three kinds of magic realism, which however are by no means incompatible: European \"metaphysical\" magic realism, with its sense of estrangement and the uncanny, exemplified by [[Kafka]]'s fiction; \"ontological\" magical realism, characterized by \"matter-of-factness\" in relating \"inexplicable\" events; and \"anthropological\" magical realism, where a Native worldview is set side by side with the Western rational worldview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/225960/3/French,%20M.,%20Jackson,%20S.%20Jokisuu,%20E.%20(2010)%20'Diverse%20Engagement%20-%20Drawing%20in%20the%20Margins'%20online%20edition-3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119235615/http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/225960/3/French,%20M.,%20Jackson,%20S.%20Jokisuu,%20E.%20(2010)%20'Diverse%20Engagement%20-%20Drawing%20in%20the%20Margins'%20online%20edition-3.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-19 }}</ref> Spindler's typology of magic realism has been criticized as \"an act of categorization which seeks to define Magic Realism as a culturally specific project, by identifying for his readers those (non-modern) societies where myth and magic persist and where Magic Realism might be expected to occur. There are objections to this analysis. Western rationalism models may not actually describe Western modes of thinking and it is possible to conceive of instances where both orders of knowledge are simultaneously possible.\"<ref>Liam Connell , \"Discarding Magic Realism: Modernism, Anthropology, and Critical Practice\", in ARIEL, Vol. 29, No. 2, April, 1998, pp. 95-110.</ref>\n\n====Lo real maravilloso====\n[[Alejo Carpentier]] originated the term ''lo real maravilloso'' (roughly \"the marvelous real\") in the prologue to his novel ''[[The Kingdom of this World]]'' (1949); however, some debate whether he is truly a magical realist writer, or simply a precursor and source of inspiration. Maggie Bowers claims he is widely acknowledged as the originator of Latin American magical realism (as both a novelist and critic);<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/> she describes Carpentier's conception as a kind of heightened reality where elements of the miraculous can appear while seeming natural and unforced. She suggests that by disassociating himself and his writings from Roh's painterly magic realism, Carpentier aimed to show how&mdash;by virtue of Latin America's varied history, geography, demography, politics, myths, and beliefs&mdash;improbable and marvelous things are made possible.<ref name=\"Bowers, Maggie A. 2004\"/> Furthermore, Carpentier's meaning is that Latin America is a land filled with marvels, and that \"writing about this land automatically produces a literature of marvelous reality\".<ref>Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism.'' New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alejocarpentier.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Alejo Carpentier]]\n\n\"The marvelous\" may be easily confused with magical realism, as both modes introduce supernatural events without surprising the implied author. In both, these magical events are expected and accepted as everyday occurrences. However, the marvelous world is a unidimensional world. The implied author believes that anything can happen here, as the entire world is filled with supernatural beings and situations to begin with. Fairy tales are a good example of marvelous literature. The important idea in defining the marvelous is that readers understand that this fictional world is different from the world where they live. The \"marvelous\" one-dimensional world differs from the ''bidimensional'' world of magical realism, as in the latter, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world (arriving at the combination of ''two'' layers of reality: bidimensional).<ref name=Zlotchew15 /> While some use the terms magical realism and lo real maravilloso interchangeably, the key difference lies in the focus.<ref>Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism''. New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007. p. 11</ref>\n\nCritic [[Luis Leal (writer)|Luis Leal]] attests that Carpentier was an originating pillar of the magical realist style by implicitly referring to the latter's critical works, writing that \"The existence of the marvelous real is what started magical realist literature, which some critics claim is ''the'' truly American literature\".<ref>Leal, Luis, \"Magical Realism in Spanish America\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 122</ref> It can consequently be drawn that Carpentier's \"lo real maravilloso\" is especially distinct from ''magical realism'' by the fact that the former applies specifically to ''America''.<ref name=\"Daniel, Lee A 1982\"/> On that note, Lee A. Daniel categorizes critics of Carpentier into three groups: those that do not consider him a magical realist whatsoever (\u00c1ngel Flores), those that call him \"a m\u00e1gicorealista writer with no mention of his \"lo real maravilloso\" (G\u00f3mez Gil, Jean Franco, Carlos Fuentes)\", and those that use the two terms interchangeably (Fernando Alegria, Luis Leal, Emir Rodriguez Monegal).<ref name=\"Daniel, Lee A 1982\"/>\n\n====Latin American exclusivity====\nCriticism that Latin America is the birthplace and cornerstone of all things magic realist is quite common. \u00c1ngel Flores does not deny that magical realism is an international commodity but articulates that it has a Hispanic birthplace, writing that \"Magical realism is a continuation of the romantic realist tradition of Spanish language literature and its European counterparts.\"<ref>Flores, Angel, \"Magical Realism in Spanish America\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> Flores is not alone on this front; there is argument between those who see magical realism as a Latin American invention and those who see it as the global product of a [[postmodern]] world.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> Guenther concludes, \"Conjecture aside, it is in Latin America that [magic realism] was primarily seized by literary criticism and was, through translation and literary appropriation, transformed.\"<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />{{rp|61}} Magic realism has taken on an internationalization: dozens of non-Hispanic writers are categorized as such, and many believe that it truly ''is'' an international commodity.<ref>Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to MR: Theory, History, Community, pp. 4 and 8</ref>\n\nThe Hispanic Origin Theory: If considering all citations given in this article, there are issues with Guenther's and other critic's \"Hispanic origin theory\" and conclusion. By admission of this article, the term \"magical realism\" first came into artistic usage in 1927 by German critic Franz Roh after the 1915 publication of Franz Kafka's novella \"[[The Metamorphosis]]\", both visual and literary representations and uses of magic realism, regardless of suffix nitpicking.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Russian author, Nikolai Gogol and his story \"The Nose\" (1835), is also a predecessor to the Hispanic origin theory. All this further called into question by Borges' critical standing as a true magical realist versus a predecessor to magic realism and how the dates of publications between Hispanic and European works compare.  Magic realism has certainly enjoyed a \"golden era\" in the Hispanic communities. It cannot be denied that Hispanic communities, Argentina in particular, have supported great movements and talents in magic realism. One could validly suggest that the height of magic realism has been seen in Latin American countries, though, feminist readers might disagree. Virginia Woolf, Angela Carter, Toni Morrison and Charlotte Perkins Gilman being excellent critical challenges to this notion of Hispanic magic realism as a full and diversely aware aesthetic. Allende being a later contribution to this gender aware discourse. Frida Kahlo, of course, being important to this as well but also at a later date than Woolf and Gilman. This feminist mapping, however, is unnecessary in identifying a basic truth. Kafka and Gogol predate Borges. They may each have their own forms of magic realism, but they are each by the broader definition solidly within this article's given identification: \"a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe....\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThis issue of feminist study in magic realism and its origination is an important discourse, as well. It should not be ignored. Given that magic realism, by nature of its craft, allows underrepresented and minority voices to be heard in more subtle and representational contexts, magic realism may be one of the better forms available to authors and artists who are expressing unpopular scenarios in socio-political contexts. Again, Woolf, Allende, Kahlo, Carter, Morrison and Gilman being excellent examples of diversity in gender and ethnicity in magic realism. To this end, Hispanic origin theory does not hold.\n\nGender diversity aside, magic realism's foundational beginnings are much more diverse and intricate than what the Hispanic origin theory would suggest as defined in this article. Early in the article, we read a broader definition:  \"[magic realism is] what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe...\" This \"too strange to believe\" standard being relative to European aesthetics\u2014i.e. Woolf's, Kafka's and Gogol's work. Later, we read another definition and seeming precedent to the Hispanic origin theory: \"Magical realism is a continuation of the romantic realist tradition of Spanish language literature.\" This \"continuation\" is a subset of a broader magic realism definition and standard. The Hispanic \"continuation\" and \"romantic realist tradition of Spanish language\" subset certainly identifies why magic realism took root and further developed in Hispanic communities, but it does not set a precedent for ground zero origination or ownership purely in Hispanic cultures. Magic realism originated in Germany as much as it did in Latin American countries. Both can claim their more specific aesthetics, but to identify the broader term of magic realism as being Hispanic is merely a theory unsupported by the citations within this article. Perhaps it is time to identify each as its own as part of a broader and less biased umbrella.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMagic realism is a continued craft in the many countries that have contributed to it in its earliest stages. Germany being first and Latin American countries being a close second. There are certainly differences in aesthetics between European and Hispanic magic realists, but they are both equally magic realists. For this reason, the Hispanic magic realists should really have proper designation as such but not the overarching umbrella of the broader term as this article suggests.<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />\n\n====Postmodernism====\nTaking into account that, theoretically, magical realism was born in the 20th century, some have argued that connecting it to postmodernism is a logical next step. To further connect the two concepts, there are descriptive commonalities between the two that Belgian critic Theo D'haen addresses in his essay, \"Magical Realism and Postmodernism\". While authors such as [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], [[Peter Handke]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[John Fowles]], [[Angela Carter]], [[John Banville]], [[Michel Tournier]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Willem Brakman]] and [[Louis Ferron]] might be widely considered postmodernist, they can \"just as easily be categorized ... magic realist\".<ref>D'haen, Theo L., \"Magical realism and postmodernism\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 193</ref> A list has been compiled of characteristics one might typically attribute to postmodernism, but that also could describe literary magic realism: \"self-reflexiveness, metafiction, eclecticism, redundancy, multiplicity, discontinuity, intertextuality, parody, the dissolution of character and narrative instance, the erasure of boundaries, and the destabilization of the reader\".<ref>D'haen, Theo L., \"Magical realism and postmodernism\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 192-3 [D'haen references many texts that attest to these qualities]</ref> To further connect the two, magical realism and postmodernism share the themes of post-colonial discourse, in which jumps in time and focus cannot really be explained with scientific but rather with magical reasoning; textualization (of the reader); and metafiction.\n\nConcerning attitude toward audience, the two have, some argue, a lot in common. Magical realist works do not seek to primarily satisfy a popular audience, but instead, a sophisticated audience that must be attuned to noticing textual \"subtleties\".<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> While the postmodern writer condemns escapist literature (like fantasy, crime, ghost fiction), he/she is inextricably related to it concerning readership. There are two modes in [[postmodern literature]]: one, commercially successful pop fiction, and the other, philosophy, better suited to intellectuals. A singular reading of the first mode will render a distorted or reductive understanding of the text. The fictitious reader&mdash;such as Aureliano from ''100 Years of Solitude''&mdash;is the hostage used to express the writer's anxiety on this issue of who is reading the work and to what ends, and of how the writer is forever reliant upon the needs and desires of readers (the market).<ref>Thiem, Jon, \"The textualization of the reader in magical realist fiction\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''</ref> The magic realist writer with difficulty must reach a balance between saleability and intellectual integrity. Wendy Faris, talking about magic realism as a contemporary phenomenon that leaves modernism for postmodernism, says, \"Magic realist fictions do seem more youthful and popular than their modernist predecessors, in that they often (though not always) cater with unidirectional story lines to our basic desire to hear what happens next. Thus they may be more clearly designed for the entertainment of readers.\"<ref>Wendy Faris, \"Scheherezade's Children: Magical Realism and Postmodern Fiction,\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 163</ref>\n\n===Comparison with related genres===\nWhen attempting to define what something ''is'', it is often helpful to define what something is ''not''. Many literary critics attempt to classify novels and literary works in only one genre, such as \"romantic\" or \"naturalist\", not always taking into account that many works fall into multiple categories.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>  Much discussion is cited from Maggie Ann Bowers' book ''Magic(al) Realism'', wherein she attempts to delimit the terms magic realism and magical realism by examining the relationships with other genres such as realism, surrealism, fantastic literature, science fiction and its African version, the animist realism.\n\n====Realism====\n[[Literary realism|Realism]] is an attempt to create a depiction of actual life; a novel does not simply rely on what it presents but ''how'' it presents it.  In this way, a realist narrative acts as framework by which the reader constructs a world using the raw materials of life.  Understanding both realism and magical realism within the realm of a narrative mode is key to understanding both terms.  Magical realism \"relies upon the presentation of real, imagined or magical elements as if they were real.  It relies upon realism, but only so that it can stretch what is acceptable as real to its limits\".<ref>Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 22. New York: Routledge, 2004. Print.</ref> Literary theorist Kornelije Kvas wrote that \"what is created in magic(al) realism works is a fictional world close to reality, marked by a strong presence of the unusual and the fantastic, in order to pint out, among other things, the contradictions and shortcomings of society. The presence of the element of the fantastic does not violate the manifest coherence of a work that is characteristic of traditional realist literature. Fantastic (magical) elements appear as part of everyday reality, function as saviors of the human against the onslaught of conformism, evil and totalitarianism. Moreover, in magical realism works we find objective narration characteristic of traditional, 19th-century realism\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Boundaries of Realism in World Literature|last=Kvas|first=Kornelije|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2019|isbn=978-1-7936-0910-6|location=Lanham, Boulder, New York, London|pages=29}}</ref>\n\nAs a simple point of comparison, Roh's differentiation between expressionism and post-expressionism as described in ''German Art in the 20th Century,'' may be applied to magic realism and realism. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] pertains to the terms \"history\", \"mimetic\", \"familiarization\", \"empiricism/logic\", \"narration\", \"closure-ridden/reductive naturalism\", and \"rationalization/cause and effect\".<ref name=\"Simpkins, Scott 1988\">{{cite journal |last1=Simpkins |first1=Scott |title=Magical Strategies: The Supplement of Realism |journal=Twentieth Century Literature |date=1988 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=140\u2013154 |doi=10.2307/441074 |jstor=441074}}</ref> On the other hand, magic realism encompasses the terms \"myth/legend\", \"fantastic/supplementation\", \"defamiliarization\", \"mysticism/magic\", \"meta-narration\", \"open-ended/expansive romanticism\", and \"imagination/negative capability\".<ref name=\"Simpkins, Scott 1988\"/>\n\n====Surrealism====\n[[Surrealism]] is often confused with magical realism as they both explore illogical or non-realist aspects of humanity and existence. There is a strong historical connection between Franz Roh's concept of magic realism and surrealism, as well as the resulting influence on Carpentier's marvelous reality; however, important differences remain. Surrealism \"is most distanced from magical realism [in that] the aspects that it explores are associated not with material reality but with the imagination and the mind, and in particular it attempts to express the 'inner life' and psychology of humans through art\". It seeks to express the sub-conscious, unconscious, the repressed and inexpressible. Magical realism, on the other hand, rarely presents the extraordinary in the form of a dream or a ''psychological experience''. \"To do so,\" Bowers writes, \"takes the magic of recognizable material reality and places it into the little understood world of the imagination. The ordinariness of magical realism's magic relies on its accepted and unquestioned position in tangible and ''material reality''.\"<ref>Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 22-24. New York: Routledge, 2004. Print.</ref>\n\n====Imaginary realism====\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2015}}\n\"Imaginary realism\" is a term first coined by Dutch painter [[Carel Willink]] as a pendant of magic realism. Where magic realism uses fantastical and unreal elements, imaginary realism strictly uses realistic elements in an imagined scene. As such, the classic painters with their biblical and mythological scenes, can be qualified as 'imaginary realists'. With the increasing availability of photo editing software, also art photographers like [[Karl Hammer]] and others create artistic works in this genre.\n\n====Fabulism====\nFabulism traditionally refers to fables, parables, and myths, and is sometimes used in contemporary contexts for authors whose work falls within or relates to magical realism.\n\nThough often used to refer to works of magical realism, fabulism incorporates fantasy elements into reality, using myths and fables to critique the exterior world and offer direct allegorical interpretations. Austrian-American child psychologist [[Bruno Bettelheim]] suggested that fairy tales have psychological merit. They are used to translate trauma into a context that people can more easily understand and help to process difficult truths. Bettelheim posited that the darkness and morality of traditional fairy tales allowed children to grapple with questions of fear through symbolism. Fabulism helped to work through these complexities and, in the words of Bettelheim, \"make physical what is otherwise ephemeral or ineffable in an attempt...of understanding those things that we struggle the most to talk about: loss, love, transition.\" <ref>{{cite web |last1=Haggard |first1=Kit |title=How a queer fabulism came to dominate contemporary women's writing |url=https://theoutline.com/post/5751/fabulism-fiction-carmen-maria-machado-daisy-johnson-melissa-broder?zd=2&zi=uju7vyr3 |website=theoutline.com |accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Amber Sparks described fabulism as blending fantastical elements into a realistic setting. Crucial to the genre, said Sparks, is that the elements are often borrowed from specific myths, fairy tales, and folktales. Unlike magical realism, it does not just use general magical elements, but directly incorporates details from well known stories. \"Our lives are bizarre, meandering, and fantastic,\" said Hannah Gilham of the ''[[Washington Square Review]]'' regarding fabulism. \"Shouldn't our fiction reflect that?\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gilham |first1=Hannah |title=Discovering the Fabulists: The Value of the Bizarre in Literature |url=http://www.washingtonsquarereview.com/blog/2018/2/7/in-defense-of-the-fantastic-breaking-up-with-realism |website=Washington Square Review |accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile magical realism is traditionally used to refer to works that are Latin American in origin, fabulism is not tied to any specific culture. Rather than focusing on political realities, fabulism tends to focus on the entirety of the human experience through the mechanization of fairy tales and myths.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Capettini |first1=Emily |title=A Second Ribcage: Fiction and an Article on New Wave Fabulism, Trauma, and the Environment |url=https://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/1548306771.html?FMT=AI |website=PQDT Open |publisher=UMI Dissertation Publishing |accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref> This can be seen in the works of [[C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis]], who was once referred to as the greatest fabulist of the 20th century. His 1956 novel ''[[Till We Have Faces]]'' has been referenced as a fabulist retelling. This re-imagining of the story of [[Cupid and Psyche]] uses an age-old myth to impart moralistic knowledge on the reader. A [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] review of a Lewis biography discusses how his work creates \"a fiction\" in order to deliver a lesson. Says the Post of Lewis, \"The fabulist...illuminates the nature of things through a tale both he and his auditors, or readers, know to be an ingenious analogical invention.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kirk |first1=Russell |title=The Faith of a Fabulist |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1990/04/01/the-faith-of-a-fabulist/a855894c-0126-490b-a4a0-ed6b9829978b/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Italo Calvino]] is an example of a writer in the genre who uses the term ''fabulist''. Calvino is best known for his book trilogy, ''Our Ancestors'', a collection of moral tales told through surrealist fantasy. Like many fabulist collections, his work is often classified as allegories for children. Calvino wanted fiction, like folk tales, to act as a teaching device. \"Time and again, Calvino insisted on the 'educational potential' of the fable and its function as a moral exemplum,\" wrote journalist Ian Thomson about the Italian Fabulist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomson |first1=Ian |title=Italo Calvino: a celebration of the fairy king |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/italo-calvino-the-fairy-king/ |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile reviewing the work of Romanian-born American theater director [[Andrei Serban]], ''New York Times'' critic Mel Gussow coined the term \"The New Fabulism.\" Serban is famous for his reinventions in the art of staging and directing, known for directing works like \"The Stag King\" and \"The Serpent Woman,\" both fables adapted into plays by Carl Gozzi. Gussow defined \"The New Fabulism\" as \"taking ancient myths and turn(ing) them into morality tales.\"<ref name=\"Magic World Behind the Curtain\">{{cite book |last1=Menta |first1=Ed |title=Magic World Behind the Curtain |date=1995 |publisher=Peter Lang Publishing |location=New York |pages=89\u2013105}}</ref> In Ed Menta's book, ''The Magic Behind the Curtain'', he explores Serban's work and influence within the context of American theatre. He wrote that the Fabulist style allowed Serban to neatly combine technical form and his own imagination. Through directing fabulist works, Serban can inspire an audience with innate goodness and romanticism through the magic of theatre. \"The New Fabulism has allowed Serban to pursue his own ideals of achieving on sage the naivete of a children's theater,\" wrote Menta. \"It is in this simplicity, this innocence, this magic that Serban finds any hope for contemporary theatre at all.\"<ref name=\"Magic World Behind the Curtain\"/>\n\n====Fantasy====\nProminent English-language fantasy writers have said that \"magic realism\" is only another name for [[fantasy fiction]]. [[Gene Wolfe]] said, \"magic realism is fantasy written by people who speak Spanish\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Wolfe | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Wolfe |author2=Baber, Brendan | chapter = Gene Wolfe Interview | editor = Wright, Peter | title = Shadows of the New Sun: Wolfe on Writing/Writers on Wolfe | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MkPfjCVo3g4C&pg=PA132 | accessdate = 2009-01-20| isbn = 9781846310577 | year = 2007 }}</ref> and [[Terry Pratchett]] said magic realism \"is like a polite way of saying you write fantasy\".<ref>{{cite web\n |publisher   = januarymagazine.com\n |url         = http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/tpratchett2002.html\n |title       = Terry Pratchett by Linda Richards\n |year        = 2002\n |accessdate  = February 17, 2008\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217212623/http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/tpratchett2002.html\n |archivedate = December 17, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Amaryll Beatrice Chanady distinguishes magical realist literature from fantasy literature (\"the fantastic\") based on differences between three shared dimensions: the use of [[antinomy]] (the simultaneous presence of two conflicting codes), the inclusion of events that cannot be integrated into a logical framework, and the use of authorial reticence. In fantasy, the presence of the supernatural code is perceived as problematic, something that draws special attention&mdash;where in magical realism, the presence of the supernatural is accepted. In fantasy, while authorial reticence creates a disturbing effect on the reader, it works to ''integrate the supernatural'' into the natural framework in magical realism. This integration is made possible in magical realism as the author presents the supernatural as being equally valid to the natural. There is no hierarchy between the two codes.<ref>Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice, ''Magical realism and the fantastic: Resolved versus unresolved antinomy.'' New York: Garland Publishing Inc., 1985. pp. 30-31</ref> The ghost of Melqu\u00edades in M\u00e1rquez's ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' or the baby ghost in Toni Morrison's ''Beloved'' who visit or haunt the inhabitants of their previous residence are both presented by the narrator as ordinary occurrences; the reader, therefore, accepts the marvelous as normal and common.<ref name=Bowers25-27 />\n\nTo Clark Zlotchew, the differentiating factor between the fantastic and magical realism is that in fantastic literature, such as Kafka's ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', there is a hesitation experienced by the protagonist, implied author or reader in deciding whether to attribute natural or supernatural causes to an unsettling event, or between rational or irrational explanations.<ref>Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism.'' New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007. p. 14</ref> Fantastic literature has also been defined as a piece of narrative in which there is a constant faltering between belief and non-belief in the supernatural or extraordinary event.\n\nIn Leal's view, writers of fantasy literature, such as [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]], can create \"new worlds, perhaps new planets. By contrast, writers like Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who use magical realism, don't create new worlds, but suggest the magical in our world.\"<ref name=Leal89 /> In magical realism, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world. This twofold world of magical realism differs from the onefold world that can be found in fairy-tale and fantasy literature.<ref name=Zlotchew15 /> By contrast, in the series \"[[Sorcerous Stabber Orphen]]\" the laws of natural world become a basis for  a naturalistic concept of magic.<ref name=\"Mizuno2019\">{{cite book|last=Mizuno|first=Ryou|title=Sorcerous Stabber Orphen Anthology.

Aveiro, Portugal, 2014. p.p. 73-79</ref>\n\nThe term was used by [[Pepetela]] (1989)<ref>PEPETELA (1989). Lueji, o nascimento de um imp\u00e9rio. Porto, Portugal: Uni\u00e3o dos Escritores Angolanos.</ref> and Harry Garuba (2003)<ref>GARUBA, Harry (2003).Explorations in Animist Materialism: Notes on Reading/Writing African Literature, Culture, and Society. Public Culture</ref> to be a new conception of magic realism in African literature.\n\n==== Science fiction ====\nWhile [[science fiction]] and magical realism both bend the notion of what is real, toy with human imagination, and are forms of (often fantastical) fiction, they differ greatly. Bower's cites [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' as a novel that exemplifies the science fiction novel's requirement of a \"rational, physical explanation for any unusual occurrences\". Huxley portrays a world where the population is highly controlled with mood enhancing drugs, which are controlled by the government. In this world, there is no link between copulation and reproduction. Humans are produced in giant test tubes, where chemical alterations during gestation determine their fates. Bowers argues that, \"The science fiction narrative's distinct difference from magical realism is that it is set in a world different from any known reality and its realism resides in the fact that we can recognize it as a possibility for our future. Unlike magical realism, it does not have a realistic setting that is recognizable in relation to any past or present reality.\"<ref>Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 29-30.

The novel's protagonist, Tita, is kept from happiness and marriage by her mother. \"Her unrequited love and ostracism from the family lead her to harness her extraordinary powers of imbuing her emotions to the food she makes. In turn, people who eat her food enact her emotions for her. For example, after eating a wedding cake Tita made while suffering from a forbidden love, the guests all suffer from a wave of longing. The Mexican [[Juan Rulfo]] pioneered the exposition through a non-linear structure with his short novel ''[[Pedro P\u00e1ramo]]'' that tells the story of Comala both as a lively town in times of the eponymous Pedro P\u00e1ramo and as a ghost town through the eyes of his son Juan Preciado who returns to Comala to fulfil a promise to his dead mother.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, major authors include British Indian writer [[Salman Rushdie]], African American novelists [[Toni Morrison]] and [[Gloria Naylor]], Latinos, as [[Ana Castillo]], [[Rudolfo Anaya]], [[Daniel Olivas]], and [[Helena Maria Viramontes]], Native American authors [[Louise Erdrich]] and [[Sherman Alexie]]; English author [[Louis de Berni\u00e8res]] and English feminist writer [[Angela Carter]].

This was the year that Franz Roh published his book on the subject, ''Nach Expressionismus: Magischer Realismus: Probleme der neuesten europ\u00e4ischen Malerei'' (translated as ''After Expressionism: Magical Realism: Problems of the Newest European Painting'') and [[Gustav Hartlaub]] curated the seminal exhibition on the theme, entitled simply ''[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]'' (translated as ''[[New Objectivity]]''), at the [[Kunsthalle Mannheim]] in Mannheim, Germany.<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />{{rp|41}} Guenther refers most frequently to the [[New Objectivity]], rather than magical realism, which is attributed to that New objectivity is practical based, referential (to real practicing artists), while the magical realism is theoretical or critic's rhetoric. Eventually under [[Massimo Bontempelli]] guidance, the term ''magic realism'' was fully embraced by the German as well as in Italian practicing communities.<ref name=\"Guenther1995\" />{{rp|60}}\n\n[[New Objectivity]] saw an utter rejection of the preceding [[impressionist]] and [[expressionist]] movements, and Hartlaub curated his exhibition under the guideline: only those, \"who have remained true or have returned to a positive, palpable reality,\"<ref>Hartlaub, Gustav, \"Werbendes Rundschreiben\"</ref> in order to reveal the truth of the times,\"<ref name=\"Guenther, Irene pp. 41\">Guenther, Irene, \"Magic realism in the Weimar Republic\" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 41</ref> would be included.

One, conservative towards Classicism, taking roots in timelessness, wanting to sanctify again the healthy, physically plastic in pure drawing after nature...after so much eccentricity and chaos [a reference to the repercussions of World War I]... The other, the left, glaringly contemporary, far less artistically faithful, rather born of the negation of art, seeking to expose the chaos, the true face of our time, with an addiction to primitive fact-finding and nervous baring of the self... There is nothing left but to affirm it [the new art], especially since it seems strong enough to raise new artistic willpower.<ref>Westheim, Paul, \"Ein neuer Naturalismus??

Roh explains,\n\n<blockquote>We are offered a new style that is thoroughly of this world that celebrates the mundane. This new world of objects is still alien to the current idea of Realism. It employs various techniques that endow all things with a deeper meaning and reveal mysteries that always threaten the secure tranquility of simple and ingenuous things.... it is a question of representing before our eyes, in an intuitive way, the fact, the interior figure, of the exterior world.<ref name=publicasu>{{cite web|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~aarios/resourcebank/definitions/|title=Magical Realism: Definitions|website=www.public.asu.edu|accessdate=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925115858/http://www.public.asu.edu/~aarios/resourcebank/definitions/|archivedate=25 September 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\nIn painting, magical realism is a term often interchanged with [[post-expressionism]], as R\u00edos also shows, for the very title of Roh's 1925 essay was \"Magical Realism:Post-Expressionism\".<ref name=publicasu/> Indeed, as Dr. Lois Parkinson Zamora of the [[University of Houston]] writes, \"Roh, in his 1925 essay, described a group of painters whom we now categorize generally as Post-Expressionists.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/~englmi/ObjectsAndSeeing_intro.html|title=Swords and Silver Rings|work=www.uh.edu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126210721/http://www.uh.edu/~englmi/ObjectsAndSeeing_intro.html|archivedate=2009-01-26}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Kanoldt Still Life II.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Alexander Kanoldt]], ''Still Life II'' 1922]]\n\nRoh used this term to describe painting that signaled a return to [[realism (arts)|realism]] after [[expressionism]]'s extravagances, which sought to redesign objects to reveal the spirits of those objects. Magical realism, according to Roh, instead faithfully portrays the exterior of an object, and in doing so the spirit, or magic, of the object reveals itself. One could relate this exterior magic all the way back to the 15th century. Flemish painter [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]] (1395\u20131441) highlights the complexity of a natural landscape by creating illusions of continuous and unseen areas that recede into the background, leaving it to the viewer's imagination to fill in those gaps in the image: for instance, in a rolling landscape with river and hills. The magic is contained in the viewer's interpretation of those mysterious unseen or hidden parts of the image.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Luber |first1=Katherine Crawford |title=Recognizing Van Eyck: Magical Realism in Landscape Painting |journal=Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin |date=1998 |volume=91 |issue=386/387 |pages=7\u201323 |doi=10.2307/3795460 |jstor=3795460}}</ref>\nOther important aspects of magical realist painting, according to Roh, include:\n* A return to ordinary subjects as opposed to fantastical ones.\n* A juxtaposition of forward movement with a sense of distance, as opposed to Expressionism's tendency to foreshorten the subject.\n* A use of miniature details even in expansive paintings, such as large landscapes.\n\nThe pictorial ideals of Roh's original magic realism attracted new generations of artists through the latter years of the 20th century and beyond. In a 1991 ''New York Times'' review, critic Vivien Raynor remarked that \"[[John Stuart Ingle]] proves that Magic Realism lives\" in his \"virtuoso\" [[still life]] watercolors.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD91031F93AA25756C0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | title=ART; The Skill of the Watercolorist | first=Vivien | last=Raynor | date=1991-05-19 | accessdate=2010-05-12 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202201725/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD91031F93AA25756C0A967958260 | archivedate=2009-02-02 }}</ref> Ingle's approach, as described in his own words, reflects the early inspiration of the magic realism movement as described by Roh; that is, the aim is not to add magical elements to a realistic painting, but to pursue a radically faithful rendering of reality; the \"magic\" effect on the viewer comes from the intensity of that effort: \"I don't want to make arbitrary changes in what I see to paint the picture, I want to paint what is given.

These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. Although the disorder varies from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and rapid visual-verbal responding. In adults, dyslexia usually occurs after a brain injury or in the context of dementia.

Generally speaking, owning, or renting, land or a [[building]] includes the right to use and develop the space above the land without interference by others.\n\nThis legal concept is encoded in the Latin phrase ''[[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' (\"''Whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell''.\"), which appears in [[medieval Roman law]] and is credited to 13th-century [[glossator]] [[Accursius]]; it was notably popularized in [[common law]] in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1766) by [[William Blackstone]]; see [[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos#Origins|origins of phrase]] for details.<!-- See refs there -->\n\n== Air travel ==\n<!---knowledgeable people can add other countries here, but the first part is germane to all countries--->\n{{Further|Flyover rights}}\nProperty rights defined by points on the ground were once believed to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before [[air travel]] became popular in the early 20th century. To promote air transport, legislators established a public easement for transit at high altitudes, regardless of real estate ownership.<ref>Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928, see 47 Stat. 1901)</ref>  \n\nNew technologies have again raised questions about ownership of \"space\" and the upward bounds of national sovereignty.  With the advent of space travel above earth's atmosphere, the height at which national sovereignty extends and therefore nations can regulate transit is often debated.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Building cantilever New York.JPG|thumb|right|A building is cantilevered over two other buildings in [[New York City]]]]\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has the sole authority to regulate all \"Navigable [[airspace]]\", exclusively determining the rules and requirements for its use.<ref>49 U.S.C. 180, 49 U.S.C.A. 18, \u00a7&nbsp;40103 \"use of airspace\"</ref> Specifically, the Federal Aviation Act provides that: \"The [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States\" and \"A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40103- |title=49 U.S.C. 40103(a)(1) |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}</ref> The \"navigable airspace\" in which the public has a right of transit has been defined as \"the airspace at or above the minimum altitudes of flight that includes the airspace needed to ensure safety in the takeoff and landing of aircraft.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-72/pdf/STATUTE-72-Pg731.pdf|title=Pub.L.

United States, 160 Ct.Cl. at 301, 311 F.2d at 801, in which \"the unavoidable damage [reduction of the highest and best use] to a person's property occasioned by [the noise created during] '''travel in the navigable air space''' [is] so severe as to amount to a practical destruction of it.\" This is a case of first impression in which the court may consider the altitude of the flights over the property, but must give primary consideration to the effect of aircraft noise where the Government itself has adopted and published standards of compatibility of use of the subjacent property. Since the subjacent property owner has suffered a diminution of the value of the property in this case, there has been a taking of an easement over and through the airspace subjacent the property of the plaintiff. '''It is abundantly clear that under the law established by Causby, Griggs, and Aaron a taking has occurred in this case.''' \n</ref> This is especially important as ''some'' aircraft (manned and unmanned) now have no minimum flight altitudes making virtually all airspace \"navigable\".\n\nFinancial compensation is owed property owners when the use of their property is substantially impaired by the federal government<ref>US v.

Generally speaking, owning, or renting, land or a [[building]] includes the right to use and develop the space above the land without interference by others.\n\nThis legal concept is encoded in the Latin phrase ''[[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' (\"''Whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell''.\"), which appears in [[medieval Roman law]] and is credited to 13th-century [[glossator]] [[Accursius]]; it was notably popularized in [[common law]] in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1766) by [[William Blackstone]]; see [[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos#Origins|origins of phrase]] for details.<!-- See refs there -->\n\n== Air travel ==\n<!---knowledgeable people can add other countries here, but the first part is germane to all countries--->\n{{Further|Flyover rights}}\nProperty rights defined by points on the ground were once believed to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before [[air travel]] became popular in the early 20th century. To promote air transport, legislators established a public easement for transit at high altitudes, regardless of real estate ownership.<ref>Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928, see 47 Stat. 1901)</ref>  \n\nNew technologies have again raised questions about ownership of \"space\" and the upward bounds of national sovereignty.  With the advent of space travel above earth's atmosphere, the height at which national sovereignty extends and therefore nations can regulate transit is often debated.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Building cantilever New York.JPG|thumb|right|A building is cantilevered over two other buildings in [[New York City]]]]\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has the sole authority to regulate all \"Navigable [[airspace]]\", exclusively determining the rules and requirements for its use.<ref>49 U.S.C. 180, 49 U.S.C.A. 18, \u00a7&nbsp;40103 \"use of airspace\"</ref> Specifically, the Federal Aviation Act provides that: \"The [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States\" and \"A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40103- |title=49 U.S.C. 40103(a)(1) |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}</ref> The \"navigable airspace\" in which the public has a right of transit has been defined as \"the airspace at or above the minimum altitudes of flight that includes the airspace needed to ensure safety in the takeoff and landing of aircraft.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-72/pdf/STATUTE-72-Pg731.pdf|title=Pub.L.

At those times this constituted the limits of \"navigable airspace\". However, the bulk of more recent decisions, which take precedent, hold that taking can occur regardless of if the flight occurred within navigable airspace or not and only impairment of property need be considered.<ref>Branning v. United States 654 F.2d 88 (Fed. Cir. 1981)\n\nHeld a taking occurred from air travel inside of navigable airspace (600')\n\nThe present case is a case, as the court foresaw in Aaron v. United States, 160 Ct.Cl. at 301, 311 F.2d at 801, in which \"the unavoidable damage [reduction of the highest and best use] to a person's property occasioned by [the noise created during] '''travel in the navigable air space''' [is] so severe as to amount to a practical destruction of it.\" This is a case of first impression in which the court may consider the altitude of the flights over the property, but must give primary consideration to the effect of aircraft noise where the Government itself has adopted and published standards of compatibility of use of the subjacent property. Since the subjacent property owner has suffered a diminution of the value of the property in this case, there has been a taking of an easement over and through the airspace subjacent the property of the plaintiff. '''It is abundantly clear that under the law established by Causby, Griggs, and Aaron a taking has occurred in this case.''' \n</ref> This is especially important as ''some'' aircraft (manned and unmanned) now have no minimum flight altitudes making virtually all airspace \"navigable\".\n\nFinancial compensation is owed property owners when the use of their property is substantially impaired by the federal government<ref>US v.

Widely adopted in Japan during the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868) and similar to [[woodcut]] in Western [[printmaking]] in some regards, the mokuhanga technique differs in that it uses water-based inks\u2014as opposed to western woodcut, which typically uses oil-based inks. The Japanese water-based inks provide a wide range of vivid colors, [[glaze (painting technique)|glazes]], and transparency.\n\n==History==\nIn 764 the [[Empress K\u014dken]] commissioned one million small wooden pagodas, each containing a small woodblock scroll printed with a Buddhist text (''[[Hyakumant\u014d Darani]]'').  These were distributed to temples around the country as thanks for the suppression of the [[Fujiwara no Nakamaro|Emi Rebellion]] of 764.<ref>http://www.schoyencollection.com/Pre-Gutenberg.htm#2489</ref> These are the earliest examples of woodblock printing known, or documented, from [[Japan]].\n\nBy the eleventh century, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples in Japan produced printed books of sutras, mandalas, and other Buddhist texts and images. For centuries, printing was mainly restricted to the Buddhist sphere, as it was too expensive for mass production, and did not have a receptive, literate public as a market.  However, an important set of fans of the late [[Heian period]] (12th century), containing painted images and Buddhist [[sutra]]s, reveal from loss of paint that the [[underdrawing]] for the paintings was printed from blocks.<ref>Paine, 136</ref>\n\nThe first secular book was written in Japan in 1781. This was the ''Setsuy\u014d-sh\u016b'', a two-volume Chinese-Japanese dictionary. Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a movable type [[printing press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] from 1590,<ref name=\"FB\">[[Fernand Braudel]], \"Civilization & Capitalism, 15\u201318th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life,\" William Collins & Sons, London 1981</ref> printing equipment brought back by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army from [[Korea]] in 1593 had far greater influence on the development of the medium{{Citation needed|reason=Bold claim, please provide evidence.|date=April 2017}}. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming sh\u014dgun, effected the creation of the first native [[moveable type]], using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts. As sh\u014dgun, Ieyasu promoted literacy and learning, contributing to the emergence of an educated urban public.\n\nPrinting was not dominated by the shogunate at this point, however. Private printers appeared in [[Kyoto]] at the beginning of the 17th century, and [[Toyotomi Hideyori]], Ieyasu's primary political opponent, aided in the development and spread of the medium as well. An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598, using a Korean moveable type printing press, at the order of [[Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, craftsmen soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writings was better reproduced using woodblocks. By 1640 woodblocks were once again used for nearly all purposes.\n\nThe medium quickly gained popularity, and was used to produce affordable prints as well as books. The great pioneers in applying this method to the creation of artistic books, and in preceding mass production for general consumption, were [[Honami K\u014detsu]] and [[Suminokura Soan]]. At their studio in [[Saga, Kyoto|Saga]], the pair created a number of woodblock versions of the Japanese classics, both text and images, essentially converting [[emaki|handscrolls]] to printed books, and reproducing them for wider consumption. These books, now known as K\u014detsu Books, Suminokura Books, or Saga Books, are considered the first and finest printed reproductions of many of these classic tales; the Saga Book of the Tales of Ise (''[[Ise monogatari]]''), printed in 1608, is especially renowned.\n\nWoodblock printing, though more time-consuming and expensive than later methods, was far less so than the traditional method of writing out each copy of a book by hand; thus, Japan began to see something of literary mass production. While the Saga books were printed on expensive paper, and used various embellishments, being printed specifically for a small circle of literary connoisseurs, other printers in Kyoto quickly adapted the technique to producing cheaper books in large numbers, for more general consumption. The content of these books varied widely, including travel guides, advice manuals, ''[[kiby\u014dshi]]'' (satirical novels), ''[[sharebon]]'' (books on urban culture), art books, and play scripts for the ''[[Ningy\u014d j\u014druri|j\u014druri]]'' (puppet) theatre. Often, within a certain genre, such as the ''j\u014druri'' theatre scripts, a particular style of writing became standard for that genre. For example, one person's personal calligraphic style was adopted as the standard style for printing plays.\n\nMany publishing houses arose and grew, publishing both books and single-sheet prints. One of the most famous and successful was [[Tsutaya J\u016bzabur\u014d|Tsuta-ya]]. A publisher's ownership of the physical woodblocks used to print a given text or image constituted the closest equivalent to a concept of \"[[copyright]]\" that existed at this time. Publishers or individuals could buy woodblocks from one another, and thus take over the production of certain texts, but beyond the ownership of a given set of blocks (and thus a very particular representation of a given subject), there was no legal conception of the ownership of ideas. Plays were adopted by competing theaters, and either reproduced wholesale, or individual plot elements or characters might be adapted; this activity was considered legitimate and routine at the time.\n\nAfter the decline of ''ukiyo-e'' and introduction of movable type and other technologies, woodblock printing continued as a method for printing texts as well as for producing art, both within traditional modes such as ''ukiyo-e'' and in a variety of more radical or Western forms that might be construed as [[modern art]]. Institutes such as the \"Adachi Institute of Woodblock Prints\" and \"Takezasado\" continue to produce ukiyo-e prints with the same materials and methods as used in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adachi-hanga.com/|title=\u6d6e\u4e16\u7d75\u30fb\u6728\u7248\u753b\u306e\u30a2\u30c0\u30c1\u7248\u753b\u7814\u7a76\u6240|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.takezasa.co.jp/|title=\u6728\u7248\u5370\u5237\u30fb\u4f1d\u7d71\u6728\u7248\u753b\u5de5\u623f \u7af9\u7b39\u5802|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Technique==\n[[Image:Kinryuzan Temple in Asakusa from the series Famous Places in the Eastern Capital by Hiroshige II.jpg|thumb|''[[Aizuri-e]]'' print: ''Kinryuzan Temple in Asakusa'' from the series ''Famous Places in the Eastern Capital'' by [[Hiroshige II]]]]\n\nThe technique for printing texts and images was generally similar. The obvious differences were the volume produced when working with texts (many pages for a single work), and the complexity of multiple colors in some images. Images in books were almost always in monochrome (black ink only), and for a time art prints were likewise monochrome or done in only two or three colors.\n\nThe text or image was first drawn onto thin ''[[washi]]'' (Japanese paper), then glued face-down onto a plank of close-grained wood, usually a block of smooth cherry.  Oil could be used to make the lines of the image more visible. An incision was made along both sides of each line or area. Wood was then chiseled away, based on the drawing outlines.  The block was inked using a brush or brushes.  A flat hand-held tool called a ''[[Baren (printing tool)|baren]]'' was used to press the paper against the inked woodblock to apply the ink to the paper. The traditional baren is made in three parts, it consists of an inner core made from bamboo leaves twisted into a rope of varying thicknesses, the nodules thus created are what ultimately applies the pressure to the print. This coil is contained in a disk called an \"ategawa\" made from layers of very thin paper which is glued together and wrapped in a dampened bamboo leaf, the ends of which are then tied to create a handle. Modern printmakers have adapted this tool, and today barens are made of aluminum with ball bearings to apply the pressure are used; as well as less expensive plastic versions. Although the first prints were simply one-color, with additional colors applied by hand, the development of two registration marks carved into the blocks called \"kento\" were added. The sheet of washi to be printed is placed in the kento, then lowered onto the woodblock. This was especially helpful with the introduction of multiple colors that had to be applied with precision over previous ink layers.\n\nWhile, again, text was nearly always monochrome, as were images in books, the growth of the popularity of ''ukiyo-e'' brought with it demand for ever increasing numbers of colors and complexity of techniques.

Widely adopted in Japan during the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868) and similar to [[woodcut]] in Western [[printmaking]] in some regards, the mokuhanga technique differs in that it uses water-based inks\u2014as opposed to western woodcut, which typically uses oil-based inks. The Japanese water-based inks provide a wide range of vivid colors, [[glaze (painting technique)|glazes]], and transparency.\n\n==History==\nIn 764 the [[Empress K\u014dken]] commissioned one million small wooden pagodas, each containing a small woodblock scroll printed with a Buddhist text (''[[Hyakumant\u014d Darani]]'').  These were distributed to temples around the country as thanksgiving for the suppression of the [[Fujiwara no Nakamaro|Emi Rebellion]] of 764.<ref>http://www.schoyencollection.com/Pre-Gutenberg.htm#2489</ref> These are the earliest examples of woodblock printing known, or bobs on documented, from [[Japan]].\n\nBy the eleventh century, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples in Japan produced printed books of sutras, mandalas, and other Buddhist texts and images. For centuries, printing was mainly restricted to the Buddhist sphere, as it was too expensive for mass production, and did not have a receptive, literate public as a market.  However, an important set of fans of the late [[Heian period]] (12th century), containing painted images and Buddhist [[sutra]]s, reveal from loss of paint that the [[underdrawing]] for the paintings was printed from blocks.<ref>Paine, 136</ref>\n\nThe first secular book was written in Japan in 1781. This was the ''Setsuy\u014d-sh\u016b'', a two-volume Chinese-Japanese dictionary. Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a movable type [[printing press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] from 1590,<ref name=\"FB\">[[Fernand Braudel]], \"Civilization & Capitalism, 15\u201318th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life,\" William Collins & Sons, London 1981</ref> printing equipment brought back by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army from [[Korea]] in 1593 had far greater influence on the development of the medium{{Citation needed|reason=Bold claim, please provide evidence.|date=April 2017}}. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming sh\u014dgun, effected the creation of the first native [[moveable type]], using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts. As sh\u014dgun, Ieyasu promoted literacy and learning, contributing to the emergence of an educated urban public.\n\nPrinting was not dominated by the shogunate at this point, however. Private printers appeared in [[Kyoto]] at the beginning of the 17th century, and [[Toyotomi Hideyori]], Ieyasu's primary political opponent, aided in the development and spread of the medium as well. An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598, using a Korean moveable type printing press, at the order of [[Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, craftsmen soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writings was better reproduced using woodblocks. By 1640 woodblocks were once again used for nearly all purposes.\n\nThe medium quickly gained popularity, and was used to produce affordable prints as well as books. The great pioneers in applying this method to the creation of artistic books, and in preceding mass production for general consumption, were [[Honami K\u014detsu]] and [[Suminokura Soan]]. At their studio in [[Saga, Kyoto|Saga]], the pair created a number of woodblock versions of the Japanese classics, both text and images, essentially converting [[emaki|handscrolls]] to printed books, and reproducing them for wider consumption. These books, now known as K\u014detsu Books, Suminokura Books, or Saga Books, are considered the first and finest printed reproductions of many of these classic tales; the Saga Book of the Tales of Ise (''[[Ise monogatari]]''), printed in 1608, is especially renowned.\n\nWoodblock printing, though more time-consuming and expensive than later methods, was far less so than the traditional method of writing out each copy of a book by hand; thus, Japan began to see something of literary mass production. While the Saga books were printed on expensive paper, and used various embellishments, being printed specifically for a small circle of literary connoisseurs, other printers in Kyoto quickly adapted the technique to producing cheaper books in large numbers, for more general consumption. The content of these books varied widely, including travel guides, advice manuals, ''[[kiby\u014dshi]]'' (satirical novels), ''[[sharebon]]'' (books on urban culture), art books, and play scripts for the ''[[Ningy\u014d j\u014druri|j\u014druri]]'' (puppet) theatre. Often, within a certain genre, such as the ''j\u014druri'' theatre scripts, a particular style of writing became standard for that genre. For example, one person's personal calligraphic style was adopted as the standard style for printing plays.\n\nMany publishing houses arose and grew, publishing both books and single-sheet prints. One of the most famous and successful was [[Tsutaya J\u016bzabur\u014d|Tsuta-ya]]. A publisher's ownership of the physical woodblocks used to print a given text or image constituted the closest equivalent to a concept of \"[[copyright]]\" that existed at this time. Publishers or individuals could buy woodblocks from one another, and thus take over the production of certain texts, but beyond the ownership of a given set of blocks (and thus a very particular representation of a given subject), there was no legal conception of the ownership of ideas. Plays were adopted by competing theaters, and either reproduced wholesale, or individual plot elements or characters might be adapted; this activity was considered legitimate and routine at the time.\n\nAfter the decline of ''ukiyo-e'' and introduction of movable type and other technologies, woodblock printing continued as a method for printing texts as well as for producing art, both within traditional modes such as ''ukiyo-e'' and in a variety of more radical or Western forms that might be construed as [[modern art]]. Institutes such as the \"Adachi Institute of Woodblock Prints\" and \"Takezasado\" continue to produce ukiyo-e prints with the same materials and methods as used in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adachi-hanga.com/|title=\u6d6e\u4e16\u7d75\u30fb\u6728\u7248\u753b\u306e\u30a2\u30c0\u30c1\u7248\u753b\u7814\u7a76\u6240|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.takezasa.co.jp/|title=\u6728\u7248\u5370\u5237\u30fb\u4f1d\u7d71\u6728\u7248\u753b\u5de5\u623f \u7af9\u7b39\u5802|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Technique==\n[[Image:Kinryuzan Temple in Asakusa from the series Famous Places in the Eastern Capital by Hiroshige II.jpg|thumb|''[[Aizuri-e]]'' print: ''Kinryuzan Temple in Asakusa'' from the series ''Famous Places in the Eastern Capital'' by [[Hiroshige II]]]]\n\nThe technique for printing texts and images was generally similar. The obvious differences were the volume produced when working with texts (many pages for a single work), and the complexity of multiple colors in some images. Images in books were almost always in monochrome (black ink only), and for a time art prints were likewise monochrome or done in only two or three colors.\n\nThe text or image was first drawn onto thin ''[[washi]]'' (Japanese paper), then glued face-down onto a plank of close-grained wood, usually a block of smooth cherry.  Oil could be used to make the lines of the image more visible. An incision was made along both sides of each line or area. Wood was then chiseled away, based on the drawing outlines.  The block was inked using a brush or brushes.  A flat hand-held tool called a ''[[Baren (printing tool)|baren]]'' was used to press the paper against the inked woodblock to apply the ink to the paper. The traditional baren is made in three parts, it consists of an inner core made from bamboo leaves twisted into a rope of varying thicknesses, the nodules thus created are what ultimately applies the pressure to the print. This coil is contained in a disk called an \"ategawa\" made from layers of very thin paper which is glued together and wrapped in a dampened bamboo leaf, the ends of which are then tied to create a handle. Modern printmakers have adapted this tool, and today barens are made of aluminum with ball bearings to apply the pressure are used; as well as less expensive plastic versions. Although the first prints were simply one-color, with additional colors applied by hand, the development of two registration marks carved into the blocks called \"kento\" were added. The sheet of washi to be printed is placed in the kento, then lowered onto the woodblock. This was especially helpful with the introduction of multiple colors that had to be applied with precision over previous ink layers.\n\nWhile, again, text was nearly always monochrome, as were images in books, the growth of the popularity of ''ukiyo-e'' brought with it demand for ever increasing numbers of colors and complexity of techniques. The stages of this development follow:\n*{{nihongo|''Sumizuri-e''|\u58a8\u647a\u308a\u7d75||\"ink printed pictures\"}}\u2014monochrome printing using only black ink\n*{{nihongo|''[[Benizuri-e]]''|\u7d05\u647a\u308a\u7d75||\"crimson printed pictures\"}}\u2014red ink details or highlights added by hand after the printing process\uff1bgreen was sometimes used as well\n*{{nihongo|''Tan-e''|\u4e39\u7d75}}\u2014orange highlights using a red pigment called ''tan''\n*{{nihongo|''[[Aizuri-e]]''|\u85cd\u647a\u308a\u7d75||\"indigo printed pictures\"}}, {{nihongo|''Murasaki-e''|\u7d2b\u7d75||\"purple pictures\"}}, and other styles in which a single color was used in addition to, or instead of, black ink\n*{{nihongo|''[[Urushi-e]]''|\u6f06\u7d75}}\u2014a method that thickened the ink with glue, emboldening the image.

However, many of the surviving examples speak to the contrary. The earliest examples by these artists, are among the most desirable, valuable, and rarest, of all ukiyo-e. Additionally, many examples exhibit very fine printing, using expensive mica, premium inks and the highest quality papers.<ref name=\"Japan, Frank A 1966\"/>\n\n==Print sizes==\n<!-- The articles \"Hosoban\" and \"Oban (disambiguation)\" redirect to this section.

The film's message is encompassed in the final [[inter-title]]: \"The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart\".\n\n''Metropolis'' met a mixed reception upon release.

Many attempts have been made since the 1970s to restore the film. In 1984 Italian music producer [[Giorgio Moroder]] released a truncated version with a soundtrack by rock artists including [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Loverboy]] and [[Adam Ant]]. In 2001 a new reconstruction of ''Metropolis'' was shown at the [[Berlin Film Festival]]. In 2008 a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in [[Argentina]]. After a long restoration process that required additional materials provided by a print from [[New Zealand]], the film was 95% restored and shown on large screens in [[Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt]] simultaneously on 12 February 2010.\n\nIn 2001 the film was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]], the first film thus distinguished.<ref>Staff (ndg) [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/metropolis-sicherungsstueck-nr-1-negative-of-the-restored-and-reconstructed-version-2001/ \"Memory of the World: Metropolis \u2013 Sicherungsst\u00fcck Nr. 1: Negative of the restored and reconstructed version 2001\"] [[UNESCO]] website.

Joh Fredersen is the city's master. His son Freder idles away his time at sports and in a pleasure garden, but is interrupted by the arrival of a young woman named Maria, who has brought a group of workers' children to witness the lifestyle of their rich \"brothers\". Maria and the children are ushered away, but Freder, fascinated, goes to the lower levels to find her. On the machine levels he witnesses the explosion of a huge machine that kills and injures numerous workers. Freder has a hallucination that the machine is a temple  of [[Moloch]] and the workers are being fed to it. When the hallucination ends and he sees the dead workers being carried away on stretchers, he hurries to tell his father about the accident. Fredersen asks his assistant, Josaphat, why he learned of the explosion from his son, and not from him.\n\nGrot, foreman of the Heart Machine, brings Fredersen secret maps found on the dead workers. Fredersen again asks Josaphat why he did not learn of the maps from him, and fires him. After seeing his father's cold indifference towards the harsh conditions they face, Freder secretly rebels against him by deciding to help the workers. He enlists Josaphat's assistance and returns to the machine halls, where he trades places with a worker.\n\nFredersen takes the maps to the inventor [[Rotwang]] to learn their meaning. Rotwang had been in love with a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen and later died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he has built to \"resurrect\" Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes he could fill the role and declares his love for Maria. Fredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria's likeness to the robot so that it can ruin her reputation among the workers to prevent any rebellion. Fredersen is unaware that Rotwang plans to use the robot to kill Freder and take over Metropolis. Rotwang kidnaps Maria, transfers her likeness to the robot and sends her to Fredersen. Freder finds the two embracing and, believing it is the real Maria, falls into a prolonged delirium. Intercut with his hallucinations, the false Maria unleashes chaos throughout Metropolis, driving men to murder and stirring dissent among the workers.\n\nFreder recovers and returns to the catacombs. Finding the false Maria urging the workers to rise up and destroy the machines, Freder accuses her of not being the real Maria. The workers follow the false Maria from their city to the machine rooms, leaving their children behind. They destroy the Heart Machine, which causes the workers' city below to flood. The real Maria, having escaped from Rotwang's house, rescues the children with Freder's and Josaphat's help. Grot berates the celebrating workers for abandoning their children in the flooded city. Believing their children to be dead, the hysterical workers capture the false Maria and burn her at the stake. A horrified Freder watches, not understanding the deception until the fire reveals her to be a robot. Rotwang is delusional, seeing the real Maria as his lost Hel, and chases her to the roof of the cathedral, pursued by Freder. The two men fight as Fredersen and the workers watch from the street. Rotwang falls to his death. Freder fulfills his role as mediator by linking the hands of Fredersen and Grot to bring them together.\n\n[[File:Maria from the film Metropolis, on display at the Robot Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A replica of the ''Maschinenmensch'' (\"Machine-Person\"), on display at the [[Robot Hall of Fame]] in the [[Carnegie Science Center]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alfred Abel]] as Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis\n* [[Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich]] as Freder, Joh Fredersen's son\n* [[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]] as [[Rotwang]], the inventor\n* [[Fritz Rasp]] as The Thin Man, Fredersen's spy\n* [[Theodor Loos]] as Josaphat, Fredersen's assistant and Freder's friend\n* Erwin Biswanger as 11811, a worker, also known as Gyorgy\n* [[Heinrich George]] as Grot, guardian of the Heart Machine\n* The Creative Man\n* The Machine Man\n* Death\n* The Seven Deadly Sins\n* [[Brigitte Helm]] as Maria<ref group=Notes>In the film's opening credits, several characters appear in the cast list without the names of the actors who play them: The Creative Man, The Machine Man, Death, and The Seven Deadly Sins.

In an interview, Fritz Lang reported that \"the film was born from my first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924\". He had visited [[New York City]] for the first time and remarked \"I looked into the streets\u2014the glaring lights and the tall buildings\u2014and there I conceived ''Metropolis'',\"{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=4}} although in actuality Lang and Harbou had been at work on the idea for over a year.<ref name=bennett /> Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that \"the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in the dark sky to dazzle, distract and hypnotize\".{{sfn|Grant|2003|p=69}} He added \"The sight of Neuyork [sic] alone should be enough to turn this beacon of beauty into the center of a film...\"{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=4}}\n\nThe appearance of the city in ''Metropolis'' is strongly informed by the [[Art Deco]] movement; however it also incorporates elements from other traditions. Ingeborg Hoesterey described the architecture featured in ''Metropolis'' as eclectic, writing how its locales represent both \"functionalist modernism [and] art deco\" whilst also featuring \"the scientist's archaic little house with its high-powered laboratory, the catacombs [and] the Gothic cathedral\". The film's use of art deco architecture was highly influential, and has been reported to have contributed to the style's subsequent popularity in Europe and America.{{sfn|Russell|2007|p=111}} The New Babel Tower, for instance, has been inspired by Upper Silesian Tower in [[Pozna\u0144]] fairgrounds, which was recognized in Germany as a masterpiece of architecture.<ref>[https://gloswielkopolski.pl/minely-92-lata-od-pierwszych-targow-poznanskich-zobacz-co-po-nich-zostalo-unikalne-zdjecia/ga/905839/zd/1997127 Upper Silesian Tower, Pozna\u0144 on 1911 postcard]</ref>\n\nLang's visit to several Hollywood studios in the same 1924 trip also influenced the film in another way: Lang and producer Erich Pommer realized that to compete with the vertical integration of Hollywood, their next film would have to be bigger, broader, and better made than anything they had made before. Despite UFA's growing debt, Lang announced that ''Metropolis'' would be \"the costliest and most ambitious picture ever.\"<ref name=bennett />\n\nThe film drew heavily on biblical sources for several of its key set-pieces. During her first talk to the workers, Maria uses the story of the [[Tower of Babel]] to highlight the discord between the intellectuals and the workers. Additionally, a delusional Freder imagines the false-Maria as the [[Whore of Babylon]], riding on the back of a many-headed dragon.\n\nThe name of the [[Yoshiwara]] club alludes to the famous red-light district of Tokyo.{{Sfn|White|1995|p=348}}\n\nMuch of the plot line of ''Metropolis'' stems from the [[World War I|First World War]] and the culture of the [[Weimar Republic]] in Germany. Lang explores the themes of industrialization and mass production in his film; two developments that played a large role in the war. Other post-World War I themes that Lang includes in ''Metropolis'' include the Weimar view of American modernity, [[fascism]], and [[communism]].<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = Shell Shock Cinema: Weimar Culture and the Wounds of War\n| last = Kaes\n| first = Anton\n| publisher = Princeton University Press\n| year = 2009\n| isbn = 978-0-691-03136-1\n| location = Princeton, New Jersey\n| pages =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n''Metropolis''<nowiki/>'s screenplay was written by Thea von Harbou, a popular writer in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]], jointly with Lang, her then-husband.{{sfn|Magid|2006|p=129}}{{sfn|Grant|2003|p=14}} The film's plot originated from a [[Metropolis (novel)|novel of the same title]] written by Harbou for the sole purpose of being made into a film. The novel in turn drew inspiration from [[H. G. Wells]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]]'s works and other German dramas.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=9}} The novel featured strongly in the film's marketing campaign, and was serialized in the journal ''Illustriertes Blatt'' in the run-up to its release. Harbou and Lang collaborated on the screenplay derived from the novel, and several plot points and thematic elements\u2014including most of the references to magic and occultism present in the novel\u2014were dropped. The screenplay itself went through many rewrites, and at one point featured an ending where Freder flew to the stars; this plot element later became the basis for Lang's ''[[Woman in the Moon]]''.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=12}}\n\n[[File:Fritz Lang und Thea von Harbou, 1923 od. 1924.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Lang and Harbou in their Berlin apartment in 1923 or 1924, about the time they were working on the scenario for ''Metropolis'']]\n\nThe time setting of ''Metropolis'' is open to interpretation.

Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich (Freder) had worked in vaudeville and was originally employed as an extra on ''Metropolis'' before Thea von Harbou recommended him to Lang.{{sfn|McGilligan|1997|p=113}} Brigitte Helm (Maria) had been given a screen test by Lang after he met her on the set of ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'', but would make her feature film debut with ''Metropolis''.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=12}} In the role of Joh Fredersen, Lang cast Alfred Abel, a noted stage and screen actor whom he had worked with on ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]''. Lang also cast his frequent collaborator Rudolph Klein-Rogge in the role of Rotwang. This was Klein-Rogge's fourth film with Lang, after ''[[Destiny (1921 film)|Destiny]]'', ''Dr. Mabuse the Gambler'', and ''Die Nibelungen''.\n\nShooting of the film was a draining experience for the actors involved due to the demands that Lang placed on them. For the scene where the worker's city was flooded, Helm and 500 children from the poorest districts of [[Berlin]] had to work for 14 days in a pool of water that Lang intentionally kept at a low temperature.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=16}} Lang would frequently demand numerous re-takes, and took two days to shoot a simple scene where Freder collapses at Maria's feet; by the time Lang was satisfied with the footage he had shot, actor Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich found he could barely stand.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=16}} Other anecdotes involve Lang's insistence on using real fire for the climactic scene where the false Maria is burnt at the stake (which resulted in Helm's dress catching fire), and his ordering extras to throw themselves towards powerful jets of water when filming the flooding of the worker's city.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=16}}<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Frank|title=Metropolis (1927)|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/25817%7C0/Metropolis.html|publisher=[[TCM.com]]|accessdate=23 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316012144/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/25817%7C0/Metropolis.html|archivedate=16 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nHelm recalled her experiences of shooting the film in a contemporary interview, saying that \"the night shots lasted three weeks, and even if they did lead to the greatest dramatic moments\u2014even if we did follow Fritz Lang's directions as though in a trance, enthusiastic and enraptured at the same time\u2014I can't forget the incredible strain that they put us under.

Nevertheless, Claxton wrote that \"the setting, the use of people and their movement, and various bits of action stand out as extraordinary and make it nearly an obligatory picture.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Claxton |first=Oliver |date=12 March 1927 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |location=New York |publisher=F-R Publishing Company | pages=80\u201381 |accessdate= }}</ref> Other critics considered the film a remarkable achievement that surpassed even its high expectations, praising its visual splendour and ambitious production values.{{sfn|Kaplan|1981|p=146}}\n\nNazi propagandist [[Joseph Goebbels]] was impressed with the film's message of social justice. In a 1928 speech he said, \"the political bourgeoisie is about to leave the stage of history. In its place advance the oppressed producers of the head and hand, the forces of Labor, to begin their historical mission\".{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1997|p=25}} Shortly after the Nazis came to power, Goebbels told Lang that, on the basis of their seeing ''Metropolis'' together years before, Hitler had said that he wanted Lang to make Nazi films.{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=164}}\n\nGerman cultural critic [[Siegfried Kracauer]] later wrote of ''Metropolis'', \"The Americans relished its technical excellence; the English remained aloof; the French were stirred by a film which seemed to them a blend of [composer] [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [armaments manufacturer] [[Krupp]], and on the whole an alarming sign of Germany's vitality.\"{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=150}}\n\nLang later expressed dissatisfaction with the film. In an interview with [[Peter Bogdanovich]] in ''Who The Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors,'' published in 1998, he expressed his reservations:\n\n{{bquote|quote=The main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, but I am at least 50 percent responsible because I did it. I was not so politically minded in those days as I am now. You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale\u2014definitely. But I was very interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture\u2014thought it was silly and stupid\u2014then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures\u2014should I say now that I like ''Metropolis'' because something I have seen in my imagination comes true, when I detested it after it was finished?}}\n\nIn his profile of Lang, which introduced the interview, Bogdanovich suggested that Lang's distaste for his film also stemmed from the Nazi Party's fascination with it. Von Harbou became a member of the Party in 1933. She and Lang divorced the following year.{{sfn|McGilligan|1997|p=181}} Lang later moved to the United States to escape the Nazis, while Harbou stayed in Germany and continued to write state-approved films, later joining the Nazi Party.\n\n===Later acclaim===\nAccording to [[Roger Ebert]], \"''Metropolis'' is one of the great achievements of the silent era, a work so audacious in its vision and so angry in its message that it is, if anything, more powerful today than when it was made.\"{{sfn|Ebert|1985|p=209}} [[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'s entry on the film reads, \"Heavy going at times but startling set design and special effects command attention throughout.\"<ref>[[Leonard Maltin|Maltin, Leonard]] ed.

It was the first serious attempt made at restoring ''Metropolis'' to Lang's original vision, and until the restorations in 2001 and 2010, it was the most complete version of the film commercially available; the shorter run time was due to the extensive use of subtitles and a faster frame rate than the original.\n\nMoroder's version of ''Metropolis'' generally received poor reviews, to which Moroder responded, telling ''[[The New York Times]]'' \"I didn't touch the original because there is no original.\"<ref name=bennett /> The film was nominated for two [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Raspberry Awards]], Worst Original Song for \"[[Love Kills (Freddie Mercury song)|Love Kills]]\" and Worst Musical Score for Moroder.{{sfn|Wilson|2005|p=286}}\n\n[[Bonnie Tyler]] was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] at the [[27th Grammy Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/bonnie-tyler|title= 27th Grammy|date=23 February 1985|accessdate=November 9, 2019}}</ref> for \"Here She Comes\".\n\nIn August 2011, after years of the Moroder version being unavailable on video in any format due to music licensing problems, it was announced that Kino International had managed to resolve the situation, and the film was to be released on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] in November.

The Munich version was 9,840 feet, or 109 minutes long.<ref name=bennett />\n\n=== ''Restored Authorized Edition'' (2001) ===\nIn 1998 [[Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung]] commissioned film preservationist Martin Koerber to create a \"definitive\" restoration of ''Metropolis'' by expanding on the Munich version. Previously unknown sections of the film were discovered in film museums and archives around the world, including a [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate]] original camera negative from the [[German Federal Archives|Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv]], as well as nitrate prints from the [[George Eastman House]], the [[British Film Institute]] and the [[Fondazione Cineteca Italiana]].

One of their major problems was that the Argentinian footage was in very bad condition, with many scratches, streaks, and changes in brightness. Some of this they were able to overcome with digital technology, something that would not have been possible even in 2001. The reconstruction of the film with the new footage was once again aided by the original music score, including Huppertz's handwritten notes, which acted as the key resource in determining where the new footage went. Since the Argentinian print was a complete version of the original, some scenes from the 2001 restoration were put in different places than they had been in, and the tempo of the original editing was restored.<ref name=bennett />\n\nIn 2005, [[Australia]]n historian and politician [[Michael Organ]] had examined a print of the film in the [[Ng\u0101 Taonga Sound & Vision|National Film Archive of New Zealand]]. Organ discovered that the print contained scenes missing from other copies of the film. After hearing of the discovery of the Argentine print of the film and the restoration project, Organ contacted the German restorers; the New Zealand print contained 11 missing scenes and featured some brief pieces of footage that were used to restore damaged sections of the Argentine print. It is believed that the New Zealand and Argentine prints were all sourced from the same master.

Two short sequences, depicting a monk preaching and a fight between Rotwang and Fredersen, were damaged beyond repair. Title cards describing the action were inserted by the restorers to compensate. The Argentine print revealed new scenes that enriched the film's narrative complexity. The characters of Josaphat, the Thin Man, and 11811 appear throughout the film and the character Hel is reintroduced.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Tale of Two Cities: Metropolis Restored|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/a-tale-of-two-cities-metropolis-restored/|work=[[Film Comment]]|accessdate=16 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216182103/http://www.filmcomment.com/article/a-tale-of-two-cities-metropolis-restored/ |archivedate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 2010 restoration was premiered on 12 February 2010 at the Berlin [[Friedrichstadt Palast|Friedrichstadtpalast]].

After a long restoration process that required additional materials provided by a print from [[New Zealand]], the film was 95% restored and shown on large screens in [[Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt]] simultaneously on 12 February 2010.\n\nIn 2001 the film was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]], the first film thus distinguished.<ref>Staff (ndg) [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/metropolis-sicherungsstueck-nr-1-negative-of-the-restored-and-reconstructed-version-2001/ \"Memory of the World: Metropolis \u2013 Sicherungsst\u00fcck Nr. 1: Negative of the restored and reconstructed version 2001\"] [[UNESCO]] website.

Joh Fredersen is the city's master. His son Freder idles away his time at sports and in a pleasure garden, but is interrupted by the arrival of a young woman named Maria, who has brought a group of workers' children to witness the lifestyle of their rich \"brothers\". Maria and the children are ushered away, but Freder, fascinated, goes to the lower levels to find her. On the machine levels he witnesses the explosion of a huge machine that kills and injures numerous workers. Freder has a hallucination that the machine is a temple  of [[Moloch]] and the workers are being fed to it. When the hallucination ends and he sees the dead workers being carried away on stretchers, he hurries to tell his father about the accident. Fredersen asks his assistant, Josaphat, why he learned of the explosion from his son, and not from him.\n\nGrot, foreman of the Heart Machine, brings Fredersen secret maps found on the dead workers. Fredersen again asks Josaphat why he did not learn of the maps from him, and fires him. After seeing his father's cold indifference towards the harsh conditions they face, Freder secretly rebels against him by deciding to help the workers. He enlists Josaphat's assistance and returns to the machine halls, where he trades places with a worker.\n\nFredersen takes the maps to the inventor [[Rotwang]] to learn their meaning. Rotwang had been in love with a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen and later died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he has built to \"resurrect\" Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes he could fill the role and declares his love for Maria. Fredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria's likeness to the robot so that it can ruin her reputation among the workers to prevent any rebellion. Fredersen is unaware that Rotwang plans to use the robot to kill Freder and take over Metropolis. Rotwang kidnaps Maria, transfers her likeness to the robot and sends her to Fredersen. Freder finds the two embracing and, believing it is the real Maria, falls into a prolonged delirium. Intercut with his hallucinations, the false Maria unleashes chaos throughout Metropolis, driving men to murder and stirring dissent among the workers.\n\nFreder recovers and returns to the catacombs. Finding the false Maria urging the workers to rise up and destroy the machines, Freder accuses her of not being the real Maria. The workers follow the false Maria from their city to the machine rooms, leaving their children behind. They destroy the Heart Machine, which causes the workers' city below to flood. The real Maria, having escaped from Rotwang's house, rescues the children with Freder's and Josaphat's help. Grot berates the celebrating workers for abandoning their children in the flooded city. Believing their children to be dead, the hysterical workers capture the false Maria and burn her at the stake. A horrified Freder watches, not understanding the deception until the fire reveals her to be a robot. Rotwang is delusional, seeing the real Maria as his lost Hel, and chases her to the roof of the cathedral, pursued by Freder. The two men fight as Fredersen and the workers watch from the street. Rotwang falls to his death. Freder fulfills his role as mediator by linking the hands of Fredersen and Grot to bring them together.\n\n[[File:Maria from the film Metropolis, on display at the Robot Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A replica of the ''Maschinenmensch'' (\"Machine-Person\"), on display at the [[Robot Hall of Fame]] in the [[Carnegie Science Center]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alfred Abel]] as Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis\n* [[Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich]] as Freder, Joh Fredersen's son\n* [[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]] as [[Rotwang]], the inventor\n* [[Fritz Rasp]] as The Thin Man, Fredersen's spy\n* [[Theodor Loos]] as Josaphat, Fredersen's assistant and Freder's friend\n* Erwin Biswanger as 11811, a worker, also known as Gyorgy\n* [[Heinrich George]] as Grot, guardian of the Heart Machine\n* The Creative Man\n* The Machine Man\n* Death\n* The Seven Deadly Sins\n* [[Brigitte Helm]] as Maria<ref group=Notes>In the film's opening credits, several characters appear in the cast list without the names of the actors who play them: The Creative Man, The Machine Man, Death, and The Seven Deadly Sins.

In an interview, Fritz Lang reported that \"the film was born from my first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924\". He had visited [[New York City]] for the first time and remarked \"I looked into the streets\u2014the glaring lights and the tall buildings\u2014and there I conceived ''Metropolis'',\"{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=4}} although in actuality Lang and Harbou had been at work on the idea for over a year.<ref name=bennett /> Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that \"the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in the dark sky to dazzle, distract and hypnotize\".{{sfn|Grant|2003|p=69}} He added \"The sight of Neuyork [sic] alone should be enough to turn this beacon of beauty into the center of a film...\"{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=4}}\n\nThe appearance of the city in ''Metropolis'' is strongly informed by the [[Art Deco]] movement; however it also incorporates elements from other traditions. Ingeborg Hoesterey described the architecture featured in ''Metropolis'' as eclectic, writing how its locales represent both \"functionalist modernism [and] art deco\" whilst also featuring \"the scientist's archaic little house with its high-powered laboratory, the catacombs [and] the Gothic cathedral\". The film's use of art deco architecture was highly influential, and has been reported to have contributed to the style's subsequent popularity in Europe and America.{{sfn|Russell|2007|p=111}} The New Babel Tower, for instance, has been inspired by Upper Silesian Tower in [[Pozna\u0144]] fairgrounds, which was recognized in Germany as a masterpiece of architecture.<ref>[https://gloswielkopolski.pl/minely-92-lata-od-pierwszych-targow-poznanskich-zobacz-co-po-nich-zostalo-unikalne-zdjecia/ga/905839/zd/1997127 Upper Silesian Tower, Pozna\u0144 on 1911 postcard]</ref>\n\nLang's visit to several Hollywood studios in the same 1924 trip also influenced the film in another way: Lang and producer Erich Pommer realized that to compete with the vertical integration of Hollywood, their next film would have to be bigger, broader, and better made than anything they had made before. Despite UFA's growing debt, Lang announced that ''Metropolis'' would be \"the costliest and most ambitious picture ever.\"<ref name=bennett />\n\nThe film drew heavily on biblical sources for several of its key set-pieces. During her first talk to the workers, Maria uses the story of the [[Tower of Babel]] to highlight the discord between the intellectuals and the workers. Additionally, a delusional Freder imagines the false-Maria as the [[Whore of Babylon]], riding on the back of a many-headed dragon.\n\nThe name of the [[Yoshiwara]] club alludes to the famous red-light district of Tokyo.{{Sfn|White|1995|p=348}}\n\nMuch of the plot line of ''Metropolis'' stems from the [[World War I|First World War]] and the culture of the [[Weimar Republic]] in Germany. Lang explores the themes of industrialization and mass production in his film; two developments that played a large role in the war. Other post-World War I themes that Lang includes in ''Metropolis'' include the Weimar view of American modernity, [[fascism]], and [[communism]].<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = Shell Shock Cinema: Weimar Culture and the Wounds of War\n| last = Kaes\n| first = Anton\n| publisher = Princeton University Press\n| year = 2009\n| isbn = 978-0-691-03136-1\n| location = Princeton, New Jersey\n| pages =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n''Metropolis''<nowiki/>'s screenplay was written by Thea von Harbou, a popular writer in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]], jointly with Lang, her then-husband.{{sfn|Magid|2006|p=129}}{{sfn|Grant|2003|p=14}} The film's plot originated from a [[Metropolis (novel)|novel of the same title]] written by Harbou for the sole purpose of being made into a film. The novel in turn drew inspiration from [[H. G. Wells]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]]'s works and other German dramas.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=9}} The novel featured strongly in the film's marketing campaign, and was serialized in the journal ''Illustriertes Blatt'' in the run-up to its release. Harbou and Lang collaborated on the screenplay derived from the novel, and several plot points and thematic elements\u2014including most of the references to magic and occultism present in the novel\u2014were dropped. The screenplay itself went through many rewrites, and at one point featured an ending where Freder flew to the stars; this plot element later became the basis for Lang's ''[[Woman in the Moon]]''.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=12}}\n\n[[File:Fritz Lang und Thea von Harbou, 1923 od. 1924.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Lang and Harbou in their Berlin apartment in 1923 or 1924, about the time they were working on the scenario for ''Metropolis'']]\n\nThe time setting of ''Metropolis'' is open to interpretation.

Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich (Freder) had worked in vaudeville and was originally employed as an extra on ''Metropolis'' before Thea von Harbou recommended him to Lang.{{sfn|McGilligan|1997|p=113}} Brigitte Helm (Maria) had been given a screen test by Lang after he met her on the set of ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'', but would make her feature film debut with ''Metropolis''.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=12}} In the role of Joh Fredersen, Lang cast Alfred Abel, a noted stage and screen actor whom he had worked with on ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]''. Lang also cast his frequent collaborator Rudolph Klein-Rogge in the role of Rotwang. This was Klein-Rogge's fourth film with Lang, after ''[[Destiny (1921 film)|Destiny]]'', ''Dr. Mabuse the Gambler'', and ''Die Nibelungen''.\n\nShooting of the film was a draining experience for the actors involved due to the demands that Lang placed on them. For the scene where the worker's city was flooded, Helm and 500 children from the poorest districts of [[Berlin]] had to work for 14 days in a pool of water that Lang intentionally kept at a low temperature.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=16}} Lang would frequently demand numerous re-takes, and took two days to shoot a simple scene where Freder collapses at Maria's feet; by the time Lang was satisfied with the footage he had shot, actor Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich found he could barely stand.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=16}} Other anecdotes involve Lang's insistence on using real fire for the climactic scene where the false Maria is burnt at the stake (which resulted in Helm's dress catching fire), and his ordering extras to throw themselves towards powerful jets of water when filming the flooding of the worker's city.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=16}}<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Frank|title=Metropolis (1927)|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/25817%7C0/Metropolis.html|publisher=[[TCM.com]]|accessdate=23 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316012144/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/25817%7C0/Metropolis.html|archivedate=16 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nHelm recalled her experiences of shooting the film in a contemporary interview, saying that \"the night shots lasted three weeks, and even if they did lead to the greatest dramatic moments\u2014even if we did follow Fritz Lang's directions as though in a trance, enthusiastic and enraptured at the same time\u2014I can't forget the incredible strain that they put us under. The work wasn't easy, and the authenticity in the portrayal ended up testing our nerves now and then. For instance, it wasn't fun at all when Grot drags me by the hair, to have me burned at the stake. Once I even fainted: during the transformation scene, Maria, as the android, is clamped in a kind of wooden armament, and because the shot took so long, I didn't get enough air.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Helm|first=Brigitte |title=The Making of Metropolis: Actress Brigitte Helm \u2013 The Maria of the Underworld, of Yoshiwara, and I |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/the-making-of-metropolis-actress-brigitte-helm/ |work=[[Cinefantastique]]|accessdate=23 February 2012 |editor-first=Lawrence |editor-last=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709020834/http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/the-making-of-metropolis-actress-brigitte-helm/|archivedate=9 July 2014|date=15 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nUFA invited several trade journal representatives and several film critics to see the film's shooting as parts of its promotion campaign.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=24}}\n\nShooting lasted 17 months, with 310 shooting days and 60 shooting nights, and was finally completed on 30 October 1926.<ref name=\"Turner\" /> By the time shooting finished, the film's budget leapt to 5.3 million Reichsmarks, or over three-and-and-half times the original budget.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=19}}<ref name=bennett /> Producer Erich Pommer had been fired during production.<ref name=bennett />\n\n===Special effects===\nThe effects expert [[Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan]] created pioneering visual effects for ''Metropolis''.

He drew inspiration from [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]], and combined a classical orchestral style with mild modernist touches to portray the film's massive industrial city of workers.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=125}} Nestled within the original score were quotations of [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]]'s \"[[La Marseillaise]]\" and the traditional \"[[Dies Irae]]\", the latter of which was matched to the film's apocalyptic imagery. Huppertz's music played a prominent role during the film's production; the composer often played piano on Lang's set to inform the actors' performances. Huppertz's score only accompanied the film once, at its original premiere.\n\nThe score was not recorded until 2001, for the film's first comprehensive restoration, with Berndt Heller conducting the [[Deutsche Radio Philharmonie Saarbr\u00fccken Kaiserslautern|Rundfunksinfonieorchester Saarbr\u00fccken]].

Considering that ''Metropolis'' was too long and unwieldy, Parufamet commissioned American playwright [[Channing Pollock (writer)|Channing Pollock]] to write a simpler version of the film that could be assembled using the existing material. Pollock shortened the film dramatically, altered its inter-titles and removed all references to the character of Hel, because the name sounded too similar to the English word [[Hell]], thereby removing Rotwang's original motivation for creating his robot. Pollock said about the original film that it was \"symbolism run such riot that people who saw it couldn't tell what the picture was about. ... I have given it my meaning.\" Lang's response to the re-editing of the film was to say \"I love films, so I shall never go to America. Their experts have slashed my best film, ''Metropolis'', so cruelly that I dare not see it while I am in England.\"<ref name=bennett />\n\nIn Pollock's cut, the film ran for 3,170 metres, or approximately 116 minutes\u2014although a contemporary review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' of a showing in Los Angeles gave the running time as 107 minutes,<ref name=variety /> and another source lists it at 105 minutes.<ref name=encyc /> This version of ''Metropolis'' premiered in the United States in March 1927, and was released, in a slightly different and longer version (128 minutes)<ref name=encyc /> in the United Kingdom around the same time with different title cards.<ref name=bennett/><ref name=Pena/>\n\n[[Alfred Hugenberg]], a [[German nationalism|German nationalist]] businessman, cancelled UFA's debt to Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after taking charge of the company in April 1927, and chose to halt distribution in German cinemas of ''Metropolis'' in its original form. Hugenberg had the film cut down to a length of 3,241 metres (about 118 minutes), broadly along the lines of Pollock's edit, removing the film's perceived \"inappropriate\" communist subtext and religious imagery. Hugenberg's cut of the film was released in German cinemas in August 1927. Later, after demands for more cuts by Nazi censors, UFA distributed a still shorter version of the film (2,530 metres, 91 minutes) in 1936, and an English version of this cut was archived in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) film library in the 1930s. It was this version which was the basis of all versions of ''Metropolis'' until the recent restorations. In 1986 it was recopied and returned to Germany to be the basis of the 1987 [[#Munich Archive version (1987)|Munich Archive restoration]].<ref name=bennett /><ref name=Pena/>\n\n===Original reception===\nDespite the film's later reputation, some contemporary critics panned it. Critic [[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a \"technical marvel with feet of clay\".<ref name=NYT/> A review by [[H. G. Wells]] dated 17 April 1927 accused it of \"foolishness, clich\u00e9, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical progress and progress in general\". He faulted ''Metropolis'' for its premise that automation created drudgery rather than relieving it, wondered who was buying the machines' output if not the workers, and found parts of the story derivative of Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'', [[Karel \u010capek]]'s ''[[R.U.R.]]'', and his own ''[[The Sleeper Awakes]]''.<ref name=wells>[[H.

He also called the acting \"uninspired with the exception of Brigitte Helm\". Nevertheless, Claxton wrote that \"the setting, the use of people and their movement, and various bits of action stand out as extraordinary and make it nearly an obligatory picture.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Claxton |first=Oliver |date=12 March 1927 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |location=New York |publisher=F-R Publishing Company | pages=80\u201381 |accessdate= }}</ref> Other critics considered the film a remarkable achievement that surpassed even its high expectations, praising its visual splendour and ambitious production values.{{sfn|Kaplan|1981|p=146}}\n\nNazi propagandist [[Joseph Goebbels]] was impressed with the film's message of social justice. In a 1928 speech he said, \"the political bourgeoisie is about to leave the stage of history. In its place advance the oppressed producers of the head and hand, the forces of Labor, to begin their historical mission\".{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1997|p=25}} Shortly after the Nazis came to power, Goebbels told Lang that, on the basis of their seeing ''Metropolis'' together years before, Hitler had said that he wanted Lang to make Nazi films.{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=164}}\n\nGerman cultural critic [[Siegfried Kracauer]] later wrote of ''Metropolis'', \"The Americans relished its technical excellence; the English remained aloof; the French were stirred by a film which seemed to them a blend of [composer] [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [armaments manufacturer] [[Krupp]], and on the whole an alarming sign of Germany's vitality.\"{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=150}}\n\nLang later expressed dissatisfaction with the film. In an interview with [[Peter Bogdanovich]] in ''Who The Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors,'' published in 1998, he expressed his reservations:\n\n{{bquote|quote=The main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, but I am at least 50 percent responsible because I did it. I was not so politically minded in those days as I am now. You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale\u2014definitely. But I was very interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture\u2014thought it was silly and stupid\u2014then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures\u2014should I say now that I like ''Metropolis'' because something I have seen in my imagination comes true, when I detested it after it was finished?}}\n\nIn his profile of Lang, which introduced the interview, Bogdanovich suggested that Lang's distaste for his film also stemmed from the Nazi Party's fascination with it. Von Harbou became a member of the Party in 1933. She and Lang divorced the following year.{{sfn|McGilligan|1997|p=181}} Lang later moved to the United States to escape the Nazis, while Harbou stayed in Germany and continued to write state-approved films, later joining the Nazi Party.\n\n===Later acclaim===\nAccording to [[Roger Ebert]], \"''Metropolis'' is one of the great achievements of the silent era, a work so audacious in its vision and so angry in its message that it is, if anything, more powerful today than when it was made.\"{{sfn|Ebert|1985|p=209}} [[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'s entry on the film reads, \"Heavy going at times but startling set design and special effects command attention throughout.\"<ref>[[Leonard Maltin|Maltin, Leonard]] ed.

It was the first serious attempt made at restoring ''Metropolis'' to Lang's original vision, and until the restorations in 2001 and 2010, it was the most complete version of the film commercially available; the shorter run time was due to the extensive use of subtitles and a faster frame rate than the original.\n\nMoroder's version of ''Metropolis'' generally received poor reviews, to which Moroder responded, telling ''[[The New York Times]]'' \"I didn't touch the original because there is no original.\"<ref name=bennett /> The film was nominated for two [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Raspberry Awards]], Worst Original Song for \"[[Love Kills (Freddie Mercury song)|Love Kills]]\" and Worst Musical Score for Moroder.{{sfn|Wilson|2005|p=286}}\n\n[[Bonnie Tyler]] was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] at the [[27th Grammy Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/bonnie-tyler|title= 27th Grammy|date=23 February 1985|accessdate=November 9, 2019}}</ref> for \"Here She Comes\".\n\nIn August 2011, after years of the Moroder version being unavailable on video in any format due to music licensing problems, it was announced that Kino International had managed to resolve the situation, and the film was to be released on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] in November.

One of their major problems was that the Argentinian footage was in very bad condition, with many scratches, streaks, and changes in brightness. Some of this they were able to overcome with digital technology, something that would not have been possible even in 2001. The reconstruction of the film with the new footage was once again aided by the original music score, including Huppertz's handwritten notes, which acted as the key resource in determining where the new footage went. Since the Argentinian print was a complete version of the original, some scenes from the 2001 restoration were put in different places than they had been in, and the tempo of the original editing was restored.<ref name=bennett />\n\nIn 2005, [[Australia]]n historian and politician [[Michael Organ]] had examined a print of the film in the [[Ng\u0101 Taonga Sound & Vision|National Film Archive of New Zealand]]. Organ discovered that the print contained scenes missing from other copies of the film. After hearing of the discovery of the Argentine print of the film and the restoration project, Organ contacted the German restorers; the New Zealand print contained 11 missing scenes and featured some brief pieces of footage that were used to restore damaged sections of the Argentine print. It is believed that the New Zealand and Argentine prints were all sourced from the same master. The newly discovered footage was used in the restoration project.<ref name=\"Cinema's Holy Grail\">{{Cite news | title = Cinema's Holy Grail | author = Pennells, Steve | newspaper = Sunday Star Times| location = New Zealand| date = 14 February 2010| page = C5}}</ref> The Argentine print was in poor condition and required considerable restoration before it was re-premiered in February 2010. Two short sequences, depicting a monk preaching and a fight between Rotwang and Fredersen, were damaged beyond repair. Title cards describing the action were inserted by the restorers to compensate. The Argentine print revealed new scenes that enriched the film's narrative complexity. The characters of Josaphat, the Thin Man, and 11811 appear throughout the film and the character Hel is reintroduced.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Tale of Two Cities: Metropolis Restored|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/a-tale-of-two-cities-metropolis-restored/|work=[[Film Comment]]|accessdate=16 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216182103/http://www.filmcomment.com/article/a-tale-of-two-cities-metropolis-restored/ |archivedate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 2010 restoration was premiered on 12 February 2010 at the Berlin [[Friedrichstadt Palast|Friedrichstadtpalast]].

Originally released on May 5, 1992 for [[DOS]], it was inspired by the 1981 [[Muse Software]] video game ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', and is the third installment in the ''[[Wolfenstein]]'' series. In ''Wolfenstein 3D'', the player [[player character|assumes the role]] of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] spy [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]] during [[World War II]] as he escapes from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] prison Castle Wolfenstein and carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis. The player traverses each of the game's [[level (video gaming)|levels]] to find an elevator to the next level or kill a [[boss (video gaming)|final boss]], fighting Nazi soldiers, dogs, and other enemies with knives and a variety of guns.\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the second major release by id Software, after the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series of episodes. In mid-1991, programmer [[John Carmack]] experimented with making a fast 3D [[game engine]] by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single [[plane (geometry)|plane]], producing ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]'' as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly ''Keen'' to a more violent theme, programmer [[John Romero]] suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter ''Castle Wolfenstein'' as a fast-paced action game. He and designer [[Tom Hall]] designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' features artwork by [[Adrian Carmack]] and sound effects and music by [[Robert Prince (video game composer)|Bobby Prince]]. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the [[shareware]] model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was a critical and commercial success and widely considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made. Garnering numerous awards and selling over 200,000 copies by the end of 1993. It has been termed the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\", and is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first-person shooter genre and establishing the standard of fast-paced action and technical prowess for many subsequent games in the genre, as well as showcasing the viability of the shareware publishing model at the time. FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game, while Apogee released a pack of over 800 fan-created levels. Id Software never returned to the series, but did license the engine to numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in 1995, and multiple other games in the [[Wolfenstein (series)|''Wolfenstein'' series]] have been developed by other companies since 2001.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Wolf3d pc.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot of the DOS version, showing the player character firing a submachine gun at guards|alt=A submachine gun firing at a falling brown-uniformed Nazi, while a second Nazi aims a pistol at the viewer]]\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is a [[first-person shooter]] presented with rudimentary [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/> The game is broken up into [[level (video gaming)|levels]], each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/> Each level is themed after [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> Levels\u2014ten in the original episodes\u2014are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a [[boss (video gaming)|boss fight]] with a particularly difficult enemy.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and [[health (gaming)|health]]. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire [[chain gun]].<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as [[2.5D]] graphics.<ref name=\"MOD8793\"/>\n\nThe player's health is represented by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one [[life (gaming)|life]] and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition can be found in hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its [[porting|ports]] the player can only save between levels.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/><ref name=\"HG101\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is divided into two sets of three episodes: \"Escape from Castle Wolfenstein\", \"Operation: Eisenfaust\", and \"Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!\" serve as the primary trilogy, with a second trilogy titled ''The Nocturnal Missions'' including \"A Dark Secret\", \"Trail of the Madman\", and \"Confrontation\". The protagonist is [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], an American spy of [[Polish Americans|Polish descent]], and the game follows his efforts to destroy the Nazi regime. In \"Escape\", Blazkowicz has been captured while trying to find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust (Iron Fist) and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, from which he must escape. \"Operation: Eisenfaust\" follows his discovery and thwarting of the Nazi plan to create an army of [[undead]] mutants in Castle Hollehammer, while in \"Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!\" he infiltrates a [[F\u00fchrerbunker|bunker]] under the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], culminating in a battle with [[Adolf Hitler]] in a [[powered exoskeleton|robotic suit]] equipped with four [[chain gun]]s.\n\n''The Nocturnal Missions'' form a [[prequel]] storyline dealing with German plans for [[chemical warfare]]. \"A Dark Secret\" deals with the initial pursuit through a weapons research facility of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry. \"Trail of the Madman\" takes place in Castle [[Erlangen]], where Blazkowicz's goal is to find the maps and plans for the chemical war. The story ends in \"Confrontation\", which is set in Castle [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]] as he confronts the Nazi general behind the chemical warfare initiative.\n\nAn additional episode, titled ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a retail game by [[FormGen]]. It follows Blazkowicz on a different prequel mission, trying to recapture the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] from the Nazis after it was stolen from [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. FormGen later developed two sequel episodes, \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\", each of which feature Blazkowicz as he fights through another Nazi base to recover the Spear of Destiny after it has been stolen again as part of a plot to [[German nuclear weapon project|build a nuclear weapon]] or [[evocation|summon demons]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Simple raycasting with fisheye correction.gif|thumb|300px|right|A simple [[ray casting]] rendering similar to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine. The red dot is the player's location. The orange area represents the player's [[field of view]].|alt=A rotating view of a complex 3D area, with an overhead view on the right showing the raycasting area as the view rotates]]\nIn October\u2013December 1990, a team of employees from programming studio [[Softdisk]] calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game ''[[Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons]]'', the first game in the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series. The group, who worked at Softdisk in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] developing games for the ''Gamer's Edge'' video game subscription service and [[disk magazine]], was composed of programmers [[John Romero]] and [[John Carmack]], designer [[Tom Hall]], artist [[Adrian Carmack]], and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of the game in December through [[shareware]] publisher [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]], the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game\u2014the team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends\u2014the team made no secret of their intentions. After a few weeks of negotiation, the team agreed to produce a series of games for ''Gamer's Edge'', one every two months.<ref name=\"MOD6676\"/>\n\nIdeas from the Deep, now formally established as [[id Software]], used some of these to prototype ideas for their own games.<ref name=\"IGNid\"/> Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with [[3D computer graphics]], which until then was largely the purview of [[amateur flight simulation|flight simulation games]] such as ''[[Wing Commander (video game)|Wing Commander]]'' (1990). Carmack found that this was largely due to the limitations of [[personal computer]]s of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast [[action game]] in 3D due to the [[rendering (computer graphics)|number of surfaces]] it needed to calculate, but felt that the increasing computational power of PCs meant that it may be possible.<ref name=\"MOD6676\"/><ref name=\"AM386\"/> During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through [[ray casting]], in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D [[game engine]] that used animated 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'', in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD6676\"/> In the fall of 1991, after the team\u2014sans Wilbur\u2014had relocated to [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and he had largely finished the engine work for ''[[Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy]]'', Carmack decided to implement a feature from ''[[Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss]]'', a [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] in development by [[Looking Glass Studios|Blue Sky Productions]].<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> ''Ultima Underworld'' was planned to display [[texture mapping|texture-mapped]] 3D graphics without ''Hovertank''{{'}}s restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/><ref name=\"UU\"/><ref name=\"UU2\"/> Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as ''Underworld'' was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from ''Hovertank 3D'' for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]''.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> Upon seeing it, [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/>\n\n[[File:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Romero]] in 2012|alt=Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses]]\nIn November 1991, with the second ''Commander Keen'' trilogy of episodes nearing completion and their contractual obligations to Softdisk almost finished, id Software sat down to plan out their next major game. Designer Tom Hall, who initially wanted to do a third ''Keen'' trilogy, recognized that Carmack's programming focus had shifted from the 2D [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] series to 3D action games. After an initial proposal by Hall of a sci-fi project, \"It's Green and Pissed\", Romero suggested a 3D remake of the 1981 ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]''. The team was interested in the idea, as Romero, Hall, and John Carmack all had fond memories of the original title and felt the maze-like shooter gameplay fit well with Carmack's 3D game engine, while Adrian Carmack was interested in moving away from the child-friendly art style of ''Keen'' into something more violent. Encouraged by the reception to his idea, Romero expounded on it by proposing a \"loud\" and \"cool\" fast action game where the player could shoot soldiers before dragging and looting their bodies. The core of the gameplay would be fast and simple, for Romero believed that due to the novelty of a 3D game and control scheme, players would not be receptive to more complicated, slow gameplay.<ref name=\"RomeroComm\"/> He felt the game would occupy a unique place in the industry, which was then dominated by slower simulation and strategy games. Adrian and John Carmack were excited by the prospect, while Hall felt that it was enjoyable enough, and that since he was the company's designer that they could return to his ideas at a later date.<ref name=\"MOD8793\"/>\n\nInitially the team believed that they would be unable to use the ''Wolfenstein'' name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> They contacted ''Castle Wolfenstein'' developer [[Silas Warner]], but learned that [[Muse Software]] and successor companies no longer existed and the trademark had lapsed. The copyrights last belonged to someone in [[Michigan]], and the team was able to purchase them.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> Thus they were free to use the name ''Wolfenstein 3D''.<ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/> The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he guaranteed id a US$100,000 payment on the project.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail ''Wolfenstein'' project to [[FormGen]], which had published id's December 1991 ''[[Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter]]'', overcoming the publisher's concerns over ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/>\n\n[[File:John Carmack E3 2006.jpg|thumb|[[John Carmack]] in 2006|alt=Black and white photo of the head and shoulders of a man wearing glasses]]\nThe project officially began on December 15, 1991.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> Romero and Hall designed the gameplay and aesthetics; Romero wanted the goal to be \"to mow down Nazis\", with the suspense of storming a Nazi bunker full of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] soldiers and Hitler himself, as well as dogs, blood \"like you never see in games\", and straightforward, lethal weapons. He also composed the general storyline for the game.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-JagDev\"/> Hall designed the levels while also adding collectible objects in the form of treasure and food for health items.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> He also did sketches for the bosses and the title screen.<ref name=\"Gamasutra-CKTech\"/> Carmack made extensive use of a [[NeXT Computer]] for the project.<ref name=\"NeXT-Wolf3D\"/> He programmed \"the core\" of the game's engine in a month; he added a few features to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'', including support for doors and decorative non-wall objects, but primarily focused on making the game run smoother and faster with higher-resolution graphics.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Jag\"/><ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> The game was programmed in [[ANSI C]] and [[assembly language]].<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> The graphics for the game were planned to be in 16 color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], but were changed to 256 color [[VGA]] four months before release.<ref name=\"GSMillerInt\"/> Romero in turn worked on building a game with the engine, removing elements of the initial design, like looting enemy bodies, that he felt interrupted the flow of fast gameplay.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> The sprites for the enemies and objects were hand drawn at eight different angles by Adrian Carmack using [[Electronic Arts]]'s ''[[Deluxe Paint|Deluxe Paint II]]''.<ref name=\"Gamasutra3DDesign\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-BitTech\"/><ref name=\"DeluxePaintII\"/> Initially the team had an external artist who assisted him and created animated wall textures, but the team felt that the quality was poor and did not use it in the game.<ref name=\"GamasutraWalls\"/> The level design, by Romero and Hall, due to the grid-based level design, took some inspiration from ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and paid homage with a hidden ''Pac-Man'' level.<ref name=\"Pacman\"/> The team ensured that the presentation of the game created the atmosphere that they wanted, adding violent animations by Adrian Carmack for enemies being shot and music and sound effects by ''Keen'' composer [[Robert Prince (video game composer)|Bobby Prince]] to make the guns sound exciting.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> With the aid of a 16-bit sampler keyboard and cassette recorder, Bobby Prince composed realistic sounds from a shooting range in addition to [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] sounds. The development team along with Scott Miller did the voicing for the enemies.<ref name=\"SFXGamasutra\"/>\n\nAs development continued, id Software hired their former Softdisk liaison [[Kevin Cloud]] as an assistant artist, and moved the company out to [[Mesquite, Texas]], near where Apogee was located.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their [[royalty payment|royalty]] rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ''ScubaVenture'', so that id could focus on ''Wolfenstein''. The game was intended to be released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode.<ref name=\"MOD105112\"/> The level maps were designed in 2D using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which had been used for the entire ''Keen'' series as well as several other games.<ref name=\"TE5GameUltra\"/> Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day using the program, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD105112\"/> Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.<ref name=\"MOD105112\"/>\n\nAs the game neared completion, FormGen contacted id with concerns over its violence and shock content. In response, id increased these aspects; Adrian Carmack added skeletons, corpses, and bloody wall details, and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German, along with a Death Cam that would show a replay of the death of the final boss of an episode. The team also added \"[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]\", the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]], to the opening screen. John Carmack, meanwhile, added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas, a feature that Hall had been pushing for months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons. Hall also added in cheat codes, and wrote a back story for the game. The team did a month of playtesting in the final stage of the game's development.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> In the early morning of May 5, 1992, the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to [[bulletin board system]]s. The other episodes were completed a few weeks later. The total development time had been around half a year, with a cost of around US$25,000 to cover the team's rent and US$750 per month salaries.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/>\n\nThe following summer, most of the id Software team developed ''Spear of Destiny'', except John Carmack, who instead experimented with a new graphics engine that was licensed for ''[[Shadowcaster]]'' and became the basis of the ''Doom'' engine.<ref name=\"SOD-Doom\"/> The one episode of ''Spear of Destiny'' was a prequel to ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and used the same engine, but added some new audio, graphics, and enemies. It took two months to create, and was published commercially by FormGen in September 1992.<ref name=\"SOD-Doom\"/><ref name=\"SOD-Romero\"/><ref name=\"SOD-5YearsDoom\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe first episode was released as shareware for free distribution by Apogee and the whole original trilogy of episodes made available for purchase on May 5 as ''Wolfenstein 3D'', though the purchased episodes were not actually shipped to customers until a few weeks later. The second trilogy that Miller had convinced id to create was released soon after as an add-on pack titled ''The Nocturnal Missions''.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> Players were able to buy each trilogy separately or as a single game.<ref name=\"TUH\"/> In 1993 Apogee also published the ''Wolfenstein 3D Super Upgrades'' pack, which included 815 fan-made levels called \"WolfMaster\", along with a map editor titled \"MapEdit\" and a random level generator named \"Wolf Creator\".<ref name=\"3DRlegacy\"/><ref name=\"SuperWolfUpgrade\"/> A retail ''Wolfenstein'' episode double the length of the Apogee episodes, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released through FormGen on September 18, 1992. FormGen later published two mission packs titled \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\", each the same length as ''Spear of Destiny'', in May 1994, and later that year published ''Spear of Destiny'' and the two mission packs together as the ''Spear of Destiny Super CD Package''. Id released the original six Apogee episodes as a retail title through [[GT Interactive|GT Software]] in 1993 and produced a collection of both the Apogee and FormGen episodes released through [[Activision]] in 1998.<ref name=\"Apogee FAQ\"/>\n\nThere were two intended promotions associated with the original Apogee release, both of which were cancelled. A pushable wall maze led to a sign reading \"Call Apogee and say [[Aardwolf]]\" (\"Snapity\" in beta versions)<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/><ref name=\"JoeSigCall\"/>; it was intended that the first person to find the sign and carry out its instructions would win a prize (consisting of US$1,000 or a line of Apogee games for life),<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/><ref name=\"JoeSigCall\"/> but the quick creation of level editors and [[cheating in video games|cheat]] programs for the game soon after release led id and Apogee to give up on the idea. Additionally, after completing an episode the player is given a three-letter code in addition to their total score and time. This code was intended to be a verification code as part of a high-score contest, but the sudden prevalence of editor programs resulted in the cancellation of the contest without ever being formally announced.<ref name=\"Aardwolf\"/>\n\n[[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]] commissioned id to port the game to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) for a US$100,000 advance. The team was busy with the [[development of Doom|development of ''Doom'']], and ignored the project for seven or eight months, finally hiring [[Rebecca Heineman]] to do the work.<ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/><ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"RomeroGDC\"/> They made no progress on the port, however, and the id team members instead spent three weeks frantically learning how to make SNES games and creating the port by March 1993.<ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/> This version made use of [[binary space partitioning]] rather than raycasting in order to give it speed.<ref name=\"scarydarkfast43-44\"/> [[Nintendo]] insisted on censoring the game in accordance with their policies; this included first making all blood green and then finally removing it, removing Nazi imagery and German voice clips, and replacing enemy dogs with giant rats.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-JagPlay\"/><ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/> The port was release in Japan on February 10, 1994 under the name ''Wolfenstein 3D: The Claw of Eisenfaust'' before being released in North America and Europe later that year.<ref name=\"WolfenJP\"/> Using the source code of the SNES port, on a whim John Carmack later converted the game to run on the [[Atari Jaguar]]. [[Atari Corporation]] approved the conversion for publication and Carmack spent three weeks, assisted by [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]], improving the port's graphics and quality to what he later claimed was four times more detail than the DOS version. He also removed the changes that Nintendo had insisted on.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Jag\"/>\n\nSince its initial release, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' has been ported to numerous other platforms as well.<ref name=\"GameFan2-6\"/> In 1993, Alternate Worlds Technology licensed ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and converted it into a [[virtual reality]] arcade game.<ref name=\"VR-Wolf3D\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-AVT\"/> The 1994 Acorn Archimedes port was done in UK by programmer Eddie Edwards and published by Powerslave Software.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-RISC\"/><ref name=\"wolfencorn\"/> By 1994, a port for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive]] was under development by [[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]], who intended to release it by September, but it was cancelled due to technical problems.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-MDrive\"/> The 1994 [[Classic Mac OS]] version of the game had three releases: ''The First Encounter'', a shareware release; ''The Second Encounter'', with 30 exclusive levels; and ''The Third Encounter'', with all 60 levels from the DOS version.<ref name=\"MacWolf\"/> An [[Atari Lynx]] version of the game was offered earlier by Atari for id, but work on the port was never started.<ref name=\"LynxEGM\"/><ref name=\"LynxPodcast\"/> A [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] version was released in October 1995.<ref name=\"wolfen3do\"/><ref name=\"WolfenJP3DO\"/> The Apple IIGS port had been in development since Fall 1994 by Rebecca Heineman under the Vitesse company, but due to licensing problems, the game was not released until four years later and published by Logicware.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GSII\"/> An open source [[iOS]] port  programmed by Carmack himself was released in 2009.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"wolfenios\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-iOS\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-OpenSource\"/> An unofficial port for the [[Game Boy Color]] was made in 2016.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GBC\"/> The Android port was titled \"Wolfenstein 3D Touch\" and published by Beloko Games.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Android\"/> Other releases include the [[Game Boy Advance]] (2002), [[Xbox Live Arcade]], and [[PlayStation Network]].<ref name=\"wolfengba\"/><ref name=\"wolfenxbla\"/><ref name=\"wolfenpsn\"/> These ports' sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the original. Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes ''Spear of Destiny'', and a 2007 [[Steam (software)|Steam]] release for PC, macOS, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes.<ref name=\"wolfenios\"/><ref name=\"wolfensteam\"/> [[Bethesda Softworks]], whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of ''Wolfenstein 3D''{{'}}s release by producing a free-to-play [[browser game|browser-based]] version of the game in 2012.<ref name=\"wolfenbrowse\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nId had no clear expectations for ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s commercial reception, but hoped that it would make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> ''[[PC Zone]]'' quoted a shareware distributor as saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the top shareware seller of 1992.<ref name=\"PCZ\"/> By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' as well as ''Spear of Destiny'' had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly by the end of the year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/> By mid-1994 150,000 shareware copies were registered and id sold another 150,000 retail copies as ''Spear of Destiny''; the company estimated that one million shareware copies were distributed worldwide.<ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/> Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|banned from sale in Germany]] due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols by the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] in 1994, and again in 1997 for ''Spear of Destiny''.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/><ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"GamasutraBPS\"/> Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed the game five months after release, describing it as: \"View from the character's point of view: It's a real shooter. The game is easy to play, and it runs well ... This is the only game of its type.\"<ref name=\"Famitsu\"/> The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier ''Commander Keen'' series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart; where ''Commander Keen'' games were bringing Apogee around $10,000 a month, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' averaged $200,000 per month for the first year and a half.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"20YearsGameUltra\"/>\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' won the 1992 Best Arcade game award from ''[[Compute!]]'', the 1992 Most Innovative Game and Best Action Game awards from ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'', the 1992 Reader's Choice&nbsp;\u2014 Action/Arcade Game award from ''Game Bytes'', the 1993 Best Action/Arcade Game, Best Entertainment Software, and People's Choice awards at the [[Shareware Industry Awards]], the 1993 Best Action Game award from ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and a [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]] from the [[Software Publishers Association]] for Best Action/Arcade Game.<ref name=\"SIAaward\"/><ref name=\"scarydarkfast11\"/><ref name=\"3DRlegacy\"/><ref name=\"CGW106\"/><ref name=\"CGW111\"/> It was the first shareware title to win a Codie, and id (with six employees) became the smallest company to ever receive the award. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was noted as one of the top games of the year at the 1993 [[Game Developers Conference]].<ref name=\"CGW108\"/>\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was well received by reviewers upon its release. Chris Lombardi of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the \"sparse [but] gorgeous\", \"frighteningly realistic\", and \"extremely violent\" graphics, as well as the immersive sound and music. Noting the violence, he warned \"those sensitive to such things to stay home\". Lombardi concluded that ''Wolfenstein 3D'', alongside ''Ultima Underworld'' released two months prior, was \"the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief\u2013suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment\", stating that they knew of no other game that could \"evoke such intense psychological responses from its players\".<ref name=\"CGW98\"/> ''Wolfenstein'' twice received 5 out of 5 stars in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' in 1993; Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser termed it \"definitely one of the best arcade games ever created for PC\", highly praised the graphics and sound, and said that the \"fast-paced action\" could keep players enthralled for weeks if they were not concerned about the violence.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> [[Sandy Petersen]], in the first \"Eye of the Monitor\" column, claimed that \"there is nothing else quite like ''Wolfenstein''\" and that it had \"evolved almost beyond recognition\" from the original 1981 game. He enthusiastically praised the speed and gameplay, calling it \"a fun game with lots of action\" and \"a fun, fairly mindless romp\", though he did note that at higher difficulty settings or later levels it became extremely hard.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> The ''Spear of Destiny'' retail episode was also rated highly by ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s Bryan A. Walker, who praised the added enemy types, though he noted that it was essentially the same game as the shareware episodes.<ref name=\"CGW102\"/> Formgen's ''Spear of Destiny'' mission packs \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\" were reviewed by Paul Hyman of ''Computer Gaming World'', who praised the updated graphical details and sound, as well as the smooth gameplay, but noted its overall dated graphics and lack of gameplay changes from the original game.<ref name=\"SODPack-CGWreview\"/>\n\nThe early ports of the game also received high reviews, though their sales have been described as \"dismal\".<ref name=\"NGen11\"/> The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential.<ref name=\"EGMSNESreview\"/> The magazine rated the Jaguar version similarly, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions of the game, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play.<ref name=\"EGMJAGreview\"/> A ''[[GamePro]]'' review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' \"set a new standard for PC gaming\" and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities.<ref name=\"GPJAGreview\"/> A ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' review of the Jaguar version was less enthusiastic, terming it good but not up to the standards of newer games.<ref name=\"NGjag\"/> Its review of the Macintosh version of the game was also mild, stating that \"there isn't a staggering amount of freshness here, but the action is fast, deadly, and (surprise) addictive\".<ref name=\"NGmac\"/> Major Mike of ''GamePro'' commended the 3DO version's complete absence of [[pixelation]], fast scaling, \"rousing\" music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, \"still packs a punch as a first-person shooter\".<ref name=\"GP3DOreview\"/> ''Wolfenstein 3D'' won ''GamePro''{{'}}s Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed ''[[The Need for Speed]]'' and ''[[D (video game)|D]]''.<ref name=\"3DOaward\"/> ''Maximum'', on the other hand, while stating that the 3DO port was better than the original and as good as the Jaguar version, felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' and the PlayStation version of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' that a new port was pointless, with the game now \"somewhat tiresome and very, very repetitive\".<ref name=\"MAX3DOreview\"/> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' asserted that ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was \"still as [[video game addiction|addictive]] as it ever was\" but essentially agreed with ''Maximum'', contending that anyone interested in first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or \"moved on\" to more advanced games in the genre.<ref name=\"NGen12\"/> More modern reviews include one for the [[Xbox 360]] port in 2009 by Ryan McCaffrey of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'', who heavily criticized it for non-existent enemy AI and bad level design and found it notably inferior to ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and one that same year by Daemon Hatfield of [[IGN]], who gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was \"dated and flawed\", it was \"required playing for any first-person shooter fan\".<ref name=\"XboxMag99\"/><ref name=\"IGNPSNreview\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' has been called the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\",<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/> specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity.<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/><ref name=\"AGGreview\"/><ref name=\"IGN100\"/><ref name=\"WIREDretro\"/> Although some prior computer shooting-based games existed, they were generally [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooters]], while ''Wolfenstein 3D'' helped move the market towards first-person shooters. It has also been attributed with confirming shareware distribution as a serious and profitable business strategy at the time;<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/> ''VideoGames & Computer Entertainment'' claimed in September 1992 that the game \"justified the existence of shareware\", and in July 1993 ''Computer Gaming World'' claimed that it \"almost single-handedly\" demonstrated the viability of shareware as a method of publishing, leading to a wave of other shareware first-person shooters.<ref name=\"CGW108\"/><ref name=\"VGCE\"/><ref name=\"DSretro\"/> The game's high revenue compared to prior, smaller 2D titles led Apogee as well as others in the shareware games industry to move towards larger, 3D titles built by larger development teams.<ref name=\"20YearsGameUltra\"/>\nDuring development, id approached [[Sierra Entertainment]], then one of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing ''Commander Keen'' and an early version of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', CEO [[Ken Williams (game developer)|Ken Williams]] offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front as part of the deal rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, ''Doom'', the success of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/> In 1996, ''Computer Gaming World'' declared ''Wolfenstein 3-D'' the 97th-best computer game ever released.<ref name=\"cgw150\"/>\n\nThe game is also recognized as the principal cause for Germany banning video games that contain certain types of symbols and imagery from extremist groups like Nazis under its [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' section 86a]] up through 2018. Section 86a had \"social adequacy\" allowances for works of art, but in 1998, a High District Frankfurt Court case evaluating the Nazi imagery within ''Wolfenstein 3D'' determined that video games did not fall under this allowance. The court ruled that because video games drew younger audiences, \"this could lead to them growing up with these symbols and insignias and thereby becoming used to them, which again could make them more vulnerable for ideological manipulation by national socialist ideas\".<ref name=\"ars tech ban\"/> Up through 2018, the Germany software ratings board, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) refused to rate any game that included inappropriate symbols and imagery, effectively banning the game for sale within the country. However, in August 2018, the decision was reversed by the German government, having determined that the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' decision was outdated since the USK now included age ratings alongside other content warnings, and that video games should be considered as art under the social adequacy allowance.<ref name=\"GermanBanReversed\"/><ref name=\"ars tech ban\"/> In November 2019, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was formally struck from the \"Index\", the list of games banned from sale in Germany.<ref name=\"Wolf3dGermanyok\"/>\n\nAfter the game's release, id Software licensed the engine to other developers, like the ''Commander Keen'' engine before it, as part of a series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine or derivatives of it include ''[[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold|Blake Stone]]'', the [[Capstone Software]] games ''[[Corridor 7: Alien Invasion|Corridor 7]]'' and ''[[Operation Body Count]]'', as well as ''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]''.<ref name=\"ENGINEbs\"/><ref name=\"ENGINEna\"/> Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled ''Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II'', designed by Tom Hall using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, ''[[Rise of the Triad]]''.<ref name=\"ENGINErott\"/> Additionally, Softdisk produced ''Catacomb Abyss'' using the prototype ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'' as part of the ''[[Catacomb 3-D#Catacomb Adventure Series|Catacomb Adventure Series]]'' trilogy of sequels.<ref name=\"Apogee FAQ Softdisk\"/> Although ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was not designed to be editable or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> The modding efforts of ''Wolfenstein'' players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like ''Doom'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' to be easily modifiable by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD166\"/><ref name=\"OW\"/> The source code for the original ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"Apogee FAQ\"/> The game's technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as ''[[Ken's Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Nitemare 3D]]'', ''[[The Terminator: Rampage]]'', ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Terminal Terror|Terminal Terror]]'' and ''[[The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki]]'', among others.<ref name=\"ROTThistory\"/>\n\nAlthough id Software did not develop another ''Wolfenstein'' game, as their development focus shifted to ''Doom'' shortly after release,<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> and has never returned to the series, multiple ''Wolfenstein'' titles have been produced by other companies, sometimes using game engines developed by id. The first of these newer ''Wolfenstein'' games was ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' in 2001, a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, and the latest titles are the 2019 games ''[[Wolfenstein: Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot]]''.<ref name=\"RTCW\"/><ref name=\"WTNC\"/>\n\n==References==\n;References\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- GAMEPLAY -->\n\n<ref name=\"HG101\">{{Cite

Originally released on May 5, 1992 for [[DOS]], it was inspired by the 1981 [[Muse Software]] video game ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', and is the third installment in the ''[[Wolfenstein]]'' series. In ''Wolfenstein 3D'', the player [[player character|assumes the role]] of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] spy [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]] during [[World War II]] as he escapes from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] prison Castle Wolfenstein and carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis. The player traverses each of the game's [[level (video gaming)|levels]] to find an elevator to the next level or kill a [[boss (video gaming)|final boss]], fighting Nazi soldiers, dogs, and other enemies with knives and a variety of guns.\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the second major release by id Software, after the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series of episodes. In mid-1991, programmer [[John Carmack]] experimented with making a fast 3D [[game engine]] by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single [[plane (geometry)|plane]], producing ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]'' as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly ''Keen'' to a more violent theme, programmer [[John Romero]] suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter ''Castle Wolfenstein'' as a fast-paced action game. He and designer [[Tom Hall]] designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' features artwork by [[Adrian Carmack]] and sound effects and music by [[Robert Prince (video game composer)|Bobby Prince]]. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the [[shareware]] model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was a critical and commercial success and widely considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made. Garnering numerous awards and selling over 200,000 copies by the end of 1993. It has been termed the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\", and is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first-person shooter genre and establishing the standard of fast-paced action and technical prowess for many subsequent games in the genre, as well as showcasing the viability of the shareware publishing model at the time. FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game, while Apogee released a pack of over 800 fan-created levels. Id Software never returned to the series, but did license the engine to numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in 1995, and multiple other games in the [[Wolfenstein (series)|''Wolfenstein'' series]] have been developed by other companies since 2001.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Wolf3d pc.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot of the DOS version, showing the player character firing a submachine gun at guards|alt=A submachine gun firing at a falling brown-uniformed Nazi, while a second Nazi aims a pistol at the viewer]]\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is a [[first-person shooter]] presented with rudimentary [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/> The game is broken up into [[level (video gaming)|levels]], each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/> Each level is themed after [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> Levels\u2014ten in the original episodes\u2014are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a [[boss (video gaming)|boss fight]] with a particularly difficult enemy.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and [[health (gaming)|health]]. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire [[chain gun]].<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as [[2.5D]] graphics.<ref name=\"MOD8793\"/>\n\nThe player's health is represented by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one [[life (gaming)|life]] and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition can be found in hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its [[porting|ports]] the player can only save between levels.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/><ref name=\"HG101\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is divided into two sets of three episodes: \"Escape from Castle Wolfenstein\", \"Operation: Eisenfaust\", and \"Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!\" serve as the primary trilogy, with a second trilogy titled ''The Nocturnal Missions'' including \"A Dark Secret\", \"Trail of the Madman\", and \"Confrontation\". The protagonist is [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], an American spy of [[Polish Americans|Polish descent]], and the game follows his efforts to destroy the Nazi regime. In \"Escape\", Blazkowicz has been captured while trying to find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust (Iron Fist) and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, from which he must escape. \"Operation: Eisenfaust\" follows his discovery and thwarting of the Nazi plan to create an army of [[undead]] mutants in Castle Hollehammer, while in \"Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!\" he infiltrates a [[F\u00fchrerbunker|bunker]] under the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], culminating in a battle with [[Adolf Hitler]] in a [[powered exoskeleton|robotic suit]] equipped with four [[chain gun]]s.\n\n''The Nocturnal Missions'' form a [[prequel]] storyline dealing with German plans for [[chemical warfare]]. \"A Dark Secret\" deals with the initial pursuit through a weapons research facility of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry. \"Trail of the Madman\" takes place in Castle [[Erlangen]], where Blazkowicz's goal is to find the maps and plans for the chemical war. The story ends in \"Confrontation\", which is set in Castle [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]] as he confronts the Nazi general behind the chemical warfare initiative.\n\nAn additional episode, titled ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a retail game by [[FormGen]]. It follows Blazkowicz on a different prequel mission, trying to recapture the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] from the Nazis after it was stolen from [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. FormGen later developed two sequel episodes, \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\", each of which feature Blazkowicz as he fights through another Nazi base to recover the Spear of Destiny after it has been stolen again as part of a plot to [[German nuclear weapon project|build a nuclear weapon]] or [[evocation|summon demons]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Simple raycasting with fisheye correction.gif|thumb|300px|right|A simple [[ray casting]] rendering similar to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine. The red dot is the player's location. The orange area represents the player's [[field of view]].|alt=A rotating view of a complex 3D area, with an overhead view on the right showing the raycasting area as the view rotates]]\nIn October\u2013December 1990, a team of employees from programming studio [[Softdisk]] calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game ''[[Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons]]'', the first game in the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series. The group, who worked at Softdisk in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] developing games for the ''Gamer's Edge'' video game subscription service and [[disk magazine]], was composed of programmers [[John Romero]] and [[John Carmack]], designer [[Tom Hall]], artist [[Adrian Carmack]], and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of the game in December through [[shareware]] publisher [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]], the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game\u2014the team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends\u2014the team made no secret of their intentions. After a few weeks of negotiation, the team agreed to produce a series of games for ''Gamer's Edge'', one every two months.<ref name=\"MOD6676\"/>\n\nIdeas from the Deep, now formally established as [[id Software]], used some of these to prototype ideas for their own games.<ref name=\"IGNid\"/> Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with [[3D computer graphics]], which until then was largely the purview of [[amateur flight simulation|flight simulation games]] such as ''[[Wing Commander (video game)|Wing Commander]]'' (1990). Carmack found that this was largely due to the limitations of [[personal computer]]s of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast [[action game]] in 3D due to the [[rendering (computer graphics)|number of surfaces]] it needed to calculate, but felt that the increasing computational power of PCs meant that it may be possible.<ref name=\"MOD6676\"/><ref name=\"AM386\"/> During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through [[ray casting]], in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D [[game engine]] that used animated 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'', in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD6676\"/> In the fall of 1991, after the team\u2014sans Wilbur\u2014had relocated to [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and he had largely finished the engine work for ''[[Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy]]'', Carmack decided to implement a feature from ''[[Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss]]'', a [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] in development by [[Looking Glass Studios|Blue Sky Productions]].<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> ''Ultima Underworld'' was planned to display [[texture mapping|texture-mapped]] 3D graphics without ''Hovertank''{{'}}s restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/><ref name=\"UU\"/><ref name=\"UU2\"/> Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as ''Underworld'' was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from ''Hovertank 3D'' for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]''.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> Upon seeing it, [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/>\n\n[[File:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Romero]] in 2012|alt=Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses]]\nIn November 1991, with the second ''Commander Keen'' trilogy of episodes nearing completion and their contractual obligations to Softdisk almost finished, id Software sat down to plan out their next major game. Designer Tom Hall, who initially wanted to do a third ''Keen'' trilogy, recognized that Carmack's programming focus had shifted from the 2D [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] series to 3D action games. After an initial proposal by Hall of a sci-fi project, \"It's Green and Pissed\", Romero suggested a 3D remake of the 1981 ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]''. The team was interested in the idea, as Romero, Hall, and John Carmack all had fond memories of the original title and felt the maze-like shooter gameplay fit well with Carmack's 3D game engine, while Adrian Carmack was interested in moving away from the child-friendly art style of ''Keen'' into something more violent. Encouraged by the reception to his idea, Romero expounded on it by proposing a \"loud\" and \"cool\" fast action game where the player could shoot soldiers before dragging and looting their bodies. The core of the gameplay would be fast and simple, for Romero believed that due to the novelty of a 3D game and control scheme, players would not be receptive to more complicated, slow gameplay.<ref name=\"RomeroComm\"/> He felt the game would occupy a unique place in the industry, which was then dominated by slower simulation and strategy games. Adrian and John Carmack were excited by the prospect, while Hall felt that it was enjoyable enough, and that since he was the company's designer that they could return to his ideas at a later date.<ref name=\"MOD8793\"/>\n\nInitially the team believed that they would be unable to use the ''Wolfenstein'' name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> They contacted ''Castle Wolfenstein'' developer [[Silas Warner]], but learned that [[Muse Software]] and successor companies no longer existed and the trademark had lapsed. The copyrights last belonged to someone in [[Michigan]], and the team was able to purchase them.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> Thus they were free to use the name ''Wolfenstein 3D''.<ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/> The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he guaranteed id a US$100,000 payment on the project.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail ''Wolfenstein'' project to [[FormGen]], which had published id's December 1991 ''[[Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter]]'', overcoming the publisher's concerns over ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/>\n\n[[File:John Carmack E3 2006.jpg|thumb|[[John Carmack]] in 2006|alt=Black and white photo of the head and shoulders of a man wearing glasses]]\nThe project officially began on December 15, 1991.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> Romero and Hall designed the gameplay and aesthetics; Romero wanted the goal to be \"to mow down Nazis\", with the suspense of storming a Nazi bunker full of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] soldiers and Hitler himself, as well as dogs, blood \"like you never see in games\", and straightforward, lethal weapons. He also composed the general storyline for the game.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-JagDev\"/> Hall designed the levels while also adding collectible objects in the form of treasure and food for health items.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> He also did sketches for the bosses and the title screen.<ref name=\"Gamasutra-CKTech\"/> Carmack made extensive use of a [[NeXT Computer]] for the project.<ref name=\"NeXT-Wolf3D\"/> He programmed \"the core\" of the game's engine in a month; he added a few features to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'', including support for doors and decorative non-wall objects, but primarily focused on making the game run smoother and faster with higher-resolution graphics.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Jag\"/><ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> The game was programmed in [[ANSI C]] and [[assembly language]].<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> The graphics for the game were planned to be in 16 color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], but were changed to 256 color [[VGA]] four months before release.<ref name=\"GSMillerInt\"/> Romero in turn worked on building a game with the engine, removing elements of the initial design, like looting enemy bodies, that he felt interrupted the flow of fast gameplay.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> The sprites for the enemies and objects were hand drawn at eight different angles by Adrian Carmack using [[Electronic Arts]]'s ''[[Deluxe Paint|Deluxe Paint II]]''.<ref name=\"Gamasutra3DDesign\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-BitTech\"/><ref name=\"DeluxePaintII\"/> Initially the team had an external artist who assisted him and created animated wall textures, but the team felt that the quality was poor and did not use it in the game.<ref name=\"GamasutraWalls\"/> The level design, by Romero and Hall, due to the grid-based level design, took some inspiration from ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and paid homage with a hidden ''Pac-Man'' level.<ref name=\"Pacman\"/> The team ensured that the presentation of the game created the atmosphere that they wanted, adding violent animations by Adrian Carmack for enemies being shot and music and sound effects by ''Keen'' composer [[Robert Prince (video game composer)|Bobby Prince]] to make the guns sound exciting.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> With the aid of a 16-bit sampler keyboard and cassette recorder, Bobby Prince composed realistic sounds from a shooting range in addition to [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] sounds. The development team along with Scott Miller did the voicing for the enemies.<ref name=\"SFXGamasutra\"/>\n\nAs development continued, id Software hired their former Softdisk liaison [[Kevin Cloud]] as an assistant artist, and moved the company out to [[Mesquite, Texas]], near where Apogee was located.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their [[royalty payment|royalty]] rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ''ScubaVenture'', so that id could focus on ''Wolfenstein''. The game was intended to be released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode.<ref name=\"MOD105112\"/> The level maps were designed in 2D using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which had been used for the entire ''Keen'' series as well as several other games.<ref name=\"TE5GameUltra\"/> Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day using the program, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD105112\"/> Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.<ref name=\"MOD105112\"/>\n\nAs the game neared completion, FormGen contacted id with concerns over its violence and shock content. In response, id increased these aspects; Adrian Carmack added skeletons, corpses, and bloody wall details, and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German, along with a Death Cam that would show a replay of the death of the final boss of an episode. The team also added \"[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]\", the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]], to the opening screen. John Carmack, meanwhile, added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas, a feature that Hall had been pushing for months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons. Hall also added in cheat codes, and wrote a back story for the game. The team did a month of playtesting in the final stage of the game's development.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> In the early morning of May 5, 1992, the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to [[bulletin board system]]s. The other episodes were completed a few weeks later. The total development time had been around half a year, with a cost of around US$25,000 to cover the team's rent and US$750 per month salaries.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/>\n\nThe following summer, most of the id Software team developed ''Spear of Destiny'', except John Carmack, who instead experimented with a new graphics engine that was licensed for ''[[Shadowcaster]]'' and became the basis of the ''Doom'' engine.<ref name=\"SOD-Doom\"/> The one episode of ''Spear of Destiny'' was a prequel to ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and used the same engine, but added some new audio, graphics, and enemies. It took two months to create, and was published commercially by FormGen in September 1992.<ref name=\"SOD-Doom\"/><ref name=\"SOD-Romero\"/><ref name=\"SOD-5YearsDoom\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe first episode was released as shareware for free distribution by Apogee and the whole original trilogy of episodes made available for purchase on May 5 as ''Wolfenstein 3D'', though the purchased episodes were not actually shipped to customers until a few weeks later. The second trilogy that Miller had convinced id to create was released soon after as an add-on pack titled ''The Nocturnal Missions''.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> Players were able to buy each trilogy separately or as a single game.<ref name=\"TUH\"/> In 1993 Apogee also published the ''Wolfenstein 3D Super Upgrades'' pack, which included 815 fan-made levels called \"WolfMaster\", along with a map editor titled \"MapEdit\" and a random level generator named \"Wolf Creator\".<ref name=\"3DRlegacy\"/><ref name=\"SuperWolfUpgrade\"/> A retail ''Wolfenstein'' episode double the length of the Apogee episodes, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released through FormGen on September 18, 1992. FormGen later published two mission packs titled \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\", each the same length as ''Spear of Destiny'', in May 1994, and later that year published ''Spear of Destiny'' and the two mission packs together as the ''Spear of Destiny Super CD Package''. Id released the original six Apogee episodes as a retail title through [[GT Interactive|GT Software]] in 1993 and produced a collection of both the Apogee and FormGen episodes released through [[Activision]] in 1998.<ref name=\"Apogee FAQ\"/>\n\nThere were two intended promotions associated with the original Apogee release, both of which were cancelled. A pushable wall maze led to a sign reading \"Call Apogee and say [[Aardwolf]]\" (\"Snapity\" in beta versions)<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/><ref name=\"JoeSigCall\"/>; it was intended that the first person to find the sign and carry out its instructions would win a prize (consisting of US$1,000 or a line of Apogee games for life),<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/><ref name=\"JoeSigCall\"/> but the quick creation of level editors and [[cheating in video games|cheat]] programs for the game soon after release led id and Apogee to give up on the idea. Additionally, after completing an episode the player is given a three-letter code in addition to their total score and time. This code was intended to be a verification code as part of a high-score contest, but the sudden prevalence of editor programs resulted in the cancellation of the contest without ever being formally announced.<ref name=\"Aardwolf\"/>\n\n[[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]] commissioned id to port the game to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) for a US$100,000 advance. The team was busy with the [[development of Doom|development of ''Doom'']], and ignored the project for seven or eight months, finally hiring [[Rebecca Heineman]] to do the work.<ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/><ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"RomeroGDC\"/> They made no progress on the port, however, and the id team members instead spent three weeks frantically learning how to make SNES games and creating the port by March 1993.<ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/> This version made use of [[binary space partitioning]] rather than raycasting in order to give it speed.<ref name=\"scarydarkfast43-44\"/> [[Nintendo]] insisted on censoring the game in accordance with their policies; this included first making all blood green and then finally removing it, removing Nazi imagery and German voice clips, and replacing enemy dogs with giant rats.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-JagPlay\"/><ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/> The port was release in Japan on February 10, 1994 under the name ''Wolfenstein 3D: The Claw of Eisenfaust'' before being released in North America and Europe later that year.<ref name=\"WolfenJP\"/> Using the source code of the SNES port, on a whim John Carmack later converted the game to run on the [[Atari Jaguar]]. [[Atari Corporation]] approved the conversion for publication and Carmack spent three weeks, assisted by [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]], improving the port's graphics and quality to what he later claimed was four times more detail than the DOS version. He also removed the changes that Nintendo had insisted on.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Jag\"/>\n\nSince its initial release, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' has been ported to numerous other platforms as well.<ref name=\"GameFan2-6\"/ In 1993, Alternate Worlds Technology licensed ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and converted it into a [[virtual reality]] arcade game.<ref name=\"VR-Wolf3D\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-AVT\"/> The 1994 Acorn Archimedes port was done in UK by programmer Eddie Edwards and published by Powerslave Software.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-RISC\"/><ref name=\"wolfencorn\"/> By 1994, a port for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive]] was under development by [[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]], who intended to release it by September, but it was cancelled due to technical problems.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-MDrive\"/> The 1994 [[Classic Mac OS]] version of the game had three releases: ''The First Encounter'', a shareware release; ''The Second Encounter'', with 30 exclusive levels; and ''The Third Encounter'', with all 60 levels from the DOS version.<ref name=\"MacWolf\"/> An [[Atari Lynx]] version of the game was offered earlier by Atari for id, but work on the port was never started.<ref name=\"LynxEGM\"/><ref name=\"LynxPodcast\"/> A [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] version was released in October 1995.<ref name=\"wolfen3do\"/><ref name=\"WolfenJP3DO\"/> The Apple IIGS port had been in development since Fall 1994 by Rebecca Heineman under the Vitesse company, but due to licensing problems, the game was not released until four years later and published by Logicware.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GSII\"/> An open source [[iOS]] port  programmed by Carmack himself was released in 2009.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"wolfenios\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-iOS\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-OpenSource\"/> An unofficial port for the [[Game Boy Color]] was made in 2016.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GBC\"/> The Android port was titled \"Wolfenstein 3D Touch\" and published by Beloko Games.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Android\"/> Other releases include the [[Game Boy Advance]] (2002), [[Xbox Live Arcade]], and [[PlayStation Network]].<ref name=\"wolfengba\"/><ref name=\"wolfenxbla\"/><ref name=\"wolfenpsn\"/> These ports' sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the original. Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes ''Spear of Destiny'', and a 2007 [[Steam (software)|Steam]] release for PC, macOS, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes.<ref name=\"wolfenios\"/><ref name=\"wolfensteam\"/> [[Bethesda Softworks]], whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of ''Wolfenstein 3D''{{'}}s release by producing a free-to-play [[browser game|browser-based]] version of the game in 2012.<ref name=\"wolfenbrowse\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nId had no clear expectations for ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s commercial reception, but hoped that it would make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> ''[[PC Zone]]'' quoted a shareware distributor as saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the top shareware seller of 1992.<ref name=\"PCZ\"/> By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' as well as ''Spear of Destiny'' had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly by the end of the year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/> By mid-1994 150,000 shareware copies were registered and id sold another 150,000 retail copies as ''Spear of Destiny''; the company estimated that one million shareware copies were distributed worldwide.<ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/> Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|banned from sale in Germany]] due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols by the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] in 1994, and again in 1997 for ''Spear of Destiny''.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/><ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"GamasutraBPS\"/> Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed the game five months after release, describing it as: \"View from the character's point of view: It's a real shooter. The game is easy to play, and it runs well ... This is the only game of its type.\"<ref name=\"Famitsu\"/> The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier ''Commander Keen'' series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart; where ''Commander Keen'' games were bringing Apogee around $10,000 a month, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' averaged $200,000 per month for the first year and a half.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"20YearsGameUltra\"/>\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' won the 1992 Best Arcade game award from ''[[Compute!]]'', the 1992 Most Innovative Game and Best Action Game awards from ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'', the 1992 Reader's Choice&nbsp;\u2014 Action/Arcade Game award from ''Game Bytes'', the 1993 Best Action/Arcade Game, Best Entertainment Software, and People's Choice awards at the [[Shareware Industry Awards]], the 1993 Best Action Game award from ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and a [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]] from the [[Software Publishers Association]] for Best Action/Arcade Game.<ref name=\"SIAaward\"/><ref name=\"scarydarkfast11\"/><ref name=\"3DRlegacy\"/><ref name=\"CGW106\"/><ref name=\"CGW111\"/> It was the first shareware title to win a Codie, and id (with six employees) became the smallest company to ever receive the award. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was noted as one of the top games of the year at the 1993 [[Game Developers Conference]].<ref name=\"CGW108\"/>\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was well received by reviewers upon its release. Chris Lombardi of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the \"sparse [but] gorgeous\", \"frighteningly realistic\", and \"extremely violent\" graphics, as well as the immersive sound and music. Noting the violence, he warned \"those sensitive to such things to stay home\". Lombardi concluded that ''Wolfenstein 3D'', alongside ''Ultima Underworld'' released two months prior, was \"the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief\u2013suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment\", stating that they knew of no other game that could \"evoke such intense psychological responses from its players\".<ref name=\"CGW98\"/> ''Wolfenstein'' twice received 5 out of 5 stars in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' in 1993; Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser termed it \"definitely one of the best arcade games ever created for PC\", highly praised the graphics and sound, and said that the \"fast-paced action\" could keep players enthralled for weeks if they were not concerned about the violence.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> [[Sandy Petersen]], in the first \"Eye of the Monitor\" column, claimed that \"there is nothing else quite like ''Wolfenstein''\" and that it had \"evolved almost beyond recognition\" from the original 1981 game. He enthusiastically praised the speed and gameplay, calling it \"a fun game with lots of action\" and \"a fun, fairly mindless romp\", though he did note that at higher difficulty settings or later levels it became extremely hard.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> The ''Spear of Destiny'' retail episode was also rated highly by ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s Bryan A. Walker, who praised the added enemy types, though he noted that it was essentially the same game as the shareware episodes.<ref name=\"CGW102\"/> Formgen's ''Spear of Destiny'' mission packs \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\" were reviewed by Paul Hyman of ''Computer Gaming World'', who praised the updated graphical details and sound, as well as the smooth gameplay, but noted its overall dated graphics and lack of gameplay changes from the original game.<ref name=\"SODPack-CGWreview\"/>\n\nThe early ports of the game also received high reviews, though their sales have been described as \"dismal\".<ref name=\"NGen11\"/> The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential.<ref name=\"EGMSNESreview\"/> The magazine rated the Jaguar version similarly, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions of the game, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play.<ref name=\"EGMJAGreview\"/> A ''[[GamePro]]'' review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' \"set a new standard for PC gaming\" and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities.<ref name=\"GPJAGreview\"/> A ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' review of the Jaguar version was less enthusiastic, terming it good but not up to the standards of newer games.<ref name=\"NGjag\"/> Its review of the Macintosh version of the game was also mild, stating that \"there isn't a staggering amount of freshness here, but the action is fast, deadly, and (surprise) addictive\".<ref name=\"NGmac\"/> Major Mike of ''GamePro'' commended the 3DO version's complete absence of [[pixelation]], fast scaling, \"rousing\" music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, \"still packs a punch as a first-person shooter\".<ref name=\"GP3DOreview\"/> ''Wolfenstein 3D'' won ''GamePro''{{'}}s Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed ''[[The Need for Speed]]'' and ''[[D (video game)|D]]''.<ref name=\"3DOaward\"/> ''Maximum'', on the other hand, while stating that the 3DO port was better than the original and as good as the Jaguar version, felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' and the PlayStation version of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' that a new port was pointless, with the game now \"somewhat tiresome and very, very repetitive\".<ref name=\"MAX3DOreview\"/> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' asserted that ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was \"still as [[video game addiction|addictive]] as it ever was\" but essentially agreed with ''Maximum'', contending that anyone interested in first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or \"moved on\" to more advanced games in the genre.<ref name=\"NGen12\"/> More modern reviews include one for the [[Xbox 360]] port in 2009 by Ryan McCaffrey of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'', who heavily criticized it for non-existent enemy AI and bad level design and found it notably inferior to ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and one that same year by Daemon Hatfield of [[IGN]], who gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was \"dated and flawed\", it was \"required playing for any first-person shooter fan\".<ref name=\"XboxMag99\"/><ref name=\"IGNPSNreview\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' has been called the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\",<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/> specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity.<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/><ref name=\"AGGreview\"/><ref name=\"IGN100\"/><ref name=\"WIREDretro\"/> Although some prior computer shooting-based games existed, they were generally [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooters]], while ''Wolfenstein 3D'' helped move the market towards first-person shooters. It has also been attributed with confirming shareware distribution as a serious and profitable business strategy at the time;<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/> ''VideoGames & Computer Entertainment'' claimed in September 1992 that the game \"justified the existence of shareware\", and in July 1993 ''Computer Gaming World'' claimed that it \"almost single-handedly\" demonstrated the viability of shareware as a method of publishing, leading to a wave of other shareware first-person shooters.<ref name=\"CGW108\"/><ref name=\"VGCE\"/><ref name=\"DSretro\"/> The game's high revenue compared to prior, smaller 2D titles led Apogee as well as others in the shareware games industry to move towards larger, 3D titles built by larger development teams.<ref name=\"20YearsGameUltra\"/>\nDuring development, id approached [[Sierra Entertainment]], then one of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing ''Commander Keen'' and an early version of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', CEO [[Ken Williams (game developer)|Ken Williams]] offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front as part of the deal rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, ''Doom'', the success of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/> In 1996, ''Computer Gaming World'' declared ''Wolfenstein 3-D'' the 97th-best computer game ever released.<ref name=\"cgw150\"/>\n\nThe game is also recognized as the principal cause for Germany banning video games that contain certain types of symbols and imagery from extremist groups like Nazis under its [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' section 86a]] up through 2018. Section 86a had \"social adequacy\" allowances for works of art, but in 1998, a High District Frankfurt Court case evaluating the Nazi imagery within ''Wolfenstein 3D'' determined that video games did not fall under this allowance. The court ruled that because video games drew younger audiences, \"this could lead to them growing up with these symbols and insignias and thereby becoming used to them, which again could make them more vulnerable for ideological manipulation by national socialist ideas\".<ref name=\"ars tech ban\"/> Up through 2018, the Germany software ratings board, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) refused to rate any game that included inappropriate symbols and imagery, effectively banning the game for sale within the country. However, in August 2018, the decision was reversed by the German government, having determined that the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' decision was outdated since the USK now included age ratings alongside other content warnings, and that video games should be considered as art under the social adequacy allowance.<ref name=\"GermanBanReversed\"/><ref name=\"ars tech ban\"/> In November 2019, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was formally struck from the \"Index\", the list of games banned from sale in Germany.<ref name=\"Wolf3dGermanyok\"/>\n\nAfter the game's release, id Software licensed the engine to other developers, like the ''Commander Keen'' engine before it, as part of a series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine or derivatives of it include ''[[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold|Blake Stone]]'', the [[Capstone Software]] games ''[[Corridor 7: Alien Invasion|Corridor 7]]'' and ''[[Operation Body Count]]'', as well as ''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]''.<ref name=\"ENGINEbs\"/><ref name=\"ENGINEna\"/> Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled ''Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II'', designed by Tom Hall using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, ''[[Rise of the Triad]]''.<ref name=\"ENGINErott\"/> Additionally, Softdisk produced ''Catacomb Abyss'' using the prototype ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'' as part of the ''[[Catacomb 3-D#Catacomb Adventure Series|Catacomb Adventure Series]]'' trilogy of sequels.<ref name=\"Apogee FAQ Softdisk\"/> Although ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was not designed to be editable or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> The modding efforts of ''Wolfenstein'' players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like ''Doom'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' to be easily modifiable by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD166\"/><ref name=\"OW\"/> The source code for the original ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"Apogee FAQ\"/> The game's technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as ''[[Ken's Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Nitemare 3D]]'', ''[[The Terminator: Rampage]]'', ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Terminal Terror|Terminal Terror]]'' and ''[[The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki]]'', among others.<ref name=\"ROTThistory\"/>\n\nAlthough id Software did not develop another ''Wolfenstein'' game, as their development focus shifted to ''Doom'' shortly after release,<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> and has never returned to the series, multiple ''Wolfenstein'' titles have been produced by other companies, sometimes using game engines developed by id. The first of these newer ''Wolfenstein'' games was ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' in 2001, a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, and the latest titles are the 2019 games ''[[Wolfenstein: Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot]]''.<ref name=\"RTCW\"/><ref name=\"WTNC\"/>\n\n==References==\n;References\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- GAMEPLAY -->\n\n<ref name=\"HG101\">{{Cite
