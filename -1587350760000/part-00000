Lateralis Euryxanthus), also known as the Alameda Striped Racer is a threatened species of colubrid snake distinguishable by its broad head, large eyes, black and orange coloring with a yellow stripe down each side, and a slender neck. The California Whipsnake is found in California\u2019s northern and coastal chaparral. The Alameda Whipsnake is a wary creature known for its speed and climbing abilities utilized when escaping predators or hunting prey. In winter months, the Alameda Whipsnake hibernates in rock crevices and rodent burrows. \n\nSince 1992, the Alameda Whipsnakes have been eliminated from 35 of 60 historical localities. The snake was first collected by Archie Mossman and later described by Riemer <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Riemer|first=William J.|date=1954-02-19|title=A New Subspecies of the Snake Masticophis lateralis from California|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1440636|journal=Copeia|volume=1954|issue=1|pages=45|doi=10.2307/1440636|issn=0045-8511}}</ref> in 1954. Unlike the major species, the California Whipsnake, the Alameda Whipsnake has been reduced to just five areas with little or no interchange due to habitat loss, alteration, and fragmentation. The biggest threat to the Alameda Whipsnake is human development in the snake\u2019s habitat. Urban sprawl is increasing at a rapid rate, and introducing the snake to direct alteration like construction of development, and indirect like pets and public recreation. \n\nThe [[California Environmental Quality Act]] and [[California Endangered Species Act]] afforded the Alameda Whipsnake some conservation benefits prior to the federal listing, but these laws by themselves were far from adequate to protect the species. The listing of the Alameda whipsnake as a federally threatened species increases the ability of public land agencies to promote conservation and management plans that take into consideration the specialized environmental and biological needs of this snake. \n\n== Behavior ==\n\n=== Diet ===\nThe Alameda Whipsnake is a [[Diurnality|diurnal]] [[ectotherm]] that is often seen foraging in the daytime. As it searches for food, the head and the front half of the body are held off of the ground for the most optimal vision to find prey. The snake has two seasonal peaks in activity, one during the spring mating season and the other during late summer or early fall. In the spring, males tend to forage and search for mates while females stay in hibernation. Female peak activity only tends to be a few days in the spring when they are looking for egg laying sites. When the Alameda Striped Racer finds prey like the [[Western fence lizard|Western Fence Lizard]] (Sceloporus occidentalis) or the [[Western skink|Western Skink]] (Eumeces skiltonianus), it takes the prey quickly, holds it tight under the loops of its body and swallows it whole without constriction. Alameda Whipsnakes are great climbers and are able to quickly move through trees and shrubs to hunt prey or escape predators (US Fish and Wildlife 2006).<ref name=jfw>{{Cite journal|date=June 2019|title=Full Issue PDF|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/1944-687x-10.1.1b|journal=Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1\u20131|doi=10.3996/1944-687x-10.1.1b|issn=1944-687X}}</ref>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nCourtship and mating are observed from late March through mid-June. During this time males move around throughout their home ranges, but females appear to remain at or near their [[Hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernacula]], where mating occurs. Female egg laying sites are typically located in grasslands with scattered shrub habitat. Copulation commences soon after emergence from winter hibernacula (Swaim 1994). Females begin laying eggs in mid-late May. Average clutch size is just greater than 7 eggs with a significant correlation between body size and clutch size (Goldberg 1975). Once the female lays her eggs, it will be about 3 months of incubation before the young appear in the late summer and into the fall (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2002).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Stephen R.|date=1975-10-27|title=Reproduction in the Striped Racer, Masticophis lateralis (Colubridae)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1562941|journal=Journal of Herpetology|volume=9|issue=4|pages=361|doi=10.2307/1562941|issn=0022-1511}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hammerson|first=Geoffrey A.|date=1978-04-24|title=Observations on the Reproduction, Courtship, and Aggressive Behavior of the Striped Racer, Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus (Reptilia, Serpentes, Colubridae)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1563418|journal=Journal of Herpetology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=253|doi=10.2307/1563418|issn=0022-1511}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woollett|first=J S|date=1998-12-14|title=Results of a live trapping survey for the Alameda whipsnake (masticophis lateralis euryxanthus) at the Site 300 facilities of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/8320}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 1965|title=Catalogue of American Amphibians and Reptiles |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1965.tb01719.x|journal=Evolution|volume=19|issue=2|pages=268\u2013268|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1965.tb01719.x|issn=0014-3820}}</ref>\n\n=== Life history ===\nThe Alameda whipsnake is an [[ectotherm]]. It might first emerge by sliding its head out of its burrow into the sun. Then it will bask its whole body until its temperature is 91.4-93.4\u2109. It has two annual peaks in activity. The first extends from March, when it leaves its hibernaculum, until mid-June, following courtship and mating. Hatchlings have been located during the second smaller peak in activity, from August through November. Afterwards, like mature snakes, they will seek out a hibernaculum for winter hibernation. Alameda Whipsnakes require 2-3 years to reach maturity, may live for eight years and can reach a length of five feet. The Alameda Whipsnake\u2019s home range may have one or more core areas and specific retreats. They are good climbers, and are able to escape into scrub or trees (US Fish and Wildlife 2006).<ref name=jfw/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woollett|first=J S|date=1998-12-14|title=Results of a live trapping survey for the Alameda whipsnake (masticophis lateralis euryxanthus) at the Site 300 facilities of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/8320}}</ref>\n\n== Description and physiology ==\nAdults reach a length of {{cvt|3 to 4|ft}}.

The Alameda Whipsnake is a slender, fast-moving, diurnal snake with a broad head, large eyes, and slender neck. \n\n==Habitat and distribution ==\n\n=== Historical range ===\nThe Whipsnake once had a continuous range in the inner Coast Ranges in western and central Contra Costa and Alameda counties (California) which is now fragmented into five populations (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1997).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schafer|first=D.W.|last2=Robeck|first2=K.E.|date=1980-06-01|title=Threatened and endangered fish and wildlife of the midwest|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/5073320}}</ref>\n[[File:Alameda Whipsnake Range Map.jpg|thumb|In yellow is the Alameda Whipsnake range, the red is the California Whipsnake range (main species)]]\n\n=== Present population size and range ===\nThe Alameda Whipsnake population has been fragmented into five mostly isolated subpopulations whose numbers are unknown, but which are certain to be rapidly declining as suitable habitat is lost to urban development. Little population abundance data exists for the Alameda Whipsnake. Almost all trapping studies targeting this species have been designed to determine presence or absence for regulatory purposes and assessing impacts to potential habitat. As such, monitoring is most often habitat based; assuming snake abundance is positively correlated with the amount of coastal scrub or chaparral vegetation and rock lands present. \u00a0\n\nThe Alameda Whipsnake is non-migratory, so distribution is not large. The current distribution has been fragmented into five populations; the Tilden-Briones, Oakland-Las Trampas, and Mount Diablo-Black Hills populations in Contra Costa County, the Hayward-Pleasanton Ridge population in Alameda County, and the Sunol-Cedar Mountain population largely in Alameda County with extensions into San Joaquin and Santa Clara Counties, with little to no interaction between the populations. It is estimated that the snakes go no more than 1 mile away from core coastal shrub habitat.\n\nThis species inhabits a variety of different chaparral, which includes vegetation composed of broad-leaved evergreen shrubs, bushes, and small trees usually less than 2.5 m. The cover is typically dense and dry during the striped racer\u2019s peak activity. Although this is where they reside, they forage in other communities in the inner Coast Range, like grasslands, pond and stream edges, and woodlands. Rock outcrops are favorable whipsnake habitats as well, as they provide dens, refuge for predators, and cool areas to escape from excessive heat. Whipsnake prey is also abundant in rocky outcrops, giving the snake plenty of foraging opportunity. The habitat must be a good mix of sunny and shady sites, partially open shrubland, and foraging sites for the whipsnake to meet its biological needs. \n\n== Human impact and major threats ==\nThe most significant threat to the Alameda Whipsnake is human impact. Approximately, 60 percent of the snake\u2019s habitat is owned by the public. One of the major threats to the Alameda Whipsnake is habitat loss as a result of urban expansion. Road and highway construction has been increasing, making the snake even more vulnerable of extinction. Even if urban development is not directly ruining the habitat, adjacent development can have a major impact as well. Being near humans can increase the likelihood of being hunted by feral pets, or killed by the public in recreation activities. Another human impact is fire suppression efforts, as it can alter habitat in two significant ways. It increases the chances of catastrophic fires in overgrown habitat, and would result in a buildup of flammable fuel in the shrubland. Also, fire suppression can reduce biodiversity of the habitat the snake requires. Pest control efforts near protected habitat also introduces rodenticides, burrow fumigants, herbicides, and pesticides that may harm the Alameda Whipsnake directly. \n\nAside from human impact, the Alameda Whipsnake must avoid its predators. The Alameda Whipsnake\u2019s predators are [[California kingsnake|California Kingsnakes]], [[Raccoon|raccoons]], [[Striped skunk|striped skunks]], [[Opossum|opossums]], [[Coyote|coyotes]], [[Gray fox|gray foxes]], [[Red fox|red foxes,]] [[Hawk|hawks]], [[Feral pig|feral pigs,]] [[Dog|dogs]], [[Cat|cats]], and [[Car|cars]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woollett|first=J S|date=1998-12-14|title=Results of a live trapping survey for the Alameda whipsnake (masticophis lateralis euryxanthus) at the Site 300 facilities of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/8320}}</ref>\n\n== Current conservation efforts ==\n\n=== ESA listing history ===\nThe Alameda Whipsnake was first listed as a [[threatened species]] under the [[California Endangered Species Act]] in 1971 and the US [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] listed it in 1997. The first 5 year review was established in 2011 and recommended no change from current listing. The [[California Environmental Quality Act]] and [[California Endangered Species Act]] afforded the Alameda Whipsnake some conservation benefits prior to its being federally listed, but these laws by themselves were far from adequate to protect the species. The listing of the Alameda Whipsnake as a federally threatened species will increase the ability of public land agencies to promote conservation and management plans that take into consideration the specialized environmental and biological needs of this snake. These plans include an increased ability to conduct prescribed burns throughout the Whipsnake's range; control native, introduced, and feral predators; regulate recreational use, and develop educational programs for the benefit of the Alameda Whipsnake.

Lateralis Euryxanthus), also known as the Alameda Striped Racer is a threatened species of colubrid snake distinguishable by its broad head, large eyes, black and orange coloring with a yellow stripe down each side, and a slender neck. The California Whipsnake is found in California\u2019s northern and coastal chaparral. The Alameda Whipsnake is a wary creature known for its speed and climbing abilities utilized when escaping predators or hunting prey. In winter months, the Alameda Whipsnake hibernates in rock crevices and rodent burrows. \n\nSince 1992, the Alameda Whipsnakes have been eliminated from 35 of 60 historical localities. The snake was first collected by Archie Mossman and later described by Riemer <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Riemer|first=William J.|date=1954-02-19|title=A New Subspecies of the Snake Masticophis lateralis from California|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1440636|journal=Copeia|volume=1954|issue=1|pages=45|doi=10.2307/1440636|issn=0045-8511}}</ref> in 1954. Unlike the major species, the California Whipsnake, the Alameda Whipsnake has been reduced to just five areas with little or no interchange due to habitat loss, alteration, and fragmentation. The biggest threat to the Alameda Whipsnake is human development in the snake\u2019s habitat. Urban sprawl is increasing at a rapid rate, and introducing the snake to direct alteration like construction of development, and indirect like pets and public recreation. \n\nThe [[California Environmental Quality Act]] and [[California Endangered Species Act]] afforded the Alameda Whipsnake some conservation benefits prior to the federal listing, but these laws by themselves were far from adequate to protect the species. The listing of the Alameda whipsnake as a federally threatened species increases the ability of public land agencies to promote conservation and management plans that take into consideration the specialized environmental and biological needs of this snake. \n<br />\n\n= Behavior =\n\n=== <u>Diet</u> ===\nThe Alameda Whipsnake is a [[Diurnality|diurnal]] [[ectotherm]] that is often seen foraging in the daytime. As it searches for food, the head and the front half of the body are held off of the ground for the most optimal vision to find prey. The snake has two seasonal peaks in activity, one during the spring mating season and the other during late summer or early fall. In the spring, males tend to forage and search for mates while females stay in hibernation. Female peak activity only tends to be a few days in the spring when they are looking for egg laying sites. When the Alameda Striped Racer finds prey like the [[Western fence lizard|Western Fence Lizard]] (Sceloporus occidentalis) or the [[Western skink|Western Skink]] (Eumeces skiltonianus), it takes the prey quickly, holds it tight under the loops of its body and swallows it whole without constriction. Alameda Whipsnakes are great climbers and are able to quickly move through trees and shrubs to hunt prey or escape predators (US Fish and Wildlife 2006).<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2019-06|title=Full Issue PDF|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/1944-687x-10.1.1b|journal=Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1\u20131|doi=10.3996/1944-687x-10.1.1b|issn=1944-687X}}</ref>\n\n=== <u>Reproduction</u> ===\nCourtship and mating are observed from late March through mid-June. During this time males move around throughout their home ranges, but females appear to remain at or near their [[Hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernacula]], where mating occurs. Female egg laying sites are typically located in grasslands with scattered shrub habitat. Copulation commences soon after emergence from winter hibernacula (Swaim 1994). Females begin laying eggs in mid-late May. Average clutch size is just greater than 7 eggs with a significant correlation between body size and clutch size (Goldberg 1975).

During the [[Cretaceous period]] (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by [[calcium carbonate]] and formations left by the evaporation of water called [[evaporites]].<ref>Randazzo and Jones, pp. 13\u201325.</ref> What covers the peninsula is the result of simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather.<ref>Randazzo and Jones, pp. 1\u20133.</ref> As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into [[limestone]]; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]]. As ocean water retreated, [[lagoon]]s formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water.<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 4.</ref> [[Barrier island]]s, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.<ref name=\"benke100\"/>\n\nFrom its origins to approximately the area of Sanford, the St. Johns flows north.<ref name=\"randazzo12\">Randazzo and Jones, p. 12.</ref> It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles\u2014which is referred to as the ''St. Johns River offset'', but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late [[Tertiary]] or early [[Pleistocene]] era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset.<ref name=\"randazzo12\"/> Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by [[Pangaea]]n [[rifting]].<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 217.</ref>\n\n=== Springs and aquifers ===\n[[File:Florida groundwater cycle.gif|alt=Cross section illustration of the hydrologic cycle in Florida, including the Floridan aquifer and formation of springs and sinkholes|thumb|left|350 px|The hydrologic cycle in Florida, showing the [[Floridan aquifer]] and formation of springs and sinkholes]]\n\nAll of Florida's abundant fresh water is the result of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called [[evapotranspiration]] that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers.<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 69.</ref> However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in [[aquifers]]. A [[surficial aquifer]] consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content.<ref name=\"spechler\"/> Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The [[Floridan Aquifer]], underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible in the northern part of Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] north to Jacksonville and [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 82.</ref>\n\nAcidic rainwater erodes the limestone and can form caverns. When the overlay of these caverns is particularly thin\u2014less than {{convert|100|ft|m}}\u2014[[sinkhole]]s can form. Where the limestone or sand/clay overlay dissolves over the aquifer and the pressure of the water pushes out, springs form. The upper and middle basins of the St. Johns River are located in a portion of the peninsula where the aquifer system is thinly confined, meaning springs and sinkholes are abundant. Springs are measured in magnitude of how much water is discharged, which is dependent upon season and rainfall. The greatest discharge is from first magnitude springs that emit at least {{convert|100|cuft|m3}} of water per second.

The clashes between American and Seminole forces during the establishment of the [[Florida territory]] are reflected in the towns and landmarks along the St. Johns named for those who were directly involved. Even before Florida was under U.S. jurisdiction, Major General [[Andrew Jackson]] was responsible for removing the Alachua Seminoles west of the [[Suwannee River]], either killing them or forcing them farther south towards Lake County, in 1818. Jackson's efforts became the [[First Seminole War]], and were rewarded by the naming of a cattle crossing across a wide portion of the St. Johns near the Georgia border\u2014previously named Cowford\u2014to Jacksonville. The result of Jackson's offensive was the transfer of Florida to the U.S.<ref>Gannon, pp. 191\u2013192.</ref><ref group=note>Lake Monroe on the St. Johns was named for President [[James Monroe]], who persuaded the U.S. government to finance the First Seminole War. As American settlers trickled in to farms and homesteads in north and central Florida, they came into increased conflict with several Seminole bands for food and sometimes took the Seminoles as slaves. The [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]] in 1823 placed Seminoles on a reservation near Lake Okeechobee, but further U.S. policy strongly encouraged them to leave Florida for [[Indian Territory]] in what would become Oklahoma. (Tebeau, p. 156.) by 1835, the Seminoles rebelled, inspired and led by [[Osceola]], whose name is one of the most widely used for landmarks and structures in the state. (McCarthy, p. 17.) Lake Jesup's namesake is the American military leader in Florida, Major General [[Thomas Jesup]], who captured Osceola in 1837. Lake Harney was named for Brigadier General [[William S. Harney]], who led several raids against Seminoles in west and south Florida. (McCarthy, p. 12.)</ref> Following the Seminole Wars, a gradual increase in commerce and population occurred on the St. Johns, made possible by steamship travel. [[Steamboat]]s heralded a heyday for the river, and before the advent of local railroads, they were the only way to reach interior portions of the state. They also afforded the citizens of Jacksonville a pastime to watch competing races.<ref>Cabell, pp. 237\u2013250.</ref> By the 1860s, weekly trips between Jacksonville, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] were made to transport tourists, lumber, cotton, and citrus. The soil along the St. Johns was considered especially successful for producing sweeter oranges.<ref>Cabell, p. 242.</ref>\n\n[[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida's involvement]] in the [[U.S. Civil War]] was limited compared to other [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] because it had a fraction of the populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the {{USS|Columbine|1862|6}}, a Union [[paddle steamer]] used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces under the command of Capt. [[John Jackson Dickison]] captured, burned, and sank the USS ''Columbine'', making her perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy.<ref>McCarthy, pp. 75\u201376.</ref><ref>Cabell, pp. 213\u2013215.</ref> The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sank a Union boat, the ''[[Maple Leaf (shipwreck)|Maple Leaf]]'', which struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into the muck near [[Julington Creek]], south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War-era artifacts, including [[daguerreotype]]s and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.<ref>McCarthy, pp. 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Spanish had colonized Florida for two centuries, the state remained the last part of the east coast of the United States to be developed and explored.<ref name=\"McCarthy, p. 20\"/> Following the Civil War, the State of Florida was too far in debt to build roads and rail lines to further its progress. Florida Governor [[William Bloxham]] in 1881 appealed directly to a Pennsylvania-based industrialist named [[Hamilton Disston]], initially to build canals to improve steamboat passage through the [[Caloosahatchee River]], and later to drain lands in the central part of the state for agriculture. Disston was furthermore persuaded to purchase {{convert|4000000|acre|km2}} of land in central Florida for $1 million, which at the time was reported to be the largest purchase of land in human history. Disston was ultimately unsuccessful in his drainage attempts, but his investment sparked the tourist industry and made possible the efforts of railroad magnates [[Henry Morrison Flagler]] and [[Henry Bradley Plant]] to construct rail lines down the east coast of Florida, including a rail link between Sanford and Tampa. Disston was responsible for creating the towns of [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]], [[St. Cloud, Florida|St. Cloud]], and several others on the west coast of Florida.<ref>Lemar, L.

A spate of poor luck and tense British-American relations followed, prompting Fell to spend some years investing in infrastructure in [[Siberia]], but he returned in 1909 with ideas of developing wetlands in central Florida. He was further encouraged by the political promises of Governor [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]] to [[Draining and development of the Everglades|drain the Everglades]] during his 1904 campaign. In 1910 Fell purchased {{convert|118000|acre|km2}} of land for $1.35 an acre and started the Fellsmere Farms Company to drain the St. Johns Marsh in 1911 and send water into the [[Indian River Lagoon]], promoting the engineered canals and other structures as wondrously efficient in providing land to build a massive metropolis.<ref>Belleville, p. 15.</ref> Some progress was made initially, including the establishment of the town of [[Fellsmere, Florida|Fellsmere]] in which land was sold for $100 an acre, but sales lagged because of a scandal regarding land sale fraud and faulty draining reports from the Everglades.

The Florida Peninsula was created primarily by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a [[Basement rock|basement]] of [[igneous]] [[granite]] and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the [[Paleozoic era]] 542 to 251 million years ago. During the [[Cretaceous period]] (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by [[calcium carbonate]] and formations left by the evaporation of water called [[evaporites]].<ref>Randazzo and Jones, pp. 13\u201325.</ref> What covers the peninsula is the result of simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather.<ref>Randazzo and Jones, pp. 1\u20133.</ref> As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into [[limestone]]; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]]. As ocean water retreated, [[lagoon]]s formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water.<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 4.</ref> [[Barrier island]]s, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.<ref name=\"benke100\"/>\n\nFrom its origins to approximately the area of Sanford, the St. Johns flows north.<ref name=\"randazzo12\">Randazzo and Jones, p. 12.</ref> It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles\u2014which is referred to as the ''St. Johns River offset'', but shortly changes direction to flow north again.

Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset.<ref name=\"randazzo12\"/> Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by [[Pangaea]]n [[rifting]].<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 217.</ref>\n\n=== Springs and aquifers ===\n[[File:Florida groundwater cycle.gif|alt=Cross section illustration of the hydrologic cycle in Florida, including the Floridan aquifer and formation of springs and sinkholes|thumb|left|350 px|The hydrologic cycle in Florida, showing the [[Floridan aquifer]] and formation of springs and sinkholes]]\n\nAll of Florida's abundant fresh water is the result of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called [[evapotranspiration]] that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers.<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 69.</ref> However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in [[aquifers]]. A [[surficial aquifer]] consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content.<ref name=\"spechler\"/> Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The [[Floridan Aquifer]], underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible in the northern part of Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] north to Jacksonville and [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].<ref>Randazzo and Jones, p. 82.</ref>\n\nAcidic rainwater erodes the limestone and can form caverns. When the overlay of these caverns is particularly thin\u2014less than {{convert|100|ft|m}}\u2014[[sinkhole]]s can form. Where the limestone or sand/clay overlay dissolves over the aquifer and the pressure of the water pushes out, springs form.

Tides regularly affect water levels as far south as Lake George; when combined with extreme winds, the river's tidal effects can extend to Lake Monroe {{convert|161|mi|km}} away and have on occasion reached Lake Harney.<ref name=\"bourgerie\"/> Tides typically raise the river level about {{convert|1.2|ft|m}} at Jacksonville, decreasing some to {{convert|0.7|ft|m}} at [[Orange Park, Florida|Orange Park]] where the river widens, and increasing back to {{convert|1.2|ft|m}} at Palatka as it narrows. As a result of tidal effects, discharge measurements in the lower basin are often inaccurate. However, the estimated rate of discharge between the Ocklawaha River and the center of Jacksonville ranges from {{convert|4000|to|8300|cuft|m3}} per second.<ref name=\"spechler\"/> The nontidal discharge at the mouth at Mayport averages {{convert|15000|cuft|m3}} per second, but with tides it exceeds {{convert|50000|cuft|m3}} per second, and following heavy rains combined with tides can top {{convert|150000|cuft|m3}} per second.<ref name=\"bourgerie\"/> Farther upriver, the discharge rate ranges from {{convert|1030|cuft|m3}} per second near Lake Poinsett to {{convert|2850|cuft|m3}} per second near DeLand. The confluence of numerous springs, the Econlockhatchee River, and the Wekiva River causes the average discharge to increase by {{convert|940|cuft|m3}} per second between Lake Harney and DeLand, representing the greatest annual average increase of streamflow along the St. Johns.<ref name=\"kroening\"/>\n\nAs distance between the mouth of the St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the [[salinity]] in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35&nbsp;parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2&nbsp;ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40&nbsp;ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9&nbsp;ppt and falls again to 0.81&nbsp;ppt at the [[Shands Bridge]] near [[Green Cove Springs, Florida|Green Cove Springs]].<ref>[http://www.stjohnsriveralliance.com/waterwithdrawl.pdf \"Environmental Protection\"] (Power Point Presentation, slide 8), St. Johns River Water Management District, hosted at stjohnsriveralliance.com.

They were primarily hunter\u2013gatherers who followed large game, such as [[mastodon]]s, horses, camels, and bison. Much of the land was far from water\u2014most fresh water was contained in glaciers and polar ice caps. As a result, Florida was an arid landscape with few trees, dominated by grasslands and scrub vegetation.<ref>Gannon, p. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:Timucua owl totem.jpg|thumb|alt=A tall, wooden figure representing an owl on display indoors|upright|left|An extremely rare [[Timucua]] owl [[totem]], found buried in muck near [[Hontoon Island]], on display at [[Fort Caroline National Memorial]]]]\n\nAround 9,000 years ago, the climate warmed, melting much of the polar ice caps and many glaciers, creating a wetter environment and submerging half the peninsular shelf. As Paleo-Indians now did not have to travel as far to find water, their camps became more permanent, turning into villages. With evidence of a wide variety of tools constructed around this time, archeologists note the transition into [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic people]]. The Archaic people made tools from bone, animal teeth, and antlers. They wove fibers from plants such as cabbage palms and saw palmettos. A few burial sites have been excavated\u2014including the [[Windover Archaeological Site]] in Brevard County near [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]]\u2014that provide evidence of burial rituals.

Populations of indigenous people increased significantly at this time, and numerous settlements near the St. Johns have been recorded from this era; the banks of the St. Johns and its arteries are dotted with [[midden]]s filled with thousands of shells, primarily those of ''[[Viviparus georgianus]]''\u2014a freshwater snail\u2014and oysters.<ref>McCarthy, pp. 30\u201331.</ref><ref>Miller, p. 68.</ref>\n\nThe advent of regional types of pottery and stone tools made of flint or limestone marked further advancements around 500 [[Common Era|BCE]]. The Archaic people transitioned into settled groups around Florida. From the central part of the state north, along the Atlantic Coast lived people in the [[St. Johns culture]], named for the most significant nearby natural formation. Around 750 [[Common Era|CE]], the St. Johns culture learned to cultivate corn, adding to their diet of fish, game, and gourds. Archeologists and anthropologists date this agricultural advancement to coincide with a spread of archeological sites, suggesting that a population increase followed.<ref>Gannon, p. 6.</ref> When European explorers arrived in north Florida, they met the [[Timucua]], numbering about 14,000, the largest group of indigenous people in the region.<ref name=\"tebeau16\">Tebeau, p. 16.</ref> The later [[Seminole]] people called the river ''Welaka'' or ''Ylacco''. These forms may derive from the [[Creek language|Creek]] ''wi-l\u00e1ko'', \"big water\", a compound usually applied to large rivers that run through lakes; the St. Johns forms and borders numerous lakes. Alternately, the Seminole name may derive from ''walaka'' (from ''wi-alaka'', \"water\" and \"coming\"), perhaps a reference to the river's slow discharge and the tidal effects on it.

Early Spanish explorers named the river ''Rio de Corientes'' (River of Currents).<ref name=\"epa2\"/> The St. Johns River became the first place colonized in the region and its first battleground: when French explorer [[Jean Ribault]] erected a monument south of the river's mouth to make the French presence known, it alarmed the Spanish who had been exploring the southern and western coast of the peninsula for decades.<ref name=\"gannon41-46\">Gannon, pp. 41\u201346.</ref><ref name=\"tebeau29-35\">Tebeau, pp. 29\u201335.</ref> Ribault was detained after he returned to Europe.\n\nIn 1564, [[Ren\u00e9 Goulaine de Laudonni\u00e8re]] arrived to build [[Fort Caroline]] at the mouth of the St. Johns River; they called the river ''Rivi\u00e8re de Mai'' because they settled it on May 1.<ref>Gannon, p. 42.</ref> An artist named [[Jacques LeMoyne]] documented what he saw among the Timucuan people in 1564, portraying them as physically powerful and not lacking for provisions.<ref name=\"tebeau16\"/> Fort Caroline did not last long, though relations with the local [[Timucua]] and [[Mocama]]s were friendly. The colony was unable to support itself; some of the French deserted.

The Timucua, who had initially befriended the French, were not encouraged to make the Spanish allies because of colonial governor [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]]' abhorrence of [[Huguenot|French Protestantism]] and his view that the Timucuan beliefs were \"Satanic\".<ref>Gannon, p. 49.</ref> By 1573, the Timucua were in outright rebellion, testing the governor's patience and forcing Spanish settlers to abandon farms and garrisons in more interior parts of Florida; the Spanish could not persuade the Timucua to keep from attacking them.<ref>Gannon, p. 57.</ref>\n\nOver a hundred years later, missionaries had more success, setting up posts along the river. Spanish Franciscan missionaries gave the river its current name based on ''[[San Juan del Puerto, Florida|San Juan del Puerto]]'' (St. John of the Harbor), the [[Mission (station)|mission]] established at the river's mouth following the demise of the French fort. The name first appeared on a Spanish map created between 1680 and 1700.<ref>Cabell, p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe Timucua, as other groups of indigenous people in Florida, began to lose cohesion and numbers by the 18th century.<ref group=note>In 1717, some of the groups were reorganized by the colonial governor; 248 Timucua were counted. The restructuring also included [[Yamasee]], Mocama, [[Apalachee]], and [[Guale]]: in total no more than 1,500 Indians remained in north Florida. Disease and violent conflicts with the Spanish and other tribes continued to decrease their numbers, and by 1763, 100 of the last remaining indigenous people of Florida chose to be relocated to Cuba with the Spanish. (Gannon, p. 94.)</ref> A tribe located in modern-day Georgia and Alabama called the [[Creek (people)|Creeks]] assisted with this; in 1702, they joined with the Yamasee and attacked some of the Timucua, forcing them to seek protection from the Spanish who forced them into slavery.<ref>Gannon, p. 186.</ref> The Creeks began assimilating other people and spread farther south until they were known by 1765 as [[Seminole]]s by the British, a term adapted from ''cimarrones'' that meant \"runaways\" or \"wild ones\".<ref>Gannon, p. 183.</ref> The Seminoles employed a variety of languages from the peoples the Creeks had assimilated: [[Hitchiti]], [[Muskogee language|Muskogee]], as well as Timucua. Between 1716 and 1767, the Seminoles gradually moved into Florida and began to break ties with the Creeks to become a cohesive tribe of their own.<ref>Gannon, p. 187.</ref> The St. Johns provided a natural boundary to separate European colonies on the east bank and indigenous lands west of the river.<ref>Miller, pp. 152\u2013153.</ref>\n\n[[File:William Bartram sketch of alligators on the St Johns River.jpg|thumb|alt=An incomplete drawing of two alligators partially submerged and rearing their heads out of the water, one with a fish in its mouth; some plants and a log are included in the foreground|left|[[William Bartram]]'s sketch of alligators on the St. Johns, created either in 1773 or 1774]]\nAfter Florida came under the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]'s jurisdiction in 1763, [[Quaker]] father and son naturalists [[John Bartram|John]] and [[William Bartram]] explored the length of the river while visiting the southeastern United States from 1765 to 1766.

Michaux was followed by [[William Baldwin (botanist)|William Baldwin]] between 1811 and 1817.

A former loyalist to Britain who left [[South Carolina]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], a planter and slave trader named [[Zephaniah Kingsley]] seized the opportunity and built a plantation named Laurel Grove near what is now [[Doctors Lake (Florida)|Doctors Lake]], close to the west bank of the St. Johns River, south of where [[Orange Park, Florida|Orange Park]] is today.<ref>Schafer, p. 21.</ref> Three years later, Kingsley took a trip to Cuba and purchased a 13-year-old [[Wolof people|Wolof]] girl named [[Anna Kingsley|Anna Madgigine Jai]].

The clashes between American and Seminole forces during the establishment of the [[Florida territory]] are reflected in the towns and landmarks along the St. Johns named for those who were directly involved. Even before Florida was under U.S. jurisdiction, Major General [[Andrew Jackson]] was responsible for removing the Alachua Seminoles west of the [[Suwannee River]], either killing them or forcing them farther south towards Lake County, in 1818. Jackson's efforts became the [[First Seminole War]], and were rewarded by the naming of a cattle crossing across a wide portion of the St. Johns near the Georgia border\u2014previously named Cowford\u2014to Jacksonville. The result of Jackson's offensive was the transfer of Florida to the U.S.<ref>Gannon, pp. 191\u2013192.</ref><ref group=note>Lake Monroe on the St. Johns was named for President [[James Monroe]], who persuaded the U.S. government to finance the First Seminole War. As American settlers trickled in to farms and homesteads in north and central Florida, they came into increased conflict with several Seminole bands for food and sometimes took the Seminoles as slaves. The [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]] in 1823 placed Seminoles on a reservation near Lake Okeechobee, but further U.S. policy strongly encouraged them to leave Florida for [[Indian Territory]] in what would become Oklahoma. (Tebeau, p. 156.) by 1835, the Seminoles rebelled, inspired and led by [[Osceola]], whose name is one of the most widely used for landmarks and structures in the state. (McCarthy, p. 17.) Lake Jesup's namesake is the American military leader in Florida, Major General [[Thomas Jesup]], who captured Osceola in 1837. Lake Harney was named for Brigadier General [[William S. Harney]], who led several raids against Seminoles in west and south Florida. (McCarthy, p. 12.)</ref> Following the Seminole Wars, a gradual increase in commerce and population occurred on the St. Johns, made possible by steamship travel. [[Steamboat]]s heralded a heyday for the river, and before the advent of local railroads, they were the only way to reach interior portions of the state. They also afforded the citizens of Jacksonville a pastime to watch competing races.<ref>Cabell, pp. 237\u2013250.</ref> By the 1860s, weekly trips between Jacksonville, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] were made to transport tourists, lumber, cotton, and citrus. The soil along the St. Johns was considered especially successful for producing sweeter oranges.<ref>Cabell, p. 242.</ref>\n\n[[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida's involvement]] in the [[U.S. Civil War]] was limited compared to other [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] because it had a fraction of the populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the {{USS|Columbine|1862|6}}, a Union [[paddle steamer]] used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces under the command of Capt. [[John Jackson Dickison]] captured, burned, and sank the USS ''Columbine'', making her perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy.<ref>McCarthy, pp. 75\u201376.</ref><ref>Cabell, pp. 213\u2013215.</ref> The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sank a Union boat, the ''[[Maple Leaf (shipwreck)|Maple Leaf]]'', which struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into the muck near [[Julington Creek]], south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War-era artifacts, including [[daguerreotype]]s and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.<ref>McCarthy, pp. 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Spanish had colonized Florida for two centuries, the state remained the last part of the east coast of the United States to be developed and explored.<ref name=\"McCarthy, p. 20\"/> Following the Civil War, the State of Florida was too far in debt to build roads and rail lines to further its progress. Florida Governor [[William Bloxham]] in 1881 appealed directly to a Pennsylvania-based industrialist named [[Hamilton Disston]], initially to build canals to improve steamboat passage through the [[Caloosahatchee River]], and later to drain lands in the central part of the state for agriculture. Disston was furthermore persuaded to purchase {{convert|4000000|acre|km2}} of land in central Florida for $1 million, which at the time was reported to be the largest purchase of land in human history. Disston was ultimately unsuccessful in his drainage attempts, but his investment sparked the tourist industry and made possible the efforts of railroad magnates [[Henry Morrison Flagler]] and [[Henry Bradley Plant]] to construct rail lines down the east coast of Florida, including a rail link between Sanford and Tampa. Disston was responsible for creating the towns of [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]], [[St. Cloud, Florida|St. Cloud]], and several others on the west coast of Florida.<ref>Lemar, L.

Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]]. Subject-verb inversion occurs most often in written works, being rare in speech.<ref name=\"collins\">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Chris |last2=Branigan |first2=Phil |title=Quotative Inversion |journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory |date=February 1997 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1023/A:1005722729974 }}</ref> Quotations may appear before the inverted verb, but can also appear after the subject,<ref name=\"bruening\">{{cite journal |last1=Bruening |first1=Benjamin |title=Alignment in Syntax: Quotative Inversion in English |journal=Syntax |date=15 April 2016 |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=113 |doi=10.1111/synt.12121 }}</ref> such as: ''\"I am going to follow you all the rest of my life,\" declared the man'' <ref name=\"bruening\"/> and ''Said the woman: \"I see you with both my eyes.\"''<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n\n====Syntax====\nIn syntactic terms, these direct quotations can be presented in two forms. The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn American English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English as well (e.g. ''be like'' in New Zealand English,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Brian |title=\"All us girls were like euuh!\": Conversational work of be like in New Zealand adolescent talk |journal=New Zealand English Journal |date=2010 |volume=24 |pages=17\u201336 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249335742_All_us_girls_were_like_euuh_Conversational_work_of_be_like_in_New_Zealand_adolescent_talk |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> ''be like'' and ''go'' in [[Glasgow]] English<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>).<ref name=\"frederica\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117\u2013128}}</ref> Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n:: d. He''''s all''' \"Okay, come with me come with me\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency,<ref name=\"frederica\"/> though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n=====Japanese=====\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker AKK=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || AKK || hated || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi''''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]]. Subject-verb inversion occurs most often in written works, being rare in speech.<ref name=\"collins\">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Chris |last2=Branigan |first2=Phil |title=Quotative Inversion |journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory |date=February 1997 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1023/A:1005722729974 }}</ref> Quotations may appear before the inverted verb, but can also appear after the subject,<ref name=\"bruening\">{{cite journal |last1=Bruening |first1=Benjamin |title=Alignment in Syntax: Quotative Inversion in English |journal=Syntax |date=15 April 2016 |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=113 |doi=10.1111/synt.12121 }}</ref> such as: ''\"I am going to follow you all the rest of my life,\" declared the man'' <ref name=\"bruening\"/> and ''Said the woman: \"I see you with both my eyes.\"''<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n\n====Syntax====\nIn syntactic terms, these direct quotations can be presented in two forms. The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation).

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n:: d.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe '''told''' us '''that''' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\nThe newer quotative verb ''be like'' in English is used to only introduce direct quotations. ''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation. It differs from the English structures in that it uses an overt quantifier ''zoiets'' to be [[grammaticality|well-formed]].<ref name=\"haddican et al\">{{cite journal |last1=Haddican |first1=William |last2=Zweig |first2=Eytan |last3=Johnson |first3=Daniel Ezra |title=The syntax of be like quotatives |journal=Proceedings of the 29th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics |date=2012 |page=81-89 |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/29/paper2690.pdf}}</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways: through grammatical marking, additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or systematic affixes of verbs. Quotative readings of evidentials are typologically rare. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows  the source of the quotation is from elsewhere, but this is not a quotative reading as there is no direct performative quoting or verbs of saying. Languages including Cuzco Quechua, Kham, Tagalog, and Kaalallisut are documented as containing quotative evidentials.

It includes the areas of [[Plantsville, Connecticut|Plantsville]], [[Marion, Connecticut|Marion]] and [[Milldale (Southington)|Milldale]], each of which has its own post office and distinct architecture. The town rests in a valley of two mountains on its east and west sides. The town is located along exits 28 through 32 of [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|Interstate 84]], exit 4 of [[Interstate 691]], and bisected by [[Connecticut Route 10]]. Southington has the nickname of \"The Apple Valley\", due to the many orchards that still dot its landscape. The [[Quinnipiac River]] flows through the town. It is home to Mount Southington ski area, which has drawn visitors since the 1960s.\n\nSouthington is located at [[geographical coordinates]] 41\u00b0 35\u2032 48\" North, 72\u00b0 52\u2032 40\" West (41.596588, -72.87767).

The most well-known geological formation in the area is one of several in the world known as the Great Unconformity.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nLocated less than one mile northwest of the Great Unconformity on Southington Mountain is Hushak Rock, known informally for decades as White Rock. The overlook has expansive views of the region and can be seen from much of Route 229 and area neighborhoods. The state of Connecticut officially named Hushak Rock in 2017 for longtime Southington civic leader and World War II pilot Walter J. Hushak (b. 1923).\n\n==History==\nAlthough Southington was formally established as a town in 1779, its roots go back to a much earlier time. Samuel Woodruff, Southington's first white settler, moved from [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] to the area then known as \"Panthorne\" that was settled in 1698 and the land was formerly occupied by the  [[Tunxis]] or Sepores Indians.<ref>(Morgan 1904:50)http://www.fosa-ct.org/Reprints/Spring2010_CTIndians.htm</ref> The settlement grew, prospered, and came to be known as \"South Farmington\" and then later, the shortened version, Southington.\n\nThe town's most important early visitor was General [[George Washington]], who passed through the town in 1770 on his way to Wethersfield.\n\nThe Marion section of Southington is one of the most historic places in the town. It is the site of an encampment by the great French general, [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau]], and his troops during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In June 1781, the French troops under Rochambeau's command left Farmington and marched {{convert|13|mi}} to their eighth camp through Connecticut, near [[Asa Barnes Tavern]] in the Marion section of Southington, now the [[Marion Historic District (Cheshire and Southington, Connecticut)|Marion Historic District]].\n\nThey camped there for four days. Rochambeau and his officers took shelter in the tavern, and the troops set up camp on a hill on the other side of the road. The area of the encampment has since become known as French Hill, and a marker on the east side of Marion Avenue commemorates the French campsite.  According to Rev. Timlow's ''Sketches of Southington'' (1875), \"Landlord Barnes gave a ball at his tavern, at which a large number of the young women of the vicinity were present; and they esteemed it something of an honor to have had a 'cotillion' with the polite foreigner.\" The celebrations-infused with spirits provided by Landlord Barnes-spanned the four nights they were in Southington. Rochambeau revisited Barnes's Tavern on the return march on October 27, 1782. According to Timlow, coins, buttons and other things were picked up in the vicinity many years after the two encampments. The Asa Barnes Tavern is now a private residence very near the camp site at 1089 Marion Avenue.\n\nSouthington originally was a small, rural farming community. In the early 1900s, Southington developed as a manufacturing center, but still maintained a very small population of a few thousand residents. Some of the products invented there include the first [[cement]] that was able to harden under water, the first carriage bolt cutting machine, the break-neck rat trap, and a new tinware process.\n\nWith the overall decline of industry in [[New England]], and the construction of [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] in the mid 1960s, Southington developed into a [[bedroom community]] in which the town saw explosive growth and a population that has surged to over 42,000 today. 28% of the workers in Southington are still employed in manufacturing, most of them in the production of fabricated [[metal]]s and [[aircraft]].\n\nIn May 1942, during [[World War II]], the town was selected by the War Department to be highlighted in a defense booklet called ''Southington, CT\u2014Microcosm of America.'' Photographers roamed the community taking photos of residents at work, at play and in their homes and churches. The final publication was intended to show friends and foes alike in Europe the typical American citizens and families, their traditions and values. Thousands of copies were dropped from military airplanes over Europe during the Nazi German Occupation. Also in 1942 the mural, ''Romance of Southington'', was painted in the town post office by [[Ann Hunt Spence]]. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the [[United States]] through the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]], later called the [[Section of Fine Arts]], of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]. The [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] was the largest and most ambitious American [[New Deal agency]], employing individuals to carry out [[public works]] projects.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arnesen |first=Eric |date=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History |volume=1 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=1540 |isbn=9780415968263}}</ref>\n\nEach year, Southington is home to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090426105705/http://www.southington.org/content/2028/default.aspx Apple Harvest Festival], an effort to bring together local businesses and denizens from the area and surrounding cities. This has been a tradition of the town since 1969, generally spanning six weekdays and two weekends. Its highlights include a town parade, carnival rides and games, musical performances, and a wide selection of unique recipes and foods served by community cornerstones including the [[Boy Scouts of America]], local churches, the [[Southington Fire Department]] and Police Department, the [[Rotary International|Southington Rotary Chapter]], and the  Southington Jaycees. Southington is home to several farms and apple orchards, including [[Rogers Orchards]], the largest in the state.\n\nTwo of Southington's main state roads are ceremonially named for notable residents. Southington's portion of Route 10 is named the Louis G. Tolles Memorial Highway for the late state Grange leader and legislator (1885\u20131956). The road was dedicated on Aug. 6, 1960, and rededicated with new signs on Oct. 6, 2007. A section of [[Connecticut Route 364|Route 364]] (Oakland Road and Berlin Street) was dedicated as the Officer Timothy Foley Memorial Highway on Sept. 11, 2009, in honor of the first (and to date the only) Southington police officer killed in the line of duty. He died six days after being struck by a vehicle on Dec. 30, 1937.\n\nIn January 2011, John Weichsel retired as town manager after 44 years. He was hired by the first Town Council when the council/manager form of government was established in town in 1966. His tenure as a town manager in the same community is one of the longest in the United States.  Weichsel died in 2013. The municipal center at 196-200 North Main St. is named in his honor. <gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Photos\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:SouthingtonPlanstvilleGreen.JPG|The Plantsville Green\nFile:PostcardSouthingtonCTPeckStowAndWilcoxFactory1910.jpg|The Wilcox Factory located in Southington, in 1910.\nFile:Asa Barnes Tavern.jpg|[[Levi B.

The median age was 43.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.1 males.\n\nAs of 2015, the median income for a household in the town is $82,704, and the median income for a family is $102,775. Households in Southington are relatively affluent with 41.9% of its households earning above $100,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_5YR_S1901&prodType=table|title=American FactFinder - Results|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=factfinder.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200214060757/https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_5YR_S1901&prodType=table|archive-date=2020-02-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[per capita income]] for the town was $36,682 according to the 2010 census.

About 2.2% of families and 3.5% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.0% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Revitalization==\n\nAs industry in the area declined, many old factories and buildings were left vacant. The latest to close was [[Ideal Forging]], which filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and vacated its building in the town center. In 2005, Meridian Development Partners of New York City purchased the land with plans to transform the former factory site into homes and retail space.<ref name=\"Ideal Forging Now Piles of Rubble On Vacant Site\">{{cite news| url=http://www.courant.com/community/southington/hc-southington-greenway-commons-0910-20150909-story.html| title=Greenway Commons| newspaper=Hartford Courant| accessdate=May 14, 2017}}</ref> Demolition of the factory began in October 2014.\n\nSouthington has taken the initiative to spur its own revitalization. In 2002, the town completed the downtown renaissance project. This project replaced the sidewalks on Main Street and Center Street with granite curbing and brick paving stones. Lifelong resident and philanthropist Robert Petroske donated $50,000 to the revitalization effort which led to the installation of decorative iron lamp posts, benches, and garbage cans. Flowering trees were planted, and a former fountain and light fixture was restored and relocated from Recreation Park (where it had been moved in 1961) to the town center. A renaissance zone was created where private business owners in the zone could apply to the town to continue the project of granite, brick pavers, and lamp posts, of which the town would pay the difference of replacement concrete sidewalks versus the more expensive brick. The extension of brick pavers from Center Street to a section on the east side of Liberty Street was completed in July 2008 to connect with the pavers installed outside the new Liberty Square office building.\n\nThe town water department, which built a new facility on West Queen Street in 2002, demolished its former facility located between Mill and High streets in June 2008 and developed the land into a landscaped park, along with a continuation of the sidewalks, iron fences and decorative lamp posts. The old water facility abuts the linear walking trail.\n\nThe linear trail opened to the public in the summer of 2003. This trail was built over the town's old rail line which had ceased operation several years earlier. Dubbed the [[Farmington Canal Trail|Farmington Canal Greenway]], when completed it will stretch from [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], following the route of the historical [[Farmington Canal]]. The second phase of construction on the trail, which officially opened in 2011, redeveloped the old train line from Plantsville center to the [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]] town line. The project has brought landscaping, iron benches, and intersections of brick pavers where the trail crosses roads. This is seen as a major link for the further revitalization of downtown Southington and Plantsville. Eventually the trail will connect with the Cheshire-to-New Haven route.\n\n== Lake Compounce ==\n[[Lake Compounce]] is partly in Southington, and Bristol. Founded in 1846, it is the oldest amusement park in the US.\n\n==Schools==\n\nSouthington has eight public elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school.<ref name=\"Southington Public School Directory\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.southingtonschools.org/page.cfm?p=8057| title=Southington Public School Directory| publisher=Southington.org| accessdate=May 14, 2017}}</ref> It also has an alternative school for children in grades 8-12 called ALTA. Approximately 6,500 students are enrolled in Southington public schools, making it one of the larger districts in the state of Connecticut. [[Southington High School]] has a growing enrollment exceeding 2,200 students, of which 90% of graduates attend post-secondary education. Southington High School is known to be a very consumed with drugs and bad teachers. The school only cares about sports an their reputation and not really the students. As long as the school looks good, everything is okay.\n\nDue to Southington's popularity as a family suburb, the town has undertaken plans to expand all schools to accommodate the growing enrollment. Three elementary schools have been completed, and a new building and second cafeteria has been added to the high school campus. Voters recently approved expansion and renovations to two other elementary schools (with one to be demolished and rebuilt), as well as to the two middle schools.\n\nSouthington also has two parochial schools; Southington Catholic is pre-kindergarten through eighth and the other, Central Christian Academy is pre-kindergarten through twelfth.\n\n===Elementary schools===\n* Walter A.

Following its creation, public transportation can now connect Southington residents to [[Waterbury (Metro-North station)|Waterbury station]] and the [[Metro-North Railroad]], providing service to [[Bridgeport]] and ultimately [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and [[New York City]].\n\n===Highways===\nSouthington is home to several highways, including [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]], also known as '''The Yankee Expressway''', and [[Interstate 691]].\n\n==Parks and recreation==\nSouthington boasts a fair share of large parks and open land, each serving several outdoor activities, and as a whole, a vast array of them.\n\n'''Public'''\n* Crescent Lake\n* Panthorn Park\n* Recreation Park\n* Southington Dog Park\n* Soltys Pond\n* Southington Little League Fields\n* Veterans Memorial Park\n\n'''Recreation'''\n* [[Mount Southington]] Ski Resort\n* Southington Country Club\n* Hawks Landing Country Club\n* North Ridge Golf Club (Formerly Pine Valley Golf Course)\n* [[Metacomet Trail]]\n* [[Ragged Mountain (Connecticut)|Ragged Mountain]]\n* Southington Community YMCA\n* Lake Compounce\n\n==Notable people==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Anderson (sportscaster)|John Anderson]] (born 1965), ''SportsCenter'' anchor\n* [[Jim Aparo]] (1932\u20132005), comic book artist for D.C Comics\n* [[Tom Cichowski]] (1944\u20132015), football player\n* [[Jonathan Coachman]] (born 1972), \"Sportscenter\" anchor and former WWE authority figure\n* [[Ann Dandrow]] (1936-2017), educator and politician\n* [[Chris Denorfia]] (born 1980), baseball player\n* [[Rob Dibble]] (born 1964), baseball player, talk show host\n* [[Lisa Robin Kelly]] (1970\u20132013), actress \n* [[Marcus H.

It includes the areas of [[Plantsville, Connecticut|Plantsville]], [[Marion, Connecticut|Marion]] and [[Milldale (Southington)|Milldale]], each of which has its own post office and distinct architecture. The town rests in a valley of two mountains on its east and west sides. The town is located along exits 28 through 32 of [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|Interstate 84]], exit 4 of [[Interstate 691]], and bisected by [[Connecticut Route 10]]. Southington has the nickname of \"The Apple Valley\", due to the many orchards that still dot its landscape. The [[Quinnipiac River]] flows through the town. It is home to Mount Southington ski area, which has drawn visitors since the 1960s.\n\nSouthington is located at [[geographical coordinates]] 41\u00b0 35\u2032 48\" North, 72\u00b0 52\u2032 40\" West (41.596588, -72.87767). According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|94.9|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|93.0|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|1.9|km2|order=flip}}, or 1.99%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nThe [[Metacomet Ridge]], a rugged [[trap rock]] mountain ridge that extends from [[Long Island Sound]] to the [[Massachusetts]]/[[Vermont]] border, passes through Southington. Notable peaks along the ridge form the eastern edge of town: [[Bradley Mountain]], [[Ragged Mountain (Connecticut)|Ragged Mountain]], [[Short Mountain (Connecticut)|Short Mountain]], and part of the [[Hanging Hills]]. The ridge is traversed by the {{convert|51|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[Metacomet Trail]].\n\nSouthington's west ridge is rich with many [[geological formation]]s. This includes North Hamlin Brook, Roaring Brook, and Soltys Pond.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rdsmediallc.com/town-magazines/southington-magazine/|title=Southington Magazine {{!}} Print Advertising in Southington CT {{!}} RDS Media|work=RDS Media, LLC|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-US}}</ref>  Soltys Pond was named after Alexander Soltys, who settled in the area in 1713.  The most well-known geological formation in the area is one of several in the world known as the Great Unconformity.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nLocated less than one mile northwest of the Great Unconformity on Southington Mountain is Hushak Rock, known informally for decades as White Rock. The overlook has expansive views of the region and can be seen from much of Route 229 and area neighborhoods. The state of Connecticut officially named Hushak Rock in 2017 for longtime Southington civic leader and World War II pilot Walter J. Hushak (b. 1923).\n\n==History==\nAlthough Southington was formally established as a town in 1779, its roots go back to a much earlier time. Samuel Woodruff, Southington's first white settler, moved from [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] to the area then known as \"Panthorne\" that was settled in 1698 and the land was formerly occupied by the  [[Tunxis]] or Sepores Indians.<ref>(Morgan 1904:50)http://www.fosa-ct.org/Reprints/Spring2010_CTIndians.htm</ref> The settlement grew, prospered, and came to be known as \"South Farmington\" and then later, the shortened version, Southington.\n\nThe town's most important early visitor was General [[George Washington]], who passed through the town in 1770 on his way to Wethersfield.\n\nThe Marion section of Southington is one of the most historic places in the town. It is the site of an encampment by the great French general, [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau]], and his troops during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In June 1781, the French troops under Rochambeau's command left Farmington and marched {{convert|13|mi}} to their eighth camp through Connecticut, near [[Asa Barnes Tavern]] in the Marion section of Southington, now the [[Marion Historic District (Cheshire and Southington, Connecticut)|Marion Historic District]].\n\nThey camped there for four days. Rochambeau and his officers took shelter in the tavern, and the troops set up camp on a hill on the other side of the road. The area of the encampment has since become known as French Hill, and a marker on the east side of Marion Avenue commemorates the French campsite.  According to Rev. Timlow's ''Sketches of Southington'' (1875), \"Landlord Barnes gave a ball at his tavern, at which a large number of the young women of the vicinity were present; and they esteemed it something of an honor to have had a 'cotillion' with the polite foreigner.\" The celebrations-infused with spirits provided by Landlord Barnes-spanned the four nights they were in Southington. Rochambeau revisited Barnes's Tavern on the return march on October 27, 1782. According to Timlow, coins, buttons and other things were picked up in the vicinity many years after the two encampments. The Asa Barnes Tavern is now a private residence very near the camp site at 1089 Marion Avenue.\n\nSouthington originally was a small, rural farming community. In the early 1900s, Southington developed as a manufacturing center, but still maintained a very small population of a few thousand residents. Some of the products invented there include the first [[cement]] that was able to harden under water, the first carriage bolt cutting machine, the break-neck rat trap, and a new tinware process.\n\nWith the overall decline of industry in [[New England]], and the construction of [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] in the mid 1960s, Southington developed into a [[bedroom community]] in which the town saw explosive growth and a population that has surged to over 42,000 today. 28% of the workers in Southington are still employed in manufacturing, most of them in the production of fabricated [[metal]]s and [[aircraft]].\n\nIn May 1942, during [[World War II]], the town was selected by the War Department to be highlighted in a defense booklet called ''Southington, CT\u2014Microcosm of America.'' Photographers roamed the community taking photos of residents at work, at play and in their homes and churches. The final publication was intended to show friends and foes alike in Europe the typical American citizens and families, their traditions and values. Thousands of copies were dropped from military airplanes over Europe during the Nazi German Occupation. Also in 1942 the mural, ''Romance of Southington'', was painted in the town post office by [[Ann Hunt Spence]]. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the [[United States]] through the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]], later called the [[Section of Fine Arts]], of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]. The [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] was the largest and most ambitious American [[New Deal agency]], employing individuals to carry out [[public works]] projects.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arnesen |first=Eric |date=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History |volume=1 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=1540 |isbn=9780415968263}}</ref>\n\nEach year, Southington is home to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090426105705/http://www.southington.org/content/2028/default.aspx Apple Harvest Festival], an effort to bring together local businesses and denizens from the area and surrounding cities. This has been a tradition of the town since 1969, generally spanning six weekdays and two weekends. Its highlights include a town parade, carnival rides and games, musical performances, and a wide selection of unique recipes and foods served by community cornerstones including the [[Boy Scouts of America]], local churches, the [[Southington Fire Department]] and Police Department, the [[Rotary International|Southington Rotary Chapter]], and the  Southington Jaycees. Southington is home to several farms and apple orchards, including [[Rogers Orchards]], the largest in the state.\n\nTwo of Southington's main state roads are ceremonially named for notable residents. Southington's portion of Route 10 is named the Louis G. Tolles Memorial Highway for the late state Grange leader and legislator (1885\u20131956). The road was dedicated on Aug. 6, 1960, and rededicated with new signs on Oct. 6, 2007. A section of [[Connecticut Route 364|Route 364]] (Oakland Road and Berlin Street) was dedicated as the Officer Timothy Foley Memorial Highway on Sept. 11, 2009, in honor of the first (and to date the only) Southington police officer killed in the line of duty. He died six days after being struck by a vehicle on Dec. 30, 1937.\n\nIn January 2011, John Weichsel retired as town manager after 44 years. He was hired by the first Town Council when the council/manager form of government was established in town in 1966. His tenure as a town manager in the same community is one of the longest in the United States.  Weichsel died in 2013. The municipal center at 196-200 North Main St. is named in his honor. <gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Photos\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:SouthingtonPlanstvilleGreen.JPG|The Plantsville Green\nFile:PostcardSouthingtonCTPeckStowAndWilcoxFactory1910.jpg|The Wilcox Factory located in Southington, in 1910.\nFile:Asa Barnes Tavern.jpg|[[Levi B.

The average household size was 2.54 and the average family size was 3.01.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 23.8% under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 26.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.1 males.\n\nAs of 2015, the median income for a household in the town is $82,704, and the median income for a family is $102,775. Households in Southington are relatively affluent with 41.9% of its households earning above $100,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_5YR_S1901&prodType=table|title=American FactFinder - Results|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=factfinder.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200214060757/https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_5YR_S1901&prodType=table|archive-date=2020-02-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[per capita income]] for the town was $36,682 according to the 2010 census.

About 2.2% of families and 3.5% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.0% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Revitalization==\n\nAs industry in the area declined, many old factories and buildings were left vacant. The latest to close was [[Ideal Forging]], which filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and vacated its building in the town center. In 2005, Meridian Development Partners of New York City purchased the land with plans to transform the former factory site into homes and retail space.<ref name=\"Ideal Forging Now Piles of Rubble On Vacant Site\">{{cite news| url=http://www.courant.com/community/southington/hc-southington-greenway-commons-0910-20150909-story.html| title=Greenway Commons| newspaper=Hartford Courant| accessdate=May 14, 2017}}</ref> Demolition of the factory began in October 2014.\n\nSouthington has taken the initiative to spur its own revitalization. In 2002, the town completed the downtown renaissance project. This project replaced the sidewalks on Main Street and Center Street with granite curbing and brick paving stones. Lifelong resident and philanthropist Robert Petroske donated $50,000 to the revitalization effort which led to the installation of decorative iron lamp posts, benches, and garbage cans. Flowering trees were planted, and a former fountain and light fixture was restored and relocated from Recreation Park (where it had been moved in 1961) to the town center. A renaissance zone was created where private business owners in the zone could apply to the town to continue the project of granite, brick pavers, and lamp posts, of which the town would pay the difference of replacement concrete sidewalks versus the more expensive brick. The extension of brick pavers from Center Street to a section on the east side of Liberty Street was completed in July 2008 to connect with the pavers installed outside the new Liberty Square office building.\n\nThe town water department, which built a new facility on West Queen Street in 2002, demolished its former facility located between Mill and High streets in June 2008 and developed the land into a landscaped park, along with a continuation of the sidewalks, iron fences and decorative lamp posts. The old water facility abuts the linear walking trail.\n\nThe linear trail opened to the public in the summer of 2003. This trail was built over the town's old rail line which had ceased operation several years earlier. Dubbed the [[Farmington Canal Trail|Farmington Canal Greenway]], when completed it will stretch from [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], following the route of the historical [[Farmington Canal]]. The second phase of construction on the trail, which officially opened in 2011, redeveloped the old train line from Plantsville center to the [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]] town line. The project has brought landscaping, iron benches, and intersections of brick pavers where the trail crosses roads. This is seen as a major link for the further revitalization of downtown Southington and Plantsville. Eventually the trail will connect with the Cheshire-to-New Haven route.\n\n== Lake Compounce ==\n[[Lake Compounce]] is partly in Southington, and Bristol. Founded in 1846, it is the oldest amusement park in the US.\n\n==Schools==\n\nSouthington has eight public elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school.<ref name=\"Southington Public School Directory\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.southingtonschools.org/page.cfm?p=8057| title=Southington Public School Directory| publisher=Southington.org| accessdate=May 14, 2017}}</ref> It also has an alternative school for children in grades 8-12 called ALTA. Approximately 6,500 students are enrolled in Southington public schools, making it one of the larger districts in the state of Connecticut. [[Southington High School]] has a growing enrollment exceeding 2,200 students, of which 90% of graduates attend post-secondary education.\n\nDue to Southington's popularity as a family suburb, the town has undertaken plans to expand all schools to accommodate the growing enrollment. Three elementary schools have been completed, and a new building and second cafeteria has been added to the high school campus. Voters recently approved expansion and renovations to two other elementary schools (with one to be demolished and rebuilt), as well as to the two middle schools.\n\nSouthington also has two parochial schools; Southington Catholic is pre-kindergarten through eighth and the other, Central Christian Academy is pre-kindergarten through twelfth.\n\n===Elementary schools===\n* Walter A.

In 1756, [[Benjamin Franklin]] reported to [[Robert Hunter Morris|Governor Morris]] that he had procured boards and timber from Kern's sawmill. In the 19th century two Welshmen, who recognized its properties and importance from being used in [[Europe]], discovered [[slate]]. A quarry was set up in 1845, and, in 1847, a factory was erected. In 1864, Slatington was incorporated into a Borough of Pennsylvania; its first Mayor was Robert McDowell.\n\nHistorically, structural iron, knit goods, and silk were manufactured in Slatington, and there were abundant slate quarries in the area.\n\nIn 1900, 3,773 people lived in Slatington, and, by 1910, that number had grown to 4,454. Between 1910 and the 2010 census, the population reduced slightly, to 4,232.  The U.S. postal code ([[ZIP code]]) for Slatington, PA is 18080.\n\nSlatington was settled in 1738 and incorporated in 1864.\n\nThe [[Fireman's Drinking Fountain]] and [[Slatington Historic District]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Borough is served by the [[Northern Lehigh School District]].

In 1756, [[Benjamin Franklin]] reported to [[Robert Hunter Morris|Governor Morris]] that he had procured boards and timber from Kern's sawmill. In the 19th century two Welshmen, who recognized its properties and importance from being used in [[Europe]], discovered [[slate]]. A quarry was set up in 1845, and, in 1847, a factory was erected. In 1864, Slatington was incorporated into a Borough of Pennsylvania; its first Mayor was Robert McDowell.\n\nHistorically, structural iron, knit goods, and silk were manufactured in Slatington, and there were abundant slate quarries in the area.\n\nIn 1900, 3,773 people lived in Slatington, and, by 1910, that number had grown to 4,454. Between 1910 and the 2010 census, the population reduced slightly, to 4,232.  The U.S. postal code ([[ZIP code]]) for Slatington, PA is 18080.\n\nSlatington was settled in 1738 and incorporated in 1864.\n\nThe [[Fireman's Drinking Fountain]] and [[Slatington Historic District]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Borough is served by the [[Northern Lehigh School District]].

The population was 4,008 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Sinking Spring was given its name for a spring located in the center of town. The water in this spring would sink into the ground from time to time, giving the illusion that it had disappeared. The Sinking Spring area is served by the [[Wilson School District]].<ref>http://www.co.berks.pa.us/Dept/GIS/Documents/maps/general/Berks_Schools.pdf</ref> \n\n==Geography==\nSinking Spring is located at {{coord|40|19|29|N|76|1|21|W|type:city}} (40.324725, -76.022386).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.4|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\nThe Indians who first inhabited this area were the Lenni [[Lenape]] Indians (meaning the \"original people\").  The Tribe in this immediate area was the Minsi or Wolf tribe. Indian inhabitants in the Sinking Spring area supposedly called the main spring as the sunken spring.  White settlers later called it the \"sinking spring.\"\n\nPenn Avenue is the main thoroughfare of Sinking Spring.  There is a stone monument in the 3800 block of Penn Avenue.  It was placed to identify \"The Spring,\" which is said to periodically appear and disappear.  The Borough of Sinking Spring has a large number of underground streams that carve out limestone and form sinkholes; thus the name Sinking Spring.\n\nThe Borough of Sinking Spring was incorporated on March 13, 1913.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 517\n|1920= 1270\n|1930= 1771\n|1940= 1861\n|1950= 1982\n|1960= 2244\n|1970= 2862\n|1980= 2617\n|1990= 2467\n|2000= 2639\n|2010= 4008\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4116\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 2,639 people, 1,233 households, and 748 families residing in the borough.
