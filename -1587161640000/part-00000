It was meant to replace the former Elisabeth University which was located in Bratislava since 1912 as the latter has been forcefully disbanded in 1919 by [[Samuel Zoch]], plenipotentiary [[\u017eupan]] of Slovakia, after Hungarian professors refused to take an oath of allegiance<ref>{{cite book\n|last1 = Feren\u010duhov\u00e1\n|first1 = Bohumila\n|authorlink1 = Bohumila Feren\u010duhov\u00e1\n|last2 = Zemko\n|first2 = Milan\n|authorlink2 = Milan Zemko\n|title = V medzivojnovom \u010ceskoslovensku 1918\u20131939\n|trans-title=In inter-war Czechoslovakia 1918\u20131939\n|publisher = Veda\n|isbn = 978-80-224-1199-8 \n|page = 167\n|year = 2012\n|language = Slovak\n}}</ref> at that time in the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author= B\u00e9la Angyal\n|title= \u00c9rdekv\u00e9delem \u00e9s \u00f6nszervez\u0151d\u00e9s \u2013 Fejezetek a csehszlov\u00e1kiai magyar p\u00e1rtpolitika t\u00f6rt\u00e9net\u00e9b\u0151l 1918\u20131938 (Protection of interests and self-organization \u2013 Chapters from the history of the politics of Hungarians in Czechoslovakia)\n|year= 2002\n|language= Hungarian\n|url= http://mek.niif.hu/01800/01869/01869.pdf\n|ISBN= 80-8062-117-9\n|pages= 18\u201319\n|publisher= Lilium Aurum\n|accessdate= 2011-10-09\n}}</ref> This has caused the majority of the university's professors (and some of the students) to take refuge in [[Budapest]], where the Elisabeth University was reestablished. It has been later moved to [[P\u00e9cs]] and renamed to [[University of P\u00e9cs]]. This persecution of former (predominantly Hungarian) pillars of education in Bratislava necessitated the recruitment of [[Czech people|Czech]] academicians. Therefore, many [[professor]]s of the newly established university, including its first rector, Prof. MUDr. [[Kristian Hynek]], were Czechs, since Slovakia at that time did not have enough educated [[Slovaks|Slovak]] speakers who could serve as faculty members. In spite of personnel, financial, and space difficulties, the university developed research and teaching programs. The Faculty of Medicine opened in 1919, and was quickly followed by the Faculties of Law and Philosophy in 1921. The Faculty of Philosophy, besides offering programs in the [[humanities]] and [[social science]], also educated much-needed teachers for Slovakia's [[high school]]s.\n\nIn 1937, a new university building for the Faculties of Law and Philosophy was opened in the centre of Bratislava. The building includes the Aula (hall) used for graduation ceremonies and other formal functions.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Slovakia became nominally a [[First Slovak Republic|republic]], but was actually under the sway of [[Nazi Germany]]. The government reduced [[academic freedom]]s at the university, and the Czech professors were forced out. The university was renamed ''Slovak University'' in 1939, though the original name was reinstated in 1954. The Faculty of Science opened in 1940 and the Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was established in 1941. Academic freedom returned after the end of the war in 1945 but was again cancelled in 1948 as the [[communist]]s took power in [[Czechoslovakia]], enforcing the ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]] at Czechoslovak universities. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was taken under direct control of the Ministry of Education.\n\nHowever, the university continued to grow, and new faculties were established (mostly by splitting the existing faculties):\n*Faculty of Education in 1946,\n*Faculty of Pharmacy in 1952,\n*Faculty of Physical Education and Sports in 1960,\n*Faculty of Medicine in Martin in 1969,\n*[[Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics|Faculty of Mathematics and Physics]] in 1980.\n\nAfter the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989, the university created a [[democracy|democratic]] self-government, and mandatory courses on [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]] were abolished. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology and the Evangelical Theological Faculty joined the university.\n\nThe transformation of Slovakia into a market economy created a need for professionals in management and financial sciences. As a result, the\nuniversity established the [[Faculty of Management]] 1991 and the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences in 2002. In 2000, the [[European credit transfer system]] was implemented to improve student mobility and facilitate more ties with other European universities.\n\n== List of faculties ==\nThis is a list of faculties of Comenius University in Bratislava with their official [[English language|English]] names.<ref>[http://uniba.sk/ Comenius University in Bratislava] \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20161020104723/http://uniba.sk/fileadmin/ruk/legislativa/2015/VP_2015_09.pdf '''VP \u010d. 9/2015''' schv\u00e1len\u00fd AS UK '''\u00dapln\u00e9 znenie''' VP \u010d. 10/2008 '''\u0160tat\u00fat UK v znen\u00ed dodatkov \u010d. 1 a\u017e 4.''']</ref>\n\n[[Image:Fmfi f1 zelen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Building of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, located in western part of Bratislava]]\n[[Image:033401e2c5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]]]]\n* Faculty of [[Medicine]]\n* Faculty of [[Law]]\n* [[Faculty of Arts, Comenius University|Faculty of Arts]]\n* [[Faculty of Natural Sciences of Comenius University|Faculty of Natural Sciences]]\n* Faculty of [[Education]]\n* Faculty of [[Pharmacy]]\n* Faculty of [[Physical Education]] and [[Sport]]\n* [[Jessenius Faculty of Medicine]] in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]]\n* [[Comenius University Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics|Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics]]\n* Faculty of [[Roman Catholic]] Theology of [[Cyril and Methodius]]\n* [[Protestantism|Evangelical]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Theology|Theological]] Faculty\n* Faculty of [[Management]]\n* Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n{{Maincat|Comenius University alumni}}\n* [[\u013dubom\u00edr Bel\u00e1k]] \u2013 singer, musician, composer and TV producer\n* [[Emil Ben\u010d\u00edk]] \u2013  journalist and translator\n* [[Zuzana Be\u0148u\u0161kov\u00e1]] \u2013  ethnologist\n* [[J\u00f3zsef Ber\u00e9nyi]] \u2013 Chairman of the [[Party of the Hungarian Coalition]]\n* [[Robert Fico]] \u2013 politician, former [[Prime Minister of Slovakia|Prime minister of Slovakia]]\n* [[Rudolf Mac\u00fach]] \u2013 Protestant theologian and expert on Mandaean language and Samaritan language\n* [[Zora Mintalov\u00e1 \u2013 Zubercov\u00e1]] \u2013 ethnographer, historian and museologist\n* [[Milan Mi\u0161\u00edk]] \u2013 geologist and university professor\n* [[Vladim\u00edr Palko]] \u2013 former [[Interior minister]] of Slovakia\n* [[Ladislav Pataki]] \u2013 [[sports scientist]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]], [[masters athletics]] champion\n* [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ra\u010dek]] \u2013 actor and diplomat \n* [[Iveta Radi\u010dov\u00e1]] \u2013 former Prime minister of Slovakia\n* [[Emire Khidayer]], diplomat, entrepreneur and writer\n* [[Ernest Valko]] \u2013 assassinated constitutional lawyer \n* [[J\u00e1n Vil\u010dek]] \u2013 biomedical scientist, educator, inventor and philanthropist \n* [[\u0160tefan Zn\u00e1m]] \u2013 mathematician, first to ponder Zn\u00e1m's problem in modern mathematics\n* [[Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k|Miroslav Lajcak]] \u2013 diplomat, [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] for the [[Seventy-second session of the United Nations General Assembly|72nd session]]\n* [[Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1]] \u2013 politician, [[President of Slovakia]] elect\n\n== Notable faculty ==\n{{Maincat|Comenius University faculty}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Utrecht Network]]\n* [[Universitas Istropolitana]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070222012004/http://www.uniba.sk/index.php?id=67 Univerzita Komensk\u00e9ho.

It was meant to replace the former Elisabeth University which was located in Bratislava since 1912 as the latter has been forcefully disbanded in 1919 by [[Samuel Zoch]], plenipotentiary [[\u017eupan]] of Slovakia, after Hungarian professors refused to take an oath of allegiance<ref>{{cite book\n|last1 = Feren\u010duhov\u00e1\n|first1 = Bohumila\n|authorlink1 = Bohumila Feren\u010duhov\u00e1\n|last2 = Zemko\n|first2 = Milan\n|authorlink2 = Milan Zemko\n|title = V medzivojnovom \u010ceskoslovensku 1918\u20131939\n|trans-title=In inter-war Czechoslovakia 1918\u20131939\n|publisher = Veda\n|isbn = 978-80-224-1199-8 \n|page = 167\n|year = 2012\n|language = Slovak\n}}</ref> at that time in the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author= B\u00e9la Angyal\n|title= \u00c9rdekv\u00e9delem \u00e9s \u00f6nszervez\u0151d\u00e9s \u2013 Fejezetek a csehszlov\u00e1kiai magyar p\u00e1rtpolitika t\u00f6rt\u00e9net\u00e9b\u0151l 1918\u20131938 (Protection of interests and self-organization \u2013 Chapters from the history of the politics of Hungarians in Czechoslovakia)\n|year= 2002\n|language= Hungarian\n|url= http://mek.niif.hu/01800/01869/01869.pdf\n|ISBN= 80-8062-117-9\n|pages= 18\u201319\n|publisher= Lilium Aurum\n|accessdate= 2011-10-09\n}}</ref> This has caused the majority of the university's professors (and some of the students) to take refuge in [[Budapest]], where the Elisabeth University was reestablished. It has been later moved to [[P\u00e9cs]] and renamed to [[University of P\u00e9cs]]. This persecution of former (predominantly Hungarian) pillars of education in Bratislava necessitated the recruitment of [[Czech people|Czech]] academicians. Therefore, many [[professor]]s of the newly established university, including its first rector, Prof. MUDr. [[Kristian Hynek]], were Czechs, since Slovakia at that time did not have enough educated [[Slovaks|Slovak]] speakers who could serve as faculty members. In spite of personnel, financial, and space difficulties, the university developed research and teaching programs. The Faculty of Medicine opened in 1919, and was quickly followed by the Faculties of Law and Philosophy in 1921. The Faculty of Philosophy, besides offering programs in the [[humanities]] and [[social science]], also educated much-needed teachers for Slovakia's [[high school]]s.\n\nIn 1937, a new university building for the Faculties of Law and Philosophy was opened in the centre of Bratislava. The building includes the Aula (hall) used for graduation ceremonies and other formal functions.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Slovakia became nominally a [[First Slovak Republic|republic]], but was actually under the sway of [[Nazi Germany]]. The government reduced [[academic freedom]]s at the university, and the Czech professors were forced out. The university was renamed ''Slovak University'' in 1939, though the original name was reinstated in 1954. The Faculty of Science opened in 1940 and the Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was established in 1941. Academic freedom returned after the end of the war in 1945 but was again cancelled in 1948 as the [[communist]]s took power in [[Czechoslovakia]], enforcing the ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]] at Czechoslovak universities. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was taken under direct control of the Ministry of Education.\n\nHowever, the university continued to grow, and new faculties were established (mostly by splitting the existing faculties):\n*Faculty of Education in 1946,\n*Faculty of Pharmacy in 1952,\n*Faculty of Physical Education and Sports in 1960,\n*Faculty of Medicine in Martin in 1969,\n*[[Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics|Faculty of Mathematics and Physics]] in 1980.\n\nAfter the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989, the university created a [[democracy|democratic]] self-government, and mandatory courses on [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]] were abolished. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology and the Evangelical Theological Faculty joined the university.\n\nThe transformation of Slovakia into a market economy created a need for professionals in management and financial sciences. As a result, the\nuniversity established the [[Faculty of Management]] 1991 and the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences in 2002. In 2000, the [[European credit transfer system]] was implemented to improve student mobility and facilitate more ties with other European universities.\n\n== List of faculties ==\nThis is a list of faculties of Comenius University in Bratislava with their official [[English language|English]] names.<ref>[http://uniba.sk/ Comenius University in Bratislava] \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20161020104723/http://uniba.sk/fileadmin/ruk/legislativa/2015/VP_2015_09.pdf '''VP \u010d. 9/2015''' schv\u00e1len\u00fd AS UK '''\u00dapln\u00e9 znenie''' VP \u010d. 10/2008 '''\u0160tat\u00fat UK v znen\u00ed dodatkov \u010d. 1 a\u017e 4.''']</ref>\n\n[[Image:Fmfi f1 zelen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Building of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, located in western part of Bratislava]]\n[[Image:033401e2c5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]]]]\n* Faculty of [[Medicine]]\n* Faculty of [[Law]]\n* [[Faculty of Arts, Comenius University|Faculty of Arts]]\n* [[Faculty of Natural Sciences of Comenius University|Faculty of Natural Sciences]]\n* Faculty of [[Education]]\n* Faculty of [[Pharmacy]]\n* Faculty of [[Physical Education]] and [[Sport]]\n* [[Jessenius Faculty of Medicine]] in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]]\n* [[Comenius University Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics|Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics]]\n* Faculty of [[Roman Catholic]] Theology of [[Cyril and Methodius]]\n* [[Protestantism|Evangelical]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Theology|Theological]] Faculty\n* Faculty of [[Management]]\n* Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n{{Maincat|Comenius University alumni}}\n* [[\u013dubom\u00edr Bel\u00e1k]] \u2013 singer, musician, composer and TV producer\n* [[Emil Ben\u010d\u00edk]] \u2013  journalist and translator\n* [[Zuzana Be\u0148u\u0161kov\u00e1]] \u2013  ethnologist\n* [[J\u00f3zsef Ber\u00e9nyi]] \u2013 Chairman of the [[Party of the Hungarian Coalition]]\n* [[Robert Fico]] \u2013 politician, former [[Prime Minister of Slovakia|Prime minister of Slovakia]]\n* [[Rudolf Mac\u00fach]] \u2013 Protestant theologian and expert on Mandaean language and Samaritan language\n* [[Zora Mintalov\u00e1 \u2013 Zubercov\u00e1]] \u2013 ethnographer, historian and museologist\n* [[Milan Mi\u0161\u00edk]] \u2013 geologist and university professor\n* [[Vladim\u00edr Palko]] \u2013 former [[Interior minister]] of Slovakia\n* [[Ladislav Pataki]] \u2013 [[sports scientist]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]], [[masters athletics]] champion\n* [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ra\u010dek]] \u2013 actor and diplomat \n* [[Iveta Radi\u010dov\u00e1]] \u2013 former Prime minister of Slovakia\n* [[Emire Khidayer]], diplomat, entrepreneur and writer\n* [[Ernest Valko]] \u2013 assassinated constitutional lawyer \n* [[J\u00e1n Vil\u010dek]] \u2013 biomedical scientist, educator, inventor and philanthropist \n* [[\u0160tefan Zn\u00e1m]] \u2013 mathematician, first to ponder Zn\u00e1m's problem in modern mathematics\n* [[Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k|Miroslav Lajcak]] \u2013 diplomat, [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] for the [[Seventy-second session of the United Nations General Assembly|72nd session]]\n* [[Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1]] \u2013 politician, [[President of Slovakia]] elect\n\n== Notable faculty ==\n{{Maincat|Comenius University faculty}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Utrecht Network]]\n* [[Universitas Istropolitana]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070222012004/http://www.uniba.sk/index.php?id=67 Univerzita Komensk\u00e9ho.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

Rather than follow the South Korean version in which two singers perform in three rounds, with the winner of the final round facing the winner of the previous episode in an attempt to become the new \"Mask King,\" Ibarra opted to air one elimination per night, emphasize the clue packages and guessing component, and have the celebrities wear more extravagant costumes.<ref name=\"GH Feb 6\"/> The series was officially ordered by Fox in August 2018.<ref name=\"VAR Aug 2\"/>\n\n[[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], the rightsholder of the ''Masked Singer'' format, lacked the ability to produce the series.

Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than being able to create a comedic tone for the show as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear. Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on to the series due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg and Thicke, respectively, due to their enthusiasm regarding the concept, and Scherzinger for her positivity and experience as a singer.<ref name=\"E!
