The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', and the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>). The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which grossed US$519 million, ''Basic Instinct'' which grossed US$352 million and ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' which grossed US$278 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm|title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=basicinstinct.htm|title=Basic Instinct|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tourist.htm|title=The Tourist|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film library==\nStudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles.\n\nStudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies:\n* [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref name=carolco1>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=carolco2>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n**The Vista Organization\n**Seven Arts (joint venture with [[New Line Cinema]])\n*Paravision International, including:\n** Parafrance Films\n** [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]],<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg>{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=March 8, 1992|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n*** [[Embassy Pictures]]<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg/><ref>{{cite web|last=Friendly|first=David T.|title=De Laurentiis Rejoins The Ranks--at Embassy|date=November 16, 1985|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-16/entertainment/ca-2810_1_major-studios|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lumiere Pictures and Television<ref>{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Lumiere rocks to French classics|date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/lumiere-rocks-to-french-classics-1118061036/|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> (currently owned as a result of parent company [[Canal+ Group]]'s acquisition of cinema operator [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] who acquired those companies, via [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]]), including:\n** [[EMI Films]],<ref name=ealing/><ref>\"A.B.

Since the creation of the People's Republic of China, its government has encouraged a revival of Taoist traditions in codified settings. In 1956, the [[Chinese Taoist Association]] was formed to administer the activities of all registered Taoist orders, and received official approval in 1957. It was disbanded during the [[Cultural Revolution]] under [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], but was re-established in 1980. The headquarters of the association are at the ''Baiyunguan'', or [[White Cloud Temple]] of [[Beijing]], belonging to the [[Longmen Taoism|Longmen]] branch of Quanzhen Taoism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Taoism/Historical-Development/Modern-Age.html|title=Patheos Library \u2013 Taoism: Modern Age|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=16 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115093751/http://www.patheos.com/Library/Taoism/Historical-Development/Modern-Age.html|archive-date=15 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Since 1980, many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt, both belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen schools, and clergy [[ordination]] has been resumed.\n\nTaoist literature and art has influenced the cultures of [[Taoism in Korea|Korea]], [[Taoism in Japan|Japan]], and [[Taoism in Vietnam|Vietnam]].

Both the Wade\u2013Giles ''tao<sup>4</sup>'' and the Pinyin ''d\u00e0o'' are intended to be pronounced identically in Mandarin Chinese (like the 'd' in 'dog'), but despite this fact, \"Taoism\" and \"Daoism\" can be pronounced differently in English vernacular.<ref>{{harvp|Carr |1990|pp=63\u201365}}. \"Converting the various [[pronunciation respelling for English|pronunciation respelling systems]] into [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], British dictionaries (1933\u20131989, Table 3) give 9 {{IPA|/ta\u028a.\u026az\u0259m/}}, 2 {{IPA|/ta\u028a.\u026az\u0259m, da\u028a.\u026az\u0259m/}}, and 1 {{IPA|/da\u028a.\u026az\u0259m/}}; American dictionaries (1948\u20131987, Table 4) give 6 {{IPA|/da\u028a.\u026az\u0259m, ta\u028a.\u026az\u0259m/}}, 2 {{IPA|/ta\u028a.\u026az\u0259m, da\u028a.\u026az\u0259m/}}, 2 {{IPA|/ta\u028a.\u026az\u0259m/}}, and 1 {{IPA|/da\u028a.\u026az\u0259m/}}\".</ref>\n\n===Categorisation===\n\nThe word \"Daoism\" is used to translate different Chinese terms which refer to different aspects of the same tradition and semantic field:{{sfnp|Pregadio|2008|loc=Vol. 1, p. xvi}}\n# \"Daoist religion\" ({{zh|labels=no||c={{linktext|\u9053\u6559}}|p={{linktext|D\u00e0oji\u00e0o}}}}; lit. \"teachings of the Dao\"), or the \"liturgical\" aspect<ref name=\"Pregadio 2008. p. 327\">{{harvp|Pregadio|2008|loc=Vol. 1, p. 327, Daoshi}}</ref> \u2013 A family of organised religious movements sharing concepts or terminology from \"Daoist philosophy\";{{sfnp|Robinet|1997|p=xxix}} the first of these is recognised as the [[Celestial Masters]] school.\n# \"Daoist philosophy\" ({{zh|labels=no||c={{linktext|\u9053\u5bb6}}|p={{linktext|D\u00e0oji\u0101}}}}; lit. \"school or family of the Dao\") or \"Daology\" ({{zh|labels=no||c=\u9053\u5b78|p=d\u00e0oxu\u00e9}}; lit. \"learning of the Dao\"), or the \"mystical\" aspect<ref name=\"Pregadio 2008. p. 327\"/> \u2013 The [[philosophy|philosophical doctrines]] based on the texts of the ''[[I Ching|Yi Jing]]'', the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Dao De Jing]]'' (or Tao Te Ching, {{zh|labels=no||c=\u9053\u5fb7\u7d93|p=d\u00e0od\u00e9j\u012bng}}) and the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' ({{zh|labels=no||c=\u838a\u5b50|p=zhu\u0101ngzi}}).

It is not the original, but a replica used in a film. Only two preserved original cars from the other train exist; they are exhibited in the Museum of Slovak National Uprising in [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]].]]\n\nAn '''armoured train''' is a railway [[train]] protected with [[vehicle armour|armour]]. Armoured trains usually include railroad cars armed with [[artillery]],[[machine gun]]s and [[autocannon]]s, some also had slits used to fire [[small arms]] like [[pistols]] and [[rifles]] from the inside of the train, this feature was especially prevalent in earlier versions of armoured trains. For the most part they were used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of [[firepower]]. Most countries discontinued their use \u2013 road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, and train tracks proved too vulnerable to sabotage as well as to attacks from the air. However, the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] used improvised armoured trains in the [[Second Chechen War]] of 1999\u20132009.\n\n== Design and equipment ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n[[Image:Pociag pancerny Danuta z 1939 r.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish armoured train, the ''[[Danuta (armoured train)|Danuta]]'', in 1939. From the left: artillery wagon, infantry assault wagon, armoured locomotive, artillery wagon]]\n[[Image:Drezyna pancerna typu TKS.jpg|thumb|right|A [[TKS]] [[tankette]] used as an armoured reconnaissance [[draisine]], an attempt to overcome one of the inflexibilities of the armoured train - being limited to the [[Rail tracks|track]]]]\n\nThe rail cars on an armoured train were designed for many tasks. Typical roles included:\n* [[Artillery]] - fielding a mixture of guns, machine guns and rocket launchers. See also [[railway guns]].\n* [[Infantry]] - designed to carry infantry units, may also mount machine guns.\n* [[Machine gun]] - dedicated to machine guns.\n* [[Anti-aircraft]] - equipped with anti-aircraft weapons.\n* [[Command and control|Command]] - similar to infantry wagons, but designed to be a train command centre\n* [[Anti-tank gun|Anti-tank]] - equipped with anti-tank guns, usually in a [[tank]] [[gun turret]]\n* Platform - unarmoured, used for any purpose from the transport of [[ammunition]] or vehicles, through track repair or derailing protection to [[railroad plough]]s for track destruction.\n* [[Troop sleeper]]s\n* The German [[Wehrmacht]] would sometimes put a ''Fremdger\u00e4t'', such as a captured French [[Somua S-35]] or Czech [[PzKpfw 38(t)]] light tank, or [[Panzer II]] light tank on a flatbed car which could be quickly offloaded by means of a ramp and used away from the range of the main railway line to chase down enemy partisans\n* [[Missile]] transport - the [[USSR]] had railway-based [[RT-23 Molodets]] ICBMs by the late 1980s (to reduce the chances of a [[first strike]] succeeding in destroying the launchers for a retaliatory strike). The US at one time proposed having a railway-based system for the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX Missile program]] but this never got past the planning stage\n\nDifferent types of armour were used to protect from attack by tanks. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases for improvised armoured trains.\n\nArmoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a [[draisine]]. One such example was the 'Littorina' armoured trolley which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction.

The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918\u20131920). The [[Spanish Civil War]] saw a little use of armoured trains, though [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) saw more. The French used them during the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954), and a number of countries had armoured trains during the Cold War. The last combat use appears to have been during the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the 1990s.\n\n===American Civil War===\nThe most successful armoured train was a single car built to defend the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]]. The railroad had been attacked by southern forces to prevent transport of Union soldiers to the front; and snipers were discouraging men attempting to repair the damage. [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] modified a baggage car in late April 1861. A [[Caliber#Pounds as a measure of cannon bore|24-pounder]] [[howitzer]] was placed on a swivel mount at the opposite end of the car from the pushing locomotive. The sides of the car were sheathed with {{convert|2.5|inch|cm|sing=on}} oak planks covered with {{convert|0.5|inch|cm|sing=on}} boiler plate. The end of the car around the howitzer was fitted with hinged {{convert|2|ft|cm|sing=on}} panels which could be temporarily lifted to aim and fire the howitzer and then lowered to protect the crew of six men loading the howitzer with [[grapeshot]] or [[canister shot]]. The remainder of the car contained fifty ports for riflemen. The car was effective for its original purpose, but vulnerability to artillery rendered such cars of comparatively little use during later stages of the war. In August 1864, a Confederate raiding party disabled a [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] locomotive pushing an armoured train; and then piled tires around the armoured car and set them afire.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dome |first=Steam |year=1974 |title=A Civil War Iron Clad Car |journal=Railroad History |volume=130 |issue=Spring 1974 |pages=51\u201353 |publisher=The Railway & Locomotive Historical Society}}</ref>\n\n===Volunteers===\nIn 1884 Charles Gervaise Boxall (1852\u20131914), a [[Brighton]]-born solicitor and officer in the [[1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers]], published ''The Armoured Train for Coast Defence in Great Britain'', outlining a new way to employ heavy artillery.

[[Winston Churchill]] accompanied the mission as a war correspondent. The train was ambushed and part-derailed, and Haldane, Churchill and some 70 of the troops were captured after a fire-fight, although the locomotive got away with the wounded.<ref>Gen Sir Aylmer Haldane, ''A Soldier's Saga'', Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1948, pp. 139\u201346.</ref><ref>Rayne Kruger, ''Goodbye Dolly Gray'', London: Cassell 1959/Pan 1974, {{ISBN|0-330-23861-2}}, pp. 104\u20135.</ref><ref>Thomas Pakenham, ''The Boer War'', London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1979/abridged edition 1993, {{ISBN|0-297-83222-0}}, pp. 95\u20136.</ref> Recalling his experience in [[My Early Life]], Churchill wrote \"Nothing looks more formidable and impressive than an armoured train; but nothing is in fact more vulnerable and helpless.

Armoured trains usually include railroad cars armed with [[artillery]],[[machine gun]]s and [[autocannon]]s, some also had slits used to fire [[small arms]] like [[pistols]] and [[rifles]] from the inside of the train, this feature was especially prevalent in earlier versions of armoured trains. For the most part they were used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of [[firepower]]. Most countries discontinued their use \u2013 road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, and train tracks proved too vulnerable to sabotage as well as to attacks from the air. However, the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] used improvised armoured trains in the [[Second Chechen War]] of 1999\u20132009.\n\n== Design and equipment ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n[[Image:Pociag pancerny Danuta z 1939 r.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish armoured train, the ''[[Danuta (armoured train)|Danuta]]'', in 1939.

Typical roles included:\n* [[Artillery]] - fielding a mixture of guns, machine guns and rocket launchers. See also [[railway guns]].\n* [[Infantry]] - designed to carry infantry units, may also mount machine guns.\n* [[Machine gun]] - dedicated to machine guns.\n* [[Anti-aircraft]] - equipped with anti-aircraft weapons.\n* [[Command and control|Command]] - similar to infantry wagons, but designed to be a train command centre\n* [[Anti-tank gun|Anti-tank]] - equipped with anti-tank guns, usually in a [[tank]] [[gun turret]]\n* Platform - unarmoured, used for any purpose from the transport of [[ammunition]] or vehicles, through track repair or derailing protection to [[railroad plough]]s for track destruction.\n* [[Troop sleeper]]s\n* The German [[Wehrmacht]] would sometimes put a ''Fremdger\u00e4t'', such as a captured French [[Somua S-35]] or Czech [[PzKpfw 38(t)]] light tank, or [[Panzer II]] light tank on a flatbed car which could be quickly offloaded by means of a ramp and used away from the range of the main railway line to chase down enemy partisans\n* [[Missile]] transport - the [[USSR]] had railway-based [[RT-23 Molodets]] ICBMs by the late 1980s (to reduce the chances of a [[first strike]] succeeding in destroying the launchers for a retaliatory strike). The US at one time proposed having a railway-based system for the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX Missile program]] but this never got past the planning stage\n\nDifferent types of armour were used to protect from attack by tanks. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases for improvised armoured trains.\n\nArmoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a [[draisine]]. One such example was the 'Littorina' armoured trolley which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction. Littorina mounted two dual 7.92mm [[MG-13|MG13]] machine gun turrets from [[Panzer I]] light tanks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n| image1    = Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper - 18610518 - p1 - Railroad Battery.png\n| alt1      = Photo of an 1861 \"Railroad battery\" used to protect workers during the [[American Civil War]]\n| caption1  = An 1861 \"Railroad battery\" used to protect workers during the [[American Civil War]]\n| image2    = CGR 3rd Class 4-4-0 1889-108.jpg\n| alt2      = Photo of an armoured [[CGR 3rd Class 4-4-0 1889]] locomotive derailed on 12 October 1899 during the first engagement of the [[Second Boer War]] at [[Battle of Kraaipan|Kraaipan]]\n| caption2  = An armoured [[CGR 3rd Class 4-4-0 1889]] locomotive derailed on 12 October 1899 during the first engagement of the [[Second Boer War]] at [[Battle of Kraaipan|Kraaipan]]\n}}\nArmoured trains saw use during the 19th century in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars (1880\u20131881 and 1899\u20131902).

The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918\u20131920). The [[Spanish Civil War]] saw a little use of armoured trains, though [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) saw more. The French used them during the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954), and a number of countries had armoured trains during the Cold War. The last combat use appears to have been during the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the 1990s.\n\n===American Civil War===\nThe most successful armoured train was a single car built to defend the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]]. The railroad had been attacked by southern forces to prevent transport of Union soldiers to the front; and snipers were discouraging men attempting to repair the damage. [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] modified a baggage car in late April 1861. A [[Caliber#Pounds as a measure of cannon bore|24-pounder]] [[howitzer]] was placed on a swivel mount at the opposite end of the car from the pushing locomotive. The sides of the car were sheathed with {{convert|2.5|inch|cm|sing=on}} oak planks covered with {{convert|0.5|inch|cm|sing=on}} boiler plate. The end of the car around the howitzer was fitted with hinged {{convert|2|ft|cm|sing=on}} panels which could be temporarily lifted to aim and fire the howitzer and then lowered to protect the crew of six men loading the howitzer with [[grapeshot]] or [[canister shot]]. The remainder of the car contained fifty ports for riflemen. The car was effective for its original purpose, but vulnerability to artillery rendered such cars of comparatively little use during later stages of the war. In August 1864, a Confederate raiding party disabled a [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] locomotive pushing an armoured train; and then piled tires around the armoured car and set them afire.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dome |first=Steam |year=1974 |title=A Civil War Iron Clad Car |journal=Railroad History |volume=130 |issue=Spring 1974 |pages=51\u201353 |publisher=The Railway & Locomotive Historical Society}}</ref>\n\n===Volunteers===\nIn 1884 Charles Gervaise Boxall (1852\u20131914), a [[Brighton]]-born solicitor and officer in the [[1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers]], published ''The Armoured Train for Coast Defence in Great Britain'', outlining a new way to employ heavy artillery.

In September 1961 the union was ended after a coup by secessionist officers in Syria. Arab nationalist officers sought to topple the secessionist government of [[Nazim al-Qudsi]] and formed an alliance within the military to launch a coup in 1963. Hatum was one of the few Ba'athist officers among the Arab nationalists in the army during this period, although the Ba'athists were the most organized force unofficially headed by a secretive grouping known as the [[Military Committee (Syria)|Military Committee]] and officially, if only nominally, organized by the political party under Alfaq.<ref name=\"Rabinovich45\"/>\n\n[[File:Military Committee celebrates 1963 coup.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Participants in the 1963 coup celebrating its success. From left to right: Hatum, [[Muhammad Umran]] and [[Salah Jadid]]]]\n\nOn 7\u20138 March 1963 [[Ziad al-Hariri]], an independent unionist officer, headed the coup by leading the takeover of [[Damascus]], capturing several strategic points in the city.<ref name=\"Seale77\"/> Meanwhile, Hatum led the unionists' capture of the city's radio station.<ref name=\"Seale77\"/> It then broadcast that the [[National Council for the Revolutionary Command]] had replaced the secessionist government and that it was reinstating several discharged Ba'athist officers into the army, including all of those on the Military Committee, which at that time was made of [[Muhammad Umran]], [[Salah Jadid]], [[Hafez al-Assad]], [[Abd al-Karim al-Jundi]] and [[Ahmad al-Mir]]. Following the coup's success, Hatum was appointed to the Military Committee, which was expanded to include more members.<ref name=\"Moubayed52\"/> He was subsequently promoted to the rank of major.<ref>Rabinovich, 1972, p. 151.</ref> In addition to the commando unit he headed prior to the coup, Hatum was also made the commander of the army garrisons posted near the strategic radio and television stations.<ref name=\"Batatu148\"/>\n\nHatum was elected as a member of the [[Regional Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Regional Command]] of the Syrian Regional Branch on 1 August 1965, serving one term that lasted until 19 December of that year.<ref name=\"Batatu338\">Batatu, pp. 338-339.</ref> That year, he also served on the military tribunal to try Israeli spy [[Eli Cohen]].<ref name=\"Moubayed52\"/>\n\n===1966 coup and aftermath===\nThe Military Committee increasingly challenged the authority of President [[Amin al-Hafiz]] and Prime Minister [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], both staunch allies of Aflaq. In February 1966, the regionalist faction of the Committee launched a [[1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] to topple the government. Jadid assigned Hatum to command a special force and arrest Hafiz from his home in Damascus. Hafiz resisted and a firefight between him and Hatum's men ensued. Hatum ordered tank fire against his home and armed clashes raged throughout the city, ending in the deaths of some 50 people. Hafiz was wounded and his daughter lost an eye during the battle, before Hafiz surrendered himself.<ref name=\"Moubayed52\"/>\n\nHatum felt he was not properly rewarded for his role in the 1966 coup, having been kept from any position in the Ba'ath Party's Regional Command or the Syrian government. Instead he kept his post in the Committee and command over Damascus' radio station. The leaders of the coup, Jadid and [[Hafez al-Assad]], viewed Hatum as reckless and deplored the severe use of force he deployed and the consequent mass casualties when he arrested Hafiz. Hatum decided to oust Jadid and Assad by establishing contact with officers and party figures who had been loyal to Bitar and Hafiz, namely former secretary-general of the party's National Command [[Munif al-Razzaz]] and former deputy chief of staff [[Fahd al-Sha'ir]].<ref name=\"Moubayed53-2006\">Moubayed, 2006, p. 53.</ref>\n\nA coup was planned for 1 July, but delayed until 3 September, upon Hatum's insistence. In the meantime, in August, one of Hatum's co-conspirators, colonel Talal Abu Asali, publicly cursed Jadid and promised to avenge Hafiz during a drinking session with other officers. As a result, he was arrested the following day by Chief of Staff [[Ahmed Suwaydani]], who assigned Hatum (who was far from suspicion at that point) to head the investigation against Asali. During the interrogation, Hatum reportedly whispered to Asali \"I will kill anyone who talks\". Jadid became suspicious of Hatum for unclear reasons, stripped him of his investigative role and assigned Syrian intelligence head, [[Abd al-Karim al-Jundi]], to head the interrogation. After Jundi allegedly tortured Asali, the latter confessed that Sha'ir and Razzaz were planning a coup against the new government, but did not mention Hatum. Jundi subsequently led a crackdown against officers belonging to the Druze community, like Sha'ir and Hatum, arresting over 200 military personnel. Asali was released.<ref name=\"Moubayed53\"/>\n\nTensions in the predominantly Druze region of [[Jabal al-Arab]], prompted Jadid and President [[Nureddin al-Atassi]] to visit the regional capital of [[al-Suwayda]] to alleviate the situation. After hearing of their visit, an incensed Hatum had Asali surround al-Suwayda with tanks, while Hatum entered the city's party headquarters where Jadid and Atassi were meeting local officials. He threatened to kill them, but after pressure from local elders, he reneged and had them detained instead. Defense Minister Assad, who was in Damascus, ordered Hatum to release Jadid and Atassi, which Hatum rejected. Assad subsequently ordered the aerial and ground bombardment of Suwayda, until he put an end to Hatum's mutiny.<ref name=\"Moubayed53\"/>\n\n==Downfall and death==\nHatum and Asali fled south to [[Jordan]], where King Hussein gave them asylum. Afterward, four hundred of Hatum's loyalists in the officers corps were dismissed, reassigned or arrested, in an unprecedented purge in Syrian military history, while in March 1967, [[Mustafa Tlass]] headed a military court that tried Hatum ''in absentia''. Hatum was sentenced to death.<ref name=\"Moubayed54-2006\">Moubayed, 2006, p. 54.</ref>\n\n[[Sectarianism]] increasingly played a role in the rivalry and confrontation between the two camps, with the Druze and to an extent the [[Sunni Muslim]] officers set against the [[Alawite]] officers like Jadid and Assad, who were largely in control of the country's military and internal security networks at that time.<ref>Moosa, p. 306.</ref> Hatum stated in a press conference in Jordan, that sectarianism was taking hold in the Syrian Army, with the purges undertaken by Assad and Jadid resulting in the entrenchment of Alawite power in the country, with Alawite officers taking up key positions in the state. He further asserted that Alawites outnumbered non-Alawites in the officer corps five to one and the government was leading Syria under the slogan of \"One Nusayri state with an eternal message.\" This was a mock reference to the Ba'athist motto \"One Arab nation with an eternal message\", replacing \"Arab\" with \"Nusayri\", which is a derogatory name for Alawite.<ref name=\"Moosa306-7\">Moosa, pp. 306-307.</ref>\n\nFollowing Syria's defeat in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] with Israel, Hatum announced that he would return to Syria to fight the Israelis. He felt Jadid would not pursue the death warrant against him with his government now weakened by the defeat.<ref name=\"Moubayed54\"/> After he reentered the country, he took up protection by the popular Syrian nationalist Druze leader [[Sultan al-Atrash]] in Jabal al-Arab. However, he was arrested by the authorities to Atrash's protestations<ref name=\"Moosa306-7\"/> and brought to court, where Tlass confirmed the death sentence and Hatum was executed by firing squad on 26 June.
