The church, facing the [[Via Giulia]], was built during the [[Italian Baroque|Baroque age]]. San Filippo was supposed to be demolished together with the surrounding neighborhood in the late 1930s, but due to the onset of WWII the demolition was halted. Abandoned and desecrated after the war, it has been restored in 2000, but maintains a secular usage and is not accessible.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Nolli 1748 San Filippo Neri in Via Giulia.JPG|thumb|left|San Filippo Neri (red arrow) and its Oratory (blue arrow) in their original context in the map of Rome of [[Giambattista Nolli]] (1748)]]\nThe church is located in [[Rome]]'s [[Regola]] [[rioni of Rome|rione]], about halfway down [[Via Giulia]] (at the n. 134B), its facade facing south-west, in a context still devastated by the demolitions of the 1930s.\n\n==Denominations==\nThe church, originally dedicated to [[Saint Trophimus]], was then dedicated to Philip Neri and, because of its tiny area, nicknamed by the roman populace \"San Filippino\" (\"Little Saint Philip\").<ref name=arm422/>\n\n==History==\nThe church was erected in 1623 (but, according to another source, in 1603)<ref name=bu705/> along [[via Giulia]].<ref name=pie7916>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 16</ref> The building's client was Rutilio Brandi, a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] glove maker native of [[San Gimignano]].<ref name=pie7916/> Brandi was ''penitente'' of [[Philip Neri]] and  ''Governatore'' of the \"Compagnia delle Santissime Piaghe di Ges\u00f9\" (\"Company of the most holy wounds of [[Jesus]]\"), an institute founded in 1617 and whose members were Florentines living in Rome.<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422>Armellini (1891), p. 422</ref> Since he was ill with [[gout]], Brandi had the church [[dedication|dedicated]] to [[Saint Trophimus]], the protector of the gouties.<ref name=pie7916/> Moreover, in the building which embeds the church Brandi founded two charitable works: a little hospital for priests, and an institute for poor girls, dedicated to Philip Neri.<ref name=pie7918/><ref name=arm422/><ref name=del476>Delli (1988), p. 476</ref> Because of that, the shrine's dedication changed with time to [[San Filippo Neri]], the \"apostle of Rome\".<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nIn 1728 the church was restored by [[Filippo Raguzzini]] on behalf of [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (r. 1724-1730); the main work was the new facade, erected between May and October 1728 with a total expense of 500 ''[[Italian scudo|scudi]]''.<ref name=pie7916/> The church facade was demolished again and rebuilt between 1767 and 1768 with a project of [[Giovanni Francesco Fiori]], in an [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] style between [[Roman Baroque|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]].<ref name=dbi>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-francesco-fiori_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Fiori, Giovanni Francesco|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |first=Tommaso|last=Manfredi|volume=48 |year=1997|language=it}}</ref>\n\nIn 1797, when the French because of the [[treaty of Tolentino]] pretended a large amount of money from the Pope, San Filippo was the only church in Rome to keep its silver [[reliquary]], since the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the church refused to give it to [[Pius VI]] (r. 1775-1799).<ref name=del476/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nSince it is only about 100 metres from the [[Tiber]], the church was severely damaged during a flood in 1853,<ref name=bu705/> and due to that was restored under [[Pope Pius IX]] (r. 1846-1878) in the same year.<ref name=pie7916/>\n\nAs part of the demolition works ordered by [[Benito Mussolini]] <ref name=bu705/> in 1938 for the construction of a wide avenue between [[Ponte Mazzini]] and the [[Chiesa Nuova]],<ref>Mazzotta (2014), pp. 185-187</ref> almost all the buildings around the church were demolished, and the church itself, desecrated, was spared only because of the stop of the project due to the beginning of WWII.<ref name=pie7916/> After that, the works of art disappeared into hitherto unknown hands or are completely lost.<ref name=bu705/> The building then fell into disrepair:<ref name=bu705/> it served as a wood storage <ref name=bu705/> and as a deposit for the fruit and vegetables street market of nearby ''vicolo della Moretta''.
