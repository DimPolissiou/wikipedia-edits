In 1929, [[Clement Melville Keys|Clement Keys]], the owner of [[North American Aviation]], purchased Pitcairn. In 1930, Keys changed the company's name to ''Eastern Air Transport''. After being purchased by [[General Motors]] and experiencing a change in leadership after the Airmail Act of 1934, the airline became known as Eastern Air Lines.<ref>Smith, F. (1982).

Those flights and their returns were Eastern's whole scheduled operation; it fit on one page in the Airways Guide. Then as later, Eastern was the fourth largest airline in the country by passenger-miles (103 million in 1939).\n[[File:The Great Silver Fleet 1939.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The Great Silver Fleet (1939)]]\nRickenbacker pushed Eastern into a period of growth and innovation; for a time Eastern was the most profitable airline in the post-war era, never needing state subsidy. In the late 1950s Eastern's position was eroded by subsidies to rival airlines and the arrival of the jet age. On October 1, 1959, Rickenbacker's position as CEO was taken over by [[Malcolm A. MacIntyre]], a brilliant lawyer but a man inexperienced in airline operations.'<ref name=\"Rickenbacker, 1967\">Rickenbacker, 1967</ref> Rickenbacker's ouster was largely due to his reluctance to acquire expensive jets as he underestimated their appeal to the public.

Delta's less-unionized work force and slowly expanding international route network helped lead it through the turbulent period following deregulation in 1978.\n\nIn 1980, a Caribbean hub was started at [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport]] (known at the time as \"Isla Verde International Airport\") near [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. In 1982, Eastern acquired [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff]]'s [[South America]]n route network. By 1985, Eastern was the largest IATA airline in terms of passengers and operated in 26 countries on three continents.\n\nDuring this era, Eastern's fleet was split between their \"silver-colored hockey stick\" livery (the lack of paint reduced weight by 100 pounds) and their \"white-colored hockey stick\" livery (on its [[Airbus]]-manufactured planes, the metallurgy of which required paint to cover the aircraft's composite skin panels).\n\nIn 1983 Eastern became the launch customer of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing 757|757]], which was ordered in 1978. Borman felt that its low cost of operation would make it an invaluable asset to the airline in the years to come. However, higher oil prices failed to materialize and the debt created by this purchase coupled with the Airbus A300 purchases in 1977 contributed to the February 1986 sale to [[Frank Lorenzo]]'s [[Texas Air]]. At that time, Eastern was paying over $700,000 in interest each day before they sold a ticket, fueled, or boarded a single aircraft.\n\nStarting about 1985, Eastern offered \"Moonlight Specials\", with passenger seats on overnight flights scheduled for cargo from thirty freight companies. The flights, which operated between midnight and 7 am, served 18 cities in the United States connecting mainly to Houston (IAH). Eric Schmitt of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that the services were \"a hybrid of late-night, red-eye flights and the barebones [[People Express Airlines (1980s)|People Express]] approach to service.\" The holds of the aircraft were reserved for cargo such as express mail, machine tool parts, and textiles. Because of this, the airline allowed each passenger to take up to two carry-on bags. The airline charged $10 for each checked bag, which was shipped standby. The airline charged between 50 cents and $3 for beverages and snacks. Bunny Duck, an Eastern flight attendant quoted in ''The New York Times'', said that the passengers on the special flights were \"a cross section of families, college kids, illegal aliens and weirdos from L.A.\".<ref>Schmitt, Eric. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/09/nyregion/overnight-flight-bargain-for-spontaneous-travelers.html?pagewanted=1 OVERNIGHT FLIGHT - BARGAIN FOR SPONTANEOUS FLYERS]\".

At the time, Eastern was the largest corporate employer in the Miami area and remained so after the cuts. John Nordheimer wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Eastern's prominence in the Miami area decreased as the city became a finance and trade center and experienced population increase-based economic growth, instead of a purely tourism-based growth.<ref>Nordheimer, John. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/24/us/cuts-by-eastern-shaking-miami-in-many-ways.html Cuts by Eastern Shaking Miami In Many Ways]\".

Concerned that Lorenzo's successful breaking of the IAM would do the same to the pilots' and flight attendants' unions, the pilots represented by [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Air Line Pilots Association]] (ALPA) and [[flight attendant]]s represented by the [[Transport Workers Union of America|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU) called a sympathy strike, which effectively shut down the airline's domestic operations. Non-contract employees, including airport gate and ticket counter agents and reservation sales agents, could not honor the strike.

In the late 1920s, Pitcairn Aviation won a contract to fly mail between [[New York City]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia]] on [[Mailwing]] single-engine aircraft. In 1929, [[Clement Melville Keys|Clement Keys]], the owner of [[North American Aviation]], purchased Pitcairn. In 1930, Keys changed the company's name to ''Eastern Air Transport''. After being purchased by [[General Motors]] and experiencing a change in leadership after the Airmail Act of 1934, the airline became known as Eastern Air Lines.<ref>Smith, F. (1982).

Those flights and their returns were Eastern's whole scheduled operation; it fit on one page in the Airways Guide. Then as later, Eastern was the fourth largest airline in the country by passenger-miles (103 million in 1939).\n[[File:The Great Silver Fleet 1939.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The Great Silver Fleet (1939)]]\nRickenbacker pushed Eastern into a period of growth and innovation; for a time Eastern was the most profitable airline in the post-war era, never needing state subsidy. In the late 1950s Eastern's position was eroded by subsidies to rival airlines and the arrival of the jet age. On October 1, 1959, Rickenbacker's position as CEO was taken over by [[Malcolm A. MacIntyre]], a brilliant lawyer but a man inexperienced in airline operations.'<ref name=\"Rickenbacker, 1967\">Rickenbacker, 1967</ref> Rickenbacker's ouster was largely due to his reluctance to acquire expensive jets as he underestimated their appeal to the public.

In 1967, Eastern purchased [[Mackey Airlines]], a small air carrier primarily operating in Florida and the Bahamas as part of this expansion.\n[[File:Boeing 747-121 N735PA EAL lsd MIA 07.02.71 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing 747 showing Eastern Airlines' longtime [[Aircraft livery|livery]] of a [[Aircraft livery#Cheatline|cheatline]] extended up the tail (a [[Aircraft livery#Hockey stick|hockey stick]] livery) in 1971.]]\nEastern bought the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] and [[Airbus A300]] widebody jets; the former would become known in the [[Caribbean]] as ''El Grandote'' (the huge one). Although Eastern had purchased four 747s, the delivery slots were sold to [[Trans World Airlines]] ([[TWA]]) when Eastern decided to purchase the L-1011.\n\nDue to massive delays in the L-1011 program, mainly due to problems with the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] engines, Eastern leased two [[Boeing 747-100]]s from [[Pan Am]] between 1970 and 1972 and operated the aircraft between Chicago and San Juan as well as from New York to Miami and San Juan.\n\n{{quote|The RB211 programme might easily have foundered in 1971 if it had not been for the steadfast support of Eastern Airlines, one of the major launch customers for the Lockheed TriStars.

The new campaign, which featured Borman as a spokesperson, was used until the mid-to-late 1980s.\n\nUnder bankruptcy, Eastern launched a \"100 Days\" campaign, in which it promised to \"become a little bit better every day\".\n\n===Turmoil===\n[[File:Boeing 727-25 N8125N EAL JFK 17.09.70 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-25]] of Eastern outside their terminal at New York's John F Kennedy Airport in 1970]]\n[[File:Douglas DC-8-21 N8608 EAL MIA 19.10.70 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Douglas DC-8]]-21 of Eastern at [[Miami International Airport]] in 1970]]\n[[File:Lockheed L-1011-1 N328EA EAL MIA 18.07.76 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|Lockheed TriStar]] ''Whisperliner'' of Eastern Air Lines landing at [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] in 1976]]\n[[File:Douglas DC-9-51 N406EA EAL DCA 26.06.82 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right| The [[Douglas DC-9]] and its successor the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] served Eastern from 1965 until the airline's closure.

Delta's less-unionized work force and slowly expanding international route network helped lead it through the turbulent period following deregulation in 1978.\n\nIn 1980, a Caribbean hub was started at [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport]] (known at the time as \"Isla Verde International Airport\") near [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. In 1982, Eastern acquired [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff]]'s [[South America]]n route network. By 1985, Eastern was the largest IATA airline in terms of passengers and operated in 26 countries on three continents.\n\nDuring this era, Eastern's fleet was split between their \"silver-colored hockey stick\" livery (the lack of paint reduced weight by 100 pounds) and their \"white-colored hockey stick\" livery (on its [[Airbus]]-manufactured planes, the metallurgy of which required paint to cover the aircraft's composite skin panels).\n\nIn 1983 Eastern became the launch customer of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing 757|757]], which was ordered in 1978. Borman felt that its low cost of operation would make it an invaluable asset to the airline in the years to come. However, higher oil prices failed to materialize and the debt created by this purchase coupled with the Airbus A300 purchases in 1977 contributed to the February 1986 sale to [[Frank Lorenzo]]'s [[Texas Air]]. At that time, Eastern was paying over $700,000 in interest each day before they sold a ticket, fueled, or boarded a single aircraft.\n\nStarting about 1985, Eastern offered \"Moonlight Specials\", with passenger seats on overnight flights scheduled for cargo from thirty freight companies. The flights, which operated between midnight and 7 am, served 18 cities in the United States connecting mainly to Houston (IAH). Eric Schmitt of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that the services were \"a hybrid of late-night, red-eye flights and the barebones [[People Express Airlines (1980s)|People Express]] approach to service.\" The holds of the aircraft were reserved for cargo such as express mail, machine tool parts, and textiles. Because of this, the airline allowed each passenger to take up to two carry-on bags. The airline charged $10 for each checked bag, which was shipped standby. The airline charged between 50 cents and $3 for beverages and snacks. Bunny Duck, an Eastern flight attendant quoted in ''The New York Times'', said that the passengers on the special flights were \"a cross section of families, college kids, illegal aliens and weirdos from L.A.\".<ref>Schmitt, Eric. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/09/nyregion/overnight-flight-bargain-for-spontaneous-travelers.html?pagewanted=1 OVERNIGHT FLIGHT - BARGAIN FOR SPONTANEOUS FLYERS]\".

In an attempt to differentiate itself from its bargain competitors, Eastern began a marketing campaign stressing its quality of service and its rank of highly experienced pilots.\n\n==== Sale to Texas Air ====\nUnable to keep up, Borman agreed to the sale of the airline in 1986 to [[Texas Air]]. Led by [[Frank Lorenzo]], he had already purchased [[Continental Airlines]] and lost a bidding war for TWA to [[Carl Icahn]].\n\nIn February 1987, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] imposed a $9.5 million fine against Eastern Air Lines for safety violations,<ref>\"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-7998449.html EASTERN WILL PAY $9.5M FINE]\".

At the time, Eastern was the largest corporate employer in the Miami area and remained so after the cuts. John Nordheimer wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Eastern's prominence in the Miami area decreased as the city became a finance and trade center and experienced population increase-based economic growth, instead of a purely tourism-based growth.<ref>Nordheimer, John. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/24/us/cuts-by-eastern-shaking-miami-in-many-ways.html Cuts by Eastern Shaking Miami In Many Ways]\".

Asked to accept deep cuts in pay and benefits, on March 4, 1989, Lorenzo locked out Eastern's mechanics and ramp service employees, represented by the [[International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers]] (IAM). Concerned that Lorenzo's successful breaking of the IAM would do the same to the pilots' and flight attendants' unions, the pilots represented by [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Air Line Pilots Association]] (ALPA) and [[flight attendant]]s represented by the [[Transport Workers Union of America|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU) called a sympathy strike, which effectively shut down the airline's domestic operations. Non-contract employees, including airport gate and ticket counter agents and reservation sales agents, could not honor the strike. Due to the lockout and sympathy strike, cancelled flights resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in revenue.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nIn 1989, Lorenzo sold Eastern Air Lines Shuttle to real estate mogul [[Donald Trump]] (who named it the [[Trump Shuttle]]) while selling other parts of Eastern to his Texas Air holding company and its subsidiary, [[Continental Airlines]], at terms disadvantageous to Eastern.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} That same year, George Berry, the Georgia Industry and Trade Commissioner, asked Eastern to consider moving its headquarters from Miami to [[Atlanta]].<ref>\"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/50481317.html?dids=50481317:50481317&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+23%2C+1989&author=&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&desc=Stock+market+pulls+out+of+dive+Series%3A+Business+Digest&pqatl=google Stock market pulls out of dive Series: Business Digest].\" ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''.
