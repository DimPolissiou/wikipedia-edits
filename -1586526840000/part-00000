Typically there are tasks that learners can and cannot accomplish. Between these two areas is the zone of proximal development, which is a category of things that a learner can learn but with the help of guidance. The zone of proximal development gives guidance as to what set of skills a learner has that are in the process of maturation. In Vygotsky's definition of zone of proximal development, he highlighted the importance of learning through communication and interactions with others rather than just through independent work.[10] This has made way for the ideas of group learning, one of which being collaborative learning.\nKenneth Bruffee recently studied the roots of collaborative learning and was able to trace some applications of collaborative learning back to the 1970s.<ref>Bruffee, K. A. (1999). Collaborative learning: Higher education, interdependence, and the authority of knowledge. Johns Hopkins University Press, 2715 North Charles Street, Baltimore, MD 21218-4363.</ref> Traditional teaching strategies were not meeting the educational needs of the new college student population that began attending school after the open-door policies of the time. During Bruffee\u2019s research, he concluded to give credit to M. L. J. Abercrombie for creating the collaborative learning and peer-editing techniques. In her published work, The Anatomy of Judgment, she stated that medical students would not be able to successfully make an accurate diagnostic judgment without collaborative learning. Other theorists and professors before the 1970s had made adjustments in their teaching and classroom preparation in order to meet the needs of students. Collaborative styles of learning were also evident in the late 1700s and early 1800s. George Jardine, a professor of logic and philosophy at the University of Glasgow, wanted to implement a new style of learning in his class due to the social and political changes. He decided to use peer-editing as a form of collaborative learning to help improve his classroom techniques. <ref>Gaillet, L. L. (1992). A Foreshadowing of Modern Theories and Practices of Collaborative Learning: The Work of Scottish Rhetorician George Jardine.</ref> \n\n=== Differences from cooperative learning ===\n[edit source]\nThere has been a split regarding the differences between collaborative and cooperative learning. Some believe that collaborative learning is similar to, yet distinct from, cooperative learning. While both models use a division of labor, collaborative learning requires the mutual engagement of all participants and a coordinated effort to solve the problem. Whereas cooperative learning requires individuals to take responsibility for a specific section and then coordinate their respective parts together.[13] Another proposed differentiation is that cooperative learning is typically used for children because it is used to understand the foundations of knowledge while collaborative learning applies to college and university students because it is used to teach non-foundations of learning. Another believed difference is that collaborative learning is a philosophy of interaction whereas cooperative learning is a structure of interaction.[14]\nHowever, many psychologists have defined cooperative learning and collaborative learning similarly. Both are group learning mechanisms for learners to obtain a set of skills or knowledge. The two styles of learning have resulted in similar beneficial outcomes.<ref>Tolmie, A. K., Topping, K. J., Christie, D., Donaldson, C., Howe, C., Jessiman, E., ... & Thurston, A. (2010). Social effects of collaborative learning in primary schools. Learning and instruction, 20(3), 177-191.</ref> Some notable psychologists that use this definition for both collaborative and cooperative learning are Johnson & Johnson, Slavin, Cooper and more.\n\n=== Collaborative learning approaches ===\n \nMain article: collaborative: a sourcebook\nThere are a wide variety of learning techniques that fall under the umbrella of collaborative learning. These can take place in-class and out-of-class, through technology, or in person. Each collaborative activity has a different process and/or goal to complete within a group. People can be organized in small or large groups depending on the learning approach. Some studies argue a few of the learning approaches are separate from collaborative learning and are unique learning concepts. \n\nThe relationship between collaborative learning and cooperative learning, as previously stated, is controversial. Some suggest cooperative learning is a collaborative activity. \nCooperative learning methods vary in explanation, but overall cooperative learning ensures each participant works on a portion of the assignment to collectively complete it.<ref>Davidson, N., & Major, C. H. (2014). Boundary crossings: Cooperative learning, collaborative learning, and problem-based learning. Journal on excellence in college teaching, 25.</ref> For instance, a group could assign each member a specific job to complete for a class project. This technique gives each student a personal responsibility and one for their entire group. \n\nAnother popular technique in an educational setting is problem-centered instruction, which is used to direct. It is used to direct participants through a collaboration task. Instructions are implicated to guide team members, individually and all together. Problem-centered instruction is a tool used in a variety of collaborative learning techniques. Instructions promote students\u2019 engaged activity, because it involves timely progression. This technique also involves real-world application for participants to apply their problem-solving skills.<ref>Merrill, M. D., & Gilbert, C. G. (2008). Effective peer interaction in a problem-centered instructional strategy. Distance Education, 29(2), 199-206. Retrieved from http://byui.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/217787799?accountid=9817</ref>  \n\nIn the late 1960s guided design was developed. This learning technique focuses on using problem-centered instruction in a small group discussion with a step by step process. An open-ended question is proposed to the group and then the question is split into the following sections: (1) Define the situation and problem, (2) State the desired outcome/ goal, (3) Develop a solution or multiple, (4) Assess and evaluate the solution(s), (5) and Create a detailed plan. Participants are encouraged to follow these steps in a sequential order. Between each step, the proposed idea must be presented to a professional (teacher, leader, faculty, etc.). The professional will then give the team feedback for the group to make adjustments in the necessary area(s). The goal is for each member to have the opportunity to share ideas and receive constructive criticism in return. As a team they will resolve differences of opinion and work towards a consensus of opinion. This will aid their ability to practice social skills, communication skills, and collaboration skills. Guided Design is most commonly used in engineering, pharmacy, science programs, nursing, and liberal arts, but is also effectively practiced in other areas of education. \n\nIn the past few decades problem-centered Instruction has been a popular form of learning in medical education. In the 1950s Abercrombie examined the benefits of collaborative learning in the medical field. She concluded that students who worked in teams were able to make more accurate judgements on a case, as opposed to working individually. Many universities adopted problem-centered instruction in their medical fields. In 1985, Harvard Medical School created a new curriculum called \u201cNew Pathways\u201d that is based off of problem-center instruction. Problem-centered instruction has since then spread to other colleges.<ref>Alhaj, A. A. Y. (2014). The Effectiveness of Collaborative Learning in Improving Tertiary Students' Communicative Competence (A case Study of Medical Students at Jazan University, Kingdom Saudi Arabia (Doctoral dissertation, University of Gezira).</ref>\n\nWriting groups (also known as peer response groups, helping circles, and class criticism) is a technique that involves collaborative learning before writing papers and afterward. Groups will come together to share each other\u2019s theses and accumulate ideas for their writing prompts. Then students break away from the group and contrast their written essays. After drafts are completed, the writing group gathers, and individuals are able to receive verbal and written feedback on their draft papers. Most students learn from this learning tactic, because they can collect diverse perspectives from their team members. The environment invites a discussion about small- or large-scale dilemmas that can be research-based or solely based on beliefs/ opinions from personal experience.<ref>Lee, A., & Boud, D. (2003). Writing groups, change and academic identity: Research development as local practice. Studies in higher education, 28(2), 187-200.</ref> This learning style has proven to be very effective in high school and college level English courses. \n \nIt is common for learners to help one another to understand the concepts they struggle with. This can take place in a standard classroom setting when one student asks a nearby peer for assistance or clarification on a topic/ issue. This traditional collaborative learning approach is peer teaching. The McGill University expanded upon peer teaching and developed a systematic procedure. To moderate the study teaching, the university created four of the following focus study groups: research-oriented, expression-oriented, appreciation-oriented, and experience-oriented.<ref>Brady, E. M., Holt, S. R., & Welt, B. (2003). Peer teaching in lifelong learning institutes. Educational Gerontology, 29(10), 851-868.</ref> In this procedure, students form one-on-one pairs called \u201clearning cells\u201d. Each learning cell will help each other in the classroom and out of the classroom. They will focus on completing assignments, teaching each other difficult concepts they struggle with, and help one another prepare for upcoming exams. Research has compared the learning cell technique to other learning styles and the McGill students who applied learning cells triumphed over students who used other learning approaches, such as seminars and discussions.<ref>Goodsell, A. S. (1992). Collaborative learning: A sourcebook for higher education.</ref> \n\nIn the late 1980s another form of peer teaching evolved in mathematic education and math workshops. This learning style was developed at the University of California at Berkeley by Uri Treisman. He wanted to confront the issues with previous tutoring programs, specifically for different ethnic groups taking introductory calculus. Treisman created an improved model that concentrated on peer teaching to help the overall student population succeed.<ref>Dick, T., Stone, T., Firor, K., & Cavinato, A. G. (2002). Excel: peer teaching in collaborative Groups. In Proceeding of STEMTEC conference pathways to Change, April (pp. 19-20).</ref> He named it \u201cProfessional Development Program\u201d. The math workshops would be led by a professional instructor, usually a graduate, who would help a small group of students solve problems. The instructors encouraged peer teaching within the group. Mathematic workshops promote students to engage in collaborative activities as teachers and learners rather than individuals competing against each other to improve content knowledge. \n\nDiscussion groups and seminars are very well-known collaborative activity that relies on communication skills throughout the group. Often times the group will be presented with a prompt or question to begin the discussion. When the discussion is student led, the conversation heavily depends on the effort and comments of the group. However, in some instances an instructor may interfere to guide the conversation in a desired direction. Compared to all of the collaborative learning approaches previously explained, discussion groups and seminars are the activities with the most freedom given to participants. There is an abundance of possible discussion formats and strategies that are designed to create an environment for people to freely share their opinions and ideas about an assigned topic.<ref>Goodsell, A. S. (1992).

These can take place in-class and out-of-class, through technology, or in person. Each collaborative activity has a different process and/or goal to complete within a group. People can be organized in small or large groups depending on the learning approach. Some studies argue a few of the learning approaches are separate from collaborative learning and are unique learning concepts. \n\nThe relationship between collaborative learning and cooperative learning, as previously stated, is controversial. Some suggest cooperative learning is a collaborative activity. \nCooperative learning methods vary in explanation, but overall cooperative learning ensures each participant works on a portion of the assignment to collectively complete it.<ref>Davidson, N., & Major, C. H. (2014). Boundary crossings: Cooperative learning, collaborative learning, and problem-based learning. Journal on excellence in college teaching, 25.</ref> For instance, a group could assign each member a specific job to complete for a class project. This technique gives each student a personal responsibility and one for their entire group. \n\nAnother popular technique in an educational setting is problem-centered instruction, which is used to direct. It is used to direct participants through a collaboration task. Instructions are implicated to guide team members, individually and all together. Problem-centered instruction is a tool used in a variety of collaborative learning techniques. Instructions promote students\u2019 engaged activity, because it involves timely progression. This technique also involves real-world application for participants to apply their problem-solving skills.<ref>Merrill, M. D., & Gilbert, C. G. (2008). Effective peer interaction in a problem-centered instructional strategy. Distance Education, 29(2), 199-206. Retrieved from http://byui.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/217787799?accountid=9817</ref>  \n\nIn the late 1960s guided design was developed. This learning technique focuses on using problem-centered instruction in a small group discussion with a step by step process. An open-ended question is proposed to the group and then the question is split into the following sections: (1) Define the situation and problem, (2) State the desired outcome/ goal, (3) Develop a solution or multiple, (4) Asses and evaluate the solution(s), (5) and Create a detailed plan. Participants are encouraged to follow these steps in a sequential order. Between each step, the proposed idea must be presented to a professional (teacher, leader, faculty, etc.). The professional will then give the team feedback for the group to make adjustments in the necessary area(s). The goal is for each member to have the opportunity to share ideas and receive constructive criticism in return. As a team they will resolve differences of opinion and work towards a consensus of opinion. This will aid their ability to practice social skills, communication skills, and collaboration skills. Guided Design is most commonly used in engineering, pharmacy, science programs, nursing, and liberal arts, but is also effectively practiced in other areas of education. \n\nIn the past few decades problem-centered Instruction has been a popular form of learning in medical education. In the 1950s Abercrombie examined the benefits of collaborative learning in the medical field. She concluded that students who worked in teams were able to make more accurate judgements on a case, as opposed to working individually. Many universities adopted problem-centered instruction in their medical fields. In 1985, Harvard Medical School created a new curriculum called \u201cNew Pathways\u201d that is based off of problem-center instruction. Problem-centered instruction has since then spread to other colleges.<ref>Alhaj, A. A. Y. (2014). The Effectiveness of Collaborative Learning in Improving Tertiary Students' Communicative Competence (A case Study of Medical Students at Jazan University, Kingdom Saudi Arabia (Doctoral dissertation, University of Gezira).</ref>\n\nWriting groups (also known as peer response groups, helping circles, and class criticism) is a technique that involves collaborative learning before writing papers and afterward. Groups will come together to share each other\u2019s theses and accumulate ideas for their writing prompts. Then students break away from the group and contrast their written essays. After drafts are completed, the writing group gathers, and individuals are able to receive verbal and written feedback on their draft papers. Most students learn from this learning tactic, because they can collect diverse perspectives from their team members. The environment invites a discussion about small- or large-scale dilemmas that can be research-based or solely based on beliefs/ opinions from personal experience.<ref>Lee, A., & Boud, D. (2003). Writing groups, change and academic identity: Research development as local practice. Studies in higher education, 28(2), 187-200.</ref> This learning style has proven to be very effective in high school and college level English courses. \n \nIt is common for learners to help one another to understand the concepts they struggle with. This can take place in a standard classroom setting when one student asks a nearby peer for assistance or clarification on a topic/ issue. This traditional collaborative learning approach is peer teaching. The McGill University expanded upon peer teaching and developed a systematic procedure. To moderate the study teaching, the university created four of the following focus study groups: research-oriented, expression-oriented, appreciation-oriented, and experience-oriented.<ref>Brady, E. M., Holt, S. R., & Welt, B. (2003). Peer teaching in lifelong learning institutes. Educational Gerontology, 29(10), 851-868.</ref> In this procedure, students form one-on-one pairs called \u201clearning cells\u201d. Each learning cell will help each other in the classroom and out of the classroom. They will focus on completing assignments, teaching each other difficult concepts they struggle with, and help one another prepare for upcoming exams. Research has compared the learning cell technique to other learning styles and the McGill students who applied learning cells triumphed over students who used other learning approaches, such as seminars and discussions.<ref>Goodsell, A. S. (1992). Collaborative learning: A sourcebook for higher education.</ref> \n\nIn the late 1980s another form of peer teaching evolved in mathematic education and math workshops. This learning style was developed at the University of California at Berkeley by Uri Treisman. He wanted to confront the issues with previous tutoring programs, specifically for different ethnic groups taking introductory calculus. Treisman created an improved model that concentrated on peer teaching to help the overall student population succeed.<ref>Dick, T., Stone, T., Firor, K., & Cavinato, A. G. (2002). Excel: peer teaching in collaborative Groups. In Proceeding of STEMTEC conference pathways to Change, April (pp. 19-20).</ref> He named it \u201cProfessional Development Program\u201d. The math workshops would be led by a professional instructor, usually a graduate, who would help a small group of students solve problems. The instructors encouraged peer teaching within the group. Mathematic workshops promote students to engage in collaborative activities as teachers and learners rather than individuals competing against each other to improve content knowledge. \n\nDiscussion groups and seminars are very well-known collaborative activity that relies on communication skills throughout the group. Often times the group will be presented with a prompt or question to begin the discussion. When the discussion is student led, the conversation heavily depends on the effort and comments of the group. However, in some instances an instructor may interfere to guide the conversation in a desired direction. Compared to all of the collaborative learning approaches previously explained, discussion groups and seminars are the activities with the most freedom given to participants. There is an abundance of possible discussion formats and strategies that are designed to create an environment for people to freely share their opinions and ideas about an assigned topic.<ref>Goodsell, A. S. (1992).

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches.

The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place.

He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in Te Puke and then again in the return match in Tauranga.

''[[Oakfield (novel)|Oakfield]]'', ''[[God Seed (novel)|God Seed]]'', ''[[Dante\u2019s Fool (novel)|Dante's Fool]]'', ''[[Iron Man Project (novel)|Iron Man Project]]'', ''[[Edge (novel)|Edge]]'' and ''[[Living in Flames (novel)|Living in Flames]]'' are all near-future supernatural thrillers, while ''[[Dog Eat Dog (novel)|Dog Eat Dog]]'', ''[[The Black Lake (novel)|The Black Lake]]'' and ''[[The Social Club (novel)|The Social Club]]'', are based in the world of ''[[Yellow Dawn]]'', a [[role-playing game]] set in the same future world ten years after it has been devastated by a terrible mutagenic virus.\n[[File:David J. Rodger.jpg|thumb]]\nRodger's novels combined high-tech intrigue and political/corporate machinations with elements of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], as created by [[H.P. Lovecraft]]. Rodger's contributions to the Mythos include the creation of several new [[Great Old One]]s in his novels ''Edge'', ''Dog Eat Dog'' and ''Living in Flames'' and the use of the [[Outer God]] [[Nyarlathotep]] in the novel [[God Seed (novel)|God Seed]]. In [[Yellow Dawn]], Rodger's interpretation of the Mythos, in particular the Great Old One [[Hastur]], is a major part of the background material. Rodger also published [[Shadows of the Quantinex]], a large-scale campaign expansion for the Yellow Dawn game, and released a 2.5 Edition update to the basic game in 2013. At the time of his death in 2015, Rodger was known to have completed a 3rd Edition of the game, bringing it in line with the latest edition of the Call of Cthulhu rules system, to be published through [[Modiphius Entertainment]].<ref>http://www.modiphius.com/</ref>\n\nRodger also wrote ''[[Cloudy Head]]'', a children's story illustrated by [[Kenn-Ole Moen]], and ''[[Murder at Sharky Point]]'', a [[murder mystery game]].\n\nRodger started writing at the age of 19. He spent 8 years working for the Environment Agency (non-departmental government agency), developing a virtual communications service within the IT Division, before moving into commercial project management for a major UK publisher. In 2000 Rodger's presence on the Internet got him a place in the BBC documentary ''[[Through The Eyes of the Young]]'', directed by Chris Terrill.\n\nRodger died at his home in Bristol on Sunday, November 22, 2015, after a short illness.<ref>http://brsbkblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/sad-news-david-j-rodger-1970-2015.html</ref> Rodger is survived by his sister and his longtime girlfriend.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Novels===\n*''God Seed'' (1996)\n*''Dante's Fool'' (1999)\n*''Iron Man Project'' (2005)\n*''Edge'' (2008)\n*''Dog Eat Dog'' (2010)\n*''Living in Flames'' (2012)\n*''The Black Lake'' (2012)\n*''The Social Club'' (2013)\n*''Oakfield'' (2015)\n\n===Collections===\n*''Songs of Spheres'' (2012)\n\n===Anthologies===\n*''Achtung!

\u00d3l\u00e1fr's elder brother, [[R\u01ebgnvaldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson|R\u01ebgnvaldr]], probably had a different mother. According to the ''[[Chronicle of Mann]]'', Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r appointed \u00d3l\u00e1fr as [[heir]] since he had been born \"in lawful wedlock\". Whether or not this is the case, after Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's death in 1187 the Islesmen instead appointed R\u01ebgnvaldr as king, as he was a capable adult and \u00d3l\u00e1fr was a mere child. R\u01ebgnvaldr ruled the island-kingdom for almost forty years, during which time the half-brothers vied for the kingship.\n\n\u00d3l\u00e1fr appears to have held authority on the island of [[Lewis and Harris]]. At some point, \u00d3l\u00e1fr appears to have confronted R\u01ebgnvaldr for a larger stake in the kingdom, after which R\u01ebgnvaldr had him seized and imprisoned by the King of Scotland. Upon his release in 1214/1215, \u00d3l\u00e1fr is stated to have undertaken a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Santiago de Compostela]], after which the half-brothers were reconciled, and R\u01ebgnvaldr had \u00d3l\u00e1fr married to Lauon, the sister of his own wife. In what appears to have been a politically motivated maneuver, \u00d3l\u00e1fr had his marriage nullified by [[Reginald, Bishop of the Isles]], and proceeded to marry Cairist\u00edona, a daughter of [[Fearchar mac an tSagairt]]. Whilst Lauon appears to have been a member of [[Clann Somhairle]], a kindred led by [[Ruaidhr\u00ed mac Raghnaill]], a man closely aligned with R\u01ebgnvaldr and opposed to the Scottish Crown, Cairist\u00edona was the daughter of a rising Scottish magnate. \n\nIn 1223, \u00d3l\u00e1fr's marital actions are stated to have precipitated R\u01ebgnvaldr's son, [[Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Dond]], to attack \u00d3l\u00e1fr on [[Lewis and Harris]], driving him into [[Earldom of Ross|Ross]] to safety of his father-in-law. Together with [[P\u00e1ll B\u00e1lkason]], \u00d3l\u00e1fr later defeated Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Dond [[Skye]]. The following year, \u00d3l\u00e1fr confronted R\u01ebgnvaldr on [[Isle of Man|Mann]], and the two partitioned of the kingdom between themselves. One of R\u01ebgnvaldr's allied against \u00d3l\u00e1fr was [[Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway]], who is recorded to have campaigned in the Isles against \u00d3l\u00e1fr. There is reason to suspect that \u00d3l\u00e1fr was conversely aligned with Alan's opponent in Ireland, [[Hugh de Lacy, Earl of Ulster]]. In 1226, R\u01ebgnvaldr and Alan orchestrated the marriage of a daughter of R\u01ebgnvaldr to Alan's bastard son, [[Thomas of Galloway (bastard)|Thomas]], a union that led the Islesmen to depose R\u01ebgnvaldr in favour of \u00d3l\u00e1fr. In 1229, R\u01ebgnvaldr invaded Mann, and was killed in battle against \u00d3l\u00e1fr.\n\nIn 1230, \u00d3l\u00e1fr was forced from his kingdom to Norway by Alan and members of Clann Somhairle. In response to this latest bout of warfare in the Isles, [[H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson, King of Norway]] decided to send a royal fleet into the Isles, under the command of [[\u00d3spakr-H\u00e1kon|\u00d3spakr]], an apparent member of Clann Somhairle. When \u00d3spakr was slain early in the campaign, \u00d3l\u00e1fr took control of the fleet and secured himself on Mann. At this point, the kingdom appears to have been partitioned between him and Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Dond, with the latter ruling the Hebridean portion and \u00d3l\u00e1fr ruling Mann itself. In 1231, after the Norwegian fleet left Isles, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Dond was slain, and \u00d3l\u00e1fr ruled the whole Kingdom of the Isles peacefully, until his death in 1237. \u00d3l\u00e1fr's restoration was seen as a success by the [[Norwegian people|Norwegians]], and likely favourably viewed by the [[Scots people|Scots]] as well. \u00d3l\u00e1fr was succeeded by his son, [[Haraldr \u00d3l\u00e1fsson|Haraldr]]. In all, three of \u00d3l\u00e1fr's sons ruled the Crovan dynasty's island-kingdom\u2014the last of which, [[Magn\u00fas \u00d3l\u00e1fsson|Magn\u00fas]], was also the last of the dynasty to rule.\n\n==Uncertain inheritance==\n\n\u00d3l\u00e1fr was a member of the Crovan dynasty,<ref name=\"ZZZM1-27t1\">[[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1.</ref> and a son of [[Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r \u00d3l\u00e1fsson, King of Dublin and the Isles]].<ref>[[#ZZZM31|McDonald (2019)]] p. ix tab. 1; [[#ZZZO1|Oram (2011)]] p. xvi tab. 5; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1; [[#ZZZP1|Power (2005)]] p. 34 tab.; [[#ZZZB1|Brown, M (2004)]] p. 77 tab. 4.1; [[#ZZZM19|MacLeod (2002)]] p. 275 tab.; [[#ZZZS1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 192 tab. i; [[#ZZZM2|McDonald (1997)]] p. 259 tab.; [[#ZZZD1|Duncan; Brown (1956\u20131957)]] p. 200 tab. ii; [[#ZZZA1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 467 n. 2 tab.</ref> \u00d3l\u00e1fr's mother was Fionnghuala Nic Lochlainn.<ref>[[#ZZZM31|McDonald (2019)]] p. ix tab. 1; [[#ZZZO1|Oram (2011)]] p. xvi tab. 5; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1.</ref> Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r had several other children: [[Affrica Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir|Affrica]],<ref>[[#ZZZM31|McDonald (2019)]] p. ix tab. 1; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1; [[#ZZZP1|Power (2005)]] p. 34 tab.; [[#ZZZS1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 192 tab. i; [[#ZZZA1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 467 n. 2 tab.</ref> [[R\u01ebgnvaldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson|R\u01ebgnvaldr]],<ref>[[#ZZZM31|McDonald (2019)]] p. ix tab. 1; [[#ZZZO1|Oram (2011)]] p. xvi tab. 5; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1; [[#ZZZW1|Williams, G (2007)]] p. 141 ill. 14; [[#ZZZP1|Power (2005)]] p. 34 tab.; [[#ZZZB1|Brown, M (2004)]] p. 77 tab. 4.1; [[#ZZZM19|MacLeod (2002)]] p. 275 tab.; [[#ZZZS1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 192 tab. i; [[#ZZZM2|McDonald (1997)]] p. 259 tab.; [[#ZZZD1|Duncan; Brown (1956\u20131957)]] p. 200 tab. ii; [[#ZZZA1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 467 n. 2 tab.</ref> and \u00cdvarr.

According to the chronicle, Lochlann, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r, and about forty others lost their lives in the shipwreck.<ref>[[#ZZZO2|Oram (2013)]] ch. 4; [[#ZZZS3|Smith, JB (2014)]] p. 38, 38 n. 5; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107; [[#ZZZD15|Duffy (2002)]] p. 64; [[#ZZZW3|Williams, DGE (1997)]] pp. 260 n. 117, 261; [[#ZZZA1|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 507\u2013509; [[#ZZZM3|Munch; Goss (1874a)]] pp. 94\u201397.</ref> \n\nIt is possible that Lochlann's foster son is identical to a similarly-named individual, a certain \"{{lang|la|Godredo filio regis Mannie}}\", who attested a [[quitclaim]] between [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] and [[Ralph de Mortimer]], in about 1241.<ref>[[#ZZZS3|Smith, JB (2014)]] p. 38, 38 n. 5; [[#ZZZM4|McDonald (2007a)]] pp. 55\u201356 n. 49; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107; [[#ZZZP2|Pryce; Insley (2005)]] p. 490 \u00a7 317; [[#ZZZL1|''Liber Niger de Wigmore'' (1904)]].</ref>{{#tag:ref|The document records an important transaction, between the emerging Welsh nobleman (Llywelyn) and the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] magnate (Ralph), in which the rights of the Mortimer lordships of [[Maelienydd]] and [[Gwerthrynion]], located in eastern-central Wales, are relinquished by Llywelyn and his heirs to Ralph, his [[Gwladus Ddu|wife]] and his heirs.<ref>[[#ZZZS2|Smith, JB (2008)]]; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107; [[#ZZZP2|Pryce; Insley (2005)]] p. 490 \u00a7 317; [[#ZZZL1|''Liber Niger de Wigmore'' (1904)]].</ref>|group=note}} It is uncertain what compelled Lochlann to flee his sovereign,<ref>[[#ZZZW3|Williams, DGE (1997)]] p. 260 n. 117.</ref> and it is uncertain why he chose Wales as his destination.<ref>[[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 106.</ref> The Crovan dynasty certainly had diplomatic and familial connections with the Welsh.<ref>[[#ZZZM5|Moore, D (2013)]] ch. 3; [[#ZZZM4|McDonald (2007a)]] p. 55; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> One possibility is that the account of Lochlann's flight reveals that he attempted to replace \u00d3l\u00e1fr's son, Haraldr, with another son.<ref name=\"ZZZO2\"/> If the chronicle is incorrect in its account of the foster-son's maritime demise, and he is indeed identical to the like-named Manx prince attested in Wales, this individual's activities outwith the realm of his ancestors may have been a consequence of strife following \u00d3l\u00e1fr's death and Haraldr's accession.<ref>[[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107; [[#ZZZS3|Smith, JB (2014)]] p. 38, 38 n. 5.</ref> Haraldr's young age at the time, and the fact that he had a potential rival in the person of his like-named cousin, Haraldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson, could indicate that Haraldr had been designated as successor during his father's lifetime.<ref>[[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 171\u2013172.</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsible=yes\n|collapsed=yes\n|align=center\n|ref=\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #9fe;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #fb9;\n|1=1. \u00d3l\u00e1fr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson (died 1237)\n|2=2.

\u00d3l\u00e1fr's elder brother, [[R\u01ebgnvaldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson|R\u01ebgnvaldr]], probably had a different mother. According to the ''[[Chronicle of Mann]]'', Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r appointed \u00d3l\u00e1fr as [[heir]] since he had been born \"in lawful wedlock\". Whether or not this is the case, after Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's death in 1187 the Islesmen instead appointed R\u01ebgnvaldr as king, as he was a capable adult and \u00d3l\u00e1fr was a mere child. R\u01ebgnvaldr ruled the island-kingdom for almost forty years, during which time the half-brothers vied for the kingship.\n\n\u00d3l\u00e1fr appears to have held authority on the island of [[Lewis and Harris]]. At some point, \u00d3l\u00e1fr appears to have confronted R\u01ebgnvaldr for a larger stake in the kingdom, after which R\u01ebgnvaldr had him seized and imprisoned by the King of Scotland. Upon his release in 1214/1215, \u00d3l\u00e1fr is stated to have undertaken a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Santiago de Compostela]], after which the half-brothers were reconciled, and R\u01ebgnvaldr had \u00d3l\u00e1fr married to Lauon, the sister of his own wife. In what appears to have been a politically motivated maneuver, \u00d3l\u00e1fr had his marriage nullified by [[Reginald, Bishop of the Isles]], and proceeded to marry Cairist\u00edona, a daughter of [[Fearchar mac an tSagairt]]. Whilst Lauon appears to have been a member of [[Clann Somhairle]], a kindred led by [[Ruaidhr\u00ed mac Raghnaill]], a man closely aligned with R\u01ebgnvaldr and opposed to the Scottish Crown, Cairist\u00edona was the daughter of a rising Scottish magnate. \n\nIn 1223, \u00d3l\u00e1fr's marital actions are stated to have precipitated R\u01ebgnvaldr's son, [[Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Dond]], to attack \u00d3l\u00e1fr on [[Lewis and Harris]], driving him into [[Earldom of Ross|Ross]] to safety of his father-in-law. Together with [[P\u00e1ll B\u00e1lkason]], \u00d3l\u00e1fr later defeated Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Dond [[Skye]]. The following year, \u00d3l\u00e1fr confronted R\u01ebgnvaldr on [[Isle of Man|Mann]], and the two partitioned of the kingdom between themselves. One of R\u01ebgnvaldr's allied against \u00d3l\u00e1fr was [[Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway]], who is recorded to have campaigned in the Isles against \u00d3l\u00e1fr. There is reason to suspect that \u00d3l\u00e1fr was conversely aligned with Alan's opponent in Ireland, [[Hugh de Lacy, Earl of Ulster]]. In 1226, R\u01ebgnvaldr and Alan orchestrated the marriage of a daughter of R\u01ebgnvaldr to Alan's bastard son, [[Thomas of Galloway (bastard)|Thomas]], a union that led the Islesmen to depose R\u01ebgnvaldr in favour of \u00d3l\u00e1fr. In 1229, R\u01ebgnvaldr invaded Mann, and was killed in battle against \u00d3l\u00e1fr.\n\nIn 1230, \u00d3l\u00e1fr was forced from his kingdom to Norway by Alan and members of Clann Somhairle. In response to this latest bout of warfare in the Isles, [[H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson, King of Norway]] decided to send a royal fleet into the Isles, under the command of [[\u00d3spakr-H\u00e1kon|\u00d3spakr]], an apparent member of Clann Somhairle. When \u00d3spakr was slain early in the campaign, \u00d3l\u00e1fr took control of the fleet and secured himself on Mann. At this point, the kingdom appears to have been partitioned between him and Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Dond, with the latter ruling the Hebridean portion and \u00d3l\u00e1fr ruling Mann itself. In 1231, after the Norwegian fleet left Isles, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Dond was slain, and \u00d3l\u00e1fr ruled the whole Kingdom of the Isles peacefully, until his death in 1237. \u00d3l\u00e1fr's restoration was seen as a success by the [[Norwegian people|Norwegians]], and likely favourably viewed by the [[Scots people|Scots]] as well. \u00d3l\u00e1fr was succeeded by his son, [[Haraldr \u00d3l\u00e1fsson|Haraldr]].

According to the chronicle, Lochlann, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r, and about forty others lost their lives in the shipwreck.<ref>[[#ZZZO2|Oram (2013)]] ch. 4; [[#ZZZS3|Smith, JB (2014)]] p. 38, 38 n. 5; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107; [[#ZZZD15|Duffy (2002)]] p. 64; [[#ZZZW3|Williams, DGE (1997)]] pp. 260 n. 117, 261; [[#ZZZA1|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 507\u2013509; [[#ZZZM3|Munch; Goss (1874a)]] pp. 94\u201397.</ref> \n\nIt is possible that Lochlann's foster son is identical to a similarly-named individual, a certain \"{{lang|la|Godredo filio regis Mannie}}\", who attested a [[quitclaim]] between [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] and [[Ralph de Mortimer]], in about 1241.<ref>[[#ZZZS3|Smith, JB (2014)]] p. 38, 38 n. 5; [[#ZZZM4|McDonald (2007a)]] pp. 55\u201356 n. 49; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107; [[#ZZZP2|Pryce; Insley (2005)]] p. 490 \u00a7 317; [[#ZZZL1|''Liber Niger de Wigmore'' (1904)]].</ref>{{#tag:ref|The document records an important transaction, between the emerging Welsh nobleman (Llywelyn) and the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] magnate (Ralph), in which the rights of the Mortimer lordships of [[Maelienydd]] and [[Gwerthrynion]], located in eastern-central Wales, are relinquished by Llywelyn and his heirs to Ralph, his [[Gwladus Ddu|wife]] and his heirs.<ref>[[#ZZZS2|Smith, JB (2008)]]; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107; [[#ZZZP2|Pryce; Insley (2005)]] p. 490 \u00a7 317; [[#ZZZL1|''Liber Niger de Wigmore'' (1904)]].</ref>|group=note}} It is uncertain what compelled Lochlann to flee his sovereign,<ref>[[#ZZZW3|Williams, DGE (1997)]] p. 260 n. 117.</ref> and it is uncertain why he chose Wales as his destination.<ref>[[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 106.</ref> The Crovan dynasty certainly had diplomatic and familial connections with the Welsh.<ref>[[#ZZZM5|Moore, D (2013)]] ch. 3; [[#ZZZM4|McDonald (2007a)]] p. 55; [[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> One possibility is that the account of Lochlann's flight reveals that he attempted to replace \u00d3l\u00e1fr's son, Haraldr, with another son.<ref name=\"ZZZO2\"/> If the chronicle is incorrect in its account of the foster-son's maritime demise, and he is indeed identical to the like-named Manx prince attested in Wales, this individual's activities outwith the realm of his ancestors may have been a consequence of strife following \u00d3l\u00e1fr's death and Haraldr's accession.<ref>[[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 106\u2013107; [[#ZZZS3|Smith, JB (2014)]] p. 38, 38 n. 5.</ref> Haraldr's young age at the time, and the fact that he had a potential rival in the person of his like-named cousin, Haraldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson, could indicate that Haraldr had been designated as successor during his father's lifetime.<ref>[[#ZZZM1|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 171\u2013172.</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsible=yes\n|collapsed=yes\n|align=center\n|ref=\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #9fe;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #fb9;\n|1=1. \u00d3l\u00e1fr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson (died 1237)\n|2=2.
