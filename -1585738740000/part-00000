This allows the endodontist to choose the most appropriate treatment option, allowing preservation and longevity of the tooth and surrounding tissues. Treatment options for an irreversibly inflamed pulp (irreversible pulpitis) include either extraction of the tooth or removal of the [[pulp (tooth)|pulp]].\n\nRemoving the infected/inflamed pulpal tissue enables the [[endodontist]] to help preserve the longevity and function of the tooth. The treatment option chosen involves taking into account the expected prognosis of the tooth, as well as the patient's wishes. A full history is required (which includes the patient's symptoms and medical history), along with a clinical examination (both inside and outside the mouth), and the use of diagnostic tests <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrotte P | title = Endodontics: Part 2 Diagnosis and treatment planning | language = En | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 197 | issue = 5 | pages = 231\u20138 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15359316 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.4811612 }}</ref>\n\nThere are several diagnostic tests that can aid in the diagnosis of the dental pulp and the surrounding tissues.\nThese include:\n* Palpation (this is where the tip of the root is felt from the overlying tissues to see if there is any swelling or tenderness present)\n* Mobility (this is assessing if there is more than normal movement of the tooth in the socket)\n* Percussion (TTP, tender to percussion; the tooth is tapped to see if there is any tenderness)\n* Transillumination (shining a light through the tooth to see if there are any noticeable fractures)\n* Tooth slooth (this is where the patient is asked to bite down upon a plastic instrument; useful if the patient complains of pain on biting as this can be used to localise the tooth)\n* Radiographs \n* [[Dental pulp test]]s\n\nIn the situation that a tooth is considered so threatened (because of decay, cracking, etc.) that future infection is considered likely or inevitable, a pulpectomy (removal of the pulp tissue) is advisable to prevent such infection.

The double flare is a procedure introduced by Fava where the canal is explored using a small file. Then canal is prepared in crown down manner using K-files then follows a \"step back\" preparation with 1&nbsp;mm increments with increasing file sizes. With early coronal enlargement, also described as \"three times technique\", apical canals are prepared after a working length assessment using an [[apex location|apex locator]]; then progressively enlarged with Gates Glidden drills (only [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|coronal]] and middle third).

In the balanced forces technique, the dentist inserts a file into the canal and rotates clockwise a quarter of a turn, engaging dentin, then rotates counter-clockwise half/ three-quarter of a revolution, applying pressure in an apical direction, shearing off tissue previously meshed. From the balanced forces stem two other techniques: the reverse balanced force (where GT instruments are rotated first anti-clockwise and then clockwise) and the gentler \"feed and pull\" where the instrument is rotated only a quarter of a revolution and moved coronally after an engagement, but not drawn out.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n=== Irrigation ===\n\nThe root canal is flushed with an irrigant.

The standard endodontic technique involves inserting a gutta-percha cone (a \"point\") into the cleaned-out root canal along with a sealing cement.<ref>{{cite book |last = Tronstad |first = Leif | name-list-format = vanc |title = Clinical Endodontics: A Textbook |year = 2008 |publisher = Thieme |isbn = 978-3-13-768103-8 }}</ref> Another technique uses melted or heat-softened gutta-percha which is then injected or pressed into the root canal passage(s). However, since gutta-percha shrinks as it cools, thermal techniques can be unreliable and sometimes a combination of techniques is used. Gutta-percha is [[Radiodensity|radiopaque]], allowing verification afterwards that the root canal passages have been completely filled and are without voids.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAn alternative filling material was invented in the early 1950s by Angelo Sargenti. Filling material has undergone several formulations over the years (N2, N2 Universal, RC-2B, RC-2B White), but all contain [[paraformaldehyde]]. The paraformaldehyde, when placed into the root canal, forms [[formaldehyde]], which penetrates and sterilizes the passage. The formaldehyde is then theoretically transformed into harmless water and carbon dioxide. According to some research, the outcome of this method is better than a root canal procedure performed with gutta-percha. There is, however, a lack of indisputable scientific studies according to the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Resin based root canal sealer.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Root canal sealer used to fill the spaces between the gutta-percha and the walls of root canal and between the gutta-percha cones]]\nIn rare cases, the paste, like any other material, can be forced past the root tip into the surrounding bone. If this happens, the formaldehyde will immediately be transformed into a harmless substance. Blood normally contains 2&nbsp;mg formaldehyde per liter and the body regulates this in seconds. The rest of an overfill will be gradually absorbed and the end result is normally good. In 1991, the ADA Council on Dental Therapeutics resolved that the treatment was \"not recommended\", and it is not taught in American dental schools.

Sometimes the abscess can be drained, antibiotics prescribed, and the procedure reattempted when inflammation has been mitigated. The tooth can also be unroofed to allow drainage and help relieve pressure.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nA root treated tooth may be eased from the occlusion as a measure to prevent tooth fracture prior to the cementation of a crown or similar restoration. Sometimes the dentist performs preliminary treatment of the tooth by removing all of the infected pulp of the tooth and applying a dressing and temporary filling to the tooth. This is called a pulpectomy. The dentist may also remove just the coronal portion of the dental pulp, which contains 90% of the nerve tissue, and leave intact the pulp in the canals. This procedure, called a \"pulpotomy\", tends to essentially eliminate all the pain. A [[pulpotomy]] may be a relatively definitive treatment for infected [[deciduous teeth|primary teeth]]. The pulpectomy and pulpotomy procedures aim to eliminate pain until the follow-up visit for finishing the root canal procedure. Further occurrences of pain could indicate the presence of continuing infection or retention of vital nerve tissue.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSome dentists may decide to temporarily fill the canal with [[calcium hydroxide]] paste in order to thoroughly sterilize the site.  This  strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] is left in place for a week or more to disinfect and reduce inflammation in surrounding tissue, requiring the patient to return for a second or third visit to complete the procedure.

This is because the access made into the root canal system removes a significant amount of tooth structure. Molars and premolars are the primary teeth used in chewing and will almost certainly fracture in the future without cuspal coverage. Anterior teeth typically do not require full coverage restorations after a root canal procedure, unless there is extensive tooth loss from decay or for esthetics or unusual occlusion.  Placement of a crown or cusp-protecting cast gold covering is recommended also because these have the best ability to seal the treated tooth. There is insufficient evidence to assess the effects of crowns compared to conventional fillings for the <abbr>restoration</abbr> of root-filled teeth, decision of restoration should rely on the clinical experience of the practitioner and the preference of the patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sequeira-Byron P, Fedorowicz Z, Carter B, Nasser M, Alrowaili EF | title = Single crowns versus conventional fillings for the restoration of root-filled teeth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD009109 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26403154 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009109.pub3 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/CD009109/ORAL_single-crowns-or-routine-fillings-restoration-root-filled-teeth }}</ref>  If the tooth is not perfectly sealed, the canal may leak, causing eventual failure. A tooth with a root canal treatment still has the ability to decay, and without proper home care and an adequate [[fluoride]] source the tooth structure can become severely decayed (often without the patient's knowledge since the nerve has been removed, leaving the tooth without any [[dental pain|pain]] perception). Thus, non-restorable [[dental caries|carious]] destruction is the main reason for extraction of teeth after root canal therapy, accounting for up to two-thirds of these extractions.<ref name=ZadikOOOOE /> Therefore, it is very important to have regular [[Dental radiography|X-rays]] taken of the root canal to ensure that the tooth is not having any problems that the patient would not be aware of.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n=== Endodontic retreatment ===\nEndodontic treatment may fail for many reasons: one common reason for failure is inadequate chemomechanical [[debridement]] of the root canal. This may be due to poor endodontic access, missed anatomy or inadequate shaping of the canal, particularly in the apical third of the root canal, also due to the difficulty of reaching the accessory canals which are minute canals that extend in from the pulp to the periodontium in a random direction. They are mostly found in the apical third of the root.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vertucci|first=Frank J. | name-list-format = vanc  |date=November 1984|title=Root canal anatomy of the human permanent teeth|journal=Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology|volume=58|issue=5|pages=589\u2013599|doi=10.1016/0030-4220(84)90085-9|pmid=6595621 |issn=0030-4220}}</ref>\n\nExposure of the obturation material to the oral environment may mean the gutta-percha is contaminated with oral bacteria. If complex and expensive restorative dentistry is contemplated then ideally the contaminated gutta percha would be replaced in a retreatment procedure to minimise the risk of failure.\n\nThe type of bacteria found within a failed canal may differ from the normal infected tooth. [[Enterococcus faecalis]] and/or other facultative enteric bacteria or [[Pseudomonas]] sp. are found in this situation.\n\nEndodontic retreatment is technically demanding; it can be a time-consuming procedure, as meticulous care is required by the [[dentist]]. Retreatment cases are typically referred to a specialist [[endodontist]]. Use of an [[operating microscope]] or other magnification may improve outcomes.\n\n== Instruments and equipment used ==\n{{See also|Endodontic files and reamers|Nickel titanium rotary file}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\n\nSince 2000 there have been great innovations in the art and science of root canal therapy. Dentists now must be educated on the current concepts in order to optimally perform a root canal procedure. Root canal therapy has become more automated and can be performed faster thanks in part to machine-driven rotary technology and more advanced root canal filling methods. Many root canal procedures are done in one dental visit which may last for around 1\u20132 hours. Newer technologies are available (e.g. cone-beam CT scanning) that allow more efficient, scientific measurements to be taken of the dimensions of the root canal, however, the use of CT scanning in endodontics has to be justified.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmc = 5730974|year = 2017|last1 = Shukla|first1 = S|title = Role of Cone Beam Computed Tomography in Diagnosis and Treatment Planning in Dentistry: An Update|journal = Journal of International Society of Preventive and Community Dentistry|volume = 7|issue = Suppl 3|pages = S125\u2013S136|last2 = Chug|first2 = A|last3 = Afrashtehfar|first3 = K.

The file segment may be left behind if an acceptable level of cleaning and shaping has already been completed and attempting to remove the segment would risk damage to the tooth. While potentially disconcerting to the patient, having metal inside of a tooth is relatively common, such as with metal posts, amalgam fillings, gold crowns, and porcelain fused to metal crowns. The occurrence of file separation depends on the narrowness, curvature, length, calcification and number of roots on the tooth being treated.

On a maxillary [[molar (tooth)|molar]], there is more than a 50% chance that the tooth has four canals instead of just three, but the fourth canal, often called a \"mesio-buccal 2\", tends to be very difficult to see and often requires special instruments and magnification in order to see it (most commonly found in first maxillary molars; studies have shown an average of 76% up to 96% of such teeth with the presence of an MB2 canal). This infected canal may cause a continued infection or \"flare-up\" of the tooth. Any tooth may have more canals than expected, and these canals may be missed when the root canal procedure is performed. Sometimes canals may be unusually shaped, making them impossible to clean and fill completely; some infected material may remain in the canal. Sometimes the canal filling does not fully extend to the apex of the tooth, or it does not fill the canal as densely as it should. Sometimes a tooth root may be perforated while the root canal is being treated, making it difficult to fill the tooth. The perforation may be filled with a root repair material, such as one derived from natural cement called [[mineral trioxide aggregate]] (MTA). A specialist can often re-treat failing root canals, and these teeth will then heal, often years after the initial root canal procedure.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nHowever, the survival or functionality of the endodontically treated tooth is often the most important aspect of endodontic treatment outcomes, rather than apical healing alone.<ref>{{Citation |vauthors = Friedman S, Mor C |title = The success of endodontic therapy: healing and functionality |journal = J Calif Dent Assoc |volume = 32 |issue = 6 |pages = 493\u2013503 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15344440 |postscript = . }}</ref>\nRecent studies indicate that substances commonly used to clean the root canal space incompletely sterilize the canal.<ref>{{Citation |year = 2004 |title = Molecular evaluation of residual endodontic microorganisms after instrumentation, irrigation and medication with either calcium hydroxide or Septomixine |journal = Oral Diseases |pages = 389\u2013397 |doi = 10.1111/j.1601-0825.2004.01015.x |author1 = G Tang |author2 = LP Samaranayake |author3 = H-K Yip |volume = 10 |issue = 6 |pmid = 15533217 }}</ref> A properly restored tooth following root canal therapy yields long-term success rates near 97%.

In the 1930s, this theory was discredited, but the theory was recently revived by a book entitled ''Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed'' which used the early discredited research, and further complicated by epidemiological studies which found correlations between periodontal disease and heart disease, strokes, and preterm births.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The book's author, George Meinig, has been a strong advocate against endodontic therapy for years; he has since lost his dental license for gross negligence and ''Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed'' has come under great criticism.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Bacteremia]] (bacteria in the bloodstream) can be caused by many everyday activities, e.g. brushing teeth, but may also occur after any dental procedure which involves bleeding.

The treatment option chosen involves taking into account the expected prognosis of the tooth, as well as the patient's wishes. A full history is required (which includes the patient's symptoms and medical history), along with a clinical examination (both inside and outside the mouth), and the use of diagnostic tests <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrotte P | title = Endodontics: Part 2 Diagnosis and treatment planning | language = En | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 197 | issue = 5 | pages = 231\u20138 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15359316 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.4811612 }}</ref>\n\nThere are several diagnostic tests that can aid in the diagnosis of the dental pulp and the surrounding tissues.\nThese include:\n* Palpation (this is where the tip of the root is felt from the overlying tissues to see if there is any swelling or tenderness present)\n* Mobility (this is assessing if there is more than normal movement of the tooth in the socket)\n* Percussion (TTP, tender to percussion; the tooth is tapped to see if there is any tenderness)\n* Transillumination (shining a light through the tooth to see if there are any noticeable fractures)\n* Tooth slooth (this is where the patient is asked to bite down upon a plastic instrument; useful if the patient complains of pain on biting as this can be used to localise the tooth)\n* Radiographs \n* [[Dental pulp test]]s\n\nIn the situation that a tooth is considered so threatened (because of decay, cracking, etc.) that future infection is considered likely or inevitable, a pulpectomy (removal of the pulp tissue) is advisable to prevent such infection.

The standard endodontic technique involves inserting a gutta-percha cone (a \"point\") into the cleaned-out root canal along with a sealing cement.<ref>{{cite book |last = Tronstad |first = Leif | name-list-format = vanc |title = Clinical Endodontics: A Textbook |year = 2008 |publisher = Thieme |isbn = 978-3-13-768103-8 }}</ref> Another technique uses melted or heat-softened gutta-percha which is then injected or pressed into the root canal passage(s). However, since gutta-percha shrinks as it cools, thermal techniques can be unreliable and sometimes a combination of techniques is used. Gutta-percha is [[Radiodensity|radiopaque]], allowing verification afterwards that the root canal passages have been completely filled and are without voids.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAn alternative filling material was invented in the early 1950s by Angelo Sargenti. Filling material has undergone several formulations over the years (N2, N2 Universal, RC-2B, RC-2B White), but all contain [[paraformaldehyde]]. The paraformaldehyde, when placed into the root canal, forms [[formaldehyde]], which penetrates and sterilizes the passage. The formaldehyde is then theoretically transformed into harmless water and carbon dioxide. According to some research, the outcome of this method is better than a root canal procedure performed with gutta-percha. There is, however, a lack of indisputable scientific studies according to the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Resin based root canal sealer.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Root canal sealer used to fill the spaces between the gutta-percha and the walls of root canal and between the gutta-percha cones]]\nIn rare cases, the paste, like any other material, can be forced past the root tip into the surrounding bone. If this happens, the formaldehyde will immediately be transformed into a harmless substance. Blood normally contains 2&nbsp;mg formaldehyde per liter and the body regulates this in seconds. The rest of an overfill will be gradually absorbed and the end result is normally good. In 1991, the ADA Council on Dental Therapeutics resolved that the treatment was \"not recommended\", and it is not taught in American dental schools.

Sometimes the abscess can be drained, antibiotics prescribed, and the procedure reattempted when inflammation has been mitigated. The tooth can also be unroofed to allow drainage and help relieve pressure.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nA root treated tooth may be eased from the occlusion as a measure to prevent tooth fracture prior to the cementation of a crown or similar restoration. Sometimes the dentist performs preliminary treatment of the tooth by removing all of the infected pulp of the tooth and applying a dressing and temporary filling to the tooth. This is called a pulpectomy. The dentist may also remove just the coronal portion of the dental pulp, which contains 90% of the nerve tissue, and leave intact the pulp in the canals. This procedure, called a \"pulpotomy\", tends to essentially eliminate all the pain. A [[pulpotomy]] may be a relatively definitive treatment for infected [[deciduous teeth|primary teeth]]. The pulpectomy and pulpotomy procedures aim to eliminate pain until the follow-up visit for finishing the root canal procedure. Further occurrences of pain could indicate the presence of continuing infection or retention of vital nerve tissue.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSome dentists may decide to temporarily fill the canal with [[calcium hydroxide]] paste in order to thoroughly sterilize the site.

This is because the access made into the root canal system removes a significant amount of tooth structure. Molars and premolars are the primary teeth used in chewing and will almost certainly fracture in the future without cuspal coverage. Anterior teeth typically do not require full coverage restorations after a root canal procedure, unless there is extensive tooth loss from decay or for esthetics or unusual occlusion.  Placement of a crown or cusp-protecting cast gold covering is recommended also because these have the best ability to seal the treated tooth. There is insufficient evidence to assess the effects of crowns compared to conventional fillings for the <abbr>restoration</abbr> of root-filled teeth, decision of restoration should rely on the clinical experience of the practitioner and the preference of the patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sequeira-Byron P, Fedorowicz Z, Carter B, Nasser M, Alrowaili EF | title = Single crowns versus conventional fillings for the restoration of root-filled teeth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD009109 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26403154 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009109.pub3 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/CD009109/ORAL_single-crowns-or-routine-fillings-restoration-root-filled-teeth }}</ref>  If the tooth is not perfectly sealed, the canal may leak, causing eventual failure. A tooth with a root canal treatment still has the ability to decay, and without proper home care and an adequate [[fluoride]] source the tooth structure can become severely decayed (often without the patient's knowledge since the nerve has been removed, leaving the tooth without any [[dental pain|pain]] perception). Thus, non-restorable [[dental caries|carious]] destruction is the main reason for extraction of teeth after root canal therapy, accounting for up to two-thirds of these extractions.<ref name=ZadikOOOOE /> Therefore, it is very important to have regular [[Dental radiography|X-rays]] taken of the root canal to ensure that the tooth is not having any problems that the patient would not be aware of.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n=== Endodontic retreatment ===\nEndodontic treatment may fail for many reasons: one common reason for failure is inadequate chemomechanical [[debridement]] of the root canal. This may be due to poor endodontic access, missed anatomy or inadequate shaping of the canal, particularly in the apical third of the root canal, also due to the difficulty of reaching the accessory canals which are minute canals that extend in from the pulp to the periodontium in a random direction. They are mostly found in the apical third of the root.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vertucci|first=Frank J. | name-list-format = vanc  |date=November 1984|title=Root canal anatomy of the human permanent teeth|journal=Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology|volume=58|issue=5|pages=589\u2013599|doi=10.1016/0030-4220(84)90085-9|pmid=6595621 |issn=0030-4220}}</ref>\n\nExposure of the obturation material to the oral environment may mean the gutta-percha is contaminated with oral bacteria.

[[Enterococcus faecalis]] and/or other facultative enteric bacteria or [[Pseudomonas]] sp. are found in this situation.\n\nEndodontic retreatment is technically demanding; it can be a time-consuming procedure, as meticulous care is required by the [[dentist]].

The file segment may be left behind if an acceptable level of cleaning and shaping has already been completed and attempting to remove the segment would risk damage to the tooth. While potentially disconcerting to the patient, having metal inside of a tooth is relatively common, such as with metal posts, amalgam fillings, gold crowns, and porcelain fused to metal crowns. The occurrence of file separation depends on the narrowness, curvature, length, calcification and number of roots on the tooth being treated.

On a maxillary [[molar (tooth)|molar]], there is more than a 50% chance that the tooth has four canals instead of just three, but the fourth canal, often called a \"mesio-buccal 2\", tends to be very difficult to see and often requires special instruments and magnification in order to see it (most commonly found in first maxillary molars; studies have shown an average of 76% up to 96% of such teeth with the presence of an MB2 canal). This infected canal may cause a continued infection or \"flare-up\" of the tooth. Any tooth may have more canals than expected, and these canals may be missed when the root canal procedure is performed. Sometimes canals may be unusually shaped, making them impossible to clean and fill completely; some infected material may remain in the canal. Sometimes the canal filling does not fully extend to the apex of the tooth, or it does not fill the canal as densely as it should. Sometimes a tooth root may be perforated while the root canal is being treated, making it difficult to fill the tooth. The perforation may be filled with a root repair material, such as one derived from natural cement called [[mineral trioxide aggregate]] (MTA). A specialist can often re-treat failing root canals, and these teeth will then heal, often years after the initial root canal procedure.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nHowever, the survival or functionality of the endodontically treated tooth is often the most important aspect of endodontic treatment outcomes, rather than apical healing alone.<ref>{{Citation |vauthors = Friedman S, Mor C |title = The success of endodontic therapy: healing and functionality |journal = J Calif Dent Assoc |volume = 32 |issue = 6 |pages = 493\u2013503 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15344440 |postscript = . }}</ref>\nRecent studies indicate that substances commonly used to clean the root canal space incompletely sterilize the canal.<ref>{{Citation |year = 2004 |title = Molecular evaluation of residual endodontic microorganisms after instrumentation, irrigation and medication with either calcium hydroxide or Septomixine |journal = Oral Diseases |pages = 389\u2013397 |doi = 10.1111/j.1601-0825.2004.01015.x |author1 = G Tang |author2 = LP Samaranayake |author3 = H-K Yip |volume = 10 |issue = 6 |pmid = 15533217 }}</ref> A properly restored tooth following root canal therapy yields long-term success rates near 97%.

This was called the \"[[focal infection theory]]\", and it led some dentists to advocate [[dental extraction]]. In the 1930s, this theory was discredited, but the theory was recently revived by a book entitled ''Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed'' which used the early discredited research, and further complicated by epidemiological studies which found correlations between periodontal disease and heart disease, strokes, and preterm births.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The book's author, George Meinig, has been a strong advocate against endodontic therapy for years; he has since lost his dental license for gross negligence and ''Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed'' has come under great criticism.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Bacteremia]] (bacteria in the bloodstream) can be caused by many everyday activities, e.g. brushing teeth, but may also occur after any dental procedure which involves bleeding.

He is the majority owner and co-founder of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]. He was the mayor of [[New York City]] from 2002 to 2013, and was briefly a candidate in the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]].\n\nBloomberg grew up in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] and graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Harvard Business School]]. He began his career at the securities brokerage [[Salomon Brothers]] before forming his own company in 1981. That company, Bloomberg L.P., is a financial information, software and media firm that is known for its [[Bloomberg Terminal]]. Bloomberg spent the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. In 2019, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him as [[The World's Billionaires#2019|the ninth-richest person in the world]], with an estimated net worth of $55.5 billion. Since signing [[The Giving Pledge]], Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.\n\nBloomberg was elected the [[List of mayors of New York City|108th]] [[mayor of New York City]]. First elected [[2001 New York City mayoral election|in 2001]], he held office for three consecutive terms, winning re-election [[2005 New York City mayoral election|in 2005]] and [[2009 New York City mayoral election|in 2009]].

He also led a rezoning of large areas of New York City, which facilitated massive and widespread new commercial and residential construction after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Bloomberg is considered to have had far-reaching influence on [[politics of New York City|the politics]], [[Economy of New York City|business sector]], and [[culture of New York City]] during his three terms as mayor. He has also faced significant criticism for his expansion of the city's [[stop and frisk]] program.\n\nIn November 2019, Bloomberg officially launched [[Michael Bloomberg 2020 presidential campaign|his campaign]] for the Democratic nomination for [[president of the United States]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He ended his campaign in March 2020, after having won only 61 delegates.

(born February 14, 1942) is an American businessman, politician, philanthropist, and author. He is the majority owner and co-founder of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]. He was the mayor of [[New York City]] from 2002 to 2013, and was briefly a candidate in the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]].\n\nBloomberg grew up in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] and graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Harvard Business School]]. He began his career at the securities brokerage [[Salomon Brothers]] before forming his own company in 1981. That company, Bloomberg L.P., is a financial information, software and media firm that is known for its [[Bloomberg Terminal]]. Bloomberg spent the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. In 2019, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him as [[The World's Billionaires#2019|the ninth-richest person in the world]], with an estimated net worth of $55.5 billion. Since signing [[The Giving Pledge]], Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.\n\nBloomberg was elected the [[List of mayors of New York City|108th]] [[mayor of New York City]]. First elected [[2001 New York City mayoral election|in 2001]], he held office for three consecutive terms, winning re-election [[2005 New York City mayoral election|in 2005]] and [[2009 New York City mayoral election|in 2009]]. Pursuing [[Political positions of Michael Bloomberg|socially liberal and fiscally moderate policies]], Bloomberg developed a [[Technocracy|technocratic managerial style]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/01/nyregion/political-memo-bloomberg-the-technocrat-seeks-his-inner-la-guardia.html |title=Political Memo; Bloomberg, the Technocrat, Seeks His Inner La Guardia |author1=Cooper, Michael |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 1, 2003|accessdate=February 25, 2020|url-access=limited}}</ref> After a brief stint as a full-time philanthropist, he re-assumed the position of CEO at Bloomberg L.P. by the end of 2014.\n\nAs mayor of New York, Bloomberg established public [[charter school]]s, rebuilt urban infrastructure, and supported [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]], [[public health]] initiatives, and [[Environmental policy of the United States|environmental protections]]. He also led a rezoning of large areas of New York City, which facilitated massive and widespread new commercial and residential construction after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Bloomberg is considered to have had far-reaching influence on [[politics of New York City|the politics]], [[Economy of New York City|business sector]], and [[culture of New York City]] during his three terms as mayor. He has also faced significant criticism for his expansion of the city's [[stop and frisk]] program.\n\nIn November 2019, Bloomberg officially launched [[Michael Bloomberg 2020 presidential campaign|his campaign]] for the Democratic nomination for [[president of the United States]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He ended his campaign in March 2020, after having won only 61 delegates.

Later in November, Agresta was terminated by the department for a low call response percentage.  Agresta maintains that the termination was a political action taken by the department, spearheaded by his political opponent's brother and husband who are respectively the President and Chief of the department as retaliation for his candidacy for the office of Councilman.  Agresta has explained his low call response percentage by stating that he was on academic leave from the department.  He filed a suit for retaliatory termination and civil rights violations in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.<ref>http://www.northjersey.com/news/crimeandcourts/36362974.html</ref>  Pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into on September 2, 2009, the insurance company representing the defendants agreed to pay a portion of Agresta's legal fees.

He filed a suit for retaliatory termination and civil rights violations in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.<ref>http://www.northjersey.com/news/crimeandcourts/36362974.html</ref>  Pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into on September 2, 2009, the insurance company representing the defendants agreed to pay a portion of Agresta's legal fees.  The Englewood Cliffs Fire Department agreed to reinstate Agresta and his brother in good standing.  Contemporaneously Agresta and his brother resigned from the department in good standing.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box\n| title = [[Englewood Cliffs Council|Councilman]]\n| before = Patricia Drimones\n| after = ''Edward Aversa''\n| years = November 2008 \u2013 present\n}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n* Councilman-elect sues town and county officials<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121102083243/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-159252218.html Councilman-elect sues town and county officials by Maya Kremen, Bergen Record], [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]].

He devised [[Le Chatelier's principle]], used by chemists and chemical engineers to predict the effect a changing condition has on a system in [[chemical equilibrium]]. He has also been credited with inventing [[French kissing]], although this has been discredited\n\n==Early life==\nLe Chatelier was born on 8 October 1850 in Paris and was the son of French materials engineer [[Louis Le Chatelier]] and Louise Durand. His father was an influential figure who played important roles in the birth of the French [[aluminium]] industry, the introduction of the [[Martin-Siemens process]]es into the iron and steel industries, and the rise of railway transportation. Le Chatelier's father profoundly influenced his son's future. Henry Louis had one sister, Marie, and four brothers, Louis (1853\u20131928), [[Alfred Le Chatelier|Alfred (1855\u20131929)]], George (1857\u20131935), and Andr\u00e9 (1861\u20131929). His mother raised the children by regimen, described by Henry Louis: \"I was accustomed to a very strict discipline: it was necessary to wake up on time, to prepare for your duties and lessons, to eat everything on your plate, etc. All my life I maintained respect for order and law. Order is one of the most perfect forms of civilization.\"<ref>L. Guillet, ''R\u00e9vue de m\u00e9tallurgie'', special edition, January 1937</ref>\n\nAs a child, Le Chatelier attended the [[Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]] in Paris. At the age of 19, after only one year of instruction in specialized engineering, he followed in his father's footsteps by enrolling in the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] on 25 October 1869. Like all the pupils of the Polytechnique, in September 1870, Le Chatelier was named second lieutenant and later took part in the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871)|Siege of Paris]]. After brilliant successes in his technical schooling, he entered the [[\u00c9cole des Mines]] in Paris in 1871.\n\nLe Chatelier married Genevi\u00e8ve Nicolas, a friend of the family and sister of four fellow students of the Polytechnique. They had seven children, four girls and three boys, five of whom entered scientific fields; two died preceding Le Chatelier's death.\n\n==Career==\nDespite training as an engineer, and even with his interests in industrial problems, Le Chatelier chose to teach chemistry rather than pursue a career in industry. In 1887, he was appointed head of the general chemistry to the preparatory course of the \u00c9cole des Mines in Paris. He tried unsuccessfully to get a position teaching chemistry at the \u00c9cole polytechnique in 1884 and again in 1897.\n\nAt the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Le Chatelier succeeded [[Paul Sch\u00fctzenberger|Sch\u00fctzenberger]] as chair of inorganic chemistry. Later he taught at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] university, where he replaced [[Henri Moissan]].\n\nAt the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Le Chatelier taught: \n:*Phenomena of combustion (1898)\n:*Theory of chemical equilibria, high temperature measurements and phenomena of dissociation (1898\u20131899)\n:*Properties of metal alloys (1899\u20131900)\n:*Iron alloys (1900\u20131901)\n:*General methods of analytical chemistry (1901\u20131902)\n:*General laws of analytical chemistry (1901\u20131902)\n:*General laws of chemical mechanics (1903)\n:*Silica and its compounds (1905\u20131906)\n:*Some practical applications of the fundamental principles of chemistry (1906\u20131907)\n:*Properties of metals and some alloys (1907)\n\nAfter four unsuccessful campaigns (1884, 1897, 1898 and 1900), Le Chatelier was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences (Academy of Science) in 1907. He was also elected to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1907. In 1924, he became an Honorary Member of the [[Polish Chemical Society]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ptchem.pl/pl/honors/president-of-honor-and-honorary-members-of-ptchem |title=President of honour and honorary members of PTChem |access-date=23 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Scientific work==\nIn chemistry, Le Chatelier is best known for his work on his principle of chemical equilibrium, [[Le Chatelier's principle]], and on varying solubility of salts in an ideal solution. He published no fewer than thirty papers on these topics between 1884 and 1914. His results on chemical equilibrium were presented in 1884 at the [[French Academy of Sciences|Acad\u00e9mie des sciences]] in Paris.\n\nLe Chatelier also carried out extensive research on metallurgy and was one of the founders of the technical newspaper ''La revue de m\u00e9tallurgie'' (Metallurgy Review).\n\nPart of Le Chatelier's work was devoted to industry. For example, he was a consulting engineer for a cement company, the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des chaux et ciments Pavin de Lafarge'', today known as [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] Cement. His 1887 doctoral thesis was dedicated to the subject of mortars: ''Recherches exp\u00e9rimentales sur la constitution des mortiers hydrauliques'' (Experimental Research on the Composition of Hydraulic Mortars).\n\nLe Chatelier in 1901 attempted the direct combination of the two gases nitrogen and hydrogen at a pressure of 200 atm and 600&nbsp;\u00b0C in the presence of metallic iron. An air compressor forced the mixture of gases into a steel Berthelot bomb, where a platinum spiral heated them and the reduced iron catalyst.<ref>4. \"Henri Le Chatelier: His Publications,\" Ceram. Abs., 16, (Oct., 1937)</ref> A terrific explosion occurred which nearly killed an assistant. Le Chatelier found that the explosion was due to the presence of air in the apparatus used. And thus it was left for Haber to succeed where several noted French chemists, including Thenard, Sainte Claire Deville and even Berthelot had failed. Less than five years later, Haber and Claude were successful in producing ammonia on a commercial scale, acknowledging that the account of Le Chatelier's failed attempt had accelerated their research. Near the end of his life, Le Chatelier wrote, \"I let the discovery of the ammonia synthesis slip through my hands. It was the greatest blunder of my scientific career\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/ed015p289.3|title = Le Chatelier and the synthesis of ammonia| journal=Journal of Chemical Education| volume=15| issue=6| pages=289|year = 1938|last1 = Silverman|first1 = Alexander}}</ref>\n\n===Le Chatelier's principle===\n{{main|Le Chatelier's principle}}\nLe Chatelier's Principle states that a system always acts to oppose changes in [[chemical equilibrium]]; to restore equilibrium, the system will favor a chemical pathway to reduce or eliminate the disturbance so as to restabilize at thermodynamic equilibrium. Put another way,\n\n<blockquote>''If a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in [[concentration (chemistry)|concentration]], [[temperature]] or total [[pressure]], the equilibrium will shift in order to minimize that change.''</blockquote>\n\nThis qualitative law enables one to envision the displacement of equilibrium of a chemical reaction.\n\nFor example: a change in concentration of a reaction in equilibrium for the following equation:\n\n:[[nitrogen|N<sub>2</sub>]]([[gas|g]]) + 3[[hydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]](g) \u21cc 2[[ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]](g)\n\nIf one increases the pressure of the reactants, the reaction will tend to move towards the products to decrease the pressure of the reaction.\n\nHowever consider another example: in the [[contact process]] for the production of [[sulfuric acid]], the second stage is a reversible reaction:\n\n:2[[sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]](g) + [[oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]](g) \u21cc 2[[sulfur trioxide|SO<sub>3</sub>]](g)\n\nThe forward reaction is exothermic and the reverse reaction is endothermic. Viewed by Le Chatelier's principle a larger amount of thermal energy in the system would favor the endothermic reverse reaction, as this would absorb the increased energy; in other words the equilibrium would shift to the reactants in order to remove the stress of added heat. For similar reasons, lower temperatures would favor the exothermic forward reaction, and produce more products. This works in this case, since due to loss of entropy the reaction becomes less exothermic as temperature increases; however reactions that become more exothermic as temperature increases would seem to violate this principle.\n\n==His time in politics==\nIt was typical for scientists and engineers of the time to have a very scientific vision of the industry. In the first issue of ''La revue de m\u00e9tallurgie'', Le Chatelier published an article describing his convictions on the subject,<ref>H.L. Le Chatelier, \"Role of Science in Industry\" in ''La revue de m\u00e9tallurgie'', n\u00b01, 1904 page 1 to 10</ref> discussing the [[scientific management]] theory of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. In 1928, he published a book on [[Taylorism]].\n\nLe Chatelier was politically conservative. In 1934, he published an opinion on the French forty-hour work week law in the Brussels publication ''Revue \u00e9conomique internationale''. However, in spite of certain anti-parliamentarian convictions, he kept away from any extremist or radical movements.\n\nHis brother [[Alfred Le Chatelier]], a former soldier, opened the Atelier de Glatigny in the rural area of Glatigny ([[Le Chesnay]]), near Versailles in 1897. The workshop made sandstone ceramics, high-quality porcelain and glassware. In 1901 the critic [[Henri Cazalis]] (alias Jean Lahor), listed the workshop as one of the best producers in France of [[Art Nouveau]] ceramics.{{sfn|Arthur|2017|p=110}} Henry Louis Le Chatelier seems to have encouraged Alfred's workshop and assisted with experiments in the composition of porcelain and the reactions of quartz inclusions, and also designed a thermoelectric pyrometer to measure temperature in the kilns.{{sfn|Arthur|2017|p=112}}\n\n===Decorations===\nLe Chatelier was named \"chevalier\" (knight) of the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 1887, became \"officier\" (officer) in 1908, \"commandeur\" (Knight Commander) in 1919, and was finally awarded the title of \"grand officier\" (Knight Grand Officer) in May 1927.\n\n==Works==\n* ''Cours de chimie industrielle'' (1896; second edition, 1902)\n* ''High Temperature Measurements'', translated by [[George Kimball Burgess|G.

Viewed by Le Chatelier's principle a larger amount of thermal energy in the system would favor the endothermic reverse reaction, as this would absorb the increased energy; in other words the equilibrium would shift to the reactants in order to remove the stress of added heat. For similar reasons, lower temperatures would favor the exothermic forward reaction, and produce more products. This works in this case, since due to loss of entropy the reaction becomes less exothermic as temperature increases; however reactions that become more exothermic as temperature increases would seem to violate this principle.\n\n==His time in politics==\nIt was typical for scientists and engineers of the time to have a very scientific vision of the industry. In the first issue of ''La revue de m\u00e9tallurgie'', Le Chatelier published an article describing his convictions on the subject,<ref>H.L. Le Chatelier, \"Role of Science in Industry\" in ''La revue de m\u00e9tallurgie'', n\u00b01, 1904 page 1 to 10</ref> discussing the [[scientific management]] theory of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. In 1928, he published a book on [[Taylorism]].\n\nLe Chatelier was politically conservative. In 1934, he published an opinion on the French forty-hour work week law in the Brussels publication ''Revue \u00e9conomique internationale''. However, in spite of certain anti-parliamentarian convictions, he kept away from any extremist or radical movements.\n\nHis brother [[Alfred Le Chatelier]], a former soldier, opened the Atelier de Glatigny in the rural area of Glatigny ([[Le Chesnay]]), near Versailles in 1897. The workshop made sandstone ceramics, high-quality porcelain and glassware. In 1901 the critic [[Henri Cazalis]] (alias Jean Lahor), listed the workshop as one of the best producers in France of [[Art Nouveau]] ceramics.{{sfn|Arthur|2017|p=110}} Henry Louis Le Chatelier seems to have encouraged Alfred's workshop and assisted with experiments in the composition of porcelain and the reactions of quartz inclusions, and also designed a thermoelectric pyrometer to measure temperature in the kilns.{{sfn|Arthur|2017|p=112}}\n\n===Decorations===\nLe Chatelier was named \"chevalier\" (knight) of the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 1887, became \"officier\" (officer) in 1908, \"commandeur\" (Knight Commander) in 1919, and was finally awarded the title of \"grand officier\" (Knight Grand Officer) in May 1927.\n\n==Works==\n* ''Cours de chimie industrielle'' (1896; second edition, 1902)\n* ''High Temperature Measurements'', translated by [[George Kimball Burgess|G.
